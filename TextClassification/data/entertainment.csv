entertainment	Netflix takes over its first cinema by leasing New York's historic Paris	Netflix vs cinemas	"Netflix has announced it has taken over the historic Paris cinema in New York.It's the first time the streaming giant - which has been accused of threatening the cinema experience - has taken a long-term lease to screen its films.Hollywood website Deadline said the deal was a 10-year lease agreement.Previously, Netflix has rented various cinemas for limited periods to ensure its films are eligible for awards. Its Oscar contender Marriage Story is now on at the Paris, which dates from 1948.""Now, the iconic theatre will be kept open and become a home for special Netflix events, screenings, and theatrical releases,"" the company said on Twitter.It is 71 years since screen legend Marlene Dietrich cut the ribbon to open the Paris, which became one of America's most notable art house cinemas. It is New York's last single screen cinema and had closed in late August.There has been some animosity towards streaming services in recent years from those who champion traditional cinema.Netflix film Okja, starring Tilda Swinton, was booed by some journalists in 2017 when it played at the Cannes Film Festival.Speaking to the BBC earlier this year, Swinton said: ""I hope that Netflix are going to build some nice big cinemas in every single city around the world. That's what I want them to do... and then they'll prove that they're really dedicated to big screen entertainment.""Earlier this year, Steven Spielberg voiced his concerns about the future of the ""motion picture theatrical experience"" in the face of competition from streaming services.In April, Dame Helen Mirren gave Netflix even shorter shrift and said the rise of watching films at home was ""devastating"" for people who make films for the big screen.Film fans on Twitter welcomed Netflix's decision to reopen the Paris.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	The Boy in the Dress: Will Gompertz reviews the RSC's new musical ★★★★☆		"There are certain tried-and-tested antidotes to the winter blues. Like looking up puppies on the internet. Or flicking through brochures of sun-drenched Caribbean holidays. And, when desperate, the fall-back option of browsing LinkedIn for profiles of old school friends with dreadful jobs.These are all free options. If you're up for spending a bit of money (£16-£67.50) to lift your spirits, then you might consider buying a ticket to see the musical The Boy in the Dress at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon.It is a show that embraces the concept of feel-good entertainment like a banker receiving a bonus, which is to say, shamelessly. Anyone after intellectual nourishment will leave feeling distinctly peckish, but those seeking a warm bath of comfort and joy will wallow in this page-to-stage musical reimagining of David Walliams' best-selling children's book The Boy in the Dress.There is a decidedly showbizzy vibe to the production, from Aletta Collins' exuberant choreography to the deluxe stage design by Robert Jones. Hardly surprising, given the music and lyrics are by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers, the songwriting duo behind late 90s pop hits Angels, Let Me Entertain You and Millennium.Williams said he and Chambers were given just two weeks to write the 17 catchy numbers that are the show's heart and soul, compared to the three years they took to write his latest album. All I can say is the album must be an absolute banger, because the tunes they knocked out in a fortnight for The Boy in the Dress are terrific - particularly if you're a fan of their early work, the hooks from which appear throughout.The story is a familiar tale of the misfit kid. Dennis is a 12 year-old football-loving schoolboy with inner feelings he doesn't understand. An existential angst not helped by his mother walking out on his father, and the locals bursting into a song about being Ordinary (""We said we're Labour, but we're voting Tory.""), because, as they say, ""What's the point of being different?""Dennis goes to his bedroom to sing If I Don't Cry and asks his big brother John for a hug, which goes down like a crate of non-alcoholic beer on a stag night. John turns away in disgust and explains that mothers do hugs, brothers do wedgies.And so, the light-hearted tone is set for two hours of gentle jokes and easy listening. John has a weakness for Magnum ice creams, Dennis likes magazines with pictures of ladies in dresses, while their dad (Rufus Hound) prefers magazines with pictures of ladies without dresses.As Dennis moves ever more confidently towards his desire to try a frock on for size, his role as star striker for the school's football team is put in jeopardy by a heavy cold (this is about as dramatic as the story gets). But this is theatre, so the game must go on with some posh boys providing the oppo (cue, topical joke). The match is played out before our eyes in a superbly executed scene seamlessly mixing puppetry, choreography and the imaginative direction of Gregory Doran.An effective staging device of having the football fixed to the end of a pole manoeuvred by a cast member is used throughout. Except for one moment when a loose football is placed for a crucial penalty, which, for the next sequence to work, has to be scored. All the goalie need do is dive out of the way so the ball can roll in. What could possibly go wrong?Well, on the night I went, the ball ricocheted off the keeper's legs and ended up in row G of the auditorium and not the back of the net. This led to an incongruous scene with the attacking team celebrating wildly having missed, while the ball is lobbed back into play from the stalls. Stick to the stick would be my note. It works.As does this show, even though there are times where it is a little rushed, and others that are a tad too pantomime hammy. At least for me. I doubt any of the younger members of the audience would concur, and it is at them the production is aimed.Those to whom I spoke afterwards loved every second: a chorus of approval that was palpable throughout, with rousing applause at the end of several of the big numbers including a glitter ball delight called Disco Symphony.The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) pulled off a remarkable feat with Tim Minchin's musical reinvention of Roald Dahl's Matilda a decade ago. It has been a huge commercial success for the company, enabling it to invest in education and outreach projects. The RSC is hoping The Boy in the Dress will follow suit and transfer for a long and lucrative West End run.Maybe it will, but the competition is a lot stiffer than when Matilda made the transition. The blockbuster juggernaut Hamilton wasn't about then, nor were Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Dear Evan Hansen - two musicals covering a similar ground of odd-one-out schoolboys.Those three have a very contemporary flavour, while The Boy in the Dress already feels more dated (the book was published in 2008). The issues it tackles are timeless and universal, but the central dramatic device of a boy wearing a dress doesn't seem particularly shocking in 2019. And supposed flashes of epiphany such as the radical idea of starting a girls' football team either need to be cut altogether or rewritten to reflect that women's football is now a major sport.But then we know The Boy in the Dress isn't frightened to be who he is and go toe-to-toe with the big guys. I hope it succeeds. There's plenty of room in this world for another joyful, uplifting musical - especially one that so unapologetically wears its heart on its sequined sleeve.Recent reviews by Will GompertzFollow Will Gompertz on Twitter"

entertainment	Music streaming market 'needs more choice'	Music industry revenues 2018How we consumed music in 2018	"Spotify, Apple and Amazon Music have revived the fortunes of the music industry, but fans aren't getting enough choice, a new report claims.It says streaming services are too similar, offering the same collection of songs with little price variation.Appealing to older music fans and offering ""super-premium"" features could double the value of the market, from £829m this year to £1.6bn in 2023.The findings came in a report for the Entertainment Retailers Association.""There's a major prize at stake,"" said Pedro Sanches, of consultancy firm OC&C, who conducted the study.The current ""all-you-can-eat"" streaming model had ""enjoyed enormous success, in part because of its simplicity,"" he said, ""but further innovation will drive more growth"".The report identified several new avenues, including premium subscriptions that offer access to exclusive content and merchandise; and expanding popular family and student plans to other demographics.Subscription streaming services have become increasingly important to the music industry, at a time when CD sales and downloads are in sharp decline.A total of 91 billion songs were played on Spotify, Apple Music and their competitors last year - the equivalent of 1,300 songs per person in the UK - and streaming now accounts for nearly two thirds (63.6%) of all music consumption in the UK.The ERA's research was commissioned amid concerns that the surge in subscriptions could stagnate.""Streaming has been the biggest news in the industry for the last 10 years,"" the organisation's CEO, Kim Bayley, told the BBC.""The younger generation are very firmly in the streaming environment, and saturation point is approaching for under-25s, so we wanted to see where future growth will come from"".The report found that, left to its own devices, the UK streaming market would continue to expand by 5-7% every year, reaching £1.1bn in 2023. But finding ways to tempt non-subscribers could result in a £500m boost, generating revenues of £1.6bn.""It's fair to say even we were surprised just how positive the results were,"" Bayley said. ""There's lots of potential.""Lessons could also be learned from other entertainment providers, she added.""Think about the way Sky [television] bundles things together - with different tiers for sport and movies and entertainment. That's the sort of thing you could do with music - create more channels, break it up a bit, and pay for the bits you want.""The need for a more diverse music streaming experience was recently highlighted by Warner Music CEO Mark Cooper.""The streaming offerings in music have not been as consumer-friendly as they could have been,"" he said in New York last week.""Right now, there's a 50 million-track universe and it's either free or $10 [per month], plus or minus.""My view is that if [streaming services were] organised to allow people to choose by genre, or by number of tracks per day, hi-res sound, global [or] local, whatever it is, the music industry and the tech companies would have been ahead [of where they are now] by way of revenue optimisation.""The ERA's research was released on the same day it was revealed that the UK Music industry had contributed £5.2bn to the UK economy in 2018.The success of stars like Ed Sheeran and Dua Lipa helped exports soar to £2.7bn; while the live music sector made £1.1bn - up 10% from £991 million in 2017, despite Glastonbury taking a fallow year.However, trade body UK Music warned that the new talent was being threatened by cuts to musical education and the continued closure of small music venues.It added that, despite the huge financial rewards for A-list stars like Calvin Harris and Adele, the average musician earned £23,059 - well below the national average of £29,832.Brexit also poses a danger to the industry, and touring musicians in particular, warned UK Music CEO Michael Dugher.""We urgently need to ensure that the impact of Brexit doesn't put in jeopardy the free movement of talent, just at a time when we should be looking outwards and backing the best of British talent right across the world.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Spinal Tap settle soundtrack dispute with Universal Music		"The creators of rock ""mockumentary"" This Is Spinal Tap say they have resolved a legal dispute with Universal Music over the film's soundtrack.Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner, who starred in the 1984 film, said they had reached a settlement with Universal's parent company Vivendi.The actors claimed the entertainment group had denied them payments.Another part of the dispute over the film rights and merchandise is ongoing.Directed by Reiner, This Is Spinal Tap followed the misfortunes of a fictional British rock band as they promoted their new record.Under the new agreement, the band's music will continue to be distributed through Universal Music Group and the rights will eventually be given to the creators.A mediator had been working to resolve the dispute since last November. The final settlement amount was not disclosed.Legal action against Vivendi's film arm Studiocanal and its executive Ron Halpern over the rights in This is Spinal Tap and related intellectual property has not been resolved.Shearer, who later appeared in The Simpsons, launched the case in 2016, claiming ""fraudulent accounting"" and ""anti-competitive behaviour"".His legal action claimed that, ""according to Vivendi"", the four creators' share of merchandising income between 1984 and 2006 was just $81 (£63). He initially sought $125m (£97m) in damages, but the claim was increased to $400m (£310m) after Shearer was joined by the others.The comedy film, which contained such songs as the fittingly-titled Gimme Some Money, Stonehenge and Big Bottom, has been credited by the likes of Ricky Gervais as a major influence.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"It's been another packed week in the world of entertainment news - for example, we learned who will present I'm A Celebrity... with Dec, what the TV critics thought of Bake Off, and which star Prince Harry had on his bedroom wall as a teenager.If you missed these stories and other happenings this week, read on.Like most teenage boys, Prince Harry had a poster of a famous crush on his wall - in his case, it was Oscar-winning actress and former Bond girl Halle Berry.The US star jokingly trolled the Duke of Sussex after spotting herself in the background of a recently resurfaced photo.""OK Prince Harry, I see you!"" she wrote, after seeing the image of his bedroom at Eton College.The Great British Bake Off is back for series number nine - and series number two on Channel 4.An audience of 6.1 million tuned in on Tuesday to see the series kick off with biscuit - rather than cake - week.Critics were united in their delight at its return, with one telling BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Ah lovely telly, the world's a better place when Bake Off's on.""Strictly Come Dancing is almost back, and last year's winner Joe McFadden said that, despite claims it's not the strongest line-up, it still ""ticks every box"".The former Holby City star said there is somebody for everybody in the new crop of contestants.The BBC show begins on 8 September.University Challenge is to focus on posing ""gender neutral"" questions, according to the show's executive producer.Peter Gwyn made the remark following a viewer complaint that the questions were skewed towards men.""We try to ensure that when hearing a question, we don't have any sense of whether it was written by a man or a woman,"" he said.Holly Willoughby will co-host this year's I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! alongside Declan Donnelly.Willoughby will fill in for Dec's regular partner Ant McPartlin while he takes a break from TV presenting.""I couldn't be more excited to have been asked to stand alongside Dec for the next jungle adventure,"" said the This Morning regular. Dec said he was ""hugely grateful"", adding: ""I'm thrilled she said yes.""Stacey Solomon hit out at gossip magazines for making women feel as though ""they're not good enough"".The TV presenter was featured on this week's cover of Now magazine with the headline: ""Stacey 'boring', 'desperate', 'cheap' - why fans are sick of her.""The 28-year old Loose Women panellist shared the cover with her 1.4 million Twitter followers, writing: ""That's the meanest thing I've ever seen.""Coleen Nolan said she regretted her on-screen row with Kim Woodburn, describing it as ""ugly, upsetting and unpleasant"", adding that she wished she could turn back time and undo it.More than 7,000 people complained to Ofcom about Wednesday's Loose Women, which saw the singer clash with the former How Clean Is Your House? host.Some viewers accused Nolan and the ITV show's other panellists of bullying.Queer Eye star Karamo Brown urged fans to look after their mental health after revealing he tried to take his own life in 2006.Brown is the culture expert on the Netflix show, in which five gay men give a straight man a makeover, both physically and often emotionally.Brown, 37, said he had been ""in a very dark place"" in 2006 and felt like his life ""could not get any better"".But he told fans: ""I want you to know that things do get better.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Obituary: Jonathan Miller	Beyond the FringeDirecting AlicePublic intellectualMonumentally tactless	"Jonathan Miller's talents were manifold, his natural gifts bewildering in their profusion.He was a humorist, an author, a director of films, TV, plays and operas. He was a photographer, a sculptor, an all-purpose intellectual and accomplished broadcaster.He could be witty, charming and life-enhancing, especially when he was the centre of attention, as he usually was.Yet Sir Jonathan - as he became - was also famously cantankerous and grumpy, and on occasions devastatingly rude.He claimed his chronic dissatisfaction stemmed from an early decision to make his career in the world of the arts and entertainment, rather than science and medicine.Others thought it had something to do with attention-seeking on the part of a very clever person deprived of affection during his childhood.Jonathan Miller was born in London in July 1934. His father Emanuel was a distinguished child psychiatrist; his mother Betty was a novelist and biographer.But neither, by Miller's own account, was especially warm or affectionate.He was educated at St Paul's School - where he was reputedly talkative and entertaining - and at St John's College, Cambridge, where he read medicine.He might have become a leading neurologist were it not for the extraordinary success of the groundbreaking satirical revue, Beyond the Fringe.It premiered at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival, and brought a kind of clever undergraduate humour to a much wider audience. It transferred to the West End and then to Broadway.Miller had just qualified as a doctor, and taken leave from his job to travel to Edinburgh. The show was a runaway success, and it was instantly apparent that he faced a choice.He found performing intoxicating and addictive. He later described that first Edinburgh run as ""a cocaine-like snort of celebrity and approval"".But, in the words of his biographer Kate Bassett: ""He could not both walk the wards and tread the boards.""In the event, he signed up for the show's West End run and put his medical career on hold. In later life, he often claimed he was sorry.Going into show business was like ""stepping off the edge of a diving board into this murky swimming pool where my moral fibre rotted irreversibly. I still fiercely regret the distraction. I think that was a bad thing I did.""By 1965, he was working in television - as the editor and presenter of the BBC's arts programme, Monitor.The following year, he directed a controversial television version of Alice in Wonderland. It was rather like a 1960s acid trip with John Gielgud as the Mock Turtle.The programme was denounced in the House of Commons as a perversion unfit for children, and added to Miller's burgeoning reputation for being excessively trendy and pretentious.He directed Whistle and I'll Come to You - a TV ghost story starring Michael Hordern and began to forge a reputation in the theatre.His 1970 production of The Merchant of Venice starred Laurence Olivier. The grand old man of British theatre wanted to play Shylock as a traditional Jewish stereotype - complete with false nose and teeth.Miller urged him to throw away the props and play the part as a 19th Century businessman - who happened not to be a gentile.It reflected Miller's own approach to his background as a non-practising non-believer: ""Not really a Jew... Jew-ish,"" to quote a line from Beyond the Fringe.From 1973 to 1975, he was an associate director of the National Theatre, which was then run by Olivier. But when Olivier retired, the top job went to Peter Hall.The two men fell out. Miller dismissed Hall as ""a safari-suited bureaucrat"". Hall retaliated, describing Miller as both a genius and a fool.""Jonathan did very unsuccessful work,"" he said, ""and there's nothing to breed discontent like failure.""In 1980, he joined the BBC's then-troubled project to televise all of Shakespeare's plays. He directed six of them, including The Taming of the Shrew with John Cleese and Othello with Anthony Hopkins.But the yearning to return to medicine stayed with him. In 1978, he presented - in his inimitable fashion - a TV series about the history of medicine and anatomy, The Body in Question.""And so, over millions of years,"" runs a typical line from the script, ""the head has developed as a far-seeing helmsman which guides and controls the propulsive engine of the rear end.""It was clear that he still regretted that decision not to become a doctor. ""There are things about the sciences which are difficult to do,"" he said on Desert Island Discs in 2005.""You have to wrap a wet towel round your head to think out some of the things. It sounds like an idle and arrogant boast - most of the things I've done in the arts I can do with my right hand tied behind my back.""He did eventually returning to medicine full-time, spending two years at McMaster University in Canada, and as a research fellow in neuropsychology at Sussex University. But it didn't last.Cutting-edge science, as he acknowledged, was beyond him: he'd been away too long. And it turned out that he craved the limelight after all.He returned to run the Old Vic for a year, to his role as a kind of public intellectual and to a life of writing, broadcasting and directing - especially operas.He'd staged his first opera, Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte, for Kent Opera in 1974, despite being unable to read music.Over the next four decades, more than 50 further productions followed at opera houses around the world. At one point, he was working on six international productions simultaneously.Several of his productions were so successful they were repeatedly revived. His Mafia-style production for ENO of Verdi's Rigoletto, updated to New York in the 1950s, remains in the repertoire.His production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Mikado was equally successful, although he claimed to hold them both in contempt. ""Boring self-satisfied drivel,"" he called their work. No better, he claimed, than ""UKIP set to music.""The critics didn't always like his work - and Miller often displayed a thin skin. But that didn't stop him dishing it out to those he didn't like.Opera singers of the old school (people assumed he had in mind Domingo, Carreras and Pavarotti) were derided as ""Jurassic performers"", who arrived at rehearsal ""with shreds of primeval vegetation hanging from their jaws"".And Britain under Margaret Thatcher was described as ""an ugly, racist, rancorous little place... a mean, peevish little country... with its acid rain of criticism and condescension.""He could be personally kind and thoughtful, but also monumentally tactless. The Royal Opera House, which commissioned several of his productions, was ""a kind of wife kennel"" for rich men.A large part of the audience for his work he described as ""disgusting old opera queens"" - this from a man who had been a vice-chairman of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.He continued to present television series - on language, madness and atheism - though the last was a term he objected to.""I never use the word atheist of myself,"" he said. ""It's scarcely worth having a name for. I don't have a name for not believing in pixies.""His versatility made him a figure of fun. Private Eye mercilessly satirised him as the self-important Dr Jonathan, a sage and a pseud and too clever by half.In later life, he became increasingly curmudgeonly. A newspaper profile described him as ""famously, noisily, angrily fed-up"".He complained that he'd always felt undervalued in Britain, that he was no longer being offered work, that he was assumed to be dead and that he was giving up directing opera.He was awarded him a CBE in 1983 and a knighthood in 2002. He never carried out his threat to leave the country, turning to making sculptures out of scrap metal instead.Erudite and clever, witty and paradoxical, Jonathan Miller was a born performer, a brilliant talker and a first-rate director.He will be remembered as a man, who even at his grumpiest, couldn't help being entertaining."

entertainment	8 of this week's biggest entertainment stories	1. We said goodbye to Barry Chuckle2. Kathleen Turner got Hollywood guessing3. Radio 4's Eddie Mair bowed out gracefully4. The Oscars announced a new category5. Robert Redford gave up acting6. China 'snubbed' Winnie the Pooh7. Matthew Perry had tummy trouble8. Timmy Mallett lost his bike	"August is usually a quiet time for news, but that hasn't been the case in the world of entertainment and the arts.Here are just a few of the stories we've been reporting on this week.Last weekend we had the sad news that Barry Chuckle, the older half of comedy duo the Chuckle Brothers, had died at the age of 73.Fans, friends and family members paid tribute to the entertainer, who starred in such TV shows as Chucklevision and Chuckle Time with his brother Paul.Rapper Tinchy Stryder was among those to pay homage, remembering the comic with whom he recorded a charity single in 2014 as a ""super cool, talented, humble legend.""Paul Chuckle described losing his brother as ""the worst feeling ever"" but vowed to carry on performing because ""I know Barry would want me to.""Body Heat star Kathleen Turner was the talk of Hollywood after giving a candid interview about her career, the film industry and some of her former co-stars.Burt Reynolds, Nicolas Cage and the cast of Friends were just a few of the people she had issues with - although she reserved much of her disdain for Donald Trump's ""gross"" handshake.For many, though, the big question was who she was talking about when she accused an unnamed female star of ""playing the same role for 20 years"".We came up with our own list of likely candidates.The announcement that presenter Eddie Mair was to leave the BBC after more than 30 years made headlines last month.Yet the 52-year-old managed to take his leave without any fanfare, quietly bowing out after Wednesday's edition of Radio 4's PM with ""no fuss or faff"".Without mentioning it was his last show, the softly-spoken Scot ended his tenure by playing Willy Nelson's version of Bring Me Sunshine.He won't be off the airwaves for long though - he's due to start presenting on LBC next month.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made a number of announcements this week aimed at making its annual Oscars telecast more accessible, more relevant - and shorter.The most notable was its intention to introduce a new award recognising outstanding ""achievement in popular film"".The declaration did not go down well in Hollywood, with actor Rob Lowe speaking for many when he suggested it showed ""the film business [had] passed away"".Once we'd recovered from the news, we had a think about the kind of films that could be eligible for the prize.At the grand age of 81, Robert Redford announced that his next film, The Old Man and the Gun, will be the last one in which he'll act.""Never say never, but I pretty well concluded that this would be it for me in terms of acting,"" he told Entertainment Weekly.The news prompted us to look back at some of the great performances he's given in such films as The Sting, All The President's Men and Out of Africa.Our feature included his recent Netflix drama Our Souls At Night, a film whose title might have done with a rethink.Winnie the Pooh. Winnie the Pooh. Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff, right?Not in China, where AA Milne's honey-loving bear has become a potent symbol of political dissent against leader Xi Jinping.It's been suggested the Chinese authorities' displeasure with mocking ursine memes is behind their decision to deny a release to Disney's new Winnie the Pooh film Christopher Robin.Starring Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher, the film opens in UK cinemas on Friday.In the week it was revealed that Friends is the most popular show on the UK's paid-for streaming services, we also learned that one of its stars recently underwent abdominal surgery.A spokesperson for Matthew Perry said he was ""grateful for the concern"" following reports he had an operation to repair a gastrointestinal perforation.In other Friends-related news, it was announced that David Schwimmer is to join the cast of Will and Grace for its upcoming 10th season.Over on Channel 4, meanwhile, Hang Ups - a British version of Lisa Kudrow's improvised series Web Therapy - saw Stephen Mangan try his hand at online psychiatry.Finally, a social media campaign sprung up aimed at reuniting TV personality Timmy Mallett with his missing bike.The 62-year-old, pictured above with Prime Minister Theresa May, was ""heartbroken"" when the bicycle on which he recently completed a 2,500-mile charity ride across Europe was apparently stolen from a pub in Berkshire.""The irony is so awful,"" he told the Press Association. ""You can take it all over the world, and yet at home it was not safe at the local village.""Hundreds of Twitter users offered to help the star, who rode across three countries in two months in memory of his late brother Martin.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

You may be suffering from Love Island withdrawal symptoms.Hey, we're not here to judge.But in case you have fallen behind on the past week's entertainment news, we want to help you get back on track.Here are eight of the biggest stories you might have missed.Jennifer Aniston revealed she, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow have talked about a possible Friends reboot.In a wide-ranging interview with InStyle, she added she ""fantasises"" about the show being brought back.""Courteney, Lisa and I talk about it. I fantasise about it. It really was the greatest job I ever had,"" Aniston said.""I don't know what it would look like today, but you never know. So many shows are being successfully rebooted.""A record-breaking 3.6 million people watched Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham win the final of this year's Love Island.The pair originally ""coupled up"" on the first episode eight weeks earlier and walked away with the £50,000 prize.Things now seem to be moving pretty fast for them - with Jack commenting this week that he hopes they will marry in 2019.BBC Radio 4's Today programme and 5 Live Breakfast lost listeners this spring, industry figures showed.Today's audience dropped by 839,000 year-on-year, while 5 Live Breakfast was down 337,000, according to Rajar, which monitors UK radio listening.The BBC said a quieter news agenda in the second quarter of this year was partly to blame.Vogue India's decision to put the 18-year-old daughter of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan on its cover came in for major criticism.Many posted angrily on social media that Suhana Khan didn't deserve the cover because she hasn't achieved anything to warrant being there.The prestigious Vogue cover is normally reserved for top models, actresses or singers at the peak of their careers.Meanwhile, Rihanna's September British Vogue cover showed her with her eyebrows seemingly removed and ultra-fine, pronounced arches pencilled in their place.It flies in the face (literally) of the bushy Cara Delevingne-inspired brows that have for so long been the beauty norm of the £20m brow industry.But would women really ditch their carefully grown-out eyebrows for such a dramatic look?We attempted to find out.The cover art illustrator for The Hate U Give has said she ""wasn't exactly thrilled"" with the casting of the film adaptation.Debra Cartwright illustrated the cover for Angie Thomas's young adult novel, which was published in February 2017.Hunger Games star Amandla Stenberg was cast in the lead role in the film, which will be released later this year.But some fans were unhappy with her casting as she has a lighter complexion than the character in the book.Coronation Street added Maureen Lipman to the list of acclaimed actors joining its ranks - she will play ""outspoken battleaxe"" Evelyn Plummer, the grandma of Tyrone Dobbs.Her character comes into Tyrone's life when he researches his family history after the death of his mother, Jackie.She will ""ruffle a few feathers on the Street"", according to ITV, much to the dismay of Tyrone's girlfriend Fiz.The Royal Family dominated a new list celebrating Britain's best dressed.The full catalogue of Tatler's choices for 2018 were released on Thursday, and the Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex all made the cut.Even five-year-old Prince George was praised for his ""Christopher Robin chic"", including shorts, long socks and sleeveless jumper outfits.The cast of the next Star Wars film was revealed, with a mixture of veteran stars and new faces set to appear.The late actress Carrie Fisher will feature in Episode IX using previously unseen footage that was recorded for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Samira Ahmed gives evidence in BBC tribunal		"BBC presenter Samira Ahmed has been giving evidence in her case claiming she was paid ""a sixth"" of what Jeremy Vine earned in ""a very similar job"".An employment tribunal is considering a claim that Ahmed's pay on Newswatch should have been comparable with Vine's on BBC One's Points of View.Ahmed says she was paid £440 per episode of Newswatch, while Vine received £3,000 for Points of View.The BBC argues the two programmes cannot be compared.Ahmed's legal team claimed on Wednesday the presenter made £693,245 less than Vine over seven years, between November 2012 and February 2019.She was paid the same as her male predecessor, Ray Snoddy, for presenting Newswatch.It emerged on Wednesday that another male presenter, Steve Hewlett, had been paid less than Ahmed when he stood in for her.In a statement earlier this week, the BBC said it was ""committed to equal pay"".""Points of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public. Newswatch - while an important programme - isn't,"" the statement read.""Samira was paid the same as her male predecessor when she began presenting Newswatch. Gender has not been a factor in levels of pay for Points of View. News and entertainment are very different markets and pay across the media industry reflects this.""The tribunal heard how Anne Robinson received £1,250 for hosting Points of View, more than the pay for both male and female presenters in the subsequent year. Terry Wogan was later paid £3,500 per episode.The BBC said Newswatch, which began on the news channel and is now repeated within BBC Breakfast on a Saturday, was ""relatively niche"" in comparison to Points of View, which is seen as more of an entertainment programme.That is disputed by Ahmed, who said at the tribunal that Newswatch was now attracting a bigger total audience than Points of View.The National Union of Journalists (NUJ), which is supporting Ahmed's case, says Newswatch's inclusion within BBC Breakfast means it has an audience reach of between 1.5 and 1.9 million people - more than double that of Points of View.However, the BBC's legal team claims Newswatch has ""no discernible impact"" on BBC Breakfast's normal viewing figures and is used to ""fill out the programme"" at the weekend."

"From Justin Timberlake in Minneapolis to the Oscar nominees luncheon in Los Angeles to Eurovision: You Decide in Brighton, it's been another hectic week in the world of entertainment.Here's a round-up of some of the bigger stories we've covered over the last seven days, just in case you missed them.Justin Timberlake paid tribute to Prince during a Super Bowl half-time show in Minneapolis that saw him perform one of the Purple One's classic songs before a giant backdrop of the late singer.Timberlake's hit-filled set also made an internet celebrity of 13-year-old Ryan McKenna, an unsuspecting fan whose appearance alongside the former 'N Sync singer saw him quickly dubbed ""Selfie Kid"".Yet Timberlake's Super Bowl performance left many unimpressed, as did the 37-year-old's latest release Man of the Woods - a record one critic described as ""a non-committal shrug of an album"".End of Youtube post by Star WarsAlongside promos from a string of upcoming movie blockbusters, the ad breaks for this year's Super Bowl included a sneak peak at the next Star Wars film.The brief teaser for Solo: A Star Wars Story was soon followed by a full trailer that offered fans their first glimpse of 28-year-old Alden Ehrenreich in the role made famous by Harrison Ford.Contenders assemble! The collected ranks of this year's Academy Awards hopefuls came together at a nominees' luncheon in Los Angeles that gave them a chance to rub shoulders, compare notes and exchange a few telephone numbers.""Hey Meryl? It's Margot. Yes, it was great to see you on Monday. I was just wondering though - could you give me a hand with my Australian accent?""Before that wholly imaginary conversation took place, the lucky nominees posed for the traditional Oscars photo. Apart from Agnes Varda, that is, whose place was taken by a cardboard cut-out.Singer SuRie - real name Susanna Cork - was named as the UK's representative at this year's Eurovision Song Contest during a live ceremony at the Brighton Dome.The Royal Academy of Music graduate and Annie Lennox lookalike said it felt ""absolutely amazing"" to be going to Lisbon in May to perform her upbeat track Storm.Mel Giedroyc was in Brighton to host Eurovision: You Decide on the same day it emerged that the Generation Game reboot she'll be co-hosting with Sue Perkins this spring will only run to two episodes.When the game show's return was announced last year, the BBC said it would have a four-episode run. This week, though, the corporation said it was ""not unusual for a new series to change length.""Black Panther, the latest superhero movie from the Marvel stable, had its European premiere in London ahead of its UK release next week.Critics have been raving about the film, which tells of a king from a fictional African republic who becomes a masked and costumed crimefighter.Yet there was much less love for Fifty Shades Freed, the final instalment in a trilogy of films to be drawn from the erotic bestsellers of writer EL James.""In terms of drama, or melodrama, or just bad drama, Freed rarely delivers the goods,"" wrote one reviewer of the film, which - like its predecessors - reached cinemas in time for Valentine's Day.Singer Lucy Rose released a poignant new video that saw her take a trip to the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland with one of her fans.Zoe Schofield, who has Asperger's syndrome and chronic fatigue, said she had ""so many great memories"" from shooting the video at the World Heritage Site.This was also the week we bid farewell to actor John Mahoney, known and loved by millions thanks to his role as the irascible Marty Crane in US sitcom Frasier.Cast members from the show paid tribute to the British-born star of stage and screen, who died at the age of 77 while in hospice care in Chicago.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Lorraine Kelly and Jennifer Arcuri clash over Good Morning Britain interview	'An iron fist in a velvet glove'	"Jennifer Arcuri has said ITV presenters ""ganged up"" on her during an appearance on Good Morning Britain.The US businesswoman is at the centre of a misconduct controversy involving Prime Minister Boris Johnson.After an interview on GMB on Monday, Ms Arcuri was challenged by Lorraine Kelly, who presents the following show.""What's the point of you coming on TV to clear the air and then you don't say anything?"" Kelly asked her during the handover between the two programmes.It is alleged that Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment during Mr Johnson's time as mayor of London due to their friendship, which he denies.Kelly suggested she had not properly answered the questions from GMB hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. ""I believe I said a few things,"" Ms Arcuri responded. ""What is it you're looking for that I should say?""""Well you didn't answer any of the questions that were put to you, and I don't really see the point of you coming on, to be honest,"" said Kelly.The clip was quickly uploaded online and Kelly began trending on social media.Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme on BBC Two later on Monday, Arcuri said: ""Did you see the way they ganged up?""The fact that I'm called out on GMB, 'Why am I here if I'm not here to admit the affair?' Well wait a minute, I'm not allowed to be upset?""Kelly's intervention surprised many as it followed comments she made last week where she encouraged people to be kinder.She told the Press Association: ""Sometimes we [our show] are dismissed as being a bit fluffy. I don't mind that.""Referring to political divisions, she added: ""What we try to do is bring people together, and that's quite hard right now. One thing we can do is try and be kinder to one another.""A spokesperson for GMB has been contacted for comment.Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporterFor a broadcaster who very rarely ruffles feathers, Lorraine Kelly has hit the headlines a lot this year.But her clash with Ms Arcuri is different to the one she had with Conservative MP Esther McVey in June.Back then, Kelly explained that she was frustrated with the current political discourse in the UK and objected to McVey's voting record on LGBT rights.Her disapproval of Ms Arcuri, however, was making a more journalistic point about the frustration presenters often feel when a guest agrees to be interviewed but then doesn't seem willing to answer the most pressing questions.Kelly's Good Morning Britain colleague Piers Morgan has previously described her as ""an iron fist in a velvet glove"" - a description she has endorsed.While she is unwaveringly polite to guests on her own show, the GMB/Lorraine handover is a particular danger zone when it comes to moments where Kelly feels she can speak more freely.Her latest comments have delighted social media users, some of whom suggest these moments are when we see the ""real Lorraine Kelly"".The jokes about her having an on-screen persona have followed Kelly since a judge ruled earlier this year that she is playing a particular version of herself on air, meaning she could be considered a ""theatrical artist"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

She was then seen plummeting from what seemed to be a crashing Tardis.The 35-year-old Broadchurch star said she was ""beyond excited"" to take up the role and the offer had been ""overwhelming, as a feminist"".Whittaker will fully begin her role next year alongside new assistants Bradley Walsh, Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole.Actress Heather Menzies-Urich, who played Louisa Von Trapp in The Sound of Music, died aged 68.She was diagnosed with brain cancer in November and died on Christmas Eve.""She was an actress, a ballerina and loved living her life to the fullest,"" her son Ryan told news site TMZ.Other notable deaths this week included Gogglebox star Leon Bernicoff who died aged 83 after a short illness, Star Wars actor Alfie Curtis - who famously threatened Luke Skywalker at Mos Eisley Cantina in the 1977 original film, telling him: ""I have the death sentence on 12 systems.""Bob Givens, the animator best known for his redesign of Bugs Bunny, also died aged 99. He also drew cartoon characters such as Tom & Jerry, Daffy Duck, Alvin and the Chipmunks and Popeye.Model Chrissy Teigen and her musician husband John Legend were caught in a mid-air drama after their flight from Los Angeles to Japan was turned around four hours into its journey to Tokyo.It was reportedly because a passenger boarded in error.Avid tweeter Teigen documented the drama and continued to live tweet once she and Legend were put on another plane.The model, who is expecting her second child, also explained why she and her husband had not used a private jet.They eventually got to their destination on a later flight but as a consequence of the delay, Legend celebrated his 39th birthday somewhere over the Pacific Ocean.Good Morning Britain topped a list of 2017's most complained about TV shows.With typically understated aplomb, presenter Piers Morgan tweeted: ""BOOM!

entertainment	Coldplay to pause touring until concerts are 'environmentally beneficial'	Carbon footprint of a tourTouring's environmental impact - Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter	"Coldplay have put plans to tour their new album on hold, due to concerns over the environmental impact of concerts.""We're not touring this album,"" frontman Chris Martin told BBC News.""We're taking time over the next year or two, to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable [but] how can it be actively beneficial.""""All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job,"" he continued, saying the band wanted their future tours to ""have a positive impact"".Coldplay's new album Everyday Life is released on Friday and, instead of spending months on the road, they are playing two gigs in Jordan, which will be broadcast, free, to a global audience on YouTube.The concerts, will take place in Amman on Friday at sunrise and sunset respectively, mirroring the two ""sides"" of their new album.The UK band last travelled the world with their A Head Full of Dreams Tour, which saw them stage 122 shows across five continents in 2016 and 2017.""Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,"" Martin said. ""We would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral.""The hardest thing is the flying side of things. But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered.""We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?""The WWF welcomed Coldplay's initiative, saying: ""It is fantastic to see world-famous artists stepping up to protect the planet.""We all have a responsibility to lead by example in the face of this climate and nature crisis - inaction is not an option if we are to preserve our planet for future generations,"" said Gareth Redmond-King, the organisation's head of climate change.End of Youtube post by ColdplaySpeaking to BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson, Martin said Jordan had been chosen because ""we wanted to pick somewhere in the middle of the world where we normally don't get to play"".He said the new record - which will be released on Friday - reflected the band's global perspective.""If you've had the privilege of travelling around the world, you know we're all from the same place,"" he went on.""In a very gentle British way, this record is us saying we don't feel different from any human on earth.""Martin said songs from Everyday Life had been inspired in part by BBC News reports about an Afghan gardener and a Nigerian hymn composer.""Journalism at its best finds these individual stories that reinforce our shared humanity,"" he explained.Coldplay will perform a one-off concert for fans at the Natural History Museum in London on 25 November.All proceeds from the show will be donated to an environmental charity.Staging a world tour isn't as simple as bunging Chris Martin and his bandmates in the back of a mini-van with a map and a year's supply of digestives.In fact, the band's last tour employed 109 crew, 32 trucks and nine bus drivers, who travelled to five continents, playing to 5.4 million people at 122 concerts.There's no easy way to calculate the band's carbon footprint; but the music industry's most recent figures suggest that live music generates 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse-gas emissions in the UK every year.It's not just flights that cause the problem. Fans travelling to and from shows are the biggest source of pollution; but there's an environmental cost to producing merchandise, powering the spotlights and moving stages from venue to venue.At the most extreme end of the scale, the ambitious ""claw"" structure that U2 took on the road in 2009 required 120 trucks to shift it around. According to one environmental group, the band generated the equivalent carbon footprint of a return flight to Mars.Since then, the industry has stepped up its efforts to become more sustainable.Radiohead swapped spotlights for LEDs, which use a fraction of the power needed for a traditional lighting rig. The 1975 have stopped making new merchandise, and are donating £1 from every ticket sold to One Tree Planted, a non-profit organisation that plants trees all over the world. And U2 have enacted a number of changes, from recycling guitar strings to using hydrogen fuel cells.Coldplay are going one step further. They don't just want to be carbon neutral, but to have tours that are ""actively beneficial"" to the planet. And by putting their concerts on hold, they're giving up a huge pay day: The Head Full of Dream tour made $523m.The industry will be watching to see what solutions they come up with.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Here's a rundown of some of the stories we covered, the people we spoke to and the stars we lost.The week began with the news that legendary comedian Sir Ken Dodd had died at the age of 90.Known for his lengthy stand-up shows, protruding teeth and surreal catchphrases, he was one of Britain's most popular and recognisable entertainers.Sir Paul McCartney, David Walliams, Sandi Toksvig and Pam Ayres were among many celebrities to pay tribute to the self-styled Squire of Knotty Ash.Sir Paul spoke for many when he said he and his fellow Beatles ""always ended up in tears of laughter"" whenever their paths crossed.This was also the week we said goodbye to comedian Jim Bowen, loved by millions for presenting darts-based game show Bullseye.You can't beat a bit of Bully, as the Lancashire native demonstrated for 14 years at the helm of the viewers' favourite.On Thursday, Strictly Come Dancing fans learned that professional dancing couple Kevin and Karen Clifton have separated after three years of marriage.But the pair confirmed they will still be touring the UK together later this year.Alexandra Burke made her own contribution to Strictly last year and will be embarking on a tour herself in 2018.Yet that hasn't stopped her being on the brunt of some harsh criticism of late - something she told the BBC was down to the way the British confuse confidence with arrogance.Showbiz reporter Lucy Ford had a surprise for Reese Witherspoon this week - a 15,000-word university dissertation on Legally Blonde.Lucy's video of her presenting Reese with the document - tied with pink ribbon and pre-scented - soon went viral. ""It was a really sweet moment,"" she told the BBC.She's been providing traffic news on BBC Radio 2 for 18 years, but Lynn Bowles has some news of her own for the station's listeners this week.""I'm afraid I'm going to be leaving Radio 2,"" she told Ken Bruce, going on to reveal that she will make her final appearance on 29 March.Katy Perry faced a backlash after footage was aired of her kissing a 19-year-old during his audition for American Idol.Benjamin Glaze said the experience made him ""uncomfortable"" and that he had hoped to save his first kiss for his first relationship.Finally, it was reported that Danny Boyle will direct the next James Bond film after the Oscar-winning film-maker revealed he was working on a script with regular collaborator John Hodge.Eon Productions have yet to confirm the news. Daniel Craig will return as 007 in the currently untitled film, which is set for release in November 2019.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"A certain gold statuette dominated the past week's news... here's the lowdown on the Oscars in case you missed them, along with some of the other stories from the past seven days.Before the Oscars, the Emoji Movie, an animated film starring James Corden and Patrick Stewart, swept the board at Hollywood's Razzie awards, which highlight the year's worst films.It ""won"" four Golden Raspberry titles, including worst picture, director and screenplay.In a statement, Razzies organisers branded the film a ""talking poop opus"".He went to the Oscars for the first time in four decades - but before he did so, Star Wars' Mark Hamill said he would rather be at home watching the ceremony in his pyjamas.Hamill - AKA Luke Skywalker - last attended in 1978 when Star Wars: A New Hope was up for best picture.Speaking at one of the pre-Oscar award ceremonies, the Oscar Wilde Awards, where he was being honoured, he told us it was ""much more fun"" to watch from home.On Oscars night itself, The Shape of Water, a film about a woman and an amphibious creature, won top honours.Frances McDormand won best actress for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and persuaded every female nominee to stand with her in a night full of statements about inclusion.Britain's Gary Oldman was named best actor for playing Winston Churchill in World War Two epic Darkest Hour.The Shape of Water won the most Oscars with four, including best film.But afterwards, a man was arrested on suspicion of stealing Frances McDormand's golden statuette.Terry Bryant was arrested for grand theft after the statuette went missing from the Governor's Ball, and later pleaded not guilty.McDormand was reunited with Oscar later that night.Charli Howard told BBC News about her journey from being an anorexic teenager to a campaigner for body positivity.""Models are models for a reason,"" the 26-year-old said. ""Not everyone photographs in the same way.""In her first book, Misfit - a memoir that deals openly with her problems with eating disorders and mental health - she said she struggled to fit in during her school years, which led to her suffering from anxiety and ultimately being attracted to modelling as a way to escape her surroundings.She now lives in the US full-time, working as a model - albeit one who is classed as plus-size.Actor Matt Smith revealed he nearly turned down his career-making role as the 11th Doctor in Doctor Who.Speaking on Desert Island Discs, Smith said he had had ""a wobble"" after being told he'd be David Tennant's successor.""I was like, 'I don't think I'm going to do it',"" he told BBC Radio 4. ""My agent said, 'You're going to do it'.""He also said he was ""the wrong class"" to play Prince Philip in The Crown, but pulled it off thanks to ""a great wig"".The NME, which is ceasing its print edition, was a massive part of many music fans' lives.Before rock music was reported in the mainstream press, before music television, and way before the internet, the NME was one of the only places to find out information about bands - or even, sometimes, to see what they looked like.During its heyday, music was also the most exciting expression of a youth culture that, some of the time at least, was changing British society.The NME was a doorway to that world.Jeremy Clarkson will be grilling contestants as the new host of ITV quiz show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?It's returning for a week this spring to celebrate its 20th anniversary.The ex-Top Gear presenter is replacing Chris Tarrant, who said in 2014 his days as a game show host were over and that he thought the programme had ""run its course"".On Friday, Clarkson said: ""I have always loved the show and am thrilled to be involved with its rebirth.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Here's a round-up, in case you missed them.The news of Prince Harry's engagement to actress Meghan Markle made headlines around the world. It also drew congratulatory messages from Markle's co-stars on US legal series Suits.Patrick J Adams, pictured above with Markle in 2012, said Harry was ""a lucky man"", while Sarah Rafferty (right) sent ""wishes for every blessing"".As further announcements about the royal engagement and wedding were made, the creator of Suits revealed it was decided to write Markle's character out of the TV series a year ago.""Collectively with the writers, we decided to take a gamble that these two people were in love and it was going to work out,"" Aaron Korsh told Radio 4's Today programme.Proof that pop stars are getting younger and younger arrived this week in BBC Music's Sound of 2018 longlist, a list of 16 up-and-coming acts that included the youngest nominee to date.US pop singer Billie Eilish, 15, was one of three teenagers on the list, selected by a panel of 173 critics, broadcasters and other music experts.Opponents of so-called Hollywood ""whitewashing"" had reason to celebrate this week when the Disney studio revealed it had cast an Asian actress to star in its upcoming remake of Mulan.China's Liu Yifei will play the famous Chinese heroine in a live-action version of the 1998 animated film, which will be directed by New Zealander Niki Caro.The announcement of the nominations for the 2018 Grammy Awards saw Jay Z (right) lead the way with eight, including one in the album of the year category.But many were surprised to see Ed Sheeran (left) left out of the main categories, with ÷ [Divide] missing out on a best album nod.Susan Calman's decision to unfollow the official Strictly Come Dancing Twitter account prompted some to speculate she was disenchanted with the programme.The Scottish comedian, pictured above with dance partner Kevin Clifton, responded by saying she was merely ""sad about leaving the show and didn't want to get even sadder"".Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt took to social media this week to alert fans to a ""pervy dude"" he said had been impersonating him online.The actor accused the imposter of ""hitting on"" his female fans and promised to ""punch [him] in the GD mouth"" should their paths ever cross.Pop star Rihanna took to social media herself this week to shoot down a fan's request to consider using a trans woman to promote her Fenty Beauty make-up range.""I don't go around doing trans castings,"" she tweeted back. ""I don't think it's fair that a trans woman, or man, be used as a convenient marketing tool.""Jennifer Lawrence revealed this week that she had a strategy to avoid receiving unwanted attention in public places - becoming ""incredibly rude"".""That's kind of like my only way of defending myself,"" said the actress in a filmed interview with comic Adam Sandler.Fans of Charlie Brooker's annual Wipe will have to do without their slice of satire this Christmas, as Brooker is just too busy to assemble his survey of the year's events.The Black Mirror creator revealed this week that he ""ran out of road"" and had not found the time to put together a 2017 edition.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

She told TMZ: ""I've always been honoured and proud to perform the national anthem and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA.""I'm a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn't strike the intended tone.""Christopher Eccleston told the BBC he thought his northern accent had held him back when trying to secure Shakespearean roles on stage.The actor star said there is a perception in the industry that ""people like me can't be classical"".Some social media users demanded Little Mix member Jesy Nelson delete an Instagram post of herself wearing her hair in dreadlocks.The 26-year-old unveiled her new hairstyle on Monday evening, but some followers suggested the picture was offensive to black people.Nelson was accused of ""cultural appropriation"" and there were calls for her to apologise.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Presenter Samira Ahmed takes BBC to tribunal	'Gender not a factor'	"Presenter Samira Ahmed has taken the BBC to tribunal this week, arguing she was paid ""a sixth"" of what Jeremy Vine earned in ""a very similar job"".Ahmed says she was paid £440 per episode on audience feedback show Newswatch, while Vine received £3,000 per episode for Points of View.The BBC's legal team argue the two presenters were not doing similar work.Journalists' union the NUJ described the BBC's gender pay gap as ""monumental"".Ahmed has presented Newswatch since 2012. According to the NUJ, although her wages were increased in 2015 to £465 per programme, they were reduced again when the corporation moved presenters onto employment contracts.The NUJ said Vine's fee for Points Of View was reduced to £1,300 in January 2018. He left the programme in July of the same year.BBC News presenter Carrie Gracie, who fought her own battle with the corporation over equal pay, said she knew of around 12 more people with employment tribunals ""in the pipeline"".She said the BBC's management was ""defensive and resistant to admitting mistakes"", and that Ahmed's case was ""emblematic and extremely important to all the other women still fighting"".Ahead of her tribunal, Ahmed said she loved her role on Newswatch, in which audiences critique the BBC's reporting of news and current affairs, ""despite it being difficult and challenging"".""I know that it is an important part of demonstrating the BBC service to all its audiences and the licence fee payers.""I have a sense of pride working for a public service broadcaster which seeks to represent the diversity of Britain and its licence fee payers.""She added: ""On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values which include 'we respect each other and celebrate our diversity' and 'we take pride in delivering quality and value for money'.""I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.""In response to her claims, the BBC insisted it ""is committed to equal pay"", explaining the pay difference occurred due to the fact Vine's show is ""entertainment"" and Ahmed's programme was ""news"".""Points of View is an entertainment programme with a long history and is a household name with the public. Newswatch - while an important programme - isn't.""Samira was paid the same as her male predecessor when she began presenting Newswatch. Gender has not been a factor in levels of pay for Points of View. News and entertainment are very different markets and pay across the media industry reflects this.""The NUJ said it was backing Ahmed's case because ""the scourge of unequal pay has no place in our public service broadcaster"".""Unfortunately, despite Samira going through a lengthy and frustrating internal process in the hope that a sensible solution could be achieved, the BBC has not resolved this case and it will now be for the tribunal to determine whether this monumental pay gap is appropriate and defensible,"" said NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet.""Samira is to be congratulated for her persistence and determination to secure fair and equal treatment by her employer.""Other broadcasting colleagues including Naga Munchetty, Sandi Toksvig, Alan Rusbridger, Andrew Copson, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi and the Right Reverend Nicholas Baines have offered Ahmed their support.The case opened on Monday at the Central London Employment Tribunal with witnesses expected to appear on Tuesday.It is listed to last for seven days.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Samira Ahmed's BBC equal pay tribunal ends: Who said what?	Why did Samira Ahmed bring the case?What did the BBC say?'Easy money'?Vine pay negotiations revealed	"An equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by TV and radio presenter Samira Ahmed has ended.Judgment has been reserved and the outcome will be published at a later date.Ahmed claimed she was underpaid for hosting audience feedback show Newswatch when compared with Jeremy Vine's salary for Points of View.She is seeking almost £700,000 in back pay. But the BBC said the two performed ""very different roles"".He got £3,000 per episode between 2008 and 2018, compared with her £440.Ahmed told the tribunal, which has lasted nearly two weeks, she ""could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work"".In a statement, she said: ""I love my job on Newswatch despite it being difficult and challenging. On the back of my BBC ID card are written the BBC values which include 'we respect each other and celebrate our diversity' and 'we take pride in delivering quality and value for money'.""I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.""Ahmed also argued that she had more input into the stories and scripts on her show than Vine did in his, and her work required more preparation time. ""It is likely that Jeremy Vine spends less time in make-up than I do,"" she said. ""Women are more likely to be criticised for their appearance on air.""The journalist, who also co-hosts Radio 4 arts show Front Row, said she believed a pay cut he took in 2018 - to £1,300 per episode - was sparked by her complaint. She named Vine as her pay comparator in an email to BBC bosses in October 2017.She added: ""My issue is with the BBC, not with Jeremy Vine. I'm incredibly grateful to him as a colleague. I don't want it to be about him and I'm sorry his name has been dragged into this.""Beyond Points of View, she said she believed he had been ""gifted"" his Radio 2 lunchtime show in 2003, which she said ""was a controversial appointment at the time and led to many complaints"" because he was not known as an entertainment presenter. ""Women are not gifted these opportunities,"" she said.That there is a big difference between news programmes like Newswatch and entertainment shows like Points of View.""There is a clear distinction between the two shows, and their genres, which is reflected in their broadcasting slot and their audience,"" the BBC's director of strategy Gautam Rangarajan said.One difference, he argued, was that the presenter is a lesser part of the appeal of news programmes. Newswatch required a ""skilled, trained journalist"", but the profile of the Points of View presenter was ""more important than in news"", he said.He cited audience research carried out in 2017 that found 71% people recognised Vine, compared with 29% for Ahmed.In 2018, the average audience for Newswatch on the BBC News Channel was 106,000, he said, while Points of View's audience was 864,000. However, Newswatch is repeated on BBC Breakfast on Saturday mornings, where it gets an average audience of 1.53 million.The BBC's legal team said Ahmed was paid the same as her predecessor Ray Snoddy, who they said was her pay comparator, rather than Vine.Points of View producer Simon Miller told the tribunal the show's presenter needed ""a glint in your eye"". They must to be able to convey a cheeky tone and strike a balance between holding the BBC to account while not being dismissive, on what is a light-hearted programme.""Getting the right balance required care,"" he said. ""One reason why Jeremy was so good at presenting the show was because he was able to strike that balance."" His predecessors Terry Wogan and Anne Robinson had similar qualities, he added.Newswatch series producer James Mallet said he did not expect presenters to put in significant amounts of personality for news programmes, which audiences wanted to be delivered straight.Mr Miller said a claim by Ahmed that making Points of View ""required minimal effort"" from Vine was ""not a fair description"".But an email from a BBC executive described the pay for Points of View as ""easy money"".Jon Swain, then head of unscripted productions for BBC Studios, wrote the email to other BBC bosses in January 2018 during discussions about Vine's future pay.He wrote: ""Jeremy has been pretty understanding and indicated... that he'd want £1500 (think that's half his current rate) but hinted that he would probably settled at £1300.""I believe stand-in presenters have been paid £1k and been very happy (it's easy money as it's so little work).""Ahmed's closing submissions criticised the corporation's witnesses and evidence, saying it failed to call anyone who was involved in negotiating Vine's fee for Points of View.It also said BBC witnesses ""were prepared to give evidence to the ET [employment tribunal] about matters that they had little knowledge of"" and that the corporation had ""repeatedly sought to make other unfair comments about SA [Samira Ahmed]'s credibility"".The tribunal also gave an insight into how contract negotiations in the TV industry work - or at least how they worked in 2007, when Vine had previously renegotiated his contract with the BBC.Roger Leatham, director of business affairs for BBC Studios, described how Vine's agent Alex Armitage told the corporation he had been offered ""close to a seven-figure amount"" by ITV and wanted the BBC to come close to matching it. He said Sky and Channel 4 also wanted to offer him work.The BBC believed Vine was one of the few presenters who appealed across entertainment, news and on radio - but the corporation was cutting budgets at the time and couldn't offer a big pay rise for his existing workload. The BBC decided the only solution was to find him more work - including daytime quiz show Eggheads and more Panorama.However, Mr Armitage rejected the offer in what Mr Leatham described as ""a rather colourful email"".""The BBC must now stop bullying this artist and pushing him around on this deal and listen to him,"" the agent wrote. ""Stop treating him like a chattel and pay him properly... Stop treating Jeremy Vine like a child as he is sick of it now.""An extra ""top-up"" clause was added, guaranteeing that the BBC would find work to the value of £100,000 for Vine or make a payment of up to £100,000 if it did not.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Charlie's Angels: What did the critics think?		"The latest reboot of the Charlie's Angels franchise premiered this week, starring Kristen Stewart and UK actresses Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska.The action movie, based on the '70s TV series, sees the Angels fighting crime on behalf of their mysterious boss.It's the second time the brand has been rebooted for the big screen, following a 2000 film (and 2003 sequel) which starred Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore.According to Benjamin Lee of The Guardian, this ""ramshackle action reboot goes at half throttle"".He gives it three stars, writing: ""There's intermittent fun to be had in this throwaway relaunch of the female secret agent franchise but the party is cut short by incoherent action and a clunky script.""The latest reboot is written and directed by Elizabeth Banks, who also guides the trio as the experienced former angel, Bosley.The movie's theme song, Don't Call Me Angel, is performed by Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey.Kenneth Turan of the LA Times suggested the Charlie Angels reboot was ""a concept in search of a movie"", adding it ""does not take flight"" (pun intended, presumably).""Charlie's Angels wants to take the venerable franchise in a new direction,"" he wrote.""The goal is exemplary, the execution nothing to write home about.""End of Youtube post by Sony Pictures Releasing UKVariety's Owen Gleiberman said that Stewart - who plays the wild and rebellious Sabina Wilson - ""anchors"" the movie, which throws up a ""divertingly up-to-the-minute fusion of guns and poses"".""Most reboots are meaningless (time to rev that franchise back up!),"" he said.""But the new Charlie's Angels, whether it turns out to be a glittering hit or the latest expensive package to get tossed by the audience onto the trash heap of franchise fatigue, feels like a generational rite of passage.""IndieWire's David Ehrlich suggested it confirms Stewart's place as a new ""comedy icon"". Their writer David Ehrlich called it a ""hilarious"" and ""kick-ass reboot"".The new movie also features appearances Djimon Hounsou, Noah Centineo, Sam Claflin and Sir Patrick Stewart.The last edition of the film series - 2003 sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, which also starred Diaz, Liu and Barrymore, received similarly mixed reviews and failed to hit the heights of its predecessor at the box office.This time around, The Hollywood Reporter's Beandrea July seemed to enjoy the ""fresh, feminist spin"" on the story, which also highlights environmental issues.""Banks brings Charlie's Angels into the modern age with flair, all while unapologetically raising a feminist flag, championing female friendships and subtly making a point about the urgency of the ongoing climate crisis.""Last but not least, entertainment website Perri Nemiroff of Collider called it ""one of the most enjoyable franchise reboots of 2019.""Charlie's Angels is a highly entertaining action comedy with a winning 'close as sisters' leading trio that also gives a big boost to the network of Angels.""If I could have walked straight from this movie into a second instalment of this iteration of the franchise, I would have.""Charlie's Angels is released in the UK on 29 November.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Emma Watson welcomes entertainment industry plan to stop bullying and harassment	'I found it shocking''Damaging to industry'	"Emma Watson has welcomed new guidelines to help prevent sexual harassment and bullying in the entertainment industry.The plan was put together by organisations like Bafta, the British Film Institute and Equity in light of the sexual harassment scandal.In future, only projects that sign up to the guidelines will be given funding by the BFI.Plans include appointing two people on every set to deal with issues and allegations, and a new support line.They have been unveiled as the British film industry prepares for the Bafta awards this weekend. As well as film, the eight-point plan will apply to the television and games industries.Actor and advocate Watson said: ""These principles are important because up until recently there were no guidelines, there was no protocol for someone that had been sexually harassed in the entertainment industry and I know this to be a fact because I've asked for principles, I've asked to see guidelines and no one could give them to me.""No one could send me - 'okay, here's the protocol that we follow when someone's had this experience' - which I found shocking.""She is one of the actors and filmmakers - also including Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker, Gemma Arterton, Gemma Chan, and James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli - to be consulted over the plans.BFI chief executive Amanda Nevill told the BBC: ""One of the most astonishing things about the introduction of these principles against harassment and bullying is the instantaneous and enthusiastic response across the whole of the industry.""This has been the most fantastic example of the industry - both the people in front of and behind the camera, all the big organisations behind it - welcoming this as a way we can come together. We aspire to an industry which is absolutely free of this.""Bafta chief executive Amanda Berry said: ""These principles and guidance are the result of a monumental cross-industry effort in the face of some difficult truths. Bafta is committed to promoting excellence and creative collaboration in film, games and television, and we believe that everyone has the right to work in a safe professional environment.""It is essential that there is a shared understanding of respectful, inclusive working practices that enable everyone to succeed.""The principles are going to be included as part of the BFI's diversity standards. This means that British filmmakers have to comply if they want to bid for funding or if they want to be eligible for the Bafta film awards, from next year.They will include a zero tolerance approach to bullying and harassment and rigorous processes in place to report any wrongdoing.It will be recommended that the two designated workers, one male and one female, will also help people off set.They'll be trained to handle allegations and to make sure workers know their rights and how to get help. They'll also encourage witnesses to speak and set out how to report any alleged criminal activity.And the free film and television support phone line, being developed by the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), is launching in April.CTBF chief executive Alex Pumfrey said: ""Film and TV can be an amazing industry to work in.""However, the horrifying revelations of harassment and abuse in our industry add to the under-reported incidence of stress, anxiety, health and mental health issues, and financial difficulty that can affect anyone.""She said those experiences could be ""devastating"" for individuals - ""and damaging to our industry as a whole"".Margot James, minister for digital and the creative industries said: ""Everyone has the right to feel safe at work and people can only thrive when they operate in a respectful and tolerant environment so that they can make the most of their creative talents. I welcome the BFI's anti-bullying and harassment guidance and the collective efforts of the wider sector which is an important first step to ensure change.""Others to have helped develop the guidelines include the union Bectu, the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact), the Production Guild, Women in Film and TV, the UK Screen Alliance and UK Interactive Entertainment, which represents the games and interactive entertainment industry.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Now sultry singer-songwriter Sade - real name Helen Folasade Adu - has a CBE to add to the OBE she received in 2002.Emeli Sande, meanwhile, becomes an OBE for services to music. The Scottish singer memorably performed at both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Olympics.Author and illustrator Raymond Briggs, creator of The Snowman and and Fungus the Bogeyman, becomes a CBE at the age of 83.This picture, taken in London's Hyde Park in 2008, shows him and a friend seated next to a deckchair adorned with perhaps his best-loved character.Broadcaster Gloria Hunniford becomes an OBE for services to cancer charities through breast screening services and cancer support. The 77-year-old sadly lost her daughter Caron to cancer in 2004.June Spencer, another broadcasting veteran, becomes a CBE. The 98-year-old actress, who plays Peggy Woolley on The Archers, is the only original cast member who can still be heard on Radio 4's long-running rural soap.Spencer said her CBE was ""an unexpected and great honour"", while Huw Kennair-Jones, editor of The Archers, said it was ""incredibly well deserved"".Patricia Hodge and Sarah Lancashire both become OBEs for services to drama.Hodge is known for such shows as Miranda, Rumpole of the Bailey and The Life and Loves of a She-Devil, while former Coronation Street star Lancashire won a Bafta this year for the BBC's Happy Valley.Both Tony Hawks and Natasha Kaplinsky are known to millions for their radio and television work. Yet both have been recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours for their activities outside the studio.Hawks becomes an MBE for services to disadvantaged children in Moldova, while Kaplinsky has been made an OBE for services to Holocaust commemoration.Kaplinsky is a member of the United Kingdom Holocaust Memorial Foundation advisory board and has spent the past 15 months voluntarily interviewing 112 British survivors.""Obviously this is a huge honour to receive an OBE but it gives me an opportunity to talk about the extraordinary people that I've met throughout this project,"" said the ITV newsreader and former Strictly Come Dancing winner.Actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw has been made an MBE, as has writer and director Amma Asante.The pair worked together on 2013 film Belle, which told the real life story of a mixed-race woman who was brought up as an aristocrat in 18th Century London.Model Erin O'Connor becomes an MBE for services to fashion and charity, while Sandie Shaw is made an MBE for services to music and charity.Shaw, now 70, became the United Kingdom's first winner of the Eurovision Song Contest when she sang Puppet on a String in Vienna in 1967.Mezzo soprano Sarah Connolly has been made a dame, while the conductor and composer George Benjamin becomes a sir.Connolly - who is not related to her namesake Billy - was made a CBE in the 2010 New Year honours, while Benjamin received the same honour six months later.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Was Taylor Swift really banned from playing her hits?		"""I don't know what else to do,"" declared Taylor Swift in a lengthy Twitter post last week. ""I just want to be able to perform my own music.""The star was distressed and upset. She wanted to play a medley of her hits at Sunday's American Music Awards but her old record label had forbidden it.Or so she claimed. The label hit back with a statement of its own, saying it hadn't tried to stop the show and that Swift's narrative ""does not exist"".Insults were traded, politicians weighed in and, eventually, a settlement was reached.Big Machine Records issued a statement on Monday night saying it had agreed ""to grant all licences of their artists' performances"" for ""the upcoming American Music Awards"".It didn't mention Swift by name but the implication was clear: Her performance could go ahead.But the second half of the statement was the really interesting part.""It should be noted,"" said the label, ""that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media.""Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists' audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.""In other words, Swift never needed permission to play hits like Shake It Off, Love Story or I Knew You Were Trouble at the AMAs (in any case, performance rights belong to the publisher, not the record label).What she couldn't do was put them online afterwards. And that matters.Last year, 6.5 million viewers tuned in watch the AMAs on television, down from 9.15 million a year earlier, but clips from the show went viral.Cardi B's carnivalesque performance of I Like It has racked up 28m views on YouTube alone, for example - making that platform more valuable to her as an artist than the TV broadcast itself.Taylor Swift obviously wants her performance archived online, too... but that's where things get tricky.""If Taylor was performing her own songs live at a festival, which wasn't being broadcast, it wouldn't be a problem,"" leading music and entertainment lawyer Talya Shalson tells the BBC.""The issue in this situation is that, as it's a recorded performance, that would effectively be a re-recording"" of the star's biggest hits.""It's very common for labels to put in a re-recording restriction, which normally lasts three or five years after the end of the artist's deal,"" she explains.Such a clause prevents the artist from taking their songs, recording them again and delivering them to another label, allowing the original rights-holder to ""protect its investments"".A crucial bit of background to this story: Swift fell out with Big Machine in June this year, after the label was bought by Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun for $300 million.Swift made no secret of her dismay. One of Braun's on-and-off clients is Kanye West, who has tormented Swift for more than a decade, interrupting her at award shows, disparaging her in his songs and putting a waxwork of her naked body into a music video.Swift believes Braun encouraged and endorsed some of those actions, which is why she issued an impassioned statement this summer, saying she felt ""sad and grossed out"" by Braun taking control of her back catalogue, including every album she released up to 2017's Reputation.She called the deal ""my worst case scenario"" that ""stripped me of my life's work""; but later announced plans to re-record all of her old music, undercutting the value of the master tapes held by Braun and his investment company Ithaca Holdings.Speaking to Good Morning America over the summer, she revealed the process would begin next year.""My contract says that starting November 2020, I can record albums one through five all over again,"" she said.""I think it's important for artists to own their work,"" she continued. ""I'm gonna be busy, I'm very excited.""(Coincidentally, she played Shake It Off during the same TV appearance, apparently without any restrictions from Big Machine.)Swift wouldn't be the first artist to record ""forgeries"" of their biggest hits: TLC, Prince and Def Leppard have all used the tactic to regain control of their music.But her plans apparently spurred last week's tussle. In her initial statement, Swift said she'd been told the AMA medley could go ahead if she ""agreed not to record copycat versions of my songs next year"".As leverage, Big Machine seemed willing to classify any archive of the performance as a ""new master recording"", putting Swift in breach of her contract.But that is a ""technical argument"" which ""to my knowledge, is not a position that a label has taken before,"" says music industry lawyer Susan Genco.She describes Big Machine's original stance as ""counter-intuitive and against the label's interest"" because, if millions of people see Swift play on Sunday, they're likely to go out and stream her back catalogue, boosting the label's profits.In that light, the decision to halt the performance seems misguided at best; vindictive at worst.It's an ugly story, and one that's as old as the music industry itself: A young artist signs a restrictive contract at the start of their career, and only becomes aware of the consequences when it's too late.In this case, Swift was able to mobilise her fans, who paid to erect #IStandWithTaylor billboards outside Big Machine's offices in Nashville; and the media, who covered the fall-out in blow-by-blow detail, until she got the outcome she wanted (although a planned Netflix documentary is still in dispute).As an added bonus, a lot more people now know that Swift is performing at the American Music Awards this weekend, where she is due to receive the Artist Of The Decade award.As Van Morrison once put it: ""Music is spiritual. The music business is not.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Jean Fergusson: Last of the Summer Wine actress dies	Stage origins of Marina'We battled through'Bicycle had to be sold	"Jean Fergusson, who played Marina in Last of the Summer Wine for 25 years, has died at the age of 74.Fergusson played the opinionated Marina in 216 episodes of the show from 1985.She also appeared several times in ITV soap Coronation Street, most recently playing the part of Dorothy Hoyle until 2011.She also had a theatre career and was nominated for an Olivier award in 1998 for playing British comic, actress and music hall performer Hylda Baker.The actress's death comes after that of her former Last of the Summer Wine colleague Juliette Kaplan in October.Comedy actress Vicki Michelle, best known for 'Allo 'Allo, paid tribute to Fergusson.Fergusson was born on 30 December 1944, and grew up in the village of Woolley near Wakefield.""I have very fond memories of a happy childhood, and going to the village school - long closed now, of course,"" she said in 2009. ""We'd stretch a line across the road and make that into our 'tennis net'. There was so little traffic back then that we rarely had to take it down.""The family later moved to Wales, where Fergusson learned her acting craft at The Castle (the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama).Before getting the role of Marina in Last of the Summer Wine, Fergusson had forged a successful career in theatre and was rarely out of work.Her first job at the Oldham Coliseum lasted two years and saw her in a variety of roles and touring productions around the UK.Fergusson also appeared in several television shows, including All Creatures Great & Small, Crossroads and The Practice, before taking on the role that would define her for the next two decades.Set in West Yorkshire, Last of the Summer Wine, which began in 1973 and ended in 2010, soon became the nation's favourite comedy. At its peak it was watched by 18 million people.Its success came from the seemingly incongruous mix of madcap capers carried out by a group of young at-heart pensioners.Fergusson's casting as the mini-skirt wearing, peroxide blonde Marina, was in fact first performed in a stage version of the show.The character was such a hit that TV director Roy Clarke decided to incorporate Marina - along with the characters of Howard and Pearl - into his television series.Hapless Howard was the love of Marina's life and the pair would travel up hill and down dale on their bikes or scooter, when Howard managed to find time away from his domineering wife Pearl.Marina's outfits were characteristically skimpy and as Fergusson grew older, she admitted to having become less and less comfortable, in more ways than one.""Funnily enough more towards the end [of the series], I was always the one in the low-cut blouse and the mini skirt or the shorts,"" she said when appearing on quiz show Pointless Celebrities in 2017.""When I got - shall we say - a little bit older, it wasn't quite the same getting all dressed up in the morning in a pair of little mini shorts and a very low-cut blouse.""But we battled through. We got on the bike and off we went.""While making Last of the Summer Wine in the 1990s, Fergusson was researching and writing the one-woman show She Knows, You Know! about the life and decline of Hylda Baker.Fergusson had admired Baker since her childhood and when she took the show to London's West End stage she found herself receiving the Olivier nomination for best entertainment show.Fergusson's first foray into Coronation Street came whilst she was still making Last of the Summer Wine. In 1999, she arrived to play the role of Mrs Mallett. She later returned to the soap after the end of Last of the Summer Wine to play Dorothy Hoyle from 2010 to 2011.In 2014, Fergusson sold off the bike she was given from Last of the Summer Wine, when she moved from Yorkshire to London and realised she had no space for it. It made £500 at auction.""If I could have kept it, I would have done,"" said Fergusson, ""but I'll let some wonderful fan have the pleasure of it.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	His Dark Materials: Critics heap praise on 'ravishing' dramatisation		"Critics have heaped praise on the BBC's new adaptation of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, calling it ""lavish"", ""epic"" and ""gorgeously realised"".""The whole thing looks beautiful,"" said the Telegraph's Anita Singh of a show she describes as ""perfect entertainment for a Sunday night in autumn"".Carol Midgley of The Times praised the ""standout"" acting performances.She said the series was ""that rare creature: something that can entertain adults and children simultaneously"".Metro's Keith Watson was effusive too, despite being confused by its story.""As the many characters tumbled off the page and on to the screen... the initial impression was one of bafflement,"" he concedes.Yet his four-star review goes on to call the programme ""a true feast for the eyes"" with ""fully formed and convincing"" performances.Set in an alternative reality full of airships, witches and giant polar bears, the eight-part drama is based on Northern Lights, the first book in Pullman's trilogy.In the version of Britain depicted in the series, every character is accompanied by a daemon - a physical manifestation of their soul that takes the form of an animal.The first episode of the series drew an average audience of 7.2 million viewers, according to overnight figures from Barb.Its lead character is Lyra, a young girl who embarks on a quest to discover why children her age are being mysteriously abducted.The Guardian's Lucy Mangan said 14-year-old Dafne Keen gives ""a fierce, intelligent performance"" as Lyra, while the Mail's Christopher Stevens said she and her fellow actors are ""terrific"".Further series based on The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, the second and third books in the trilogy, have already been commissioned.According to Mangan, the debut episode ""gave every sign"" the drama would have the ""time and space to do them justice"".Published between 1995 and 2000, Pullman's books have previously been adapted for radio, film and the stage.The film version, 2007's The Golden Compass, was not a box office success, though it did win an Oscar and a Bafta for its visual effects.The TV version, a co-production with US network HBO, was largely shot in Wales with a large cast that includes James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson.The BBC has not confirmed how much the show cost to make, though its budget has been reported to be between £40 million and £50 million.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon ordered by HBO		"Cable channel HBO has given the go-ahead for a prequel series to the hit fantasy TV show Game of Thrones.House of the Dragon will be set about 300 years before events in the original series, which ended its eight-season run earlier this year.The announcement came hours after another planned prequel, due to star Naomi Watts, was reportedly cancelled.Game of Thrones was HBO's most popular series. It won multiple Emmy awards and drew tens of millions of viewers.""It's my pleasure to announce today that we are ordering House of the Dragon straight to series for HBO,"" said Casey Bloys, president of HBO programming, at a launch event in Los Angeles for the HBO Max streaming platform.""It tells the story of House Targaryen and the early days of Westeros.""In a tweet, Games of Thrones said House of the Dragon would be co-produced by Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik.A pilot episode for an unnamed prequel starring Oscar nominee Naomi Watts was filmed over the summer.Earlier on Tuesday, sources quoted by The Hollywood Reporter said executive producer Jane Goldman had emailed the cast telling them that HBO had cancelled the show.The reasons behind the decision were not immediately clear and HBO did not comment.However, entertainment website Deadline reported that the pilot had not been well received by HBO.That prequel, also co-created by George RR Martin, was reported to have been set about 5,000 years before events in the original series.On Monday, Game of Thrones writers David Benioff and DB Weiss announced that they had left the next Star Wars trilogy, due to launch in 2022. The news came after the pair signed an exclusive deal with Netflix.Sky have extended their broadcast deal with HBO for another five years, according to Deadline, which means that the prequel is likely to air on Sky Atlantic in the UK - as Game of Thrones did.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or at bbcnewsents.

A time machine that captures the essence of who we were and are.""The project will aim to take the Abba experience to a new generation of fans and will enable them to see, hear and feel the band ""in a way previously unimagined"", a press release said.In June this year the band performed together for the first time in 30 years to celebrate the 50-year partnership between songwriters Ulvaeus and Andersson.Abba's biggest hits include Waterloo, Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia and Super Trouper.Their music was adapted into the successful theatre show, Mamma Mia! which was also turned into a 2008 film featuring Meryl Streep, Julie Walters and Pierce Brosnan.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Buffy the Vampire Slayer: How the show influenced modern entertainment	Strong, complex women on screen.Whip-smart dialogue filled with great pop culture references.Joss Whedon!Standalone storylines with an ongoing narrative leading up to an end of series 'Big Bad'.La La Land?	"It's been 20 years since Buffy The Vampire Slayer first hit our TV screens. It has fans all over the world, and made a star of its lead actress Sarah Michelle Gellar.A TV series based on a not-great movie about a Californian teenager who attends high school by day and fights vampires by night, seems an unlikely candidate to be a serious contender to become a TV classic and hugely influential piece of popular culture.But Buffy managed it and after close to 150 episodes - with its final outing airing in 2003 - its influence is still felt today as a truly ground breaking piece of work.Here are some of the things that Buffy has given the world of entertainment.In TV and film it's all too common for female characters to be the love interest or the support to a male lead.Buffy successfully put a woman at the centre of the series, and led the way for characters like The Hunger Games' Katniss Everdeen, The Force Awakens' Rey, Homeland's Carrie Mathison, and so many more.This was a trademark feature of Buffy - one example, after a gruesome multiple murder at a college fraternity house, a demon approvingly comments: ""It's like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue.""Series ranging from Gilmore Girls to Family Guy gleefully use dialogue in a similar, although less gruesome, way.Buffy's show runner is now one of the biggest names in Hollywood.Two of the films in the Top 10 highest grossing of all time were directed by him - Marvel's The Avengers and its sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron. Both took over $1.5bn (£1.23bn) and he also had a role overseeing other successful Marvel films.And it all started with the experience he got writing and directing Buffy.When writer/producer Russell T Davies re-launched Doctor Who in 2005, he changed its format to one that was similar in many ways to Buffy.The episodes in each series lead up to a climax where the main threat has been bubbling under the surface for several episodes.Without Buffy's brilliant musical episode Once More, With Feeling would Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's movie ever have been green-lit?Actually, yes, it would have been. But if you enjoyed the singing dancing love letter to LA which didn't win best film at this year's Oscars, you could do worse than to check out Buffy's musical extravaganza.It's exactly like La La Land, but with added demons.It also set a trend for other TV shows to unexpectedly feature a musical episode halfway through a series, including medical comedy Scrubs and medical drama Grey's Anatomy - and an upcoming Supergirl/The Flash crossover.Thanks Buffy, you saved the world - a lot.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	BTS's record label sues over 'malicious' posts		"Trolls who posted ""insulting"" and ""defamatory"" comments about BTS have been reported to police in South Korea.Big Hit Entertainment, the company behind the pop band, says it is taking action over posts ""that exceed the reasonable and accepted boundaries of expression and personal commentary"".The firm did not go into detail about the nature of the comments.However, it has previously sued over claims of ""sajaegi"" - bulk-buying albums to inflate BTS's chart position.Earlier this summer, the company also asked for court authorisation to seize and destroy bootleg merchandise being sold outside the band's concerts.In a statement, Big Hit explained it routinely monitored social media and message boards for posts about its artists that contained ""ill-intentioned criticism, the spreading of groundless information and personal attacks"".It has also established a hotline for fans to report offensive or defamatory content.The company claims that police have already launched investigations into its complaints, adding: ""We have responded with zero tolerance against insults and defamation against our artists.""We emphasise that there is, and will be, no leniency or settlement with the perpetrators of these acts.""Unlike the UK, where truth is a defence against defamation charges; South Korean law allows for an individual to be punished if they make a factually-accurate statement that brings another person into disrepute.In the wake of the #MeToo movement, there have been calls for a revision of the law, which makes it particularly difficult for victims of sexual assault to speak out.There is no suggestion that members of BTS have been accused of sexual assault. The ""Report Army"" Twitter account, which helps BTS fans identify and report offensive content, suggests contacting Big Hit over death threats, trolling and offers to sell the band's personal information.BTS, who won their first MTV Award on Monday night, are the most successful band to emerge from the K-pop scene, and recently sold out two nights at Wembley Stadium.Earlier this month, however, Big Hit announced the septet were taking an ""extended period of rest and relaxation"" in order to ""rest and recharge in their own personal ways"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Sheffield's Forced Entertainment win International Ibsen Award	'Profound influence'	"Theatre company Forced Entertainment have become the first group to win the prestigious International Ibsen Award.The biennial award, which rewards those who bring ""new artistic dimensions to drama or theatre"", has previously only been given to individuals.The Sheffield group's artistic director, Tim Etchells, said they were ""honoured"" to get such recognition.Named after Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, the prize is funded by the Norwegian government.A spokesman for the award said the group - made up of Robin Arthur, Tim Etchells, Richard Lowdon, Claire Marshall, Cathy Naden and Terry O'Connor - had been chosen as ""a recognition and appreciation of theatre as a collective art form, and of the theatre's importance within society"".""Forced Entertainment have created their own performative space within the history of theatre - here, theatrical conventions are played out, and they are torn apart,"" he said.""This influential theatre group is a group that recognises the theatre as a central voice within society, and which sincerely and with dedication, uses theatre as an arena for public debate; an open, reflexive and poetic space with ethical and social value.""Etchells said the company, who were also awarded prize money of 300,000 euros, were ""very happy"" to be named as winners alongside such a ""formidable"" list.Forced Entertainment was founded in 1984 with the aim of ""exploring and exploding the conventions of genre, narrative and theatre itself"", a company spokeswoman said.The group produce everything from small two-person pieces to large-scale productions, and have put on shows and events across the world.Arts Council England's executive director for arts and culture, Simon Mellor, said the award was ""a fitting tribute to Forced Entertainment's 30-year history of producing startlingly original work"".""[It is] a recognition of their far-reaching and profound influence on the contemporary theatre and performance scene,"" he said.Rufus Norris, the National Theatre's artistic director, added that the company had been ""a constant reminder that the way that we make work in the mainstream is only one very narrow way of making work"".""They are challenging, they are always provocative. They are prepared to have a real proper conversation with their audience,"" he said.Previous winners of the award, announced to coincide with the 19th Century playwright's birthday, include Austrian writer Peter Handke, French stage director Ariane Mnouchkine, Norwegian dramatist Jon Fosse and German composer Heiner Goebbels.It was first awarded in 2008 to English theatre and film director Peter Brook."
entertainment	Nice attack: Rihanna cancels concert as entertainment figures mourn		"Singer Rihanna has cancelled a concert in Nice in the wake of the Bastille Day attack that left at least 84 dead.The pop star wrote on Instagram her gig on Friday at the city's Allianz Stadium ""would not be going ahead as planned... due to the tragic events"".The Nice Jazz Festival, due to start on Saturday, has also been cancelled.Many figures from the entertainment world have expressed shock at the news, with Simon Cowell among those sending ""thoughts and prayers to all affected"".Rihanna, currently in Europe with her Anti tour, was in Nice at the time of the attack but was said to be ""safe"" by her representative.The makers of the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey - which had been filming on location in the south of France - also said everyone working on the film had been accounted for and was ""safe and sound"".Producer Dana Brunetti circulated the statement on Facebook, saying it was ""another sad day for France and the world"".Boy George tweeted his ""heart breaks for France"", while Cyndi Lauper said she was ""so sad for the people of Nice"".Comedian Amy Schumer, actress Mia Farrow and TV personality Kim Kardashian West are among others to express their sympathies.At least 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed through a crowd during Bastille Day celebrations in Nice on Thursday evening.The driver drove 2km down the city's Promenade des Anglais at about 23:00 local time, before being shot dead by police.Youssou N'Dour, Melody Gardot and Britain's Laura Mvula were among those who had been scheduled to appear at Nice's Jazz Festival.The event was to have run from Saturday to Wednesday but has now been cancelled, as have some of the city's other Bastille celebrations this weekend.Festival organisers told the BBC all tickets would be refunded and thanked ticket holders ""for their understanding"".US singer George Clinton, who had been due to perform at the festival on Sunday, sent his ""sincere condolences and prayers to the families of the victims"".London-based rapper Tiggs Da Author, who was also scheduled to appear on Sunday, is another performer to have sent ""thoughts and prayers"" via Twitter.Thursday's events have cast doubt on whether Bastille Day, an action thriller starring Britain's Idris Elba, will continue to be shown in French cinemas.A spokesperson for distributor StudioCanal told the BBC it would let cinemas decide whether to show the film and would support them if they chose to withdraw it.The UK release of the film - which features a bomb blast in central Paris - was put back two months to 22 April following the terror attacks that took place in the city in November last year.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	US elections 2016: How the entertainment world predicted a Trump presidency		"Across film, television and music, the prospect of Donald Trump becoming the US commander-in-chief was raised long before he became the president-elect on Wednesday.The election of Trump as the 45th US president has led many fans of The Simpsons to recall an old episode which apparently predicted it.Bart To The Future, first broadcast in 2000, showed how the lives of the main characters might turn out.A grown-up Lisa Simpson was seen as the White House incumbent, explaining to her staff she has ""inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump"".She then asks her secretary of state, childhood friend Milhouse Van Houten, how bad the country's finances are as a result of Trump's time in office. He replies: ""We're broke.""Earlier this year, The Simpsons writer Dan Greaney described the 16-year-old episode as ""a warning to America"".""That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was consistent with the vision of America going insane,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter.""What we needed was for Lisa to have problems beyond her fixing, that everything went as bad as it possibly could, and that's why we had Trump be president before her.""More recently, the show once again referenced his candidacy for president, although by this point Trump had publicly confirmed he would run for office.Trumptastic Voy­­age, broadcast last year, saw him on an escalator with Homer Simpson - a reference to the real-life entrance he made to announce his candidacy with wife Melania.Earlier this year, the show officially endorsed Hillary Clinton, releasing a clip of Homer and Marge discussing who to vote for, before settling on the democratic candidate.But the team behind the animated comedy series was not alone in predicting a Trump presidency.In 1999, a music video by US rock band Rage Against The Machine also appeared to allude to a bid by Trump for the White House.A man can be seen holding up a sign that reads ""Donald J Trump for President"" in the band's video for Sleep Now in the Fire.At the time, Trump had thrown his hat into the ring to be the Reform Party's nominee in the next presidential race, but he withdrew his candidacy in February 2000 - nine months before the election.The music video was directed by documentary filmmaker Michael Moore - who has more recently addressed the prospect of a Trump presidency directly.Moore, who is known as a left-wing political commentator, released a film earlier this year entitled TrumpLand, in which he warned of the dangers of his potential election.The filmmaker also posted an article on his website, headlined ""Five Reasons Trump Will Win"", although by this time it was a more realistic prospect than it had been when he directed the music video 17 years earlier.A slightly more indirect reference to a future Trump presidency was seen in the Back To The Future films.In the second movie, released in 1989, the trilogy's villain, Biff Tannen, is seen becoming a successful businessman, which leads him to open a 27-storey casino and, more pertinently, use his money to influence US politics.Fans long believed that this was based on Trump - a theory which was confirmed by the film's writer last year.Asked about the similarities between Tannen and Trump, Bob Gale told The Daily Beast: ""We thought about it when we made the movie.""Gale highlighted one scene in particular that appeared to allude to Trump.""There's a scene where Marty confronts Biff in his office and there's a huge portrait of Biff on the wall behind Biff, and there's one moment where Biff kind of stands up and he takes exactly the same pose as the portrait,"" he said.In the movie, Biff uses the profits from his casino to shake up the Republican Party, before eventually assuming political power himself. He is later seen transforming California's Hill Valley into a town riddled with crime and corruption.Trump was elected president 27 years after Back To The Future Part II was released.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

""I'll do my best to be a very good dame - and I don't mean in pantomime.""Known to millions as Peggy Mitchell, landlady of EastEnders hostelry The Queen Vic, the Shoreditch-born actress made her stage debut at 13 and appeared in nine Carry On films between 1964 and 1974.In addition to her roles on stage and screen, Windsor has supported and raised funds for such charities as Help the Aged, Variety, the Royal British Legion and the Amy Winehouse Foundation.""I feel so lucky to live in a country I love [and do] a job I have always adored which has allowed me to be in a position where I am able to help others,"" she said.""For a girl from the East End born into a working class family and an evacuee during World War Two, this is truly like a dream,"" she continued. ""I am so happy and blessed to say it's real.""Phillips is perhaps best known for playing Livia in the BBC's landmark adaptation of Robert Graves' I, Claudius.The Welsh actress won a Bafta for her work in the 1976 series, in which she played the to the emperor Tiberius, played by George Baker.Phillips, who was made a CBE in 2000, made her first radio appearance at the age of 11 and was married to actor Peter O'Toole for 20 years.She was recently heard on BBC Radio 4 alongside cast members of The Archers in a production of Calendar Girls, a play in which she first appeared in 2008.The 82-year-old said her damehood was ""totally unexpected... and something I could never have imagined when I decided to be an actress at the age of six.""I idolised all the dames like Peggy Ashcroft and Edith Evans and couldn't quite believe then that we inhabited the same planet.""I feel the same way now -

the charity Prince Charles established to help disadvantaged young people - that enabled him to join a youth theatre production.""To be honoured by the Queen in this way having been aided by her son's charity feels like a beautiful full-circle moment,"" said the actor, now 39.Born in County Antrim in 1965, Nesbitt made his name playing Adam Williams in ITV's popular romantic drama Cold Feet.He has since been seen in such TV dramas as Murphy's Law and The Missing and appeared as a dwarf in Peter Jackson's recent Hobbit trilogy.The 50-year-old became chancellor of Ulster University in 2010 and is a patron of Wave, a charity that supports people bereaved or injured by the years of violence in Northern Ireland.""I've been very blessed with my work and very blessed to come from Northern Ireland, and for those two things to be on the citation was really rather gratifying,"" the actor said.The music world is represented in the New Years honours by Albarn and Goldie, who receive an OBE and an MBE respectively.The former shot to fame with Blur in the early 1990s but has enjoyed success since as both a solo artist and a member of cartoon collective Gorillaz.He has also helped create works for the stage, most recently Wonder.land -

entertainment	The Bob Iger method	Riding into the futureProtect the brandCharm (in)offensivesSuccession	"It is customary in most examinations of a CEO's tenure to highlight errors and missed opportunities, find competitors who will bad mouth said individual, and, when it comes to those who lead global corporate giants, question whether any financial successes have been justly shared, within the company and across wider society.To immerse yourself in coverage of Bob Iger is to find journalists struggling and generally failing on all three fronts. Mr Iger's reign at The Walt Disney Company does present challenges to even the most sceptical of journalists. He has overseen a series of blockbuster acquisitions; Disney's growth has been consistent, vast (and record-breaking, for instance when it comes to the latest box office success of his Marvel franchise); and scandal has for the most part been absent.Mr Iger, who isn't yet done with running Disney, but says he has ruled out running for US President, is widely lauded as both the most powerful man in Hollywood/global media outside of Big Tech (delete as appropriate), and a reassuring, modern personification of the American dream.Such adulation demands that anyone scrutinising him put extra emphasis on missteps and failings. In his only recent UK interview, I sat down with him for over an hour for BBC Radio 4's The Media Show, and put four criticisms to him. First, why the delay in launching a direct-to-consumer streaming service? Second, was Martin Scorsese right about the creative homogeneity of Marvel productions? Third, does the differential in pay between him and junior staff (or ""cast members"") at Disney undermine the case for capitalism? Fourth, are he and Disney compromised by doing business in China?He had answers to all, of course. Before getting into them, it's worth elucidating the method and strategy that has made him undoubtedly one of the most effective CEOs in media history. I call it Igerism.To my mind, Igerism is strategic simplicity, exceptional charm, and shameless ambition.That's the short version. There is a much longer version in Iger's book, The Ride of a Lifetime, which I hesitate to admit is actually very interesting. Most leadership manuals by self-appointed corporate moral crusaders are unreadable tosh; the Iger book has several news lines, including about his relationships with Steve Jobs and Rupert Murdoch, and plenty of mischief, including quite cutting detail on Hollywood egos such as the super-agent Michael Ovitz, who once stood between Iger and the top job at Disney.Iger's shameless ambition pertains to both his own career and his company's. As a boy done good from the East Coast, he rose to become one of America's top TV executives in his 30s (his book is full of praise for key mentors). He then faced a challenge: how to replace the legendary Michael Eisner as boss, when what Disney needed was major overhaul and he had been Eisner's deputy for five years. Iger had to cast himself as an agent of change despite being a consummate insider.He did it by explaining the changes he wanted to make. Crucially, as someone from an ordinary background, he never felt he needed to apologise for wanting to get on in life, a sentiment I wish I could have included in a documentary I made about social mobility.After getting the job, strategic simplicity kicked in. It really is remarkable how uncomplicated Iger's approach to business growth is. He identifies weaknesses and neutralises them. And then he pursues scale and power to squash competitors, often by buying them. He looks at the underlying trends in a sector, and rides them.In several blogs on this page I have written about how modern media is shaped by the marriage of content with frictionless distribution. For the past 15 years, Iger's strategy has been to acquire more and more and more content. He distinguishes Disney's forthcoming streaming service from Netflix by casting the latter as a volume player. They have loads and loads and loads of content, and have tried to become your entire viewing companion, with something for all the family such that you don't need to bother with other services.Disney+ (or Iger+, as I call it) will be different, because of its assortment of mega brands - what Iger calls high-quality, branded entertainment. Owning those brands is the content side; getting them to consumers in the most frictionless and convenient way possible is the other side of it. I put to Iger that he, and Disney, were late to the game with a streaming service. You can make your own mind up on his answer, in which he broadly says you need both the content and the technology, and that takes time.The other trend in media is globalisation, of course. If you own the IP on some TV or film, you want to sell that in as many places as possible. It helps if they are world-famous brands (Marvel, Star Wars, Mickey Mouse); and it also helps if the nature of their stories is universal rather than local (superheroes, sci-fi, kid's cartoon characters, in those three cases).So with Disney+, which will provide something like the culmination of Iger's career, you see the unification of these three trends: a vast library of content, the frictionless-ish distribution of a direct-to-consumer offer, and story-telling with appeal from Boston to Beijing.Of all the brands that Iger has sought to nurture, none matter to him more than Disney itself. Here again his strategy was simple. When he took over, Disney's animation division was weak. He stripped Disney to its basics: what did the company traditionally do best? Answer: stories kids love. So he presented, in stark terms, the crisis in the animation division to his board. This persuaded them to loosen the purse strings and go for Pixar.Next, what are companies like Disney in the business of doing, ultimately? Providing joy through stories. They're not alone in this, of course: when I interviewed Ted Sarandos of Netflix, he distinguished his company from the BBC not only through reference to the regulation faced by the latter, but by saying that the reason Netflix doesn't do news is that it's basically a joyful place. And news isn't.This is also why Iger chose not to buy Twitter. He had gone a long way down the line with Jack Dorsey of Twitter, who used to be on Disney's board. But as he explained to me, the complexity of the deal would have been distracting; and as he has said in other interviews, the ""nastiness is extraordinary""According to Igerism, when nurturing brands, distil them to their essence, and to the extent possible allow nothing to damage that essence. It is obvious in retrospect that Twitter does not fit with a company whose aim is to provide joy through stories.Despite this, he has done business in China. This was clearly a sensitive subject during the interview (and after it). The theme park he opened in Shanghai, after several dozen long-haul flights, was clearly a huge commercial gambit and, now success. Disney has obligations to its staff, known as cast members, which may at some point become impossible to reconcile with certain working practices in a country ruled according to socialism with Chinese characteristics. For now, the commercial gain has outweighed any reputational damage. But constant vigilance is the price.His own price - the salary he takes from Disney - has been the subject of controversy. Abigail Disney, a relation of Walt who has no direct involvement in the company, was outspoken about it, while praising Iger's leadership. In crude arithmetic terms, the board of Disney believe he has more than earned his salary, $66m in a recent year. The broader question, of whether such a differential between the boss and those starting out at the bottom, as he once did, undermines the case for capitalism, is one I put to him. You can make up your own mind about his answer.Much has been said and written by other interviewers, not least Oprah Winfrey, about Iger's integrity and reputation for decency. The quotes in Maureen Dowd's New York Times interview, from some of Hollywood's biggest names (David Geffen, Barry Diller), are gushing.As corporate strategy, his inter-personal skills have been exceptionally valuable. Steve Jobs had a toxic relationship with Eisner, and Disney; Iger charmed him, then bought his company. George Lucas was quite understandably very protective of his blockbuster creations. Iger charmed him, then bought his company. Ike Perlmutter of Marvel was notoriously one of the most eccentric and inaccessible CEOs on the West Coast. Iger charmed him, then bought his company.And very, very few people knew or thought Rupert Murdoch was prepared to sell the entertainment behemoth he spent decades building. Iger charmed him, then bought his company.In any reflection on Iger's leadership of Disney, it would be remiss to overlook the fact that his personal relations with a series of titanic egos - who between them had very different dispositions and politics - has been highly effective.Talking of which, when I spoke to him, Iger had just started watching Succession, the American drama about a media mogul's family that is one of the greatest TV shows ever made. He was very into it, and having put off his own retirement several times, will know that a succession plan for Disney will be high on his priority list, once Disney+ has rolled out.It is a tough act to follow. Iger's career has connected two very different golden ages in our screen culture. Igerism offers a template for how to make a mouse roar.The full-length interview with Bob Iger is available via The Media Show on BBC Sounds: Making the Mouse Roar. A shorter TV version for BBC News and BBC World will be broadcast over the weekend of 8th November and then available on the BBC iPlayer."
entertainment	Game of Thrones writers Benioff and Weiss leave Star Wars trilogy	Kevin Feige to the rescue?Game of Thrones 'film school'	"Game of Thrones writers David Benioff and DB Weiss have left the next Star Wars trilogy, which is due to launch in 2022.The news comes after the pair signed an exclusive deal with Netflix.""There are only so many hours in the day, we could not do justice to both Star Wars and our Netflix projects,"" a statement given to Deadline read.They added that ""getting to talk about Star Wars"" with creator George Lucas had been ""the thrill of a lifetime"".They said: ""We love Star Wars. When George Lucas built it, he built us too.""Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said that they would be welcomed back in the future. ""David Benioff and Dan Weiss are incredible storytellers,"" she said.""We hope to include them in the journey forward when they are able to step away from their busy schedule to focus on Star Wars.""According to a Disney release schedule published in May, the trilogy is due to be the next set of Star Wars films, following this December's The Rise of Skywalker, the final chapter of the Skywalker family chronicles.The next films are scheduled for 2022, 2024 and 2026, and are set to usher in a new era for the famous franchise.Analysis by Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondentBenioff and Weiss aren't the first film-makers to unexpectedly leave the Star Wars universe before getting to realise their vision of a galaxy far, far away.Josh Trank left a planned Boba Fett spin-off, Lego Movie makers Phil Lord and Chris Miller departed the Han Solo film, Colin Trevorrow left Star Wars Episode IX, and even Rogue One's Gareth Edwards found that someone else was brought in to oversee re-shoots.In most cases, it seems the original directors' visions eventually clashed with that of Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy. That perhaps isn't the case with Benioff and Weiss. When their Netflix deal was announced, many wondered what might take priority and whether Netflix might have to wait until after the planned Star Wars trilogy to see the results of their $250m (£195m) deal.The pair's departure isn't a huge body blow to Star Wars, though. The recent news that Marvel chief Kevin Feige will develop at least one Star Wars movie, and perhaps even take on a larger role, is good news for the franchise. One of his great strengths with Marvel has been taking directors with disparate visions and allowing them to make films that simultaneously reflect their differing talents and still make the movies feel part of the same cohesive universe.There was much fanfare when Benioff and Weiss were unveiled as the writers behind the new Star Wars movies last February.While Game of Thrones was a huge success, there was consternation from some fans over the final series, which aired earlier this year. A petition calling on HBO to redo season eight has been signed by more than 1.75 million disgruntled fans.The Change.org petition argues that Benioff and Weiss ""have proven themselves to be woefully incompetent"".The pair made a rare public appearance at the weekend at the Austin Film Festival, according to Metro, where they admitted that the experience working on Game of Thrones was like an ""expensive film school"".When asked why they didn't bring in more writers to the show, they replied: ""Because we didn't know better.""Many have been wondering how duo would combine their work for Netflix with the Star Wars commitments.Speculation has also begun about who will replace them, with some on social media pointing out the lack of diversity behind the camera for Star Wars films to date.Meanwhile, fans have been treated to a new trailer for Disney Plus's Star Wars TV series The Mandalorian., which takes place after the fall of the Empire in 1983's The Return of the Jedi.Disney Plus will launch in the US on November 12, but no date has yet been announced for the UK.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	BritBox: UK broadcasters enter the streaming wars as new service launches	How does the price compare with other services?Analysis	"BritBox, a streaming service offering shows from ITV, the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5, has launched in the UK.Downton Abbey, Gavin & Stacey, Wolf Hall, Love Island and Broadchurch are among the shows available.C4 and C5 have come on board after ITV and the BBC announced BritBox as a way to get into the paid streaming market.The service will cost £5.99 per month and will mostly feature classic series, but will also include new shows, beginning with Lambs of God.The drama stars The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd, The End of the F****** World's Jessica Barden and Essie Davis from The White Princess as nuns living on a remote island. It was originally shown on Australian TV in July.Reemah Sakaan, ITV's group director for streaming, said there was a ""whole slate of original programmes"" in development for BritBox.While the service would be a second or third subscription for many viewers, it will be able to rival the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Apple TV+, she said.""It's got the widest range of UK box sets of any service,"" she said. ""Ostensibly the other streamers are US-focused so they make dramas for the US market, whereas BritBox is the faces, people and places that you know.""Some archive programmes that have been on services like Netflix will now move to BritBox, she said.""For some time we've been bringing our shows back home and now that we've got a destination in BritBox, that's something we'll be doing more actively. We'll still be working in partnership with Netflix and Amazon and all of the other streamers.""Dramas on the service at launch include Cracker, Prime Suspect, Brideshead Revisited and Ashes to Ashes; while comedies include Absolutely Fabulous, Extras, Blackadder and Fawlty Towers.More than 600 classic episodes of Doctor Who - broadcast between 1963 and 1989 - will be available to stream for the first time by Christmas.Shows and movies from Channel 4 and Film4's back catalogue will be available in 2020, and original shows from Comedy Central UK will also feature.Sakaan said having a big catalogue of classic shows ""shouldn't be underestimated"" by those assessing BritBox's chances of success.""The new battleground, quite often in streaming, are shows like Friends, which are 20 years old and are the top performers,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.By Amol Rajan, BBC media editorComing over a decade after a similar idea was first mooted, BritBox is entering a much more crowded marketplace.What we don't know is how good the product will be, in terms of the quality and uniqueness of the content, and the user experience. And we also don't know just how big the market for subscription-based video-on-demand services around the world is.Several big American companies, including Disney, are launching new services, betting that this market is still immature.BritBox is launching with a similar hope. The obvious criticism - that it contains a lot of repeats - means the user experience and a high quality of curation will be vital.The broadcasters have been in negotiations for years, because they have very different needs and interests. The BBC wouldn't want to damage iPlayer too much. ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 need to keep their advertisers on side.That they have all reached agreement despite these different priorities shows they feel they simply have to make a big, joint play in the streaming market.What a pity, though, that regulators didn't have the foresight to see that a decade ago.Some of the biggest hits of recent years, such as Killing Eve, Peaky Blinders and Bodyguard, will not be on BritBox at first.This is either because existing deals are in place with other streaming services, or because they are still on the broadcasters' own catch-up platforms.Shows are not expected to appear on BritBox until they have dropped off the BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and All 4, which do not require paid subscriptions. The BBC was recently given permission to keep programmes on iPlayer for one year.TV critic Scott Bryan said the idea of rival channels teaming up to try to compete with the likes of Netflix was ""quite big news"".""The issue is whether people are willing to pay towards them,"" he continued. ""And it will be interesting to see which shows end up being on which service.""Some shows might be a co-production between the BBC and Netflix for example, and that might end up on Netflix.""So for many of us there's going to be a lot of confusion trying to work out which show is going to be on which platform.""On social media, some users questioned why they were being asked to shell out to watch programmes they had effectively already paid for.Responding to that point in July, BBC director general Lord Hall compared BritBox with releasing a programme on DVD.""That was the BBC saying, there's a secondary market - you pay for content after we've shown it,"" he said. ""This is just a modern-day version of that, and an even better version of that, because it used to be infuriating when you'd seen a programme on the BBC and you couldn't get hold of the DVD.""Any money the corporation makes will be put back in to programme-making, he said. ""I think this is wins all round for the licence fee payers.""BritBox launched in the US two years ago and has a different catalogue of content, with 650,000 subscribers.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Ticketmaster makes 'huge step forward' for disabled music fans	Analysis - Alex Taylor, BBC News	"For years, deaf and disabled music fans have faced huge barriers when it comes to booking concert tickets.Whether it's the requirement to call premium rate help lines, or having to provide evidence of their disabilities, the experience has put many fans off.Now Ticketmaster is introducing a new system that allows gig-goers to book tickets online ""like anyone else"".BBC reporter Alex Taylor, a wheelchair user who regularly attends concerts, called the move a ""huge step forward"".Ticketmaster's scheme allows fans to submit details of their disability online. Once validated, the information is bound to their profile, meaning they can book tickets for all future gigs without extra effort.In participating venues, accessible seats will be clearly labelled on the seat map like any other ticket - whether that's in the range of a hearing loop, or in a wheelchair-friendly zone, with a free companion ticket.""It's something we've been seeking to address for some time now,"" Ticketmaster's MD, Andrew Parsons, told the BBC. ""Fundamentally, all fans deserve equal access to live entertainment.""The plus side of this system is that, in the future, the fans won't have to do anything. They will be able to buy their tickets like anyone else.""The booking system was soft-launched in two venues, Glasgow's SEC and Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena, a fortnight ago.""The feedback's been really, really positive,"" said Parsons. ""We're very keen to roll it out to a host of new venues now; and I'm challenging all of our teams on that.""He said that arenas in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle would be enrolled in the scheme by the end of the year, with more venues in more countries to follow in 2020.""This is fantastic news for disabled music fans, and we hope other businesses will follow Ticketmaster's lead,"" said Kristina Barrick, of the disability equality charity Scope.""Buying tickets online is not just about convenience. For disabled people whose impairments mean they can't use a phone, this will be game-changing.""Ticketmaster's new system is a huge step forward for the disabled community - the end of a needless digital divide. The traditional accessible ticket line route (specialist phone numbers open at set hours), is not only laughably cumbersome and time-consuming in the digital age, but also the opposite of accessible for disabled people, especially those who may have difficulty using the phone.Now, finally, a major player has begun to take the plunge (albeit tentatively), helping explore technology's full potential as an accessibility tool. Of course this is not before time and could've happened sooner. Research by the UK charity Attitude is Everything has been vital in highlighting the issue and forcing companies to take their earplugs out. Enabling disabled customers makes financial sense: The purchasing power of the community, known as the purple pound, was estimated to be worth around £249bn to the economy in 2017.But more work needs to be done. Launching at SEC Hydro, Glasgow and Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff shows willing but far from a full UK-wide commitment (Birmingham, London?), although Ticketmaster promise further roll-outs.Ultimately, this is a first-step, a warm-up to a headline act of ticketing equality that I, as a wheelchair user, have longed for my whole life. The whole point of music, and art as a whole, is that it is accessible to all - and most powerful live.Ticketing shouldn't be a barrier, but a route in. I'll meet you at the front.More than three million disabled people attend a concert every year and disabled music fans make up 11% of the live music audience, according to government statistics.But the UK charity Attitude is Everything, recently found that 82% of deaf and disabled music lovers had faced difficulties attending live music events, while 83% had been discouraged from buying tickets because of inaccessible booking systems.In response, it launched the Ticketing Without Barriers Coalition, and worked in conjunction with Ticketmaster to design its new system.""I'm delighted that Ticketmaster's accessible ticket sales will go online,"" said the charity's CEO, Suzanne Bull in a statement.""This is real progress for millions of disabled fans who are entitled to a variety of ways in which they can book their tickets"".A similar scheme also exists for the Birmingham NEC, Birmingham Arena and Resorts World Arena, via The Ticket Factory website.Ticketmaster stressed that their dedicated phone lines won't be closing - with the new system simply an option for fans who prefer to go online.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Entertainment Retailers Association says 'bricks and mortar' stores at record high	'Astonishing numbers'	"The number of ""bricks and mortar"" entertainment stores has reached a record high - despite rising online sales of music and film.There are now some 14,800 shops selling CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray, with supermarkets and high-street chain sales leading to the rise.The figures show ""traditional retail still has a place"", said the Entertainment Retailers Association.The internet accounted for 71.8% of entertainment sales in 2015.Physical stores were responsible for the remaining 28.2%.The number of stores selling music and video has more than doubled since 2009, with DVD and Blu-ray available in 14,852 stores in 2015 and CDs and vinyl in 14,727, said the ERA, which represents retailers and digital services.Many stores sell both, said a spokeswoman.""These are astonishing numbers,"" said ERA chief executive Kim Bayley.""Conventional wisdom has always suggested that the internet spelled the end for physical entertainment stores, but these numbers show that traditional retail still has a place, particularly for impulse purchases and gifts.""After all, you can't gift-wrap a download or a stream.""She told the BBC that physical stores are now streamlining and tailoring customer offers.""The growth of the internet has made retailers think differently,"" she added, with independent stores ""catering to very distinct tastes"" such as country music or world music.Larger retailers are driving sales by focusing on campaigns and offers, as well as impulse buys, she said, adding: ""People tend to go to stores like Amazon when they know what they want - but in a shop, they might decide to pick up a film to watch with a pizza on a Saturday night.""Stores now reporting sales to the Official UK charts for the first time include Argos, Boots, Primark and Urban Outfitters.""The addition of these outlets to the chart panel means it is difficult to make a direct year-on-year comparison, but the trend is clear - just as the internet has demonstrated that accessibility and convenience are key to selling entertainment, physical stores are demonstrating that if you put entertainment in front of people, they will buy it,"" added Bayley.In January, the ERA said ""surging digital revenues"" led to an all time high in sales of £6.1bn last year, ending a decade of decline.""Inevitably much of the focus has been on the investment by digital services helping the games, video and music industries develop new markets, but these latest figures on physical store numbers show bricks and mortar is also investing in extending its reach,"" said Bayley.There was a 1.5% growth in video (DVD and Blu-ray) sales last year, with music up 3.5% and games up 10%, said the ERA, with the CD seeing its best year in a decade."
entertainment	Peter Nichols: British playwright dies aged 92		"The British playwright Peter Nichols has died at the age of 92, his agent has confirmed.The Bristol-born writer was best known for plays like A Day In The Death Of Joe Egg and Privates On Parade.His agent, Alan Brodie, issued a statement on behalf of Nichols' family calling him ""one of Britain's foremost playwrights"".He added that he ""died peacefully on Saturday morning in Oxford. His wife Thelma was at his bedside"".A Day In The Death Of Joe Egg, which was first staged at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre in 1967, centres on a British couple struggling to save their marriage whilst trying to raise a disabled child.A new production of the play is about to open in London starring Toby Stephens, Patricia Hodge and Claire Skinner.The musical comedy Privates on Parade was inspired by Nichols' own experiences in the real-life Combined Services Entertainment, which provided live entertainment to the British armed forces.It was adapted for the big screen in 1982, starring John Cleese, and was revived in 2012 as the opening production of the first season from the Michael Grandage Company at the Noël Coward Theatre in London, with Simon Russell Beale in the lead.His other plays include The National Health, Forget-Me-Not Lane and The Freeway.Nichols was awarded a CBE for services to drama in 2018.Writer and director Steven Unwin said on Twitter he would be ""much missed"".He was ""An utterly remarkable, provocative, searingly honest and surprisingly heartbreaking playwright,"" he added.Sir Howard Panter, who is producing A Day In The Death Of Joe Egg at Trafalgar Studios, said in a statement: ""Peter was one of British theatre's greatest writers of the last 60 years.""As the company rehearse Joe Egg - his funny, moving and perhaps greatest masterpiece - ahead of its West End opening next week, Peter to his very last was emailing notes and involved in the production as he had always done.""We are so pleased we have been in rehearsals for long enough for the company to hear from Peter his experience of bringing up his daughter and how that informed Joe Egg. Bringing the authenticity that was a hallmark of Peter's work."""
entertainment	Phoebe Eclair-Powell: 'I can only write about what makes me angry'	'A terrifying time'	"Phoebe Eclair-Powell writes plays fuelled by her outrage at shocking stories she spots in newspapers. She has now won Europe's biggest playwriting prize - and says she has learned a lot by writing for Hollyoaks and from her mum Jenny Eclair.Eclair-Powell's first play Wink, in 2015, was sparked by seeing a story about a teenage boy who had killed himself after being the victim of revenge porn. ""I just thought, oh wow, that's crazy, this boy has lost his life because of the internet. So I wrote a play about the internet and about male psychology.""Next came Fury, a reworking of Medea inspired by news stories about changes to child tax credits, and how some women who had become pregnant as a result of rape may have to ""prove"" it in order to receive the benefit.""Again, it was like, oh my God, that's madness. How can I approach this?"" Fury (which The Times described as ""Medea in chavland"") had its run extended at the Soho Theatre, the venue that helped launch the career of another double-barrelled Phoebe, Fleabag's Waller-Bridge.Eclair-Powell continues: ""I do always keep an eye on, what are those real life stories that maybe go a bit unnoticed, but are just really shocking actually when you look into them?""Now comes Shed: Exploded View, following three couples over 30 years, which has domestic violence as its ""spine"". The writer was again incensed by a story in the media, this time about rising murder rates.""I can only write about what makes me angry and I couldn't understand why, yet again, they released those figures of how many women are killed a week by their partner, and it had gone up. I think I was so flabbergasted that something could be getting worse and not better.""While researching the subject on charity websites, she read about a woman who had been stabbed in the face with a fork by her partner.The story ""haunted"" the dramatist and became part of Shed: Exploded View, which won the Bruntwood Prize for Playwriting at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre on Monday.The script is ""astonishingly emotional"" and a ""punch to the guts"", according to the venue's new joint artistic director Bryony Shanahan, who was among the judges.""She deals with themes of female trauma with dignity, offering hope to her characters and the audience along the way.""Eclair-Powell's play was chosen from more than 2,500 entries and won £16,000 as well as development at the Royal Exchange. The biennial Bruntwood Prize is for unperformed plays and is judged blind - so the judges don't learn the identities of the writers until afterwards.The winning play was also inspired by artist Cornelia Parker's Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View, which captures a domestic garden shed moments after being blown up.Eclair-Powell describes the 1991 artwork as an ""explosion in action"". She remembers buying a postcard after seeing it in the Tate Modern gallery in her youth. When she was struggling to craft a play about domestic violence, she looked at it for inspiration. ""I whipped it out and saw it again and thought, this is what I'm trying to describe.""According to the Bruntwood Prize's official description, the play is ""about ripping the fabric of time to start again - it's about burning this world to the ground so we can build a better future for generations of women to come"".Snippets of all the shortlisted plays were performed at the Royal Exchange on Monday. Eclair-Powell says: ""A lot of the plays we just saw extracts of, people talked about violence a lot, and I think at the moment we're living in a really terrifying, very aggressive time, and I think violence is so part of our backdrop.""As well as writing for the stage, Eclair-Powell, 30, from south London, has written four episodes of Channel 4's Hollyoaks - which brings issues like domestic violence to TV screens every day.""I grew up watching Hollyoaks. I really like melodrama, and I like young people's stories,"" Eclair-Powell says. While writing for a tea-time soap is different from writing for the stage (""You're not allowed to swear for one, and my writing is incredibly sweary""), the impact can be bigger.""I really don't like the snobbery around continuing drama - soap operas - because storylines in soap operas have changed laws. When Hollyoaks had its first male rape storyline, that actually changed a law. They've broken so many boundaries.""She adds: ""Hollyoaks has probably helped me see that there's nothing wrong in entertaining the audience. Entertainment may be the wrong word with this play… but really communicating your message. Making people laugh and making people cry.""Eclair-Powell is also working on several other TV shows, including an adaptation of Joe Sugg's graphic novel Username: Evie and a show for Sid Gentle Productions, the makers of Killing Eve.The writer's mum, the comedian and author Jenny Eclair, has been a familiar face on British screens since the 1990s. ""I've tried my best to be different from my mum, but we look exactly the same,"" Eclair-Powell says.""We're really similar. She makes me laugh more than anyone else and I've been very lucky to grow up with her sense of humour and to realise that a sense of humour is one of the best ways to get a message across, and that making someone laugh is akin to making them cry. I have a lot to thank her for because she's supported me the whole way through.""At first, Eclair Sr wasn't a big fan of the non-linear structure and overlapping stories in Shed: Exploded View, however. ""She thinks it's pretentious. But she's also held my hand through it and been a shoulder to cry on when no-one wanted to put it on.""Now it's won the award, Jenny is a very proud mum, and her daughter no longer has to worry about who will put it on.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	BBC chief Danny Cohen defends entertainment shows on the BBC	Bidding wars	"BBC TV boss Danny Cohen has defended the corporation's right to make entertainment shows like The Voice and Strictly Come Dancing.A recent government paper questioned whether such shows were ""distinctive"" enough compared to commercial rivals.""I don't know why entertainment has suddenly become a dirty word in the context of the BBC,"" said Cohen.""The battle for Saturday nights between BBC and ITV has been going on for decades. It has driven standards.""The BBC's director of television was speaking ahead of his appearance at the Edinburgh TV Festival on Wednesday, where he said he would defend the issue ""strongly"".""I believe that we should keep fighting for entertainment on Saturday nights on the BBC that reaches a wide range of people up and down the country, from all different sorts of backgrounds,"" said Cohen.He said the corporation should be making shows for audiences who put entertainment ""top of the list"" of what they want from the BBC, rather than ""niche"" TV programmes that ""get the seal of approval from opinion formers"".""A show like The Voice, it's really popular with young people, diverse audiences and less well-off audiences and it matters to them as much as Strictly, and we should make sure that we offer both,"" said Cohen.BBC One's talent show The Voice was singled out in the government's consultation paper, due to be debated ahead of the BBC's Royal Charter renewal, for being ""similar to ITV's X Factor"".Mr Cohen's comments came after BBC director general Tony Hall wrote in the Daily Mirror that some commentators were questioning ""whether we should provide entertainment"" at all.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said he was not among them. He said: ""I've never questioned it, and as far as I'm aware nobody is questioning it. Nobody is talking about dismantling the BBC.""Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Whittingdale praised The Great British Bake-Off as a show that was ""not obviously a ratings winner"" but has become ""one of the most successful shows the BBC has done"".He added: ""What they shouldn't do is produce programmes - and this is a personal opinion - which are absolutely indistinguishable from a populist commercially-driven programme.""The minister also questioned whether the corporation should compete with commercial rivals for the British rights to programmes like The Voice, which ITV also wanted to show.""It was going to be shown on free to air anyway,"" he said. ""Should the BBC get into bidding wars with another free to air broadcaster? I think that's an interesting question.""However Claire Hungate, managing director of Warner Brothers Television UK, told the TV festival that the BBC did not bid more than ITV for The Voice and the BBC won the rights ""purely based on creativity"" and because it was the best home for the show in the UK."
entertainment	Apple cancels The Banker film premiere over 'concerns'		"Apple has cancelled the world premiere of one of its streaming service's first original movies while it investigates ""concerns"" about the film.The Banker is based on the true story of two black businessmen who overcame racial prejudice by enlisting a white man to front their bank in 1960s Texas.Apple did not give details about the nature of the concerns.But Hollywood media reported they related to complaints from the children of one of the men, Bernard Garrett.The red carpet premiere was due to take place on the closing night of the American Film Institute [AFI] Festival in Los Angeles on Thursday. The film is due to have a cinema release on 6 December before being available on Apple TV+ in January.In a statement, Apple said: ""We purchased The Banker earlier this year as we were moved by the film's entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy.""Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the film-makers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.""In light of this, we are no longer premiering The Banker at AFI Fest.""The Banker stars Anthony Mackie as Garrett and his Avengers co-star Samuel L Jackson as Garrett's partner Joe Morris. In the film, they recruit Matt Steiner, played by Nicholas Hoult, to help them get around racial barriers.The pair pose as a cleaner and chauffeur, but in reality use the banks they buy to give loans to other African Americans.When announcing the premiere in October, AFI Festivals director Michael Lumpkin said: ""The Banker joins a remarkable group of films being released this year that openly confront centuries of racism and injustice in our country, while celebrating the brave individuals whose activism has created real change.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Radio 2 reveals the best-selling albums of the 21st Century	Album listening in decline	"Adele's 21 is the UK's best-selling album of the 21st Century, selling more than five million copies since 2011.The record, which features the hits Rolling In The Deep and Someone Like You, is more than a million copies ahead of the second biggest-seller, Amy Winehouse's Back To Black.Adele also takes third place in the chart, with her most recent record, 25.The century's 40 biggest albums were revealed on Radio 2's Pick of the Pops, as part of National Album Day.Ed Sheeran appears in the top five twice too, while other artists in the top 20 include Coldplay, Kings of Leon, Lady Gaga and Scissor Sisters.Even with streaming taken into account, albums from the first decade of the century dominate the chart, making up 28 of the top 40.David Gray's White Ladder is the only record in the list to have been released before 2000 - having first been issued on his own label HIT Records in 1998, before being re-released in the early months of the new millennium.Radio 2's head of music Jeff Smith said it was ""heartening"" to see that 70% of the artists in the Top 40 were British, ""proving that home-grown music is still as popular as ever"".National Album Day was launched last year to mark the 70th anniversary of the album format. This year's theme is ""don't skip"", encouraging people to appreciate ""the benefits of taking time out to listen to an album from start to finish"".The idea is to challenge the cherry-picking approach to music listening that first took hold with the advent of the iPod in 2001.A recent study by streaming service Deezer found 15% of people below the age of 25 had never listened to an album all the way through.The survey of more than 2000 UK-based adults, found that 42% of people simply opted for playlists - either their own, or ones curated by streaming services - rather than playing albums in full.However, a separate study revealed that listening to an album is one of the best ways to de-stress - beating activities like gardening, exercising or taking a nap.According to a survey of 2,019 adults, listening to an album was the third most-popular activity for improving mood and mental well-being, after comfort-eating and reading (which came first).Bear in mind the research was commissioned by music industry body the BPI and the Entertainment Retailers Association to mark National Album Day, so treat the findings accordingly.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Robyn Crawford says relationship with Whitney Houston was 'love - open and honest'		"Robyn Crawford was Whitney Houston's best friend. A childhood confidant who became her assistant and creative partner. They were also, briefly, lovers.For years, their romance has been the subject of rumour and speculation. Two recent films about Houston's life, Whitney: Can I Be Me and the family-sanctioned Whitney, raked over the coals of their relationship - suggesting Crawford was the real love of her life.Crawford always declined to comment on her life with Houston - appearing in those films via archive footage, but never agreeing to an interview.But now that everyone else has had their say, Crawford has decided to tell her story. ""Why now?"" she asks in the introduction to her new memoir, A Song For You.""Believe me, I've done my best to stay out of the spotlight [but] I believe it is my duty to honour my friend and to clarify the many inaccuracies about myself and about who Whitney was"".She confirms, for the first time, her romantic history with Houston, which began when they were teenagers and lasted two years.""It wasn't all about our sleeping together,"" she stresses in the book. ""We could trust each other with our secrets, our feelings, and who we were. We were friends, we were lovers. We were everything to each other. We weren't falling in love. We just were. We had each other. We were one: that's how it felt.""Houston broke off the relationship just after she signed her record deal, handing Crawford a Bible and telling her she feared public exposure.Crawford remained a devoted friend and emotional bulwark, anchoring Houston to her past, and steadying the ship of her often-turbulent private life.She candidly describes their drug use and how she watched, helplessly, as her friend's habit spiralled out of control.""No matter what rules we came up with around responsible drug use, she kept breaking them and using whenever she wanted to,"" she writes.By the time Crawford quit Houston's team in 2000, the star was cancelling shows and missing recording sessions. She suspected the singer was being physically abused by her husband, Bobby Brown, and had found burned spoons in her kitchen.Crawford's own story isn't much happier - she is the daughter of a single mother, who left her husband after years of abuse; and lost two of her closest family members to Aids.But the book isn't overwhelmingly bleak. After escaping Houston's orbit, Crawford slowly rebuilt her life, and is now happily married with two adopted children. She has worked as a journalist, interviewing the likes of Jessica Biel and Kristen Bell, and is currently a fitness trainer.Her goal in writing the book was to erase the memory of Houston's tragic death, drowning in a bathtub on the eve of the 2012 Grammy awards, and remind the world she was ""bighearted, unselfish, hilarious"" and phenomenally talented - whether she was singing at the Super Bowl, learning to act on the set of The Bodyguard, or celebrating in church (where some parishioners were so overwhelmed by her vocals they would faint).""I want to elevate her. I want to lift her so she can hold her legacy up way high,"" Crawford tells the BBC, as she recounts the making of her memoir.What was it like to rekindle all these old memories as you wrote the book?I spent most of the last two-and-a-half years feeling and reliving the 80s and the 90s to the point that my son said one day, ""I'll be glad when mom is finished writing this book, so she can play with me again"".It's really true, you know? Sometimes they would disturb me and I'd be in a thought, so it would be a delayed reaction, or I might snap at them. So I really was not the mommy that I had been, attentive to every little thing.And the process of writing was like a roller coaster of emotions. The beginning, where we were bright-eyed, adventurous, fearless; then all the wild years achieving all the things we had talked about; and then my family and the challenges there. So there were tears of joy, tears of sadness, strain.You speak about watching Whitney in the studio, and how she could breathe life into a song; but I wondered what it was like to hear her sing in private, at home or in the car?I used to call that the pre-concert! We had this house in New Jersey and, in the great room, there was a dome. She would go into that room and just sing - gospel, jazz, Al Jarreau, whatever came to her - because the acoustics were like brilliant. I remember one night she was in that room singing Fly Me To The Moon, it was so effortless that it sounded like she really was flying.In those early days, it sounded like you had a lot of fun. Having water gun fights in hotel corridors and exploring the world together.The one thing about Whitney is she was like a kid. She wanted to have as much fun as she possibly could.I remember Whitney would rent out Lehigh University's arena in Pennsylvania to prepare for tours, and we'd always play football outside on their field. One time, for the last play, we told her, 'OK, the entire line is going to go right and we're going to block for you. You pause for a second, one second, and shoot to the right behind us.""She said, 'OK, OK, OK'. But when we all went to the right, she went to the left. She ran right into one guy, they clipped knees and she toppled over. For the rest of the dress rehearsal, she couldn't wear her heels. So no more touch football for us. They killed it for everybody. After that, it was ping pong instead.People will be interested to read about your romantic relationship with Whitney. The way you describe it is very tender and moving - but at the same time it's no big deal. You say you ""never talked about labels, like lesbian or gay,"" it just was what it was.Mmm-hmm, that's just how it was.People pull it out as a relationship - but we met and we clicked and we became friends. We built that friendship on being open and honest with each other about everything. She told me she was going to sign this [record] deal and she was going to take me with her all around the world. And along the way, we had an intimate, loving, physical experience of friendship within our friendship. It was love and it was open and honest.Whitney ended the relationship shortly after signing her record deal, telling you ""it would make our journey even more difficult"". How hard was it to put those feelings to one side and just be friends?Well, we were friends - and we knew each other very well.The focus was always where we were going. Nothing could stand in the way of that. Whitney shared with me her belief that, if people found out about our relationship, they would use it against us. And it was the 80s. You were either this or that. And women were treated in a way where they were rivals and not comrades. So it was a lot and we were young. We were young, but we were fearless.In a way, you protected each other.That was very important. Whitney said ""I want you right here. You know me. You knew me before we got where we were going."" So we were a team. She knew me and she trusted me.End of Youtube post by whitneyhoustonVEVOI was struck by your mum's first meeting with Whitney, where she says, ""You look like an angel, but I know you're not"". And then, a few days later, Whitney presents you with a joint for the first time.My mother had her right! Whitney had this angelic radiance about her. And then she pulled a joint out of her breast pocket as if to say, ""Yeah, I do this too, OK?""The two of you did drugs together often, but eventually you tried to talk her out of kicking the habit. Do you think she ever made a serious attempt at giving up?We never believed cocaine was a good thing; and in the early years she'd say to me: ""This cannot go where we're going"". So I believe for sure that Whitney knew she needed to help herself and wanted to do that.I write about it in the book that she called someone for help.Yes, this is in 2001 - she called a doctor to discuss rehab.Yes, Dr Richard Frances. She called him herself. And she said she was not someone who wanted to die. She was someone who wanted to live. She meant that.The public perception is that things took a dark turn when Bobby Brown turned up on the scene. That seems to be a dividing line in her life and her career.Well, I think people feel that way because it was covered so wildly and consistently in the tabloids in the mainstream media, so I believe that's where the public gets that over-reaching narrative.Do you agree with that narrative?Well... Obviously, I was still there at that time. And there were, let me say, a lot of 'distractions' during that time. But Whitney was still working and achieving during those times of career. I mean, she had film projects...She made The Bodyguard and Waiting To Exhale when she was with Bobby, right?Right. But what I will say is that she was exhausted.I guess when you're working hard, and home life is turbulent, there's no respite.Yeah. Everything came back to her. She was dealing with all of it and she wasn't getting the rest and the quiet she needed.But the same was true for you. At the same time as you were working for Whitney, you were caring for two family members with Aids. Did you ever have enough time for yourself?No, and you do lose your identity. I really didn't know who I was. So when it was all said and done, I write in the book about how I had to find Robyn again.Lisa Hintelmann, who is now your wife, said she couldn't start a relationship with you unless you agreed to have therapy. She sounds incredibly wise.Oh yeah. Lisa has been my Rock of Gibraltar. She let me know that she loved and cared about me, but that I needed to help myself.She gave me shelter and a place to hide, because when you feel like that, you just want to be alone. So it was a dark time for me, but she got out of my way, and just let me crawl until I climbed back up.You consciously left the entertainment industry, and went to work in a tennis club and on a farm, where you picked fruit. What was that like?Manning the desk at the tennis club wasn't for me, you know? But I loved the farm. No-one knew me, and I loved being outdoors. I stayed the entire summer season and I got a lot of asparagus. I love asparagus to this day!End of Youtube post 2 by whitneyhoustonVEVOShortly before Whitney died, you gave away some of the mementoes of your time together. I wondered what you parted with, and what you decided to keep?I presented a lot of gold and platinum discs to the Whitney Houston Academy of Performing Arts, which is the grammar school that she attended. But I kept the plaques for The Star Spangled Banner and her first single, You Give Good Love. And I kept letters from people around the world, heads of state like Nelson Mandela. All my tour books I kept, you know, different notes, And the Bible Whitney gave me, I kept.Do you still listen to her music?After I left the company, I didn't listen to her music for a while. And then one day I listened to Exhale. which was one of my mother's favourites. And then I played The Greatest Love Of All for my daughter and she loved it. I mean, I found her playing it in her room on her Alexa. And so, lately, you know, I have a couple of favourites including the Preacher's Wife.So it's mainly the gospel songs?Oh, yeah. I mean, I listen to a lot of gospel music, and even if it's not the Preacher's Wife, it is the gospel music that Whitney played - like Fred Hammond, Yolanda Adams, Persuaded, Through The Storm. She loved gospel music. It's the music she loved to sing most.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	'I am Justin Trudeau', jokes Sir Lenny Henry		"Sir Lenny Henry has been having a laugh at the expense of the Canadian prime minister by telling an audience: ""I am Justin Trudeau.""Mr Trudeau apologised this week after Time magazine published an old photo of him in blackface.Sir Lenny was speaking at a Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge focusing on how to improve diversity in the TV business.He discussed ""what now needs to be done"" in the industry.The actor has previously campaigned for lawmakers to guarantee true representation for minorities in UK film and television.Blackface, which was more prevalent in the past, particularly in the entertainment industry, involves white people painting their faces darker - and is widely condemned as a racist caricature.Time magazine published the first of three damaging photos of Mr Trudeau on Wednesday, saying it was taken from the yearbook of West Point Grey Academy - a private school in British Columbia, where he worked as a teacher before entering politics.It showed the then 29-year-old Mr Trudeau in a turban and robe with dark make-up on his face, neck and hands.On Thursday, he admitted he cannot say exactly how often he wore blackface. The revelations have rattled his campaign in a tight election race, with Canadians going to the polls on 21 October.Earlier this year Sir Lenny spoke of the racial abuse his mother faced when she first arrived in the UK.""People followed her down the street and asked her where her tail was,"" the actor revealed at a screening of the BBC's Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle.""This is the stuff our grandparents and parents experienced.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	ITV to recreate I'm A Celebrity jungle for theme park in Salford		"It's a long way from the Australian rainforest to Salford Quays, but ITV is to recreate the I'm A Celebrity jungle there for a new visitor attraction.The indoor I'm A Celebrity... Jungle Challenge will offer a ""multi-sensory adrenaline adventure"" from next summer.The venue, part of a £26m leisure development, will include replicas of Base Camp, Croc Creek and Snake Rock.But ITV said visitors won't come into contact with animals or insects - or be required to eat any bugs.Bush tucker might be on sale for those who want it, however.The broadcaster is finalising whether live creepy crawlies will be involved in the experience at all.But William van Rest, ITV's director of games, live and merchandising, said any animals would likely be virtual.The programme has been criticised by campaigners, including Chris Packham, who recently called on it to stop ""abusing animals"".Most of the attraction will be a 90-minute ""action-packed challenge"" involving such things as zipwires, parachute drops, climbing walls and mazes. On their way, visitors will collect stars in an attempt to be crowned king or queen of the jungle.Members of the TV show's production team have been involved in designing the venue and its activities, according to van Rest.He said: ""It's inspired by the show, and we're trying to create a jungle as closely as we can. Some of the games within I'm A Celebrity are things like treetop challenges, and one of the team who helps create the games for I'm A Celebrity is helping us with this.""The attraction is part of ITV's More Than TV strategy, which also includes tours of its Coronation Street and Emmerdale sets and its daytime studios at Television Centre in London.There is also a Ninja Warrior-themed aqua park near Windsor, and Ninja Warrior family adventure centres in Stoke and Wigan.Van Rest said: ""It's tapping into the market of viewers wanting to have experiences with TV brands, and operators recognising the power of the brands and the emotional engagement audiences have with the brands.""I'm A Celebrity is one of our biggest entertainment brands, and this is in the heartland of our audience. We think it's really exciting, and it's the first time we've done this sort of immersive experience.""The 2,500 sq m I'm A Celebrity...

entertainment	Disney boss Bob Iger talks Star Wars, Marvel and Martin Scorsese	'Too many Star Wars films'Britain must wait for Disney+Scorsese 'has never watched Marvel'Succession 'reminds me of a certain family''Cold feet' over buying Twitter	"He's arguably the most powerful man in Hollywood - the boss of The Avengers, The Lion King, Star Wars and Toy Story, not to mention Mickey Mouse.Since becoming chief executive of The Walt Disney Company in 2005, Bob Iger has masterminded the Mouse House's growth into an entertainment empire with the takeovers of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox.The studio's films have taken $8.3bn (£6.4bn) at box offices worldwide so far this year, and account for about $4 in every $10 spent at North American cinemas.Following the publication of his memoir, titled The Ride of a Lifetime (Disney does theme parks too), he gave his only UK interview to BBC media editor Amol Rajan.Here are five key things he said, including why ""less is more"" in the Star Wars universe, why Martin Scorsese was wrong to compare Marvel films to theme parks, and why Disney didn't go through with a deal to buy Twitter.Disney bought Marvel in 2009 and turned it into film's most lucrative franchise. There have been 10 Marvel films in the past three years, with eight more coming in the next three. Is there a danger of over-saturation?""Marvel is just doing sensationally well,"" Iger replies. ""The last film they released [Avengers: Endgame] had the highest global box office in the history of the motion picture business, and their pipeline is very, very rich with new stories and new characters and new adventures and new superhero exploits. So not true.""It's a different story with Star Wars, though. After a run of a film a year for five years, ending with The Rise of Skywalker this December, there will now be a gap until the next instalment in 2022.""I have said publicly that I think we made and released too many Star Wars films over a short period of time,"" Iger says. ""I have not said that they were disappointing in any way. I've not said that I'm disappointed in their performance. I just think that there's something so special about a Star Wars film, and less is more.""There may have been too many Star Wars films, but there clearly haven't been enough Star Wars TV shows.Disney is launching its own streaming service, Disney+, in the US on 12 November, with the highlights including The Mandalorian, an original live action series that takes place after the fall of the Empire in 1983's The Return of the Jedi.But British viewers will have to wait to watch it. Or anything else on Disney+. For up to a year.""We haven't announced a date for launch in the UK,"" Iger says. ""Our plan is to roll out Disney+ in most of Western Europe within the first year that we launch in the US.""The legendary Taxi Driver and Goodfellas director recently put the boot into Marvel by saying they are closer to theme parks than real films because it ""isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being"".""Ouch!"" is Iger's reply. ""Martin Scorsese is a great film-maker. I admire him immensely. He's made some great films. I would debate him on this subject. First of all, Marvel's making movies. They're movies. That's what Martin Scorsese makes. And they're good movies.""He goes on: ""I don't think he's ever seen a Marvel film. Anyone who's seen a Marvel film could not in all truth make that statement.""Ouch!Disney completed a $71bn (£54bn) deal for Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox - including the likes of X-Men, The Simpsons and Fantastic Four - earlier this year after a bidding war with Comcast.""As, you'd expect, Rupert is a tough negotiator. But he's true to his word. When he says yes to something, he sticks to it,"" Iger says.He also lifts the lid on the lengths he went to before a Fox board meeting in London in 2018 in order to win the deal. He wanted to make a new bid to Murdoch in person without Comcast getting wind of his plan, but was worried the Disney private jet would be picked up by online plane trackers.""We decided that if we flew a Disney corporate plane to London, it may tip Comcast off that we may be coming in with a bid that was higher than theirs, and we didn't want anybody to know that,"" he says. ""We decided we would leave our plane in Belfast and then charter another plane from Belfast to London so that we wouldn't fly in with the Disney jet.""He asked to meet Murdoch in the afternoon before Fox's evening board meeting. That wheeling and dealing has echoes of TV hit Succession, about a media mogul and his family.Iger said he had seen a few episodes. ""There are things in it that remind me of a certain family that's been involved in the media business. But I think, you know, there's a lot of fiction in it as well.""Iger's book reveals Disney also came close to a deal to buy Twitter, but he pulled the plug at the last minute. He says he got ""cold feet"" because it was ""too controversial"".""I thought there were responsibilities we would have to take on in running Twitter in terms of its position in the world and its effect on the world,"" he says.""While I was intrigued with what it might represent in terms of opportunity for us, I thought the responsibilities would burden us with things that would be potentially too distracting, too controversial, too challenging to manage.""Listen to the full interview with Bob Iger on BBC Sounds in Making the Mouse Roar.It is customary in most examinations of a CEO's tenure to highlight errors and missed opportunities, find competitors who will bad mouth said individual, and, when it comes to those who lead global corporate giants, question whether any financial successes have been justly shared, within the company and across wider society. To immerse yourself in coverage of Bob Iger is to find journalists struggling and generally failing on all three fronts.Mr Iger's reign at The Walt Disney Company does present challenges to even the most sceptical of journalists.Read more from AmolFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Why BP rejection is giving the arts a headache		And so the Scottish National Portrait Gallery has now added its name to growing list of arts institutions rejecting BP's corporate sponsorship money. The gallery made the reason clear: it is addressing the climate emergency.BP had hoped the cold shoulder treatment from the arts sector had ended with the Royal Shakespeare Company's recent announcement that it was cutting ties after several years of partnership. It was not to be.Attention will now turn to the British Museum and the Royal Opera House to see if they too will withdraw from long-standing corporate partnerships with the oil giant (the National Portrait Gallery in London has dodged the issue for the time being by announcing it is closing for the next three years).Externally, the public will be expecting all those arts institutions who have stated their commitment to becoming more environmentally responsible to undergo real and visible change in order to deliver on their promise.Internally, there will be at least one employee feeling a little dispirited: the person(s) whose job it is to fundraise on behalf of the arts institution. It has never been an easy task, but it has become a whole lot harder in the past 12 months.Typically, sport takes the lion's share of corporate sponsorship, with arts organisations feeding off any scraps of company cash that might be left over.There is not a history of companies queuing around the block to financially support exhibitions and gallery refurbishments. It is a small pool in which fundraisers have to fish, and it's now in danger of evaporating altogether.The public scrutiny museums, theatres, orchestras and other arts bodies now find themselves under is unprecedented. The effect is two-fold.Firstly, corporate sponsorship deals nowadays must be able to withstand forensic examination by stakeholders and the media, which Turner Contemporary's deal with Stagecoach South East could not.Secondly, the negativity surrounding arts sponsorship - from the Sackler Trust controversy to BAE Systems withdrawal from supporting the Great Exhibition of the North - is extremely off-putting for companies that might be thinking of entering the arts arena.What has also become absolutely clear over the past 12 months is that arts organisations have to up their game when it comes to basic due diligence before accepting a sponsor's money.It is no longer good enough to check the credentials of the sponsoring company. They now have to make sure the personal values of those who run and own it are compatible with their own charitable objectives.A quick Google search won't do. Twitter feeds, Instagram posts and other platforms for public comment all have to be rigorously checked.All of which means more work for already hard-pressed fundraising departments operating in arts institutions that are still feeling the chill wind of austerity. Theirs is a difficult and thankless job that has now become much, much harder.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

entertainment	Sir Jonathan Miller, director and humorist, dies at 85	'A supreme intellect''Creative genius'	"Sir Jonathan Miller, the distinguished theatre and opera director who famously starred in the Beyond the Fringe satirical revue, has died aged 85.In a statement, his family said he had died ""peacefully at home... following a long battle with Alzheimer's"".A man of many parts, Miller was also an author, a photographer, a sculptor, a broadcaster and a qualified doctor.Born in London in 1934, Miller studied medicine at Cambridge before embarking on a career in the arts.The catalyst was Beyond the Fringe, in which he appeared with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.The groundbreaking revue premiered at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival before transferring to the West End and Broadway.Its success led to Miller becoming editor and presenter of BBC arts programme Monitor and a director of plays at the National Theatre.His productions included a modern-dress staging of The Merchant of Venice, with Laurence Olivier as Shylock.He went on to direct six of the BBC's 1980s Shakespeare productions, among them The Taming of the Shrew with John Cleese and Othello with Anthony Hopkins.He served as artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre from 1987-90. Despite being unable to read music, he also directed operas for the ENO, Glyndebourne and the Met in New York. Who's Who listed his only recreation as ""deep sleep"".In a tribute, the Royal Opera House's director of opera Oliver Mears said Miller was ""one of the most important figures in British theatre and opera of the past half century"".He continued: ""Combining a supreme intellect with a consistently irreverent perspective, formed from his experiences in both comedy and medicine, Miller shone a unique light on our art form.""His intolerance of inauthenticity and laziness on stage was matched by the urgency and rigour of his search for the composer's vision, historical accuracy and psychological truth - resulting in so many productions which have stood the test of time.""The English National Opera added on Twitter: ""His contribution to comedy, theatre and ENO in particular was immeasurable. For over four decades Jonathan created some of ENO's most celebrated and popular opera productions.""And the National Theatre described him as ""a legendary figure across theatre and opera"".Miller, who was knighted in 2002 for services to music and the arts, was witty and erudite but could be cantankerous.""I've got this, I think, unjustified reputation for being grumpy,"" he once said, insisting he only objected to ""people who are 30 years younger than I am and know 100% less than I do"".Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, said Miller was ""a creative genius whose imagination knew no bounds... he brought arts and culture to millions on the BBC"".Monty Python star Eric Idle paid tribute to ""the beloved hilarious genius Jonathan Miller"", adding that Miller had ""dramatically changed my life three times"".He was also remembered by BBC Radio 3 broadcaster Petroc Trelawny as ""a polymath and cultural giant"" whose ""contribution to British cultural life was as varied as it was vast"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Evanescent delicacy is not the quality in the arts that I admire most, but it is often the characteristic by which I am most reduced to envy.""

Falling Towards England, 1985""All I can do is turn a phrase until it catches the light. There was a time when I got hot under the collar if the critics said I had nothing new to say. Now I realise that they had a point. My field is the self-evident. Everything I say is obvious, although I like to think that some of the obvious things I have said were not so obvious until I said them."" May Week Was in June, 1990""I think the control I had over my work was less than adequate. There was nothing wrong with the good bits in my poems, it's just that they were packed around with lots and lots of bad bits, and I think that the only way I've improved in the last several decades... is that I've learned to leave out the bad bits."" On ABC Radio, 2005""Unfortunately I can't [drive]. Or rather I can, but nobody believes in my ability enough to give me a licence.""

North Face of Soho, 2006""It makes no sense whatsoever to call the perpetrators of the Holocaust 'the Germans' if by that is meant that the German victims of Naziism - including many Jews who went on regarding themselves as Germans to the end of the line - somehow weren't Germans at all.

There will also be a second prize of £2,000 and a third prize of £1,000.Armitage said: ""Over the course of my 10-year laureateship I want one of the headline projects to be a prize or award that recognises the resurgence of nature and environmental writing currently taking place in poetry, to this end I have decided to create The Laurel Prize.""The new wave of nature writing in non-fiction has been well documented over recent years but not enough attention has been paid to a similar move in poetry, with climate crisis and environmental concerns clearly provoking this important strand of work.""He added: ""I want the prize to celebrate and reward that work, to encourage more of it, and to be part of the discourse and awareness about our current environmental predicament.""The 56-year-old, who studied geography at Portsmouth Polytechnic, has himself written widely about nature in a career spanning three decades - from accounts of trekking the Pennine Way to a recent collection, The Unaccompanied, about an endangered world in meltdown.The prize will be run by national arts charity the Poetry School, which also runs the annual Ginkgo Prize for ecopoetry.

entertainment	Blue Story director Rapman questions 'hidden reasons' for film ban	What have Vue said?'Lucky there were no serious injuries'Film company 'offered extra security''They bullied me'Film is 'about love, not violence'	"The director of a film at the centre of a storm over violence in cinemas has said he feels ""bullied"" and ""cheated"" after it was banned by the Vue chain.Rapman said Blue Story had nothing to do with a mass brawl involving machetes at a Vue in Birmingham, which left seven police officers injured.Vue pulled the British film, saying it had sparked 25 incidents nationwide.But Rapman said there ""was no link to Blue Story"" and asked whether there were ""hidden reasons"" behind the ban.Five teenagers were arrested after the fight in Birmingham's Star City complex on Saturday.The writer and director told BBC arts editor Will Gompertz: ""They were just in a cinema apparently for Frozen [2], but then they pinned it on Blue Story.""Vue said there had been a total of 25 ""significant incidents"" at its sites around the country, all involving people either watching, buying tickets for, going in to watch or leaving screenings of Blue Story.Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, said there was ""no connection"" between the Birmingham brawl and his movie.""And then you start thinking, is there hidden reasons there? What's the owner like? Has he got an issue with young urban youth? Is he prejudiced? Does he believe that this film brings a certain type? Is there a colour thing?""You start thinking of all these things, and it was an upsetting time.""A spokesperson for Vue said the decision to pull Blue Story from its 91 cinemas nationwide was ""categorically not"" related to race.The rapper-turned-film-maker, who rose to prominence in 2017 with his hit YouTube series Shiro's Story, said taking a machete to a cinema was ""barbaric"", but asked Vue to give details of the other incidents.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: ""They say that there's been a number of incidents, but where's the proof? Where's the evidence? Where?""We live in a camera generation now. If anything happens, the youth are going to film that and you will see it. How come we haven't seen any footage of the rest of these incidents?""I feel like that was just something to say to cover their decision, which already wasn't justified because the [original] incident had no connection to Blue Story.""Vue founder and chief executive Tim Richards said incidents involving groups took place at 16 cinemas in total, starting on Friday morning - the day of Blue Story's release - until Saturday evening, when it was pulled.""In over 30 years of working in cinema exhibition in the UK, I have never seen a nationwide issue like this affecting so many cinemas in such a short space of time,"" Mr Richards said.The chain classes ""significant incidents"" as those involving illegal activity, harassment, intimidation, violence, public disorder, or anything requiring security, medical, fire or police intervention. But Vue has not given specific details of the incidents or where they took place.""We have reviewed and assessed each and every incident in detail as part of our ongoing process of making decisions as to how we could possibly keep Blue Story on our screens,"" Mr Richards said.Additional security was put in place, but ""we were still not satisfied the risk had been reduced to an acceptable level"", he added.Mr Richards also said Blue Story, which has a 15 certificate, attracted a ""very young audience"". Reports suggesting those involved in the incidents were there to watch other films - such as Frozen 2 - were ""simply not true"", he added.""A younger audience were attempting to purchase tickets for other movies to access the Blue Story screenings and were also resisting requests for ID. This also played a key role in incidents and our decision.""West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""officers were attacked by quite young children"" in Birmingham on Saturday, including ""12, 13-year-olds who were there in quite large numbers"".His force had not asked the chain to pull screenings of the film, he added.""But we have to ask why and how did so many young children turn up in such quite large numbers, some of them armed to attack other people. It's fortunate there wasn't any serious injury on Saturday, but my goodness there could have been.""Rapman said he knew his film would appeal to young people, but he had no reason to suspect it might attract violence.""The two gangs that the film's based on, which are real gangs, have been in a cinema screen watching it together, laughing together, joking together, and leaving a cinema connected, happy seeing the area they grew up in.""Blue Story follows the life of Timmy who lives in Lewisham but goes to school in Peckham - two areas that have a notorious rivalry.It is released by the Paramount film studio, which offered to provide extra security at cinemas, Rapman said. The movie is also backed by BBC Films.""Paramount have definitely offered every single site extra security if they need it. How hard would that be to just get more [security] people there?""Showcase originally followed Vue's lead in pulling the film, but later reinstated it. Odeon and Cineworld have continued showing the movie.Vue's move has led to a vocal backlash, with some accusing the chain of being ""institutionally racist"". Vue has said its decision was made ""on grounds of safety alone"" and not because of ""biased assumptions or concern about the content of the film itself"".But Rapman said: ""They've alienated themselves from a big audience there. The explanation came with no evidence, no facts.""I feel like they bullied me because I'm a small film. They wouldn't have pulled Frozen, they wouldn't have pulled Last Christmas. They pulled a little independent movie that needs it more than them other movies.""He feels ""cheated"" as a result, he added. ""I feel it's always the upward hurdles coming from our background. I always knew it was never going to be smooth. But the last thing I thought was a cinema would ban us from every single site. I just don't think they respect me. They don't respect my movie.""Rapman said Blue Story is ""about what people do for the people they love, and how love can make people make the wrong decisions - and the right decisions sometimes"".He told BBC News: ""If you watch the film, you will understand. The last line of the whole trailer is, 'I'm not trying to justify, but I'm going to show you what these young boys are fighting for'.""I'm not justifying their actions, but go and see why they are fighting, see why they're stabbing and see what they're doing all these things, just so you can see their motivation and maybe we can help prevent that, so they don't have to pick up a weapon again.""In his statement, Vue's Tim Richards added: ""We wholeheartedly agree that the issues that have arisen are not about the film, but neither are they about Vue.The chain screens more than 500 films a year ""in a range of diverse content"", he explained. ""We are in the business of showing movies, not withdrawing movies.""Blue Story opened on Friday 22 November on 310 screens in the UK and Ireland and made £1.3 million over the weekend.That was enough to secure it third place on this week's UK and Ireland box office chart, behind Frozen 2 and Last Christmas.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Roundhouse Theatre to keep Sackler name despite turning down £1m donation	'Hub for emerging artists'	"London arts venue The Roundhouse will keep the name of the controversial Sackler family on one of its theatres despite rejecting their £1m donation.The venue's studio theatre was renamed the Sackler Space in 2015 after getting a grant from the billionaire family.But arts organisations have since shunned their money due to its connections with the controversial opioid painkiller OxyContin.The Roundhouse turned down a further £1m in 2018.It said the donation could distract ""from our work with young people"".Earlier this year, the Sackler Trust suspended charitable donations in the UK after institutions including the Tate and National Portrait Gallery also declined their funds.The attractions decided they no longer wanted to be linked with the family that owns US drug company Purdue Pharma, which has been accused of aggressively marketing the prescription painkiller OxyContin. The Roundhouse was listed as receiving £1m in the Sackler Trust's latest accounts, which cover 2018.A spokesman for the Camden theatre and gig venue said: ""We are enormously grateful for the trust's support over the years, but we have made a decision not to accept the donation at this time.""To do so risks distracting from our work with young people, and that's our priority.""However, they said they do not ""intend to remove the name on the Sackler Space at this time"".

entertainment	David Attenborough says BBC should prioritise arts		"Sir David Attenborough has criticised the BBC, accusing it of failing to make enough arts and culture programmes.The naturalist and broadcaster said the corporation does not prioritise these shows because they do not attract a big enough audience.""If you're a public service broadcaster, people of all kinds should be catered for,"" he said.Sir David was speaking in an interview celebrating the 95th year of Radio Times.He said that, as a public broadcaster, the BBC has a responsibility to show programmes on a range of topics.""I don't think the BBC does enough [arts and culture],"" he told the magazine. ""It's not enough simply to say: 'Well, it doesn't get a big enough audience.'""If you're a public service broadcaster, what you should be saying is: 'We will show the broad spectrum of human interest.'""Blue Planet II, which was narrated by Sir David, was the most watched TV programme of 2017, reaching 37.6 million viewers in the UK.The environmentalist has also written and presented such series as Planet Earth, Blue Planet, Life in Cold Blood and Zoo Quest.In response to Sir David's comments, BBC Arts said they would ""love to do even more"" coverage.The veteran broadcaster also defended the BBC, saying gaps in its arts and culture coverage were not entirely its fault.""There are lots of gaps in the BBC's coverage now, and that's because they are harried and badgered by all sorts of people,"" he said.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Dora Maar: Picasso's lover comes out from his shadow		"Dora Maar lived to be almost 90 yet, despite being a gifted artist in her own right, her reputation has rested mainly on her romantic relationship with Pablo Picasso. Now a new exhibition is aiming to bring Maar out of Picasso's shadow.He was a hugely celebrated painter but before they met in 1935 she was already known in France for her photographic work. The Tate Modern exhibition sheds light on Maar's life and on her sometimes neglected work.In 1935 Maar (born Henriette Théodora Markovitch) was unit stills photographer on a film being shot at the Billancourt Studios on the outskirts of Paris. She was introduced to Picasso, 26 years her senior and already a world-famous artist.Maar became his lover and - some have thought - the most influential of his muses. For the next eight years they were part of one another's lives - although Picasso continued his existing relationship with Marie-Thérèse Walter.Those few basic facts are often all that even art-lovers know about Maar, who died in 1997. Over the years there were many women in Picasso's life and she was undoubtedly one of those who mattered most to him.But Maar's reputation has been growing. A version of the Tate Modern show has already been seen at the Pompidou Centre in Paris and next year the exhibition will travel to Los Angeles.As a photographer and a painter in her own right does she deserve now to step out of his shadow? Or could what she achieved now be overstated, to compensate for decades of neglect?Professor Mary Ann Caws wrote a book about Maar 20 years ago, before her reputation had revived, and considers Maar to have been a ""remarkable talent"".""Much of her early work in France was fashion photography but it's unlike anyone else's fashion photography.... the best of her pictures are very dramatic.""The juxtapositions are often peculiar and so is the way she used light and dark. As soon as you know even a sample of what Dora Maar did you will always recognise her work - the pictures will speak to you. The proportions of her photographs can be peculiar but the work's always telling and has an impact.""Some of her photos can be shadowy and have a feeling of doom yet others can be remarkably funny. But the fashion images were only one part of Dora Maar. She went to Barcelona and took pictures of starving people in desperate circumstances. A lot of that work has been ignored because people see her in the context of knowing Picasso later.""Emma Lewis is co-curator of the Tate Modern show, which contains more than 250 photographic images. She says she's come to admire the ""dark glamour"" of Maar's work but adds ""there's a playful element too - real subversive wit"".Maar also photographed some of the 30,000 inhabitants of ""la zone"" - the circular strip of undeveloped land which became a wretched linear shantytown around Paris. The Tate Modern exhibition has striking examples of all these elements of her early career.Lewis says the 1930s were the heyday of illustrated weekly and monthly magazines. ""It provided Dora with a means of making a living and we show how talented she was in what she did.""It allowed her to play with avant garde and experimental imagery. She was involved with Surrealism - but I think it was very hard for a woman to be part of that group of artists.""Dora Maar's commercial work appeared in big French magazines of the day such as Rester Jeune. It also circulated in various arts journals and erotic reviews.""By and large the documentary photography was seen in exhibitions and not in print. But her politics were left-wing and in the Depression her documentary work on the plight of the poor was important to her - she had links to the radical Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists.""The exhibition could hardly ignore the Picasso connection. But it puts that part of Maar's life in context.As a photographer she recorded him working on probably his best known painting - Guernica (1937). Visitors to the Tate can see some of the Picasso works influenced by Maar in their years together, including the well-known Weeping Woman (also of 1937) which the Tate already owns.Some describe this as a portrait of Maar but she always insisted she had never modelled for Picasso for any picture. But she acknowledged he used elements of her appearance.Professor Caws says Maar was the most intellectual of Picasso muses. ""She spoke Spanish which meant they could have real conversations about the convulsive events of the 1930s. She was beautiful but I think Picasso was attracted by the dramatic spark she had.""The passionate relationship faded from around 1942 and Maar headed south to live in Menérbes in Provence. So had Maar accepted that no woman would ever possess Picasso?""I don't think she was a woman meekly to accept anything,"" says Professor Caws. ""When it all ended she was screaming and passionate and furious. But when she settled in the south she developed her own skills as a painter, something which used to be ignored when people wrote about her. Those paintings can be pretty remarkable but the best of the photography is incredible.""So we don't need to try to cut Pablo Picasso out of her life. She still has things to say to us with him or without him.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Booker Prize: Five other times awards have been shared	Academy Awards, 1969Eurovision Song Contest, 1969Golden Globes, 1988Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize, 2016Critics' Choice Awards, 2019	"For the third time in its 50-year history, the Booker Prize has been shared between two authors.Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo were named joint winners on Monday and will each receive half of the £50,000 prize money.The award was previously shared in 1974 and again in 1992, after which the rules were changed to prevent another tie.Yet this year's judges chose to overrule their own regulations and split the prize between Atwood's The Testaments and Evaristo's Girl, Woman, Other.Here are five other notable occasions when more than one party ended up being crowned the victor in an arts and entertainment contest.Ingrid Bergman was as surprised as anyone when she opened an envelope on 14 April 1969 to discover the best actress Oscar would go to two people.""It's a tie!"" she exclaimed, revealing to a stunned audience that Katharine Hepburn and Barbra Streisand would both be honoured for The Lion in Winter and Funny Girl respectively.Both actresses received 3,030 votes each, though only Streisand was present to accept. Hepburn's Oscar - her third of four - was accepted on her behalf by her director Anthony Harvey.A tie had previously occurred in 1932 when Fredric March and Wallace Beery were both named best actor.March had actually received one more vote than Berry, but the rules at the time decreed a tie would be declared if any actor came within three votes of winning.There have been four other ties in the history of the Academy Awards, though those all occurred in less prominent categories.The most recent took place in 2013 when the best sound editing Oscar was shared between Skyfall and Zero Dark Thirty.For the first and only time in Eurovision history, the 1969 contest resulted in a four-way split.France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were all named winners after ending up with the same points tally in Madrid.At the time, each country had a jury consisting of 10 members who each awarded one point to their favourite song. An improbable turn of events led to four countries receiving 18 points each.Since there was no rule at the time to govern a tie, all four were declared winners and were invited to perform their respective winning songs.Years later, Lulu called the situation ""ridiculous"" but admitted she was ""so glad"" her Boom Bang-a-Bang song had been one of the top four.""If I'd have been fifth I'd have been desperate,"" the Scottish singer told Australian talk show Today Extra in 2016.History was made twice at the 46th Golden Globe awards when two of its categories resulted in a three-way tie.Jodie Foster, Shirley MacLaine and Sigourney Weaver all shared the award for best actress in a motion picture drama.""I don't believe this,"" muttered Michael Douglas as he declared the result with his Fatal Attraction co-star Anne Archer.Weaver, for her part, said the award should have resulted in ""a five-way tie"". MacLaine did not attend the ceremony.The prize for best actor in a comedy or musical TV series, meanwhile, was jointly awarded to Michael J Fox, Judd Hirsch and Richard Mulligan.Empty Nest star Mulligan was the only one of the three on hand to accept his award in person.There were three other two-way ties on one of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's more bonkers nights.The judges of the UK's only literary award for comic literature couldn't decide between two of the 2016 nominees. So they decided to honour both.That meant authors Paul Murray and Hannah Rothschild both had Gloucestershire Old Spot pigs named after their respective winning novels.It was the first time the award - presented annually to the book (or books) deemed to best capture the comic spirit of PG Wodehouse - had been split between two winners.Jurist James Naughtie said it had been ""impossible to separate"" Murray's The Mark and the Void and Rothschild's debut novel The Improbability of Love.Peter Florence, chair of the jury that chose to split this year's Booker Prize, is a founder judge of the Wodehouse Prize.Earlier this year, Glenn Close and Lady Gaga were both crowned best actress at the 24th annual Critics' Choice Awards.Close was recognised for her work in The Wife, while Lady Gaga was honoured for her performance in A Star is Born.""I was so thrilled [to tie] with Gaga,"" Close told reporters afterwards. ""Maybe one year everyone in the same category will all be up there together, because how do you choose?""This was actually the second tie of the night as the award for best actress in a TV movie or limited series was also bifurcated.""I actually can't think of a more beautiful thing than a tie, because there really isn't a winner when we get to do such great work and we have such wonderful opportunities,"" said Amy Adams as she shared the stage with fellow winner Patricia Arquette.Ties are relatively common at the Broadcast Film Critics Association's awards, though this was only the second time two occurred at the same ceremony.It was a case of mixed emotions for Gaga, who rushed from the January ceremony to ""say goodbye"" to her dying horse Arabella.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Rylan raises more than £1m with 24-hour Children In Need karaoke feat		"Rylan Clark-Neal has now raised more than £1 million for Children In Need by singing non-stop karaoke for 24 hours.The presenter belted out 231 songs, assisted by more than 90 celebrity guests, including Rick Astley, Nicole Scherzinger and Craig David.He ate spoonfuls of honey every hour to keep his vocal cords coated - along with the occasional Pudsey donut.""I am in such a state,"" Clark-Neal told Radio 2's Zoe Ball as he approached the end of the challenge on Wednesday.""It doesn't feel real. None of it feels real.""The crooning marathon was broadcast live on BBC Radio 2 and the BBC red button. In the last half hour of his challenge the star raised more than £200,000 - with the tally reaching £845,239 by the time he finished at 09:15 GMT.""That's unbelievable, thank you so much,"" said the star.Donations continued to flood in after Rylan took a well-deserved rest, taking the tally past the £1 million mark by Thursday morning.""That sore throat today is totally worth it, @Rylan!"" tweeted Radio 2. ""We are so incredibly proud to announce that we've hit ONE MILLION POUNDS (£1,027,776 to be precise!)""The final grand total will be revealed during Friday night's Children In Need broadcast on BBC One.Rylan's challenge saw him duet with Dermot O'Leary on You Don't Bring Me Flowers, rap with Trevor Nelson and DJ Spoony on a version of Rapper's Delight, and dance with Strictly contestants Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard.Rylan said he was inspired to keep singing by the memories of a recent visit to a Children In Need-funded youth club.The star met the disadvantaged children helped by the Southend Association of Voluntary Services (Turning Tides) project in Essex - playing Hungry Hippos and taking part in arts and crafts lessons.""It was amazing and, do you know what, I didn't actually think about this when I signed up to do this,"" said the Strictly: It Takes Two presenter.""I didn't really think that I would need that, but actually visiting the project and meeting all the kids and volunteers and speaking to them and understanding how much this money impacts their lives, when I am sort of dying at four o'clock in the morning trying to garble together a song I know what I'm doing it for now.""His final song was Tina Turner's The Best - for which he was joined by M People star Heather Small.As it ended, the 31-year-old sank to the floor in relief and Zoe Ball played him the bells of St Margaret's Church in his hometown of Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, which were ringing in his honour.Rylan's charity feat came eight months after Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman danced non-stop for 25 hours on Radio 2 in aid of Comic Relief.In 2017, Sara Cox also boogied for 24 hours in an 80's Danceathon, while Dermot O'Leary kicked off the challenges in 2015 with another 24 hours of dance - live on the plaza outside BBC New Broadcasting House.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Will Gompertz resurrects Turner for a tour of the art prize in his name ★★★★☆		"If you happen to be walking along Oxford Street in London this week don't be too surprised if you detect a hint of patchouli and orange blossom mixed with the usual stench of diesel fumes.The sweet smell of luxury perfume will have wafted down on a gentle northerly breeze from Regent's Park, where the world's wealthy elite will be en masse, shopping at the Frieze Art Fair.The hardier among them might embark on a day out to Margate, where they will promenade beside the sandy beach on which TS Eliot partially wrote The Waste Land (""On Margate Sands./I can connect/Nothing with nothing.""), and look across to Sir David Chipperfield's elegant, modern Turner Contemporary art gallery, the venue for this year's Turner Prize exhibition.They will know that it is situated on the very spot JMW Turner - the great British Romantic painter after whom the prize is named - stood 200 years ago. He was transfixed by the light on the North Sea, ""The skies over Thanet are the loveliest in all Europe"" (this from a man who painted in Venice).But what would he have made of the work produced by the four artists competing for his eponymous award now in its 36th year?He was a coarse, irascible Londoner, quite unlike the refined group of super-rich, globe-trotting 21st Century collectors who will make the pilgrimage east next week. One can only imagine the scene as they go around the show together.Turner [on entering Oscar Murillo's exhibit]: What's this balderdash?Collectors: Mr Turner! Oscar's work isn't…err…that. It demonstrates a sustained emphasis on the notion of cultural exchange and the multiple ways in which ideas, languages, and everyday items are displaced, circulated, and increasingly intermingled.Turner: 'Twas ever thus my lovlies! Doesn't explain them rows of papier mache coves with gross bellies, though. They remind me of the stuffed shirts down the Royal Academy.Collectors: HaHaHaHaHa. You're hilarious! You should have seen the effigies coming down on the train. What a sight! Almost Turneresque, you could say.Turner: Are you taking the p…Collectors: No! There's a connection with your painting and your politics. They represent a globalised workforce entrapped within the capitalist system of production as both worker and consumer.Turner: The legacy of the rotten industrial age, eh? I see. But what the Dickens is going on with that big black sheet covering the window? It's obscuring the loveliest skies in all of Europe!Collectors: That's a black canvas signifying the darkness of our contemporary moment.Turner: Gawd, give me strength. Next![They move on to watch Helen Cammock's 100-minute film, The Long Note.]Turner: Ouch!Collectors: What's wrong?Turner: I've just walked into the bleedin' wall. Why's it so damn dark? Has that wretched Constable fellow been here making a nuisance of himself?Collectors: No, Mr Turner, it's because we're going to watch a filmTurner: A what?Collectors: A film. A bit like moving photographs. It's by Helen Cammock. She's looking at the role women played in the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in 1968.Turner: [Watches for a while] Is it supposed to be tedious?Collectors: It's not tedious! It's important! Think of it like a painting but with sound and words.Turner: I'm not stupid! I understand. I'd rather sit and watch that sea, mind. Are you sure it's art?Collectors: Yes![They leave after 10 minutes of Turner fidgeting and huffing and make their way to Tai Shani's exhibit. Turner stands at the threshold of her gallery and looks in.]Turner: This is more like it! The colour! The imagination! A big pink landscape painting you can stroll into - it's like adding a ring to Dante's fine tale. Splendid!Collectors: Are you taking the p…Turner: No! It's first-rate… [looks over to the wall]… What are those?Collectors: Headphones. You put them over your ears and hear a story that relates to the sculpture.Turner: Hand 'em over. How long's the story?Collectors: Over seven hours we think.Turner: Lord love us! What's it about?Collectors: Err, hmm, well…it's great artwork isn't it!Turner: What's it about?Collectors: Ah…it's… [reading from wall text]… a city in time, but not space, and the work explores feminine subjectivity and experience beyond traditional gender constructs.Turner: What the deuce! Much has changed since I was a simple painter. Tell me more.Collectors [still reading the wall text]: It's a world in which historical events, science fiction and myths combine, building a radical vision of a future world born of an alternative past.Turner [referring to his landlady and lover in Margate]: Mrs Booth would have thought this capital, she really would. Is there anything else to see? I couldn't half do with a brew.Collectors: Just Lawrence Abu Hamdan's installation.Turner: Sounds like quackery.Collectors: It's his exhibit! He calls himself a ""private ear"".Turner: Is that Cockney rhyming slang?Collectors: No! It's what he does. He takes ""earwitness"" testimonies from people who have suffered at the hands of authority and re-presents them as audio-visual stories on a translucent screen in the middle of the room.Turner: What's wrong with making pictures?Collectors: Nothing! We love your work!! But we love Lawrence, too.[They walk into the exhibit. Turner watches the glass screen on to which words and pictures are projected, while listening to a narrative track being played though speakers. He is silent as glimpses of the recent horrors of being incarcerated in Saydnaya prison near Damascus, Syria are relayed. The film changes but Turner remains, watching and listening to Lawrence Abu Hamdan reading a text in a work called Walled Unwalled (2018). The master artist is mesmerised. He stays and stays and stays. Eventually, slowly, he leaves.]Collectors: What did you think?Turner: It would be an honour for me if that man won any prize awarded in my name.Recent reviews by Will GompertzFollow Will Gompertz on Twitter"
entertainment	Eric Tucker: Exhibition fulfils 'unseen' artist's final wish		"Eric Tucker, a boxer and building labourer, made hundreds of paintings in the front parlour of his terraced house in Warrington over six decades.But nobody else saw the majority of them before he died last year. Even his family had no idea how prolific he was.He did tell them he'd like to have a gallery exhibition in his home town - and that wish has now been fulfilled.""I'm very proud for him,"" his brother Tony says. ""He would have loved it. I'm sorry he's not there [to see it].""After Eric died and his 400 paintings and thousands of sketches finally came to light, he was hailed as an important discovery in British art. His scenes depicting the streets and pubs of north-west England attracted comparisons with LS Lowry.Tony Tucker only began to get a sense of how many paintings his brother had created shortly before his death.""I found his paintings in the bedrooms, in the loft, in the store room, even in the garden shed they were stacked,"" he says. ""Even I hadn't realised how much work he'd produced. So that was quite a shock to me.""Following Eric's death at the age of 86, his family put on their own exhibition in his home. ""We thought the neighbours would come,"" Tony tells BBC News. ""But it went viral. We had queues right down the street.""In total, more then 2,000 people went through the doors over two days. Now, his first full retrospective, titled Eric Tucker: The Unseen Artist, is being staged at Warrington Museum & Art Gallery from Saturday.The exhibition includes a recreation of the parlour Eric used as an art studio in the house he shared with his mother until her death.""He took over the front parlour,"" Tony says. ""My mother, I remember, was very resistant, but it was impossible to stop him. That's where he did his work. Each evening he'd go in there and work away. Obviously to great effect - much more than I'd ever realised.""Tucker's paintings captured a bygone era, with characters seen drinking, smoking and wearing flat caps in pubs or traffic-free terraced streets with smoke billowing from chimneys.Despite some obvious parallels, comparisons to Lowry are ""a bit lazy"", according to the exhibition's curator Janice Hayes. ""In Lowry, the characters are almost incidental. For Eric, you actually feel that you know some of these people.""There's a guy with a peaked cap on who looks like he's come out of Peaky Blinders and you don't want to mess with him. There's a lady there who perhaps reminds you of Kat Slater or Elsie Tanner.""The artist would often surreptitiously sketch people under the table in the pub, she says.""There's one that I particularly like where he's obviously in a pub doing a pub quiz, but on the back [of the quiz sheet] he's sketched a couple of the people he was sitting next to.""She adds: ""We knew that Eric had expressed to Tony that he would have liked an exhibition in his home town, so it's nice to feel that we're able to honour that last wish.""He's an important artist for Warrington as much as some of the great artists we've already got.""Art critic Ruth Millington, who has written the exhibition catalogue, says Tucker painted ""with authenticity and a sophisticated innocence"", and the discovery of his works ""marks a significant contribution to modern British art"".She says: ""In contrast to the caricatured 'matchstick men' of Lowry, Tucker treated his characters with compassion. Painting people he knew, they appear, emphatically, as individuals, captured close-up enough for their expressions to emerge.""Tucker also took inspiration from Edward Burra and Surrealist artists, Millington explains. ""Like Burra, Tucker forefronts the psychological dramas of ordinary, working-class people.""Tucker was a masterful storyteller, painting everyday dramas of working class life in Warrington. There's a softness to many of Tucker's paintings, which shows the influence of British Surrealism, and artists such as Julian Trevelyan.""Like the Surrealist painters from the 1930s and 40s, Tucker captured elements of the surreal in the everyday. He turned the most mundane scenes into atmospheric, almost eccentric, paintings.""Before his death, only one of Tucker's paintings had ever been exhibited in public, after winning a local competition. Now, around 70 are included in the new exhibition.""He didn't get any recognition in his life,"" his brother Tony adds. ""But I'm hoping that he gets it now.""Eric Tucker: The Unseen Artist is at Warrington Museum & Art Gallery until 23 February.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Marty v Marvel: Kevin Feige responds to Scorsese's 'not cinema' comments		"The man behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe has responded to Martin Scorsese's comments that the comic book inspired-films are ""not cinema"".""Everybody has a different definition of cinema,"" said Kevin Feige, calling his words ""not true"" and ""unfortunate"".""Myself and everyone who works on these movies loves cinema, loves movies [and] loves going to the movies,"" he added.Feige's comments follow a BBC interview with Disney chief Bob Iger in which he took issue with Scorsese's remarks.""I don't think he's ever seen a Marvel film,"" Iger told BBC media editor Amol Rajan. ""Anyone who's seen a Marvel film could not in all truth make that statement.""The Marvel vs Marty row kicked off earlier this month when Scorsese contentiously compared Marvel's output to ""theme parks"".""It isn't the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being,"" he told Empire magazine.Scorsese doubled down on his remarks in a New York Times opinion piece in which he criticised ""the sameness of today's franchise pictures"".""Many of the elements that define cinema as I know it are there in Marvel pictures,"" he wrote. ""What's not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk.""The Oscar-winning director went on to accuse ""franchise films"" like Marvel's of keeping other films off cinema screens.""For anyone who dreams of making movies or who is just starting out, the situation at this moment is brutal and inhospitable to art,"" he continued.Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter, Feige said ""everybody is entitled to their opinion"", adding: ""I look forward to what will happen next.""But in the meantime, we're going to keep making movies,"" he continued, insisting Marvel had taken creative risks with its stable of characters.""We killed half of our characters at the end of a movie,"" he said, referring to the conclusion of 2018's Avengers: Infinity War.""I think it's fun for us to take our success and use it to take risks and go in different places.""Over the last 11 years, the films released under the banner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) have enjoyed record-breaking box office success.Earlier this year Avengers: Endgame overtook 2009's Avatar to become the highest-grossing film ever, having already set a new record for the biggest global opening of all time.Marvel's movies have also been embraced by critics and awards bodies - among them the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.This year saw Black Panther - the first superhero film to be nominated for the best picture Oscar - win awards in three other categories.Chadwick Boseman, who starred in Black Panther, told Emma Jones of BBC Talking Movies he does not want non-superhero films such as his latest movie 21 Bridges to be pushed out of the market.""The thing is, I am not just on a Marvel team,"" he said. ""I am part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but you want all types of movies and even in [Scorsese's] extended comments he admits that there is a criteria for what cinema is. [Good narrative] could happen in a superhero movie - I am not going to jump on an argument on one side about it.""He has a great opinion, he's a genius at what he does so he is obviously not wrong. But it is an opinion and he's not completely right either.""Next year's Oscars are likely to see nominations for Joker, an origin film about DC Comics' iconic super-villain.This week saw Joker became the first film since Avatar to remain at the top of the UK and Ireland box office chart for six consecutive weeks.In a recent interview with the BBC's World Service, Scorsese said he had considered directing Joker but had eventually decided he ""didn't have the time for it"".Todd Phillips ended up directing the film, which overtly pays homage to such Scorsese classics as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.Robert De Niro - star of both those films and Scorsese's new film The Irishman - also appears in Joker alongside Joaquin Phoenix.This week, Joker became the most profitable comic book movie of all time, having made more than 15 times what it reportedly cost to make.Both Feige and Scorsese were guests at the Hollywood Film Awards in Los Angeles earlier this month, where the issue also surfaced.""As fewer and fewer movies make it to the screen, we all start squabbling with each other about who is making better and more important films,"" said director James Mangold.""I think the reality is we're all making important films. We just wish there was more real estate for them all to get up on a screen.""Mark Ruffalo - who acted in Scorsese's 2010 film Shutter Island - also alluded to the row by pointedly referring to Avengers: Endgame as ""cinema"" at the event.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Workers at Bradford's libraries and museums also voted to go on strike over what a union called ""swingeing cuts"".Elsewhere, Essex County Council reversed a decision to close 25 of 74 libraries in July but said it wanted volunteers to run some smaller branches, while in August the High Court ruled Northamptonshire County Council's plan to close 21 of its 36 libraries was unlawful.The funding will ""make a massive difference"", Museums Association Sharon Heal said. ""Our members have told us about crumbling ceilings, leaking roofs and a lack of money to be able to carry out basic maintenance work.""Often museums are housed in historic properties that have suffered from years of neglect and in order to protect our fantastic collections and ensure that our communities can continue to enjoy them we need to act now - this funding will enable museums and galleries in England to do just that.""The £250m will be delivered by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) along with Arts Council England, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Historic England.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

This time around, with knife crime at a record high, the east London MC is looking and speaking out.The 34-year-old rapper / actor has a starring role in the returning crime drama Top Boy and his sixth LP Hoodies All Summer sees him combine music and drama to devastating effect.The powerful music video for lead single Trouble begins with a sample of an old speech by the late activist Darcus Howe, blaming politicians and police for failing black communities and creating disharmony.Kano picks up the threads of Howe's argument in his eerily-jaunty opening verse: ""Politician, hush don't make a sound / Been oppressing us couple centuries now / And these gunshots never reach your town / It's never on top when you leave your house.""The whole piece then crashes down to a gospel prayer after the video's young protagonist, Nate, is stabbed to death in broad daylight while playing with his friends. Now with more than 100 people having been fatally stabbed in the UK this year - the youngest, Jaden Moodie, was just 14 years old when he was killed in nearby Leyton - Kano wants his music to become ""a direct conversation with people of the community that I'm from"".""I do see what's going on, things do trouble me and it's natural that will creep into my music,"" he says. ""I don't want to be a preachy person. It's more like 'I get it.'""'I know the wider world might not get it and I know the media might not get it when a kid gets stabbed and they throw him up on screen and act like he was a gang member when he wasn't - trying to blame the parents and everyone but the system that's been created.""""I think great art poses questions and doesn't necessarily give answers and solutions - that's not what I'm trying to do,"" he adds.""I'm here to show you my perspective, as an older person. I'm not silly enough to think someone's going to stop violence.""I'm just trying to humanise situations and represent voices that aren't being represented.""Poet Caleb Femi has called Kano a musical spokesperson - a modern-day Bob Dylan or Tupac Shakur for Britain's youth.""In these times of uncertain political leadership, the endz have found their own prime minster in Kano"" he writes.""The endz minister?!"" laughs Kano, whose real name is Kane Robinson. ""I don't want that job - it's hard enough doing the jobs I do right now!""After thanking Femi for those ""kind words"" he stresses the importance of his own being able to ""stand the test of time.""""This album in particular I just kept thinking about myself in the future, looking back and could I be proud of what I've done?""If I had an album full of party tunes in a time like this, would that be acceptable for the artist that I believe I am?""That's why, when other artists are drip-feeding a constant supply of ""content"", Kano is happy to operate in his own time and on his own terms.His new record, featuring Kojo Funds, Popcaan and Lil Silva, melds UK hip-hop, grime and garage influences, as well as jungle and dancehall - reflecting his Jamaican roots. The penultimate track, Class of Deja, sees him re-connect with Ghetts and D Double E - all members of the legendary N.A.S.T.Y Crew, who are widely considered pioneers of the grime scene in the early noughties.Kano says he's pleased to have ""inspired a generation of young artists,"" recalling how, before the scene exploded and started putting ""dollar signs"" in people's eyes, artists like himself, Wiley, Dizzee Rascal and Lethal Bizzle were spitting bars on pirate radio simply ""because we loved it"".One of the young fans galvanised by those trailblazers was Stormzy - who made sure to thank Kano and his cohorts for ""paving the way"" during his historic Glastonbury headline performance in June.Likewise, Kano acknowledges Stormzy in his album opener, Free Years Later. But rather than celebrate his success, he recalls how police allegedly kicked open his front door, after a neighbour mistook him for a burglar. As Kano notes, ""as a young, successful black man in this country - in some people's eyes you still don't belong"".Perhaps that's why he's determined to colonise spaces that aren't a natural home for UK rap - with a five date-tour of lavish venues like the Royal Albert Hall and Manchester namesake the Albert Hall, in October.""I don't remember many moments of our kind of music in those buildings,"" he observes.Before that, however, the star will reprise his debut acting role as Sully, a drug dealer on the fictional Hackney estate of Summerhouse, in Top Boy.The cult series looked to have bitten the dust after being dropped by Channel 4 in 2014, only to be saved by high-profile fan and soon-to-be Netflix executive producer, Drake.""He just let them know 'I'm a big fan of the show. If there's anything I could do to help get it back I would love to do so. I'm serious.'""Shortly after that we sat down, me, him and [actor] Ash [Walters] and spoke about our ambitions.""He was like 'I don't want to get involved in creating it. I want you guys to do what you do.'""The team that made it happen #TopBoy2019 @therealkano @ashleywalters @futuretheprinceA post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Nov 8, 2017 at 6:06am PSTEnd of Instagram post by champagnepapiWhile there's ""definitely no cameo"" from Drizzy there will be appearances from Dave - ""a natural on camera"" - and the ""unstoppable"" Little Simz.How then do so many rappers - from Will Smith to Queen Latifah - move into acting so seamlessly?""Hip-hop is the art of story-telling,"" Kano muses, noting acting is ""allowing yourself to become vulnerable"".""Maybe there's a confidence that it takes.""Confidence and looking out, as well as looking in.Hoodies All Summer by Kano is out on 30 August and Top Boy returns on 13 September."
entertainment	'We are a family - and an art collective'	Rolling in mud'It may stop at any minute'	"When performers Grace Surman and Gary Winters and their two children decided to form a family art collective, the results involved rolling in mud, mass school drumming and a homage to Greta Thunberg.Every child is an artist. That's what Pablo Picasso said.Not every child, though, is an equal partner in a professional art collaboration with their mum and dad.As well as being the bundles of innocent creativity that Picasso probably had in mind, Merrick, nine, and 12-year-old sister Hope have been involved in their parents' performance art since before they knew that's what it was.When Merrick was one, he starred in his mum's tender 12-minute video I Love My Baby And My Baby Loves Me.Later, Grace would take the children along as she devised her performance routines. ""They were watching us make our work and they were around when we were in rehearsals. They were playing in a studio while we were playing in a studio."" So it seemed natural to play together.Grace choreographed a short performance duet for herself and Hope, and another for Gary and Merrick. The latter, titled Would You Rather Be Lost, went on tour - and looks like just about the most fun a father and son can have without the involvement of water slides or candy floss.Those projects went so well that, a year ago, Grace and Gary decided they and the children should work together as a family.They have now made two films for the National Trust to mark the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo massacre, when the cavalry charged a workers' rights protest in Manchester, killing around a dozen people.Artists Jeremy Deller and Bob and Roberta Smith and singer Jarvis Cocker are among the others taking part in the National Trust's People's Landscapes project. One of the family's films will be shown at Quarry Bank, a historic mill in Cheshire, where the family have filmed around 100 local schoolchildren drumming around the site.Doing interviews about their creations is not nearly as interesting as making them, and at Quarry Bank, Merrick gets bored and disappears from the cafe table less than three minutes after the family start telling me about their work. He's bursting with energy. He's a nine-year-old boy.Hope is more patient but she too makes her escape before the interview is over, boarding a National Trust buggy to the next filming location where some steel drums are waiting. Merrick reappears from around the corner at one point and his mum suggests I ask him a question before he bolts again.Do the family all come up with the ideas together? ""Yeah,"" he replies. He pauses, then reconsiders. ""Not really.""""We have,"" his dad protests.Are there any bits that were your idea?""No,"" Merrick says - before his mum and dad both remind him about the bits he suggested.""The drumming was your idea,"" Grace insists in a light-hearted rebuke. ""The whole thing was your idea!""It has been a long day, and the fact they are artistic collaborators doesn't take away the fact they are parents and children first and foremost.In their Quarry Bank film, the sound of the young drummers, who play bins and buckets and anything else that will make a beat, represent the sound of protest and marching and militaristic rhythm, Gary explains.Gary reminds Merrick too about rolling around in the mud at Dunham Massey, the other National Trust property where they have been filming. There, they dressed in period costume to present themselves as a sort of echo of the family who lived on the grand Cheshire estate in 1819. Their film project is titled Glorious Phantoms.""We've sort of contributed all together,"" Hope picks up. ""In Dunham Massey, I'm doing a speech all on my own, which is the Greta Thunberg speech to the UK Parliament.""The march at St Peter's Fields in Manchester in 1819 was about political reform at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. The family tried to think about what was the biggest issue inspiring protests today.Grace says: ""Hope has seen and heard of Greta, and been involved in climate strikes at school, and you were saying, weren't you, that it feels like the most important thing that you could think of right now. At the time of Peterloo, the important thing was to have a voice, to be heard. And Greta's like a spearhead for that [today].""As well as the films, the family, who live in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, are also working on a new stage performance and have been participating in a project for Manchester theatre company Quarantine.That has involved them staying in a new housing development and organising creative activities for the neighbours to encourage a community spirit, including painting workshops, country dancing and ice sculpture.It's a great excuse to have the kind of quality time most families don't get, but they have also made a point of discussing why they are doing those things in the first place.""You have to find a way to talk about the work, about what an artist is, what art is,"" says Gary, who is also one half of the performance duo Lone Twin. ""It comes down to those fundamentals sometimes - about why things happen, or why an idea might be good.""For their work for the National Trust, the children are getting paid for their contributions, as any professional artists would. It's a good source of pocket money as well as being fun, but Grace says she and Gary know the arrangement might not last.""As soon as they go, 'This is boring, and I don't like it, I'm not getting anything from it, and why am I doing it?' then it will just all be packed away. Gone. It's not about making them do something. It does work now but it may well stop at any minute and we have to be prepared for that.""Lots of artists who work together have their creative differences, after all. But these collaborators have to live under the same roof, and being a family comes first.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Arts bosses are still too white, Arts Council England says	'Holds back progress'	"More English arts organisations should appoint black and minority ethnic staff to their top jobs, the head of Arts Council England has said.Darren Henley was speaking after Arts Council England (ACE) published its latest diversity figures.They show that 17% of the workforce in companies that get annual ACE funding are black or minority ethnic - compared with 15% in the population as a whole.But 10% of artistic directors and 8% of chief executives are from a minority.And 9% of chairs of boards are black or minority ethnic.""For change to be real, there needs to be more diversity at the top,"" Mr Henley said.Current artistic directors who are from a minority include Indhu Rubasingham at the Tricycle Theatre and Madani Younis at the Bush, both in London, and Dawn Walton and Michael Buffong at touring theatre companies Eclipse and Talawa respectively.British actor and director Kwame Kwei-Armah, who moved to the US to run Baltimore's Center Stage, recently said it was ""painful"" that there were so few ""African-Caribbean or African artistic directors and leaders"" in the UK.The Arts Council's report said it welcomed the ""continued progress"" in increasing diversity in the workforce and ""will be looking to build on this"".But Mr Henley said ""we all have to do better"" when it comes to disability.Just 4% of staff in the 696 organisations that receive annual funding are disabled - compared with 19% in the wider working population, the report said.Mr Henley said the Arts Council would publish recommendations for venues and other funded companies next year on how to tackle this.The report also said attracting audiences from less affluent social groups would be ""a major theme of our future work"".Around a third of people who buy tickets for arts events come from the top two socio-economic groups, which account for 24% of the overall population.And 21% of ticket buyers come from the bottom two socio-economic groups - despite the fact that those groups make up 31% of the country.""For many children and young people from minority communities and from the least prosperous parts of our society, the arts aren't a part of life,"" Mr Henley said.""That exclusion holds back their progress. And this represents a huge waste of our national talent, at a time when we need it more than ever.""Of the funded companies with more than 50 permanent staff and which provided staff data, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Cheltenham Festivals reported that 100% of their staff are white.York Museums Trust is on 99%, Opera North has 98%, English National Opera has 97% and the figure for both the Halle Orchestra and City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra is 96%.Mr Henley threatened cultural organisations who did not supply full staff data.""We must be able to present an accurate picture of progress and of problems,"" he said.""Inevitably, going forward, we will have to look at the funding conditions of those that do not comply.""Arts Council England will have invested £11.8m specifically in diversity this year, he added.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Samira Ahmed takes BBC to court over equal pay	'Progress'	"BBC presenter Samira Ahmed is taking the BBC to an employment tribunal over alleged unequal pay.According to court listings, Ahmed's case is due to be heard over five days from next Monday.The papers allege ""failure to provide equal pay for equal value work"" under the Equality Act 2010.Ahmed presents Newswatch, which examines BBC editorial decisions, and the Radio 4 arts show Front Row. The BBC has declined to comment.Ahmed began her career as a BBC News trainee in 1990 and has worked as a news correspondent and a reporter on BBC Radio 4's Today programme and BBC Two's Newsnight.She covered the OJ Simpson case as the BBC's Los Angeles correspondent and was a presenter and reporter at Channel 4 News from 2000 to 2011.BBC News has asked Ahmed for a comment on the employment tribunal.The 51-year-old is not the first woman to take issue at the corporation's pay structure. Carrie Gracie previously resigned from her role as China editor in a dispute over equal pay.The BBC then apologised for underpaying her and said it ""has now put this right"" by giving her back pay.She donated the full, undisclosed amount to the Fawcett Society - a charity that campaigns for gender equality and women's rights.The issue of gender pay inequality at the BBC came to a head in July 2017, when it was revealed its best-paid star, Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans, made between £2.2m and £2.25m in 2016/2017. During the same period its highest-paid female presenter, Claudia Winkleman, earned between £450,000 and £500,000.About two-thirds of stars earning more than £150,000 - and all of the top seven earners - were male, the annual report revealed.Director general Tony Hall said there is ""more to do"" on gender and diversity and in September 2017 the BBC announced sweeping pay reviews.Six male BBC presenters, including Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell and John Humphrys, agreed to pay cuts in January 2018, to help level the playing field.The BBC's most recent annual review showed an improvement for women, with Winkleman, Zoe Ball and Vanessa Feltz now among the corporation's top earners.Rights watchdog, The Equality and Human Rights Commission, is investigating the BBC over pay historical gender pay discrimination.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Capturing the art and beauty of memorials		"Gabrielle Crawford has worked for years as a professional photographer. Now living in Normandy she was puzzled by how few people took an interest in France's monuments to the dead of two world wars. So, having secured a commission, she set about creating a photo collection of the monuments - trying to bring a female perspective to these commemorative works of art.Gabrielle (who was once married to the actor Michael Crawford of Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em fame ) remembers being aware of war monuments even when she was very young.""My father was a naval surgeon and on Christmas Day we'd go to the hospital to shake hands with the sailors after church, where there'd always be a monument to the dead.""And each summer we went on holiday to Italy. Driving down through France my father would point out the war memorials and I'd wonder about the stories behind them. Here I am years later having photographed many of them.""France has been a fixture in her life. In 1965 in the British embassy in Paris she married Michael Crawford. That marriage ended but he and their children have been to Normandy to see her photographic exhibition at the Mont-Ormel museum, a few miles from where she lives.In August 1944, Mont-Ormel was the site of a bloody engagement in the battle for Normandy, which followed the D-Day landings of 6 June. Gabrielle Crawford was commissioned by the Orne department to create a photographic record of France's monuments to the dead of two world wars. The collection would then be held at the museum.""When I came to live in Normandy I was taken by the number of war memorials there are - many very beautifully made with amazing detail. In the cities they were designed by architects. But in small towns and villages often they were paid for by local subscription: they're less grand and perhaps more touching. Often they feature images representing the ordinary French people who died when the Germans invaded or who were deported afterwards.""British war monuments are almost all to young men who went abroad to die. But in France it's more complex and often you see children on them and old people and the women who suffered at home. That was the French experience.""She finally chose around 60 images to show in the exhibition. She says it annoys her that some of the original monuments have been moved over the years and are hard to see up close.""That's why in some cases I crop in on faces. Some show real pain and anger but that detail is lost when people speed by in their cars. I did a huge amount of travelling to find the monuments but often when you get to a place it will only be people over 70 who have any idea where they are.""So did French friends think it odd that someone from Britain would take an interest in the monuments? Gabrielle says people were more surprised at a woman taking an interest.""I think the whole issue of war memorials is seen usually as a male thing. But as the pictures mounted up I looked at my work and I thought it's very clearly a woman's eye, a female view. And I hope that's what's new about the collection people will find at Mont-Ormel. I hope the pictures will be seen in other places too.""At least in the north of France people were memorialising invasion and you will see an image of a mother weeping or a daughter terrified because her father has suddenly gone. Relatively few show heroic soldiers and I decided to exclude memorials to an individual general or whatever - but they're pretty rare anyway.""Gabrielle says there's a real power to simple stone or concrete monuments, which often include the classic Poilus - the French infantrymen of the 1914-18 war. (The word roughly equates to the British term Tommy.)""Often they'll be life-size or near life-size and people repainted their coats in blue and the moustache in black. They can end up looking very slightly comic but French people still have an affection for them, perhaps more than for more grandiose monuments.""""And you have to remember that in France the state and the church are separate. So war memorials weren't allowed to have a religious aspect at all: it was more something a particular village would do.""Gabrielle is pleased her exhibition has coincided with the 75th anniversary of D-Day. There are some specific World War Two monuments but often names were added to monuments of World War One.""I've had to limit myself for now to Normandy and a little bit beyond - there are monuments elsewhere I could have included in Picardy and even in Belgium.""But the main aim was to remind people that these monuments exist and are worth looking at. They sometimes contain surprising detail of the suffering wars brought - not just to the soldiers but to parents and wives and children too.""Gabrielle Crawford's photographic exhibition runs at the Mont-Ormel museum in Normandy until 1 September.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Celebrities call for more creative education in schools	'We need to wake up'	"Stars from the arts world have joined industry leaders in urging the UK government to make creative education accessible to all young people.Sir Lenny Henry and model Adwoa Aboah have co-signed a letter championing the value of creative subjects.""For the benefit of the whole of the UK, we urge government to incentivise a broad and balanced curriculum within schools,"" the letter reads.Photographer Rankin and director Sam Taylor-Johnson have also signed up.The letter's release coincides with this year's A-level results, which showed further decreases in the number of students taking drama and music.The letter from the Creative Industries Federation calls on the government to recognise the ""critical"" role of creative education for young people in the creative industries and the economy as a whole.It cites evidence saying there has been an 8% drop in the number of students taking GCSEs in creative subjects since 2014/15.It accuses England's education system of ""sidelining"" creative subjects by excluding them from the English Baccalaureate.Subjects cited in the letter, which has more than 150 signatories, include drama, art, music and dance.The EBacc requires pupils to gain good GCSEs in two sciences, a language and either history or geography, as well as English and maths.""We call for either the discontinuation of the EBacc, or its broadening to include creative subjects,"" the letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.""It is also crucial that young people and those advising them have better access to high-quality advice about creative careers and how to pursue them.""Taylor-Johnson, director of Fifty Shades of Grey and the forthcoming A Million Little Pieces, said that ""our creative industries are booming"".""Yet policy makers seem to be geared towards denying the next generation of creatives the opportunity to contribute to an enormous part of the UK's economy,"" she continued.The country needs to ""wake up to the risks of undervaluing the skills provided by artistic and creative subjects"", she added.A Department for Education spokesperson said the proportion of young people taking at least one arts GCSE had fluctuated but remained ""broadly stable"" since 2010.""We are clear that the EBacc should be studied alongside additional subjects, like the arts, that reflect pupils' individual interests,"" the spokesperson continued.Entries in drama and music A-levels saw sharp decreases this year, according to figures from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ).There were 5,848 A-level entries for music and 10,207 for drama in 2019 - down from 6,251 and 11,239 on last year.A decade ago, 10,425 students took music A-level, with 16,925 doing drama.Michael Dugher, chief executive of lobby group UK Music, said the figures pointed to ""a deepening crisis facing music in education"".The Department for Education spokesperson said the government was ""providing nearly £500 million of funding from 2016 to 2020 for a diverse portfolio of music and arts education programmes designed to improve arts provision.""Follow us on Facebook and on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Arts suffering from 'class-shaped hole', Labour inquiry finds	The report's recommendations:	"The arts industry is suffering from a ""class-shaped hole"", a Labour Party inquiry says.The Acting Up report suggests the high audition costs for drama school is one of several factors deterring people from working class backgrounds from entering the arts.It also recommends more school trips to the theatre to encourage young pupils.The government said it was a ""priority"" to ensure everyone can take part in the arts and culture, including in schools.Former Coronation Street and EastEnders actress Tracy Brabin, who was first elected as an MP in by election last year, led the inquiry along with fellow Labour MP Gloria De Piero, who worked as a presenter on GMTV before becoming a politician.Ms Brabin, whose best-known role was as single mother Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street from 1994 to 1997, said there was a ""diversity crisis on our stages and screens"".The report, commissioned by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, looked at what more could be done at school level to encourage young people to consider a career in the arts.It said that drama, and other related subjects, are often treated as inferior at some schools - and that students are sometimes discouraged from studying them.It also suggested there are poor drama facilities, few arts excursions and a lack of awareness about arts career opportunities in many schools.Ms Brabin, who also worked as a TV writer in her pre-political life, said: ""Our performing arts are some of the best in the world and they should represent our whole nation, not just a privileged section of it.""But the systematic eradication of arts education in schools, sky-high drama school audition fees, chronic low pay and a lack of diversity behind the scenes are all contributing to a diversity crisis on our stages and screens.""The publication of the report follows comments made by presenter Anita Rani last week, who said the pay gap among the BBC's top talent was as much about race and class as gender.A government spokesman said it was investing £300m between 2016 and 2020 to encourage young people to participate in music and arts.He said: ""We are completely committed to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to take part in arts and culture, including in schools.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Why Flea's memoir ends as the Red Hot Chili Peppers begin	Surviving violence at homeDiscovering music... and nudityBooks stopped him becoming a drug addictHe only had one lesson on the bassHe set up his own music schoolAnthony Kiedis is his best friend, and biggest antagonistThe Chili Peppers just wanted to make people laughOne last thing...	"From the very first chapter of his autobiography, Flea makes it clear he won't be telling a story of rock glory.Being famous, he explains, doesn't count for anything.Instead, the book is a coming of age tale, depicting a chaotic childhood full of fun, danger, misadventure and mayhem. The band that made him a megastar - The Red Hot Chili Peppers - only swerves into view as it reaches its final pages.""I thought if I wrote a book about the Chili Peppers, it'd be like cheating,"" the bassist tells the BBC.""But if I could write a book about my childhood that could exist on its own merits, without the band, then I deserved to write a book. That was the challenge I set for myself.""The result is Acid For The Children, a moving and frequently hilarious glimpse into his formative years; from the wreckage of his parents' first marriage and the explosive temper of his step-father; to the years he spent smoking weed, bunking off school and breaking into swimming pools.Flea thrived on the unpredictability, but felt untethered to the real world.""I looked for love in the faces of people I saw on the street,"" he writes.For people who know his stage persona - mouth pursed, elbows extended, head thrashing over the bass - the vulnerability of his writing may come as a surprise. But Flea emerges as a tender, big-hearted character. Tossed about by the currents of life, he always keeps his head above the water.Ahead of the book's publication, we caught up with Flea as he was ""petting a dog on the head and making a cup of tea"" at his home in LA, to examine some of the key passages.When Flea was 13, he returned home from trick-or-treating to find a group of kids running down the street in a panic.""They informed us that a scary man had gone crazy. He was firing a gun into the street and screaming like a crazed animal,"" he writes.When he got home, he flung open the front door to warn his parents about the mad man, only to find his step-father, Walter Urban Jr, slumped over a chair ""clad only in his underwear, blood smeared about his face and torso, a pistol by his side"".""That stuff was really scary, and it really did traumatise me,"" Flea tells the BBC about the violence that punctuated his childhood.""After some of those really traumatic episodes at my house, I would go to school the next day feeling hung over and in a daze, really upset. But when you're a kid, you don't see the forest for the trees. It's just your experience and you're trying to make sense of it.""So I just waited for that feeling to end, and I'd go play basketball or play in the band and hope for the best. But it was very difficult many a time.""Now 56 and a parent himself, the star says he's put those incidents behind him.""My parents were too wrapped up in their own pain to see what they were doing wrong,"" he says.""Going around holding grudges and resentments saps your spirit so, in a selfish way, for my own personal wellbeing and being the best dad I can, I need to forgive.""While home life was turbulent, it had some upsides. Walter was a musician, whose shelves were ""weighed down by hundreds of jazz albums""; and the house played host to a rotating cast of artists.""Bearing witness to these jazz musicians, playing in my house when I was a little kid, absolutely blew my head off,"" says Flea. ""It opened me up to something so rich and so beautiful and so alive and so infinite that it was the most remarkable gift.""The bohemian lifestyle had its quirks, too.""It was kind of like a naked house,"" he recalls. ""We'd all walk around naked.""I have an old friend, a childhood friend, who's like, 'Man, I remember going over to your house and your dad answered the door, and he was naked!'""He thought that was so wrong, man. He was like, 'This is a lunatic asylum' but for me, when I look back on it, that was the one healthy part of the whole thing.""With a cover photo that shows Flea, aged 12, smoking a joint, it's clear that the memoir won't shy away from the star's predilection for drugs.""LSD was good to me,"" opens one chapter. ""For someone like me, who was running crazy in the street, the drug got me to access my subconscious, to develop introspection.""He goes on to describe experiments with cocaine, speed, heroin and MDMA.Surprisingly, he says it was a love of books that ""stopped me from becoming a junkie or completely frying my brain"".""I'm not a really educated person, but I've always found great joy in reading,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's been a guardian angel for me.""I didn't get a lot of parenting at home, so it gave me a sense of ethics and exposed me to different ways of thinking. So I'd read every night... unless I was too wasted to do it.""Flea is one of the most influential bassists of his generation, with a syncopated-but-melodic style that combines funk, punk and hard rock.But he was originally a jazz trumpeter, who only picked up a guitar to help out his friend, Hillel Slovak.Hillel gave him one lesson, telling him to pluck the strings with two fingers ""alternately, like they were walking,"" and three weeks later, Flea made his stage debut with Anthym.""I've never been very technical,"" he explains. ""I came at it more from jamming and creating rhythms that were unlike anyone else's. I would be drooling because I was so lost in it.""He says the Chili Peppers approached songwriting in a similar way, prioritising instinct over songcraft, until guitarist John Frusciante joined them for their fourth album, Mother's Milk, in 1988.""Honestly, our songwriting really went up a level when John joined the band. He had a lyricism in his playing, but he also understood how to structure a song. I really learned a lot from him.""He may not have studied music formally, but the school marching band played a crucial role in Flea's story.""For me, a wild-assed street kid, the only reason I showed up to school was to play the trumpet,"" he says.But the year he graduated, a new law in California decimated school funding, with arts and music classes the earliest and biggest casualties. So, in 2001, Flea decided to open his own music school, the Silverlake Conservatory.""Music really saved my life as a kid, so I just wanted there to be a hub for kids to get together and play,"" he says.""They talk about school being the 'Three Rs,' - reading, writing and arithmetic, but at our school, we always talk about the 'Three As,' - academics, arts and athletics.""""I meet adults now who are like, 'Hey, when I was 12 years old, I went to your school and it changed my life'. That really means a lot to me.""Anthony Kiedis, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' wild-eyed frontman was, Flea says, his ""missing link"".""He was unlike anyone I had ever met,"" he writes. ""Among my friends, I was the guy who was always trying to do something that would freak people out. Then I met Anthony and he matched me step for step"".Their bond was watertight, but the relationship was stormy. Flea recalls one trip to Michigan where the duo started trading insults. ""It started out lightly and humorously, but became meaner and more personal, preying on each other's insecurities, doing our best to humiliate and hurt each other,"" he recalls.In his own autobiography, Scar Tissue, Kiedis called the relationship with Flea ""bizarre and sometimes dangerous"". So was the bassist wary of re-opening old wounds?""I hesitated to write it,"" the musician admits. ""Obviously I want to be respectful to him but this is the story, man.""When I look back, I can still feel all that pain - but in the end, that's the thing that makes our creative relationship what it is, do you know what I mean?""Flea's book ends in 1983, as the Chili Peppers play their first gig under the name Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem.With just one song in their repertoire (Out In LA), they fill the stage time by dancing to the Jonzun Crew's electro-funk hit Pack Jam.""When we started the band, everything was about what was funny to us,"" he explains. ""We really loved this song, so we came up with a dance routine in our living room, going, 'This would be so fun!'""And, you know, it was the most fulfilling experience, artistically, that I'd ever had in my life.""He says that, 36 years later, the band's goals are the same.""It goes through ups and downs and phases. There's times when it's gruelling work - but when we get those moments where it's hilarious and we're all tingling and laughing, it's the greatest thing in the world.""Flea didn't want to write a memoir at all. If he'd had his way, the star's first book would have been very different.""What I'd actually like to write is a fiction book about the life of whales. Like Watership Down, but for whales.""I've been thinking about it. I was just on a five-day backpacking trip and I was thinking about it the whole time.""Flea's book Acid For The Children is out now.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	More arts funding 'should go outside London'	Funding warningBudgets 'squeeze'	"Theatres, galleries and other cultural groups located outside London should get a bigger share of government arts funding, a committee of MPs has said.There should be a ""better regional balance"" in the grants, according to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee.They said it was easier for arts organisations in London to raise money through sponsorship and philanthropy.Arts Council England said it was increasing funding outside London.The body distributes government money in the form of annual funding to almost 700 venues and other arts organisations.""We agree that more needs to be done on increasing the proportion of our funding outside the capital,"" Arts Council chief executive Darren Henley said.A spokesperson said 56 percent of the Arts Council's annual government funding will be spent outside London 2017/18. This will rise to 60 percent in 2018/19.The Arts Council also distributes National Lottery money and said 75 percent of its Lottery pot would go outside the capital by 2018.Committee chair Damian Collins MP said there should be ""a greater appreciation of the cultural treasures and creative innovation to be found across the UK, and especially outside of London"".He added: ""Strong local leadership and innovation from regional arts and cultural organisations has produced some remarkable successes, but more needs to be done to avoid further closures of small museums and galleries, as funding from local authorities declines.""The report also said major national institutions should only get direct government subsidies if they support regional organisations, through lending exhibits, touring and mentoring.In its response to the report, the Local Government Association said councils had ""always been a vital part of this country's cultural landscape, spending over £1 billion a year on culture"".Cllr Ian Stephens, chair of the LGA's culture tourism and sport board, said councils were ""working more efficiently... to support cultural experiences and facilities through trusts or social enterprises, shared services [and] maximising income generation"".However, he continued, ""the squeeze on council budgets as a result of the £2.6bn social care funding gap by 2020 means councils will have to continue to divert more money from other local services, including cultural services, to try and plug growing social care funding gaps"".Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Gary Rhodes' life in pictures: Michelin stars, MasterChef and more		"Gary Rhodes, who has died at the age of 59, was one of Britain's most popular chefs on and off screen - showing his love of good British food on numerous TV shows, and winning Michelin stars for his restaurants.Rhodes grew up in Kent and began cooking at the age of 14, when his mother went back to work and asked him to cook his younger sister's dinners.His first kitchen job was at the Hilton in Amsterdam. While there, he was hit by a van and needed brain surgery, but he recovered and returned to England. He made his first TV appearance on Keith Floyd's Floyd on Britain and Ireland in 1988.His first full series for the BBC, Rhodes About Britain, was broadcast in 1994, and a second series followed a year later.Then came programmes like Open Rhodes, Gary Rhodes's New British Classics and Classic Rhodes.By the time he opened his first restaurant, City Rhodes in 1997, he was a household name, and his trademark spiky hair made him one of TV's most recognisable celebrity chefs.City Rhodes won its Michelin star within 12 months. In 1998 he opened Rhodes in the Square, in Pimlico, which also won a Michelin star.In 2001, the BBC chose Rhodes to take over as host of MasterChef from Lloyd Grossman, who had been at the helm for 10 years.But Rhodes' incarnation of the show lasted just one series before being cancelled. It was later relaunched - without Rhodes - in 2005.His other TV shows included Gary Rhodes at the Table, Cookery Year and Rhodes Across India, while he published more than 20 cookbooks.He often said he disliked the reputation he had among some food writers (""all this cheekie-chappie rubbish""), which was embodied by his spiky hair. But he said: ""I think it wouldn't matter if I changed my hairstyle tomorrow, they wouldn't like the next hairstyle either.""When Rhodes was made an OBE for services to the hospitality industry in 2006, he said the honour was more exciting than receiving a Michelin star.""As a young lad growing up you would hear about these people getting these honours and think how proud they must feel. I never thought something like this would happen,"" he said.He took part in the sixth series of Strictly Come Dancing in 2008, partnered with Karen Hardy. But his dancing wasn't quite up to the standard of his cooking - they were the third couple to be voted off.He's pictured here on St George's Day 2009 with Boris Johnson - then mayor of London, now prime minister. Rhodes is wielding a bread and butter pudding, and once said he was most proud of redeeming the humble dish's reputation.He's pictured with fellow chefs Heston Blumenthal (left) and Michel Roux Jr (centre), who were judging chefs competing to win a Roux Scholarship in 2009.He championed tomatoes on BBC Two's Great British Food Revival in 2012.Rhodes' family said he died on Tuesday in Dubai, which had become his home and where he ran two restaurants.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Katie Price declared bankrupt at High Court	The life and times of Katie PriceWhat is bankruptcy?	"Katie Price has been declared bankrupt in a hearing at the High Court, which was told she had failed to stick to a plan to repay her debts.The former model and reality TV star was not present at the London hearing.Last year, Price, 41, came to an arrangement with her creditors for a repayment plan known as an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA).But the insolvency practitioner overseeing her IVA said she had failed to keep to the terms of the agreement.Now that she's been made bankrupt, the Official Receiver will take control of her financial affairs and property.Price, who lives in West Sussex, found fame in the 1990s as a glamour model under the name Jordan and was once said to be worth more than £40m.As Jordan, she was famed for her breast enlargement surgery and was a frequent face on the front of lads' magazines.Modelling wasn't the only string to her bow. In 2001, she stood as an MP, offering free breast implants on the NHS - but that wasn't enough to persuade voters.She branched out into publishing, with books such as Being Jordan, and dabbled in fashion. She appeared in TV shows such as Footballers' Wives and starred in the 2004 series of I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!It was on the ITV jungle show that she met her future husband, the pop star Peter Andre. After they split, she went on to marry Alex Reid in 2010, and then Kieran Hayler in 2013. She and Hayler are reported to be planning to divorce.Price was crowned the winner of Celebrity Big Brother in 2015, and she has been praised for her work as an anti-bullying campaigner, which began when her son Harvey was targeted for his disabilities.But it has been a difficult couple of years for the star. She went into rehabilitation last year to tackle drug and alcohol abuse, and earlier this year was convicted of driving while nearly twice the legal alcohol limit.In the summer, she admitted shouting a ""tirade of abuse"" at her ex-husband's new partner in a school playground and was fined £415.Last month, she was one of three celebrities who had Instagram posts advertising diet products banned by the Advertising Standards Authority.She is now seen on the reality show My Crazy Life on the Quest Red channel and has a clothing range named after her daughters Princess and Bunny.Someone can file for bankruptcy as a way of escaping overwhelming debt. An Official Receiver takes charge of their finances and assets, such as their house, and may use them to pay off their debts.The bankrupt person will be under certain restrictions, eg not being able to apply for credit of more than £500 without telling the lender about their bankruptcy. It usually ends after a year, after which most debts are written off and they can make a fresh start.As well as voluntarily filing for bankruptcy, a person can be made bankrupt if they have not paid their debts.An Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA) - which freezes someone's debts and allows them to pay them back over a set period - is one alternative to bankruptcy. But one route to being made bankrupt is if a person has broken the terms of their IVA, as the High Court heard that Price had done.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Pussycat Dolls: How 'the stars aligned' for a reunion	'Fashion forward'	"The Pussycat Dolls reunion was supposed to be top secret.Rumours had been swirling for several months, but journalists were under instruction not to confirm anything ahead of the group's surprise reunion performance on X Factor: Celebrity this weekend.Louis Walsh, however, may have missed the memo.""You know who's coming on? The Pussycat Dolls are the special guests!"" he told Lorraine Kelly during a live TV interview on Monday. ""There's an exclusive for you. They're back together.""The pussycat was firmly out of the bag.""Half the time, Louis doesn't even know what he's talking about, so I was just surprised he got that one right,"" laughs his co-judge Nicole Scherzinger, lead singer of the Dolls.""You could see in his face though,"" adds Carmit Bachar. ""After he said it, he was like 'did I just drop the ball?'""It's now been officially announced that Nicole and Carmit, along with Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt and Jessica Sutta, are all set to return for nine live UK shows in April 2020.""It's been a few years in the making,"" explains Kimberly. ""But I think ultimately there's some unfinished business with the Pussycat Dolls.""We're ready to get out there and do what we love. And the stars aligned. We've all been busy making babies and all those kinds of things,"" she adds (before Nicole interjects: ""Speak for yourself!"").The Dolls broke up relatively early, in 2010, having released just two albums. And it's not as if their star was fading at the time they split.They'd scored number one hits in the UK with Stickwitu and Don't Cha, while Jai Ho, Beep, Buttonz and When I Grow Up all hit the top 10 over their five years together.Nonetheless, the group splintered off for various solo projects, but all have kept strong links with the UK.Kimberly now lives in London with her British husband. Ashley appeared on Strictly and I'm A Celebrity and now presents on Heart radio. Nicole has performed in the West End, judged on X Factor and topped the UK singles chart with one of her solo hits, Don't Hold Your Breath.""LA was our home, but the UK was our second home because the British just scooped us up,"" says Ashley. ""So our lives ended up here as well, some of us, so the fans have just been holding on strong with wanting this reunion and our biggest fanbase is over here.""One member - Melody Thornton - is notably absent from the reunion, amid suggestions that she was requesting a larger share of the singing parts. Nicole sang 95% of the group's vocals across their first two albums, by her own admission.Speaking to VH1's Behind The Music in 2012, producer Ron Fair confirmed: ""Melody sang a bit here and there but the records were Nicole, with the exception of an occasional ad lib. They were Nicole.""As a result, Melody has often spoken about feeling under-used as a singer during her time with the group.""They said, 'we're going to have Nicole do all of the recording, you're going to have to learn to dance with the rest of the girls',"" Melody explained earlier this year when she was in the UK for Dancing on Ice.""And for me it really affected my confidence because I wasn't using my best asset [my voice]. And I was the weakest dancer.""Explaining her absence from the reunion tour, Ashley says: ""Mel's got a lot of projects going on in life.""She was included in all of this, she's our sister, the door is always open, but it just wasn't the right timing for her right now. We wish her well.""The Dolls avoid the question of whether the vocals will be divided up more evenly this time around - which, to be fair, could just be down to the fact they haven't started rehearsals yet.But Nicole says: ""This is a tour that we've never created, so we're really excited. Everybody brings their own unique gifts to the table.""We're just going to push each other, we want to see each other shine, we're going to push the boundaries together as a group with each other, so everybody is going to have their own time to shine.""She breezes past any suggestion that there is disharmony within the group. ""We're not famous for that are we? We get along, it's a sisterhood, we love each other, we have the best chemistry,"" she says. ""We feed off each other, and if we ever have an issue, we've always been open about communication and talking it through.""Naturally, when you're so close, there may be some disagreements, some arguments. But that's the beauty, what makes you stronger. We've evolved so much. Like, bye drama! We want this to be really enjoyable for us.""The Dolls were known for their suggestive outfits and dancing, which occasionally landed them in trouble. A company who booked them for a gig in Malaysia in 2006 was fined after authorities objected to their sexually explicit dancing.Culturally, things have shifted a little since then. Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret announced last week they were dropping their annual fashion show amid criticism it was sexist and outdated.With that in mind, will the Dolls change any of their image or choreography?""It's evolved, but we are the Pussycat Dolls and we stand together in having fun on stage and embracing our female bodies, whatever shape they may be in,"" says Ashley.""And I think that will continue, fashion has evolved and we get to have fun and play and getting dressed up is what the Dolls is about.""Nicole adds: ""We're excited about being fashion forward. We'll be taking a lot of inspiration from the runways. We really love what Dua [Lipa] has been doing with fashion, so it's going to be the best of both worlds. But danceable!""The sexually suggestive image is a nod to the Dolls' roots as a burlesque dance troupe. The group, which was founded by Robin Antin in 1995, attracted a huge following in Hollywood, with stars like Britney Spears, Pink and Carmen Electra joining them on stage.Nicole was recruited after auditioning for talent show Popstars to sing the lead vocals (although British singer VV Brown claimed she performed all the backing vocals, not the other Dolls).Chart success and headline world tours soon followed. This time around, the five-piece are keen to ensure they savour and enjoy the whole experience.""It was such a whirlwind,"" Ashley recalls of their rise to fame. ""It was all just going, going, going, and it's hard to stay present within it and have gratitude for that present moment.""But I think with us maturing over the last 10 years and all the life experience that's happened, we can hopefully bring that in and stay within the moment and enjoy it.""The tour could potentially be the first of several new Dolls projects, according to Nicole. ""We're working on new music. But we're doing one thing at a time. We're together, we're focusing, we've got a massive performance [on X Factor] at the end of this week, which is huge for us, and then we're all focusing on the tour.""She adds how much of a relief it is to once again be surrounded by her bandmates after pursuing her own projects for so long. This year alone, Nicole has judged on The Masked Singer, Australia's Got Talent and X Factor: Celebrity.""I feel blessed because I'm doing all these different shows, different continents, and these press days, it's so much more fun and way easier with the girls 'cause I'm like, 'we got this!'""It's so much easier I think, and it's jogging our memories a lot.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Celebrity fraud: FBI hunt for 'Con Queen of Hollywood'		"The FBI says it is searching for victims of the so-called ""Con Queen of Hollywood"", who has been offering bogus entertainment jobs abroad.The perpetrator impersonated the likes of Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, offering fake jobs that often require up-front payments.According to the New York Times, about 100 victims have been spoken to, with losses of between $3,000 and $150,000.The FBI say the scam has been going on since 2013.In a press release, the FBI said victims, including stunt performers, writers and make-up artists, are ""contacted by text, email, or phone... and are told the job requires travel to Indonesia, typically Jakarta, for a so-called trial run of their services.""When they arrive in Indonesia, the victims are met by a driver and are pressured into providing US currency for the driver's services. The victims are asked to continue to pay for other services and fees until the trip is completed or they realise they are the victim of a scam.""The victims are not reimbursed for the cost of the travel or paid for their services while in Indonesia.""The FBI asks victims to submit a questionnaire about their experiences, in the hope of finally finding the perpetrator.According to the Hollywood Reporter, the con artist also has been leading people into sexually charged phone conversations, with no apparent financial motive.In April, Victoria Alonso, executive vice president of production at Marvel, discovered a scammer was using her identity to conduct explicit telephone auditions with aspiring actors.She told the Hollywood Reporter: ""People need to understand that this is not what Marvel or I would ever do.""It's a horrible, horrible thing. I've had an unimpeachable 30-year career. That somebody is claiming I have done these things - I've spent many, many sleepless nights.""Actor Brandon Wengrzynek told the trade paper that he was lured to engage in sexually explicit role-play in order to convince the con artist of his acting ability.On that occasion, the ""Con Queen"" was pretending to be casting director Sarah Finn, who worked on Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther.He said he went along with it until he found it too uncomfortable and alarm bells started ringing.""She was absolutely convincing,"" Wengrzynek told Hollywood Reporter.""It just blows my mind how professional the whole thing is.""Wengrzynek then contacted a friend to try to verify the job offer and discovered it was fake.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Orville and Emu: British TV's famous puppets go on sale		"Two of British TV's most famous puppets - Orville the Duck and Emu - are going on sale at auction.Orville, a cheeky green duckling wearing a nappy, was a regular on television during the 1980s and 1990s, alongside ventriloquist Keith Harris.Harris and Orville's success followed in the footsteps of comic Rod Hull's chaotic act with mischievous bird, Emu.Each of the puppets is expected to fetch up to £10,000 when they go under the hammer in London next month.Harris became a household name thanks to the BBC programme The Keith Harris Show - on which Orville became a stand-out act.At the peak of their popularity in the 1980s, Harris released a number of singles with the puppet - including Orville's Song (""I wish I could fly"") which got to number four in the single charts.Harris and Orville continued to make guest appearances on shows including Never Mind the Buzzcocks, Louis Theroux and Shameless before Harris appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in 2012.He was diagnosed with cancer of the spleen in 2013, and died two years later aged 67.Hull's Emu act was best known for the attacks his puppet launched against celebrities during guest appearances and their own BBC series Emu's Broadcasting Company.His victims included Michael Parkinson, Snoop Dogg and the Queen Mother.Hull died in 1999 after falling off the roof of his cottage while adjusting his TV aerial. He was 63 years old.Orville and Emu go on sale at Bonhams on 17 December.The auction house says the Emu on sale is ""the original puppet owned and used by Rod Hull during his television and stage career"" and was acquired from his estate in the early 2000s.The Orville puppet was acquired from Keith Harris in the early 2000s and is described as ""an original puppet owned and used"" by the ventriloquist during his career."

Traditionally, the sadder the film, the more money it makes, but I'm sure there must be a solution where you show such radiant joy and success that that would encourage you to give more money.""Asked by MPs how Comic Relief would operate in the future, he replied that the charity was ""at a very interesting moment"" in learning lessons from successful online fundraising campaigns.""We're not strong on that yet,"" he said. ""I imagine as we go into this new future, that will not be based on celebrities going abroad. I suspect we will start that new initiative not going that way.""And then on the TV, I think we have to do what we think is best, and I think it will be heading in the direction of not using [celebrities abroad], and particularly being very careful to give voices to people abroad.""He said Comic Relief had not acted ""robustly"" to the criticism over the Dooley film because it was focused on raising money at the time.In response, Labour MP Mr Lammy wrote on Twitter: ""Looks like Comic Relief are finally ready to listen to hundreds of thousands of my constituents and others who support aid but want to move on from the tired, harmful stereotypes and tropes that surround it and prevent genuine equity and partnership.""Kelsey Nielsen of pressure group No White Saviours, who works in Uganda, said Comic Relief had pledged to make such changes in the past, and now needs to put them into practice.It needs to stop ""continuing this narrative that Africa is in need of the great white saviour and the great white influencers to come in,"" she told BBC News.Charities shouldn't stop sending people to Africa, but should do it in a way that's not ""manipulative or coercive"", she added. ""It's not about not helping and not caring, it's about the way it should be done.""It's almost that idea that Africans should just be thankful for whatever help they get. That has a lot to do with the root of how we view each other.

entertainment	Michael Jackson doc director challenges 'cult of celebrity'	'I salute their courage'Reed vs the Jacksons'The cult of celebrity'	"""The cult of celebrity is pernicious and it leads people to go blind and parents to do stupid things,"" says Dan Reed, director of a new Michael Jackson documentary.His film, Leaving Neverland, first made headlines in January, when it was considered so graphic that mental health professionals had to be on hand at a screening.Showing at Sundance Festival, the four-hour film featured the testimonies of Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say they were sexually abused by the singer as young boys in the 1990s.The Jackson estate has denied the allegations and made a number of attempts to discredit the film, calling it ""an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in"" after the singer's 2009 death.But Reed tells the BBC he hopes his film will ""make parents think twice about trusting strangers and will make people think twice about idolising a celebrity"".With a week until its release on Channel 4, Reed has spoken about the power of the testimonies of Robson, 36 and Safechuck, 40.He says it took ""a period of time"" to believe them both.""I interviewed Wade for three days and James for two days.""It's the cumulative impression that they made, how open they were, how consistent their accounts were, how nothing that I discovered later when I did in-depth research contradicted what they said.""Reed says he also spent a lot of time looking into the cases of Jordan Chandler and Gavin Arvizo, who brought legal action against Jackson whilst he was alive in 1993 and 2004.Chandler's case was settled out of court, whilst Jackson was found not guilty on all charges during Arvizo's case.Reed continued: ""There was also plenty of evidence in sworn statements by members of Jackson's staff, etc, that corroborated aspects of what they [Robson and Wade] told me.""There's a huge amount of work we did over two years to try and test everything that they said and I never found anything that cast any doubt.""As part of the documentary, the families of Robson and Safechuck were interviewed, including their mothers, fathers and siblings.Their interviews detail from the first time the boys met Jackson - Robson at a concert in Australia and Safechuck at a Pepsi commercial shoot - up until the present day.Reed says ""the accounts of their [Wade and James] mothers and families were also very consistent and supported everything they said.""He added: ""I found the mothers entirely believable as well.""I mean, for a mum to go on the record and admit that she had delivered her child into the clutches of a predatory paedophile is not a nice thing to have to admit for any mum.""I salute their courage in sitting down and laying bare how they felt when telling you the whole story.""""I can't imagine any circumstances in which a mother would sit down and make that up - it's the most humiliating, appalling thing to have to admit as a mother you were in the next room while someone was raping your child for years and years.""Reed also says he had the same feeling about Wade and James too, and said ""you wouldn't make up such graphic, sexual descriptions"" when describing their sexual encounters with Jackson.As boys, they both spent time at Jackson's Neverland ranch, claiming that they had shared beds with the singer.""If they weren't said with such dignity, these things would be deeply humiliating for a grown man,"" he added.HBO, who made the film in partnership with Channel 4, are currently being sued by the Michael Jackson estate for breaking a reputation clause in an old contract.The family maintain that Jackson is innocent and has been proven so in a court of law.Reed says that when making the film, he had ""no contact with the estate or the family before making the film"".""The views of Jackson and the views of his lawyers, and their rebuttals, their denials are plentifully represented in the film,"" he adds.""We've given a lot of space to allow them to deny and we've even put fans in saying horrible things about Wade.""We consider that we've given their views plenty of space and adequate representation in the film, it's not a one sided film at all and you can see the Jackson side.""They still deny that any sexual abuse took place and that view hasn't changed since the last time I checked.""When Jermaine Jackson was asked about the film on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he asked people around the world to ""let this man rest"" and said his family were ""tired"" of defending Michael.Reed's response to this was to say ""we're not digging up Michael Jackson"".""What we're doing is telling the stories of two of his victims and they're very much alive and well. They deserve to have their say and to be heard.""I think the #MeToo movement has changed the landscape - the family has hit out in a very old-fashioned way, which is to say it's all about money.""They haven't received a penny, nor will they - they have no financial interest whatsoever in the film and we never offered any.""In light of this film being released, comparisons have been made with the allegations that have faced singer R Kelly.The singer has been accused of sexually abusing a number of women, with some underage. But for the large part his music has remained popular despite such allegations, which he has denied.Reed says that the reason people like Jackson and Kelly have not been scrutinised is because ""people are dazzled by talent and status, wealth, reputation"".He adds: ""Especially when you're very young and your idol is an incredible dancer or singer, you translate their talent into goodness, you translate their talent into the type of human being they are.""You assume that they're a nice person and unfortunately that is not the case.""We have to be more sceptical and we have to challenge fame, celebrity and power more than we have in the past.""Leaving Neverland will air on Channel 4 on the 6th and 7th of March.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Emma Thompson selfie: What's the etiquette for photos with celebrities?	'Selfies are a duty'	"Dame Emma Thompson is said to have been ""horrified"" to learn a waiter lost his job for asking for a selfie with her. The story raises questions about the correct etiquette when it comes to photos with celebrities (and brings back memories for one BBC reporter).When most of us go out for a meal, we generally want to spend a leisurely evening catching up with friends over a nice glass of wine.So you can understand why some celebrities get irritated when fans disturb them to ask for photos, just as they're tucking into their main course.While most actors and pop stars are all too happy to meet and take selfies with fans on red carpets and at premieres, the rules of engagement are slightly more hazy when it comes to their personal lives, as one waiter found out last weekend.Dame Emma Thompson was eating out at the five-star Brown's Hotel in Mayfair, according to The Sunday Times, when a waiter approached her and asked for a picture. Thompson politely declined - saying she didn't want to impose on her fellow guests and spoil the atmosphere.The next day, the waiter was suspended from his job, having apparently broken the hotel's strict protocol.But when The Sunday Times told Dame Emma of this development, she phoned the manager of the hotel and urged Brown's to reinstate the waiter.The hotel's managing director Stuart Johnson told BBC News: ""Caring for the privacy and wellbeing of both team members and guests, we are unable to make further comment on this matter.""The story had particular resonance for this reporter - although my anecdote fortunately didn't lose me my job.In 2005, I was working as a waiter in a branch of Frankie & Benny's in South Queensferry, just outside Edinburgh.This was my first proper job out of high school and several years before I became an entertainment reporter for BBC News.One Tuesday in December, during the mid-afternoon lull between the lunch and dinner services, five excitable female customers walked through the door and sat themselves at a table with their small entourage.They were our only customers in the whole restaurant. I was sitting at the bar on my lunch break at this point so a colleague of mine, Lisa, went to take their drinks order.""That's Girls Aloud,"" she said casually as she came up to the bar to make their drinks. I assumed she was joking but turned round to take a proper look at the table and immediately realised she wasn't.We found out later the girlband had just done a signing at a nearby HMV (again, it was 2005) and were popping in for some food on their way back to Edinburgh airport.I just about fell off my chair with excitement. As a massive pop fan, I knew I had to get a photo with Girls Aloud before they left.But how?This was the age before smartphones, remember, and most people didn't carry cameras around with them. So I did what any normal Girls Aloud fan in 2005 would do - called my mum and told her in no uncertain terms to race up to the restaurant with her digital camera.She did so in record time (I spent extra money on her Christmas present that year), before Girls Aloud had finished their main course.I waited for my moment, after their manager had paid the bill, and asked if I could have a photo before they left. Luckily, they were happy to oblige.I had a quick chat with them (Nicola Roberts suggested the chicken she'd had should've been served with gravy by default - a fair point) before they said goodbye and headed to the airport.My picture with them ended up in the local paper, and for the next few weeks customers would make comments to me like 'shame we weren't here on the Girls Aloud day!'Far from being fired from my job, my then managers were delighted with the publicity from the Queensferry Gazette, but then again this particular branch of Frankie & Benny's wasn't quite as exclusive as Brown's Hotel in Mayfair.In a high-class venue such as that, asking for photos with guests is said to be grounds for a disciplinary, and the restaurant was within its rights to suspend the waiter who had spoken to Dame Emma.But the story has sparked a debate about whether or not celebrities should pose for selfies with the public when they're going about their private lives.""Smiling for selfies is a duty,"" Judge Rinder said on Sunday, after the Dame Emma story emerged.""It's part of the deal for the privileges and perks that celebrity brings. Asking nicely matters of course but by doing very little, you get to improve the chemistry of somebody's day. Celebrities who grumble about it might consider getting a real job.""""Those ego-crazed celebrities who refuse to pose for photos should remember they're ONLY celebrities because of the public that pays to watch them,"" agreed Piers Morgan.Some celebrities have found a halfway house. After recent performances of his one-man show, Sir Ian McKellen posed for selfies with audience members while collecting donations in a bucket, with the funds going towards the upkeep of the theatre.But other celebrities, such as Meryl Streep, more fondly recall the autograph era, where it didn't matter whether or not you had your best face on.Speaking to The Sunday Times in 2015, Dame Maggie Smith said: ""What's awful is it used to be just autographs, but now everyone wants photographs. There's nothing like privacy, but nobody will have that soon. Nobody's private any more.""Many restaurants and private members' clubs ban photos of any kind in order to make their guests as comfortable as possible.""Our members' privacy is very important, so please don't bother anyone you don't know. Posting about fellow members on social media is not allowed either,"" Soho House's rules state, for example.Clean Bandit's Grace Chatto was once ejected from Soho House Berlin for requesting a selfie with David Beckham and then posting it online.The house rules at Annabel's are slightly more nuanced: ""Photography within the club and posting to social media should be discreet and not involve or feature other members and their guests.""Many exclusive parties attended by A-list celebrities ban photos entirely, such as the party Beyonce and Jay-Z held after the Oscars this year.""As you go down the stairs, they have a sign that says 'this is the last picture you'll take'. No phones, no social media, no nothing,"" Emilia Clarke told Graham Norton on Friday. ""And then you get in and you're like 'oh, that's why. This is hallowed ground.'""Mark Stephens, a solicitor specialising in media law, told BBC Breakfast: ""I travel around with celebrities a lot, and frankly if you're in that kind of private space, then it's probably inappropriate.""We have a 'red carpet rule'. So if they're in a public space, and they're doing a job, then in those circumstances of course, ask and they will do a selfie with you. But if they're on an airplane or out for dinner with their family, then it can be very disruptive.""My advice to people is, if you want a selfie with someone famous in a restaurant, wait by the door when they leave, and they're likely to give you one on the way out, as long as you haven't interrupted their evening.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

""I hadn't even actually got into my stride.""Edmonds joined the ITV reality show three days after the rest of the campmates, vowing to retire from the TV industry if he won.But viewers didn't want that outcome - and voted him out after just nine days in the jungle, despite the entertainment provided by his burgeoning friendship with football manager Harry Redknapp.Edmonds joked: ""As Harry Redknapp would say, the boy was hardly on the pitch and he didn't even get a yellow. He got a straight red and he was off.""So, yeah, I was surprised, and then I was disappointed, and then I felt a bit down, and then people have just been wonderful.""He thanked fans for the warm reception since his eviction. He said: ""I'm not complaining now that it's happened. I have to accept the public have spoken.""He added that he was glad to be reunited with wife Liz, saying: ""We're back together, having to really, really put up with a five-star hotel, 30C today, we're right by the edge of the pool. It's tough.""Edmonds also responded to reports about a feud with the show's co-host Holly Willoughby and suggestions that he held a grudge against Ant and Dec for apparently copying elements of Noel's House Party while they were developing Saturday Night Takeaway.""There's no feud with Holly or Philip [Schofield, her This Morning co-host],"" Edmonds said.""One particular newspaper has been trying to make out that I'm in some way jealous of Ant & Dec's success. The truth of the matter is they had me on [their show] as the Overlord.""I know some people don't like it, but we all do get on very well.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Nolan took a break from the show and cancelled all her other work after the clash.Other TV shows to receive complaints included Sky News, Emmerdale and Coronation Street.An episode of Love Island, in which Dani Dyer became visibly distressed when shown footage of boyfriend Jack being housed with an ex-girlfriend, also attracted complaints.If his reaction to topping last year's chart is anything to go by, Piers Morgan will be disappointed that Good Morning Britain was only in seventh place this year.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Celebrity Big Brother: Ryan Thomas named winner	'It scared me''Time to think'	"Ryan Thomas has been named winner of Celebrity Big Brother after a controversial series that has seen walk-outs and thousands of complaints.They were sparked by an incident between Thomas and Roxanne Pallett, in which the former Emmerdale star claimed to have been repeatedly punched.She accused ex-Coronation Street actor Thomas of deliberately hurting her, but later admitted she got it wrong.Thomas said he had feared he would get a call from police over the incident.He appeared shocked and shook his head as he left the house, telling host Emma Willis he was ""overwhelmed"".Thomas was shown footage from the incident with Pallett - which Big Brother bosses had described as ""almost play-fighting"" - describing her reaction as ""totally unexpected"".""It was a sign of affection... there was nothing in it,"" he said.""As it unravelled, as it became bigger and bigger, then it scared me.""We all know how something like that can stick on a man,"" he added, saying: ""I just wanted out.""I felt I was going to be getting a call from the police for doing something untowards to a woman. And that's not me.""I was glad we had 24-hour surveillance on us, because the point was proven.""Thomas, who starred as Jason Grimshaw in Coronation Street, had been the bookies' favourite to win the Channel 5 reality show, followed by US star Kirstie Alley. She was the runner-up.Pallett apologised to Thomas in a number of interviews after quitting the show.In a TV interview on the Jeremy Vine show, she said: ""I massively apologise to Ryan, his friends and fans and every single person who watched that.""[It was] an overreaction to what wasn't a malicious act.""I was sensitive and emotional and mistook what was playful - I apologise for it, I shouldn't have questioned his motivation.""More than 11,000 complaints have been made to Ofcom.

""I've been trying to rebuild my reputation since.""Osborne was shocked to learn none of the other contestants had nominated him during the series. He told Willis he had found it difficult not being able to speak to his children, saying he had just wanted to make his family proud.He said he had wanted to show who he really was, after a scandal in 2015 when he was heard making threats to a former girlfriend in leaked recordings.""It gave me a lot of time to think about how I can better everything in my life,"" he added.Thirteen people had entered the Big Brother house on 16 August for the latest instalment of the reality TV show.While most of the former contestants attended the final, Pallett was not present.

I'll be at home with everyone else, having a glass of wine, watching it as everyone else is.""Willoughby presented the latest series of the show alongside long-running host, Declan Donnelly, following the conviction of his presenting partner Ant McPartlin for drink-driving offences.Despite some tepid reviews of her debut - with Sean O'Grady at The Independent comparing Dec and Holly to ""a couple who've finally decided to get married, but realise a few months in that they might have made a terrible mistake"" - Willoughby proved a hit with viewers.An average of 10.9 million people tuned in to the final episode of the show, to watch former Tottenham football manager Harry Redknapp be crowned king of the jungle.While McPartlin has taken time off from TV presenting to attend rehab, he is expected to return to screens in the new year, with plans to film Britain's Got Talent auditions in January.As for Willoughby, her co-host on This Morning - Phillip Schofield - has shared a picture of the pair at the Natural History Museum ice rink, saying: ""We're back together"".We’re back together 😊😊 @dancingonice launch 2019A post shared by Phillip Schofield (@schofe) on Dec 18, 2018 at 9:01am PSTEnd of Instagram post by schofe"

Get Me Out Of Here!, overnight ratings show.The ex-Tottenham and West Ham manager beat fellow finalists Emily Atack and John Barrowman on the ITV reality show.He was a popular winner and the programme itself has been a hit this year, with an average of 10.8 million watching Sunday's final live.Those are the highest ratings the show's final has had for five years.Another 170,000 watched on ITV+1. Last year, an average of 9.2 million watched live to see Georgia ""Toff"" Toffolo crowned.Redknapp became the show's oldest ever winner at 71 and said it was ""so surreal"" to emerge victorious.""My grandkids will be jumping around the living room now. They'll be so excited,"" he said after being crowned.He said he didn't think he would survive so long in the show, and praised his campmates for being ""amazing"" and pulling him through.While he has a ""very happy home life"", he added that football can be a ""lonely business"" and the show had ""taught me how to laugh again"".But he admitted he had struggled with the meagre rations - and unusual foods - and that he thought the contestants would get well-fed with a ""nice bit of grub"" every night.Host Holly Willoughby said more than 11 million votes were cast in this year's final.""Harry was the favourite all the way though,"" TV critic Emma Bullimore told BBC Radio 5 Live.""With all of his little idiosyncrasies and little catchphrases, he was absolutely brilliant entertainment value and a very worthy winner.""There was no game plan, there was no pretence, he was just himself.

I came into this with a bit of a difficult start to the year.""I didn't really know what I was doing and where I wanted to go and this place has just given me so me so much self-acceptance.""Willoughby made the actress promise to never cover up her freckles again, after Atack said: ""This is my skin, this is my hair - this is what I look like.""Barrowman came in third place, and said I'm a Celebrity had been one of the best experiences of his life.The actor and singer appeared emotional as he told Willoughby and Donnelly: ""I can't tell you how happy I am.""This year's contestants have been put through a series of Bushtucker trials involving snakes, cockroaches and other creatures.They've also had to negotiate assault courses blindfolded, bake cakes while plastered in treacle and climb through ""sickening sewers"" in order to win food and other necessities.The trio had to each carry out a final trial in order to win treats for their last supper together, after 23 days in the jungle.Barrowman had to eat a range of gruesome items like worms, a dead spider, goats' eyes and a bull's penis.Atack had to wear a helmet filled with insects while Redknapp's trial saw him trapped in an underground chamber while rats and bugs ran over him in the pitch black.The former football manager was the bookies' favourite to win this year's series, despite having never watched the show before.After leaving the show and being shown his highlights, he said: ""Great show, innit?""Many viewers agreed. Lots thought it was one of the best series in the show's 16-year history, and Redknapp was one of the most popular winners.Ten celebrities headed into the Australian jungle in November, where they were later joined by Noel Edmonds.In the absence of his normal partner Ant McPartlin, Declan Donnelly hosted the show with Willoughby.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

We wonder who will be the house's head chef?This swanky lounge would give even the Love Island villa a run for its money.And we can imagine this pair of orange armchairs will be a hot spot for all the gossip.Millennial pink has also entered the Big Brother house this year, in the form of this plush, poolside boudoir which we're sure the more glamorous housemates will appreciate.With a second heatwave on its way to the UK, the celebrities will be able to cool off in the pool and sip on something from the brand new poolside bar or alternatively, the celebs could opt to have a soak in the heated hot tub.This year's bathroom is fitted with a chic bathtub and surrounded by a quirky flamingo wallpaper, carrying on the house's tropical theme.There is also a lot of soft furnishings, which we suspect means the bathroom will be another prime spot for gossiping and conspiring!

entertainment	I'm A Celebrity: Noel Edmonds isn't allowed in bus lanes, says council	'How the other half live''Not a touch on bushtucker trials'	"Noel Edmonds claimed on I'm A Celebrity that he has a tactic for beating traffic - driving in bus lanes.The Deal or No Deal presenter said he originally drove a black cab to get to and from work more quickly, before upgrading to a bus after getting a ticket for using the wrong lane.""Bristol traffic is chaotic,"" he told the ITV1 show.But Bristol Council has now said their bus lanes are only for licensed buses - ""not celebrities"".Noel - who became the first contestant voted off the show on Friday night - said his wife Liz initially bought him a black cab and that, by driving in bus lanes, he shaved an hour off his commute.While he said this was ""totally legal"", he told campmates on the jungle-based reality show that after the council installed CCTV in bus lanes, he got a ticket.""So having got the ticket, I didn't take my cab in the bus lane,"" he said. ""I did what any sane person would do. I bought a bus. I've a Routemaster bus.""""How the other half live,"" commented fellow competitor Fleur East - echoing the thoughts of many others on social media who were surprised at his admission.The 69-year-old added: ""One of the extraordinary things about licensing in the UK is that you can drive it on a car licence, as long as there are no more than nine people on board.""That's correct - as confirmed by the DVLA. While they said they couldn't advise specifically on an individual driver or vehicle, passenger-carrying vehicles can be driven by anyone using a category B car driving licence.That's as long as the vehicle is at least 30 years old, isn't carrying more than eight passengers (as Noel said), and isn't being used for reward or hire.However, if he's using it in Bristol's bus lanes as he insinuated, he may not be able to do so any longer.A Bristol City Council spokesman told the BBC: ""While the penalties we issue aren't a touch on bushtucker trials, our bus lanes are just for licensed buses, taxis and cyclists, not celebrities.""The council's bus lanes are monitored by CCTV cameras, with any motorist using a bus lane illegally issued with a penalty charge notice.The council said their bus lanes are ""placed strategically to try and improve journey times around the city and we ask that people abide by the law"".Noel may have more luck if he moves house however, because whether or not a bus is allowed in a bus lane (without paying passengers, that is) depends on where in the country that bus lane is - different areas have different rules.Transport for London, for example, said normally all buses are allowed on the city's roads as long as a bus has nine seats for passengers, plus the driver's seat.""There is no regulation on whether it's a public/private bus or whether the passengers have paid,"" a spokeswoman said.Noel isn't the first famous person to use an unusual mode of transport - the Duke of Edinburgh had his own black cab for many years, to allow him to travel inconspicuously."

entertainment	Celebrity Big Brother 2018: Who's in the house?	Gabby AllenDan OsborneRoxanne PallettKirstie AlleySally MorganRodrigo AlvesChloe AylingRyan ThomasJermaine PennantHardeep Singh KohliNatalie NunnNick LeesonBen Jardine	"Celebrity Big Brother is back - and the latest line-up includes soap stars, reality show veterans, a Hollywood actress and a former footballer - but despite the rumours, there is no sign of Stormy Daniels (as yet...).This year's theme is ""eye of the storm"" and viewers who had been expecting to see the adult film star - who has had a legal battle with US president Donald Trump - were teased with a presidential-themed task on the opening night.While the show's viewing figures aren't anything like what they used to be, Channel 5 as always is promising surprises as the series unfolds.Let's take a look at the new housemates:If you're still suffering withdrawal symptoms from Love Island, its 2017 star Gabby Allen will be a sight for sore eyes.Since leaving the villa, she and former boyfriend and Blazin' Squad star Marcel Somerville have broken up.From finding love in one home televised across the nation, to moving on in another, Gabby's life is eventful to say the least.Most CBB series include a current or former star of ITV's reality show Towie, so it's no surprise to see former Towie star and resident bad boy Dan Osborne in the house.But here's the goss: Dan split from his wife, Eastenders actress Jacqueline Jossa earlier this year, after being romantically linked to the former Love Island star Gabby Allen (who we've just mentioned of course).Maybe the Channel 5 producers are trying to conjure up some of that Love Island magic in the Big Brother house?Just weeks after surviving a car crash, the former Emmerdale actress will probably be enjoying some R&R in the Big Brother house - or at least what passes for R&R in that crazy environment.In July she was taking part in a stock car race in North Yorkshire, when she was airlifted to hospital after being cut from the race car.This week she revealed she got engaged to her boyfriend just seven days after meeting him.And now she's been flung into the CBB house, a big test for many a new-fledged relationship in the past.Former Cheers actress Kirstie was the first celebrity to enter the famous house this series and therefore was given the first task, to act as an (unelected) president of her housemates.Despite her a successful acting career, nowadays there's a lot more public interest in her life as a Scientologist.Kirstie was raised as a Methodist (a denomination of Protestant Christianity) but converted to the Church of Scientology in the late 1970s and has since become one of the religion's most famous members, alongside Tom Cruise and John Travolta.Known as Psychic Sally, we wonder whether she can already predict which celebrity will be crowned the winner of Celebrity Big Brother.Sally does more than 150 live stage shows a year and has also starred in several TV shows, focusing on her supernatural gifts.And five years ago, she received a £125,000 payout from the Daily Mail over reports she had received instructions from a hidden earpiece during a show in Dublin. The paper apologised and said it accepted the article was untrue.Rodrigo earned the nickname of The Human Ken Doll after undergoing more than 100 surgeries and procedures, including pec implants and botox, to totally transform himself.He is a regular on red carpets and has more than 700,000 followers on Instagram, where he is seen frequenting beaches, partying on yachts and flaunting his collection of corsets.In 2017, when there were reports that Rodrigo was going to enter the house, he told Metro: ""'If I were to go on a show of that format, it will show the public the real side of me, because all they know is what they read on the news.""Model Chloe made headlines last year after she was lured into a fake photoshoot in Italy and held captive for six days.In June, Lucasz Herba was convicted of kidnapping, extortion and carrying false documents. He was jailed for almost 17 years.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live in July, Chloe said: ""Because I wasn't crying and in tears, that's what led to people to think that I was not being truthful.""The former Coronation Street star has followed his brothers into reality TV and is swapping the Rovers Return Inn for the Diary Room.Ryan, who played builder Jason Grimshaw, is already the favourite to win this year's series with the bookies.He's not the first member of his family to venture into reality TV - his brother Scott is a former Love Island contestant and, in 2016, Scott's twin Adam appeared on I'm A Celebrity.And Ryan quickly won the first viewers' vote of the series - being elected vice-president of the Big Brother House on opening night - which is usually a clear sign that he is the most-recognisable and most popular at the outset. But CBB history demonstrates how quickly that can change.The former Arsenal and Liverpool footballer has made some of his former teammates nervous by entering the house.""I think they are concerned, yeah,"" he told the Daily Star. ""They are worried about what hidden gems I might come out with, skeletons that might come out of the closet.""The 35-year-old was just 15 when he was sold by lowly Notts County to Arsenal for £2m and he has had an eventful career since then - with 24 England under-21 caps, and an appearance in the Champions League final.But he has also hit the headlines for spending time in jail for drink-driving and driving while disqualified - and for being the first Premier League star to play while wearing an electronic tag.Hardeep is no stranger to reality TV - having appeared on Celebrity MasterChef and a celebrity version of The Apprentice.The 49-year-old Scottish comedian and broadcaster-turned chef also lived on the streets while filming Famous, Rich and Homeless for the BBC.In 2009, while working for the BBC's One Show, he ""apologised unreservedly"" following a complaint of inappropriate behaviour from a female colleague. He was dropped from the show for six months but never returned.The father-of-two said at the time he recognised he had ""overstepped the mark"" but had been ""badly treated"" by the BBC over the incident.Natalie will only really be known to those viewers who gorge on American reality TV shows - but they have provided some of CBB's most memorable contestants in recent years.She first appeared on the small screen when she took part in season four of US hit Bad Girls Club in 2009.The show is focused on fights and arguments between a small group of unique but highly aggressive women, so it took some effort for Natalie to be booted off the show after a physical altercation with her co-stars.Maybe the British sensibility will kick in and mellow Natalie out during her stay in the UK? But arriving for the opening night show wearing a crown and declaring herself ""the Queen of England"" suggests not.Among the usual recycled reality stars and soap actors, this is probably the most unlikely housemate on this year's show - and one whose infamy may have to be carefully explained to any viewers under 30.Nick was a Watford-born banker who briefly became one of the most talked-about people in the world. In 1995, while working for Barings Bank, he made a series of increasingly risky financial trades - unauthorised actions that caused £800m in losses and led to the collapse of Barings, the world's second oldest merchant bank.It was such a sensational incident that it was later made into a film - called Rogue Trader - with Nick portrayed by Ewan McGregor.After spending time in a Singapore prison for his rogue trading, Nick became a motivational speaker - but it will be interesting to see if housemates put him in charge of their shopping budget.This is the second reality show in the space of a year for Ben. In December, he married police officer Stephanie for Channel 4's Married At First Sight. They met for the first time at the altar but the couple broke up after the show's final episode aired on TV.He was later accused of cheating on Stephanie and admitted to kissing another woman behind her back.Oh, and did we mention, he's going to be a dad too, fathering a child with a mystery woman.He told The Sun: ""I have been blessed.

entertainment	Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother are officially ending		"The makers of Big Brother have announced that the show is being axed at the end of the current series.Big Brother's Twitter account shared the news that the 19th series, launching on Friday night, would be the last.Channel 5 confirmed Celebrity Big Brother was also ending.The show first appeared on screens in 2000 and was extremely popular, but viewing figures have dwindled in recent years.A spokesperson told the BBC: ""The forthcoming series of Big Brother will be the last - of either celebrity or civilian versions - on Channel 5.""We'd like to thank Endemol and all of the production team who have worked tirelessly to make the show a success.""Endemol released a statement shortly after Channel 5's announcement to say they were ""disappointed not to reach an agreement with Channel 5"" over the future of the show.The production company did hint that it might not be the end of the show entirely as they added ""the decision opens up a new chapter and we are excited about future possibilities for Big Brother in the UK"".During the launch of Celebrity Big Brother, Channel 5 controller Ben Frow hinted the franchise would be ending as ""the contract runs out at Christmas"".It was revealed recently by Deadline that Channel 5 was set to bring popular US TV show The Bachelor to a British audience, as a rival to ITV2's Love Island.The dating show failed to captivate viewers when the channel brought it over in 2012, but the current appetite for dating shows could help revive its popularity.Big Brother was billed as a social experiment on Channel 4 18 years ago, and involved putting ordinary people in a house over a series of weeks with no contact to the outside world.Davina McCall presented the first incarnation of the show, stepping down in 2010 when it moved to Channel 5.It was then hosted by former winner Brian Dowling before Emma Willis took over in 2013 and been narrated by Marcus Bentley for the whole 18 years the show has been on air.Rylan Clark-Neal has hosted the spin-off show Bit on the Side for six years and tweeted to thank show makers and viewers for the ""amazing journey"".The final CBB series was won by Ryan Thomas, but was overshadowed by the actions of Roxanne Pallett, who accused Thomas of punching her.The incident attracted more than 11,000 complaints to Ofcom and overshadowed the show's other storylines for the rest of the series.Pallett later apologised to Ryan Thomas, saying she ""overreacted"".In July, Endemol Shine UK applied to Hertsmere Borough Council to keep the Big Brother house at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, for the next three years.The house's current permission was due to expire on 30 September, just 16 days after the new series begins.The council's planning committee approved the application at a meeting on Thursday, after discussing conditions to restrict noise.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Kylie Jenner and the celebrity surgery effect	"""No more Joan Rivers""""The Baywatch generation has gone""""The issue with Love Island""""In 15-20 years we will see some repercussions"""	"Her famous pout helped her to build a beauty empire, but Kylie Jenner says she has stopped getting lip fillers.The procedure involves injecting dermal fillers into the lips to create volume and has become increasingly popular in recent years.The 20-year-old is among a number of celebrities whose looks have influenced trends in cosmetic procedures.Jenner admitted during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in 2015 that her natural lips had been ""an insecurity"" that she wanted to change with temporary lip fillers.She later went on to launch her brand Kylie Cosmetics, which included a line of lip products designed to help customers make their lips look bigger through over-lining and filling.#KylieJenner showing off her natural lips! She said she got her fillers removed 👀A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Jul 8, 2018 at 6:16pm PDTEnd of Instagram post by theshaderoomBut now the mother-of-one has written on Instagram to say she has dissolved the fillers, after a follower asked why her lips looked smaller.Jenner's decision comes at a time when cosmetic trends are changing as extreme Botox and big breast implants are giving way to a more natural look.Last year it was reported, the cosmetic surgery industry in the UK was worth an estimated £3.6 billion.As there are no regulations in the UK covering dermal fillers and non-surgical treatments, they can be administered by anyone.This also means it is harder to keep track of how many people are having procedures done and there are currently no official statistics to draw from.Celebrities who couldn't frown or raise their eyebrows due to Botox were previously staple fodder for comedians to take aim at, but now, according to plastic surgeon Marc Pacifico, this look (and joke) is a thing of the past.Renee Zellweger was heavily criticised in 2014 for her new look after allegedly having plastic surgery, while stars like Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Aniston claim they gave up on injections after getting negative responses from the public and media alike.""I've had a couple of consultations where Meghan Markle has been referenced as an aesthetic goal and target. People want treatments to look fresh and bright,"" Pacifico tells the BBC.""We want to make sure someone looks natural and refreshed, not frozen.""He thinks older celebrities are now more likely to embrace their lines and wrinkles, leading to a change away from cosmetic surgery procedures such as face lifts and Botox.Last year in the UK, women had 1,857 face and neck lifts, which is down 44% from 2016 according to The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS).Pacifico says: ""With face lifts now, rather than turning back the clock to look younger, it's about looking the best you can for your age - no more 'Joan Rivers'!""""Now people never want to hear the comment 'What have you had done?'""Pamela Anderson and Carmen Electra's characters on the 1990s TV show Baywatch epitomised glamour, inspiring a generation of women to get breast augmentation surgery.But now, celebrities are opting to reduce or even remove their implants, including Victoria Beckham and Sharon Osbourne.""We've moved away from bigger is better,"" Pacifico says.""There's much more recognition and understanding that a more modest size looks better and lasts longer - young people are recognising that the decisions they make now are for the next 15 years or so.""He says, ""The Baywatch generation has gone, much in the same way Kylie Jenner had lip fillers removed, celebrities are talking about having large implants removed.""Last year in the UK there were 3,747 breast reduction surgeries, a 5% increase from 2016.Pacifico works with BAAPS, who last week called for plastic surgery adverts to be banned.It comes after the Head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, raised concerns about them appearing during Love Island ad breaks.Stevens claimed the images were ""playing into a set of pressures around body image"", leading to young people needing mental health services.This was echoed by Pacifico, who says he also takes issue with the ITV2 show.""There are some role models that might not be that healthy, with a flawed perception of what is normal [on the programme].""He says he sees the influence of reality TV shows and social media affecting young people who come in for procedures, particularly lip fillers.""Lip fillers are an ever popular procedure and clients ask for a natural look - but it's deemed not enough. It goes back to an aesthetic compass,"" Pacifico says.""Someone over 35 will agree with me, but someone in their 20s will ask for more filler despite having more volume because of their age.""It comes back to that risky combination of influence of role models and what they're doing and social media and the pressures to always look your best.""For consultant surgeon Rajiv Grover, he is more concerned by the medical complications with lip fillers.""One only has to look at the constant stream of cautionary tales of botched filler stories in the media to see that the current landscape of unregulated non-surgical treatment is absolutely dire,"" he says in a medical report on lip fillers.""The complications arising from dermal fillers - which can include very serious infections, skin necrosis, and blindness - can often not be recognised, much less be treated by, amateur injectors, leaving the problems on the doorstep of the overstretched NHS.""Although Pacifico has noticed a shift towards more natural looking cosmetic procedures, he says there are celebrities and reality stars whose surgery is still promoting an unhealthy image.He says he has ""concerns"" about the current bigger bum trend, popularised by Kim Kardashian and Iggy Azalea.Bum implants, lifts and fat injections have become extremely popular recently, but are far from risk free.Rapper Cardi B has spoken out about her botched bum implants, whilst reality star Alicia Douvall appeared on Celebrity Botched Up Bodies after her implants leaked.""It is not a procedure I perform a lot of, we're not in Miami or Brazil and people aren't exposed as much,"" Pacifico says.""But in 15-20 years we will be seeing some repercussions when fashions change and the aging process takes hold.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

""There's a deal that I am striking with the great British public who have supported me over the years.""Edmonds' addition to this year's line-up has already spawned its fair share of puns.In a separate interview with The Sun, Noel revealed how he had been getting his taste buds ready for eating bugs in the show's infamous bushtucker trials.""There are now no worms in our garden,"" he said.In recent years, Edmonds has been battling for compensation from Lloyds Banking Group after being the victim of a multi-million pound bank fraud a decade ago.He revealed in March that he tried to take his own life as a result of the ordeal.The Chase's Anne Hegerty, football manager Harry Redknapp, TV presenter Nick Knowles and actor John Barrowman are among the celebrities he will meet when he joins the camp later.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

There are not yet any posts on her account, although she already has 138,000 followers. Her mother has posted on her own account more than 3,000 times.True's cousin, Dream, was born in 2016 and also has her own Instagram account - with almost a million followers.

You can always make the account private.""Yvonne Vincent says she wouldn't create an Instagram account for her baby ""but part of me thinks some celebrity kids are going to grow up without privacy anyway so what does it matter? It's treating your child as an accessory, which is pretty horrible really"".Indeed, there are many famous names who deliberately don't put pictures of their children on social media - or if they do, their faces are obscured - including TV presenters Holly Willoughby and Emma Willis.Award-winning blogger Jen Walshaw, who runs parenting website Mum in the Madhouse, has been posting images of herself and her two boys on her Instagram account for several years.**WET** Well it is raining anyway so why let that stop play.

entertainment	8 of the worst celebrity waxworks	1. Adele2. Victoria Beckham3. Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan4. Taylor Swift5. Katy Perry6. Britney Spears7. Michael Jackson8. Boy George	This waxwork of Beyonce has gone viral on social media and for good reason too, because it looks nothing like her.The figure is part of an exhibit at a Niagara Falls wax museum and has been compared to Jennifer Aniston, Dee from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and basically everyone apart from Beyonce.She's got some competition though - here's a selection of our favourite terrible celebrity waxworks.It appears the Panoptikum Museum in Hamburg took inspiration from Adele's hit and thought never mind I'll find someone like you rather than making a waxwork in the likeness of the Grammy-award winning singer.Everyone knows Posh Spice likes to carefully manage her image, so she won't be happy with this impression of her.It comes from the Louis Tussaud House of Wax Museum in Great Yarmouth, which has somewhat legendary status in the world of terrible waxworks.Louis Tussaud is back at it again with his waxworks and even poor Kylie and Jason have fallen victim to his designs.The 80s power couple have been immortalised forever in wax Especially for You.Normally when celebrities pose next to their waxwork, you find it really difficult to tell which one is which.Not in this case though - the New York Madame Tussauds didn't quite get the memo about making a Taylor Swift waxwork actually look similar to her. Shake it off, Tay...I don't know what happened to Katy Perry Last Friday Night, but she's ended up at the Musee Grevin in Paris looking like a completely different person.It's only this memorable outfit from her Teenage Dream days that salvages the whole thing.Britney announced her extremely successful Vegas residency was coming to an end in December last year.So to mark such an accolade she was rewarded with this terrifying waxwork in the Las Vegas Madame Tussauds.He's one of the most recognisable faces in music.... which makes it that much worse that this waxwork looks nothing like the great MJ.Don't blame it on the sunshine, don't blame it on the good times, blame it on the... artist?Boy George has achieved many incredible things in his life - he's won Grammys, Brits and sold more than 50 million records with his band Culture Club.Therefore this rather poor imitation of his cutting edge look is probably something he will want to forget.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Kelsea Ballerini on disco balls, ugly tears and stolen luggage		"""I think I could fit my whole band in there,"" says Kelsea Ballerini, raising her eyes towards Europe's largest glitter ball, which is suspended from the ceiling of a hotel in central London.""Think about it: We could roll from show to show like hamsters.""The country star is sizing up the mirrored monstrosity just an hour before she performs directly beneath it for fans and the press.Although it's an acoustic set, the breadth of Ballerini's songwriting is apparent: the 26-year-old, who's the only female artist to have topped the US country charts with her first three singles, mixes the Nashville twang of Peter Pan with the crossover pop of Miss Me More and the syncopated strut of her Chainsmokers collaboration This Feeling.But the highlight is her new single Homecoming Queen - a simple, heartfelt ballad about facing up to low self-esteem.In the song's video, Ballerini is seen walking off stage full of confidence, her ears ringing from the applause of the crowd - but as the music swells, her high heels and hair extensions fade away until she is left alone in a darkened room, silently sobbing.The scene was unplanned, and the tears were real.""I was just in this abyss,"" she says, recalling how the video shoot brought back the feelings of ""loneliness and anxiety"" she'd poured into the lyrics last year.The single is the first taste of the star's eagerly-anticipated third album, due early next year. And, just before she played BBC Radio 2's Hyde Park festival, Ballerini talked about the making of the record, being inducted to the Grand Old Opry at the tender age of 25, and the time Beyoncé's sister stole her luggage.Let's just take a moment to admire this glitter ball.I mean, honestly, that's all I really should talk about. It's amazing.Your last couple of singles have had a poppy, glitter ball feeling, but Homecoming Queen is more heartfelt. What inspired it?I was touring really heavily and on [social media] I was only really showing the really cool moments of my life - on stage or on a red carpet, all that kind of stuff.What I wasn't showing was that I was feeling really painfully insecure. So I wrote this song to say it's OK to feel what you feel, and it's also OK to share it, because we're all human. You're allowed to have a bad day, you know?The pressure to be ""Instagram perfect"" can be very damaging.Yes, I think we've lost connection to other people because we're not sharing those vulnerable moments. So I wanted to be the first one to be like, ""Well, here's an ugly cry!""Which leads straight to the video. How nervous were you to film it?I collaborated with [director] Shane Drake on the treatment, and we knew it would be emotional - but I wasn't really planning on losing it.So what happened?When we'd shot the whole thing, Shane squatted down by my chair and said, ""All right, we've got what we need but we're going to do one more take for safety.""Then he said, ""Listen, I know you wrote the song. I just want to know why you wrote it,"" and he got up and walked out.And I just snapped back into that place of writing it, of feeling lonely and insecure and anxious, and I lost it, and that's the take that you see.Homecoming Queen is the first taste of the new album. What stage are you at with that?We have 10 songs done, hundreds written, and we're trying to figure what other colours and textures we need. There's a song with horns, a song with a string quartet, two collaborations that are polar opposites, musically. I'm just having fun.Lyrically, your last album covered two years, from a horrible break-up to getting married. Is this the next chapter?It's not. This time, I took the pressure off having a concept and just let myself write. And I wrote like crazy. I wrote more country than I've ever written and more pop than I've ever written. We put the saddest song out first.You were inducted to the Grand Old Opry earlier this year - at quite an early stage of your career, if I'm right?I know, I didn't expect it to happen so soon.How did it come about?It actually happened on stage. I was playing the Opry the same night as a Little Big Town, and they texted me and said, ""Hey, do you want to sing Girl Crush with us?""But when they brought me out, they sang in four part harmony, ""Kelsea, do you want to join the Opry?"" and I just sobbed. It's a running theme.You were inducted by your idol, Carrie Underwood. What was it like to perform with her on that stage?The coolest part wasn't even anything that people saw. I was rehearsing backstage with Carrie, facing each other with our lyric sheets and working out who's singing what, when all of a sudden we hear a third harmony come in. It turned out Keith Urban had been roaming the halls of the Opry and he just walked in the room, singing.To me, that was the moment, because it was like, ""This is what it means: You're part of this family forever.""You recently wrote on Twitter that you'd decided to ""care more about the meal than the bloat"". Have you stuck to that?Yeah. That's why there's a treadmill: Just run it off. It's fine!Actually, I'm not a treadmill person, I don't know why I said that. I love cycle class, though.I don't like spin classes because the music puts me off. I prefer to listen to podcasts if I'm at the gym.Have you listened to Crime Junkie? Oh my gosh, it's so good. I can't watch CSI because I'm such a chicken but Crime Junkie, for some reason, is my obsession. What do you listen to?Do you know Song Exploder? There's an incredible episode where Solange picks apart the recording of Cranes In The Sky.Oh, I have a really funny Solange story! She'd been in Tennessee to play the Bonnaroo festival and we were on the same flight to LA, when she accidentally took my bag. We literally had to hunt her down through, like, 70 people before we got it back.So basically, Solange stole my backpack.If she'd ended up in your wardrobe, what would she have been wearing?I was going to LA for one of the collaborations on my album, so I was trying to look cute because I wanted to take photos while we were recording the vocals. But I was also trying to look casual, 'cause I didn't want to look like I was trying too hard. So I had a giant neon sweater and jean shorts and cowgirl boots. Solange would have rocked it.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

entertainment	Dale Winton and Graeme Souness - and 5 other unlikely celebrity friendships	1. Anna Wintour and Roger Federer2. Jessica Williams and JK Rowling3. Ed Sheeran and Courteney Cox4. Eminem and Elton John5. Danny Dyer and Harold Pinter	"They say ""opposites attract"" in love, but the same can be said for friendship.Some were surprised to see that former hard-tackling footballer Graeme Souness went to the funeral of Supermarket Sweep host Dale Winton on Tuesday.In fact, the pair were good friends for many years, after meeting through Souness's wife.""We met in a restaurant in London and became great friends,"" the former Scotland captain told BBC 5 live last year. ""We used to see him on holiday in southern Spain when we all went there.""Their friendship blossomed to such an extent that Winton asked Souness to be his best man.He proudly agreed, as all good friends would - unaware until the big day itself that it was just for a spoof wedding on BBC Three.Here are five other unlikely celebrity friendships.The long-standing Vogue editor - widely revered in the fashion world - is known for her icy, restrained demeanour. That is, it seems, unless she is speaking to tennis icon Roger Federer.Writing in Tennis magazine with rarely-seen warmth, Wintour opened up about their friendship, which began when they met for lunch through a mutual friend in 2005.She gushingly admitted that while ""everyone calls themselves Roger Federer fans"", she considers herself ""a groupie"".""It's no secret that he's appeared in Vogue about as often as Karlie Kloss,"" she continued.The Swiss ace has gone on to join her at numerous fashion shows, a world Wintour says he is ""desperate to talk about"".And when Federer accepted her invitation to attend the Met Gala last year, Wintour said: ""Roger was by far the best dressed. Nineteen Grand Slams, one Met Gala and counting."" Game, set and costume match.As an actress, comedian and former senior correspondent on The Daily Show, Williams is no stranger to showbusiness - however the origin story of her friendship with Rowling resembles a fan's dream.Speaking on the Late Show With Stephen Colbert last year, Williams recounted how their relationship was sparked by a mix of Twitter and some liquid courage.After the Harry Potter author followed her on Twitter, Williams only decided to slide into her DMs in the midst of a night out.""My boyfriend [and I] were at a bar and we had been drinking and [he was like], 'You should DM her,' and I was like, 'no!' And so I did a shot and then I messaged her like, 'Heeey JoJo!'""⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️💀. Cool. Now that we've established that I'm dead- I met FREAKING J👏🏾K👏🏾R👏🏾O👏🏾W👏🏾L👏🏾I👏🏾N👏🏾G (aka Jo Jo- lol she lets me call her that. So ignorant.) originally like a month ago. Obviously we all know that I've been a Harry Potter nut since I was 10 years old so I was very nervous to meet one of my sheroes for the first time. What would I wear? What do you say at the alter (lmaooo)? What if we like...don't get along? Will I quit reading books forever because we don't get along? So I hung out with Jojo and was relieved that we got on verrrrry well and I was so stoked because meeting your heroes can be a real toss up of either cupcakes or dog doodoo if you know what I mean. This right here was cupcakes. We had like a legit full six hours of drinks and cocktails. Did I lowkey tear up during dinner? Yes. Am I aware that it was a trash bonkers thing to do over dinner while she's biting into her plate of veggies? Yes. But any sort of extreme emotion makes my eyes well up. #standinginmytruth #therealme #lovemeforme. Anyway- I had so much fun talking about life/politics/thesims with her over 25 cocktails that I felt like a realllll dweeblord for FORGETTING to snag a photo. The following day my mom tried to comfort me after I forgot to get a photo by saying ""That's okay baby. You guys hung out for you two only and not social media."" She was low key very correct but also she's my mother so I was like ""🙄🙄😑😑😑."" So cut to last night- and (wildly)I'm hanging out with the Khaleesi again and I was on my way out the damn door and was like ""......wait I'm sorry can I get a photo? For my Instagram?? (I know such 🚮)"" She was like ""yes Jess of course!"" So we took a few photos and yes she's a major babe and here she is on my IG feed for the both you And me to enjoy. ⚰️ #eatcraylove #jkrowling #harrypotterA post shared by Jessica Williams (@msjwilly) on Jul 20, 2017 at 9:49am PDTEnd of Instagram post by msjwilly""She was like, 'When's the next time you're gonna be in London? I promise I'm not this blabby after the fourth cocktail,' and I was like AHHHH!"" said Williams.The pair, who share the same birthday like all good BFFs, went on to meet for ""six hours of food and cocktails"".🧙🏾‍♀️A post shared by Jessica Williams (@msjwilly) on Apr 22, 2018 at 3:56pm PDTEnd of Instagram post 2 by msjwillyTheir relationship turned professional in March when Rowling cast Williams in the role of Professor Eulalie (Lally Hicks) in the forthcoming Fantastic Beasts sequel.One is a contemporary pop star, the other is famed for playing Monica in the ever-popular '90s sitcom Friends.And yet despite their differences in space and time, the pair hit it off after being introduced by mutual friends.Sheeran even revealed he stayed at Cox's Malibu beach house while he was writing material for his album x, which was released in 2014.My friend Courteney is nominated for a People Choice Award for favourite cable tv actress. She's never won one before and she lets me live in her beach house, so how's about we all vote for her and win her the damn thang eh? Safe. Vote here please kind people - http://www.peopleschoice.com/pca/vote/votenow.jspA post shared by Ed Sheeran (@teddysphotos) on Nov 19, 2013 at 10:17am PSTEnd of Instagram post by teddysphotosHe told The Sun newspaper: ""There was no rent but I made the bed and cups of tea and things like that. If you're staying at your friend's house, you should treat it like your own.""Well, actually, that's a lie - because I don't make my own bed at home.""Fast-forward to the present and it appears Sheeran has repaid his dues in another form - successfully playing matchmaker between Cox and Snow Patrol musician Johnny McDaid.This one dates back to the early noughties, when Eminem was criticised for apparently homophobic lyrics in his music.LGBT campaigners were angered by his use of derogatory terms to describe gay people on The Marshall Mathers LP.One person who came to the rapper's defence was Sir Elton.At the height of the controversy, the pair famously performed Stan together at the Grammy Awards in 2001, at the end of which they hugged and held hands.""For me, Eminem was never homophobic,"" Sir Elton said.""I listened to the whole of the Marshall Mathers album… and I was floored by it. And I thought, how could anyone think this is… he's just writing about the way things are. Not how he thinks, but the way things are.""Not only did they become firm friends, but Slim Shady even sent Sir Elton a rather bizarre wedding gift, as the Rocket Man singer recalled last year.Dyer, who plays Mick Carter in EastEnders, first met the legendary playwright in 1999 when the actor played a small role in Celebration at London's Almeida Theatre.Pinter, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, subsequently asked him to appear in No Man's Land at the National Theatre.He later cast Dyer as Joey in his final play The Homecoming in 2008, months before the playwright's death from cancer.Speaking to The Guardian in 2013, Dyer - often living up to the image of an East End hardman - said he was ""devastated"" at the death.""He was the only person who I feared but loved,"" he said. ""He was a tyrant... but he could get away with it because he was so enchanting. He was a poet.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	9 highlights from Celebrity Big Brother so far		"We've had tears. We've had tantrums.Celebrity Big Brother has proved to be just the kind of guilty pleasure-TV that cosy January nights in were made for.This year's house started out with all-female housemates, a move Channel 5 said was to celebrate the centenary of women over 30 being given the vote.But it wasn't long before they were joined by a few men - including Boyzone's Shane Lynch, dancer Wayne Sleep and Love Island's Jonny Mitchell.In the interests of taste and decency, there are a few moments which we sadly can't bring you in this highlights round-up, such as Rachel Johnson's dance moves, Courtney Act's apparent wardrobe malfunction and a conversation about drag queens and ""tucking"".But for those who need to catch up on the series, here's a quick round-up of some of the other water cooler moments so far:1. Andrew Brady as a drag queenWe're not sure what Lord Sugar would've made of Betty Swollocks.But former Apprentice candidate Andrew Brady's drag alter-ego sure made for some entertaining television.Sadly, India didn't think so, sitting in silence and generally looking scared as a result of her apparent phobia of drag queens.(Naturally, Twitter was quick to dredge up several historic photos of India with drag queens.)2. Ann saying Meghan Markle is ""trouble""You may have heard about Prince Harry's engagement to Meghan Markle in November - the pair are due to marry on 19 May.But, in a conversation about the couple, Ann Widdecombe said she didn't like Markle's ""background"" or ""attitude"".""I worry. I add it all up and I'm uneasy,"" she added.But she faced a backlash from viewers, who were quick to jump to Markle's defence.3. Shane paying tribute to his former bandmate Stephen GateleyViewers took to social media to say they were tearing up shortly after Shane Lynch discussed the death of his former bandmate Stephen Gately in 2009.""There will always be five [members of Boyzone],"" Shane said. ""Regardless of what you see, he will always be there.""4. The debate about the Hollywood sexual abuse scandalThe string of allegations against entertainment figures such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey in recent months sparked discussion among the female contestants on the first evening in the house.Ann and Amanda Barrie were firmly of the opinion that actresses could simply choose to decline if propositioned by a powerful Hollywood figure.But Rachel, Malika Haqq and Jess Impiazzi said many stars, particularly when they're young and less famous, feel under intense pressure in such situations.5. India discussing gender reassignment surgeryEarly in the series, India likened her transition from male to female felt ""like having a tooth out,"" adding how much of a ""relief"" it was becoming a woman after years of feeling ""stressed and exhausted"" as a man.Ann was quick to share her own thoughts on having such surgery on the NHS, commenting: ""Well the fact is the NHS can't do everything, isn't doing everything.""And you've got to ask yourself what the priorities should be... match [gender reassignment surgery] with someone going blind, children with cancer.""India argued it was the high suicide rates amongst transgender people meant that giving them such surgery for free was ""money well spent"".6. Big Brother means BrexitGet any group of people together for more than five minutes these days and it's inevitable that the conversation will eventually turn to Brexit.During one discussion in the kitchen, Ann explained her decision for choosing to vote for the UK to leave the European Union, while Jess revealed that she didn't actually vote.""We're celebrating 100 years of women having the vote,"" Ann pointed out. ""And you've just told me you didn't bother voting?""Awkward.7. The ballad of Ginuwine and AshleyBig Brother history is littered with romances - only last week Grace and Mikey, who got together on Big Brother in 2006, announced they were expecting their third child.This time around, we have model and DJ Ashley James getting friendly with R&B singer Ginuwine.She has already reassured him that she ""doesn't cheat"" and the pair even discussed marriage (above).At this rate we're expecting children by Christmas.8. The musical performancesWatching Ginuwine perform Pony as Ann Widdecombe watches on is certainly an early contender for cringiest TV moment of 2018 so far.John Barnes's World In Motion rap was also a wonderful sight to behold - but sadly both videos are absent from YouTube for music rights reasons.(Possibly for the best.)9. Ann leaving a party because the music is too loudWe all have that one friend.""I have good hearing, and you [Big Brother] are trying to damage it. You have a duty of care.""Having woken up hoarse after many an evening out, we do sympathise - but given Ann's Strictly Come Dancing experience we can't help but wish she'd thrown some shapes.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Jess ImpiazziAnn WiddecombeMalika HaqqAmanda BarrieAshley JamesMaggie OliverIndia WilloughbyRachel Johnson	"Eight new celebrities walked (with their umbrellas) into the Celebrity Big Brother house on Tuesday evening.This series is a little different to normal - the first batch of housemates are all female, although male contestants will be added later this week.Channel 5 said it was launching the show with the female-only cast to mark the 100th anniversary of women over 30 being given the vote.Former Liverpool player John Barnes will be the first man to enter the house on Friday.""Putting the women in first and allowing them to settle and take control of the house before the men arrive will create an interesting dynamic,"" Tamsin Dodgson, Celebrity Big Brother's executive editor, told BBC News.""How do the different groups cope with power and what impact does gender really have? Fundamentally though it will be a lot of fun to watch.""Here are this year's contestants (so far):Jess is best known for appearing in MTV reality show Ex on the Beach.She's also appeared in 2017's Dangerous Game alongside Calum Best and once dated Charlie Sheen.Ann Widdecombe served as a Conservative MP from 1987 until 2010.She appeared in Strictly Come Dancing in the year after she stepped down and made it to the ninth week with her partner Anton Du Beke.You'll probably recognise reality TV veteran Malika if you've ever watched Husbands of Hollywood, Dash Dolls or Hollywood Divas.But the 34-year-old is perhaps most famous for her association with Khloe Kardashian - the pair have been best friends since they were 15.Actress Amanda Barrie is the oldest contestant this year, entering the house at the grand age of 82.Her TV credits include Benidorm, Holby City, multiple Carry On films and Are You Being Served?.But she's perhaps best known for playing Alma Halliwell (also known as Alma Baldwin and Alma Sedgewick) in Coronation Street for more than a decade - leaving the soap in 2001.Ashley first shot to fame in 2013 after appearing in E4 reality show Made in Chelsea.But she's now better known as a model, DJ and presenter - hosting her own show on Hoxton Radio every Friday.Maggie Oliver is a former detective with Greater Manchester Police who helped break up the Rochdale child grooming ring.Her involvement was dramatised in BBC One's Three Girls last year - which saw actress Lesley Sharp portray her.Transgender newsreader India has previously worked as a TV reporter.

Get Me Out of Here had, minutes before Packham's speech, been given an award for best reality TV show, with Holly Willoughby collecting the trophy.Willoughby stepped in as joint presenter, alongside Declan Donnelly, on the most recent series of I'm A Celebrity... while Ant McPartlin was on a break from TV to receive treatment for alcohol addiction.Other winners included Lorraine Kelly, who was given the award for outstanding contribution to television.She used her time at the podium to air her frustration with social media and the harm it can do to young people.""They have to deal with some really vile things on the internet,"" said Kelly.""That cannot continue.

entertainment	Celebrity names you're probably saying wrong	JK RowlingAmanda SeyfriedMartin ScorseseBarbra StreisandShia LaBeoufCharlize TheronMatt GroeningSusan Sarandon	"As Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot can do anything - apart from getting people to pronounce her name correctly.You've probably been calling her Gal Gah-dote or Gal Gah-doh all this time. Or maybe you're not at all sure and have been mumbling her surname, hoping no one will notice.But the Israeli actress recently cleared up the confusion by telling Jimmy Kimmel it's actually pronounced Gal Gad-dott.She's not the only one who's struggled with name issues. Here are a few other famous faces whose name you may have been saying wrong.Twenty years ago, no one had heard of Harry Potter author JK Rowling. But with great fame comes great name mispronunciation.Is it Roe-ling or Rowl-ling? The author once corrected an interviewer saying: ""It's Rolling - as in Stone.""Mamma Mia! star Amanda Seyfried is constantly correcting people on how to say her name.Sieg-freed, Sigh-freed, Sieg-fred and Say-freed have all been said to her face, and every time she cringes.She cleared it up once and for all in a 2012 interview - it's Sigh-fred.Everyone knows it's Scor-say-zee, right? Wrong. It's Scor-sess-see.The director says so himself in the fifth series of Entourage.Last year Barbra Streisand made headlines after she complained to Apple boss Tim Cook about the way Siri says her name.How is that? Well, it's pretty much the way everyone pronounces it: Strei-zand.""She pronounces my name wrong,"" the singer told NPR. ""Streisand with a soft S, like sand on the beach.""So that's Strei-sand to you and me.Shia LaBeouf famously wore a paper bag on his head at the Berlin Film Festival in 2014, saying he wasn't famous anymore.But in talking about the incident, people were forced to say his name - which was a little tricky for some.He's Shy-a La-Buf, not Shee-ya La Boof.The South African actress has had a rough time getting people to say her surname right.It's not Ther-on or Ther-own (rhymes with Throne) - she goes by Ther-in.To make things even more confusing, that's not even her actual name either. In Afrikaans, it's pronounced Shar-leeze Thrawn, but she's opted for Ther-in as she thinks it's easier to say.Here she is telling Piers Morgan how to say it properly.Simpsons creator Matt Groening has one of those names whose spelling instantly flummoxes you.But it's not Groan-ing or Green-ing - it's Gray-ning.If you've merrily been living your life calling her Susan Sarun-dun you're wrong.The Oscar winner once helpfully explained to interviewers how to pronounce her name: ""It's Sa-ran-don - rhymes with abandon.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

And of course, good monetary gain,"" he laughed.Ms Banks, who also performed at the show, said the advent of streaming had democratised music for independent artists.""Young people have access to platforms that distribute our music,"" she said. ""You have easy access to everything on your phone, and it's put the power back in the hands of the people. I feel like that's why UK rap has become more successful, because you just can't stop it.""The guitarist dedicated his speech to the spirit of indie musicians across generations.""When I started out with The Smiths, indie punk was over,"" he said. ""We learned a lot of great things from it, it left a great legacy, but it was from an older generation to me.""So when it was time to get The Smiths together, it felt, for me, like year zero: A complete open vista.""It felt like my generation were about to stand for something, and to stand against other things. Gender politics were involved in a big way, there was party politics, there was a difference in the way music was going to be produced, the way it was going to sound and definitely the way it was going to be distributed.""The Smiths went on to rewrite the rules of indie music, and Marr paid tribute to the artists, managers and labels who were ""driving music forward"" today.""I'd like to thank anyone in this room who puts their time and energy and passion and sleepless nights and credit cards into music of any genre,"" he said.""It's not easy for young musicians. It was never easy. It seems more difficult now.

""I couldn't have had someone in the middle of that, telling me how to write my feelings.""But the star admitted she was eyeing up one potential collaborator for her next record.""I'm flying out Thursday to work on new songs in LA with Linda Perry,"" she said, namedropping the writer behind Christina Aguilera's Beautiful and 4 Non Blondes' What's Going On.""I'm really fond of her and what she does, so I hope we can get something together.""""Brunch is the new rock 'n' roll,"" said Billy Duffy as he observed the orderly and polite proceedings on the red carpet.""Most people in bands these days aren't really partying. That myth of the rock star falling about like some bad B-movie has gone. There are exceptions, and God bless them, but in general most rockers are pretty together.""It's progress, I think. Things change.""Georgia, a former Arsenal player and one-time drummer for Kate Tempest, was named ""one to watch"" by BBC Music Introducing, thanks to the success of her blazing, euphoric club track About Work The Dance Floor.""When I put it out, I didn't know what to expect,"" said the singer. ""I didn't even know that people would listen.""The song went on to amass three million plays on Spotify, followed by a buzzworthy set at Glastonbury, giving the 25-year-old a boost as she records her second album, a collection of songs about ""thrill-seeking and expression in a world of routines and trappings"".""There's a lot of collaborations coming out soon, which I'm really excited about,"" she confided to the BBC.

To start with anyway.Channel 5 says it wanted to mark the 100th anniversary of women over 30 being given the vote.""We approach each series thinking of ways to make it as entertaining and engaging as possible,"" Tamsin Dodgson, Celebrity Big Brother's executive editor, told BBC News.""As the nation prepares to mark [the centenary], we're launching the show with female-only contestants which is a gentle nod to this landmark anniversary.""Big Brother has done this before, when the show was on Channel 4.The eighth series, which aired in summer 2007, saw 11 female housemates enter Big Brother.On day three, they added a single male contestant, and then gradually added more men in the following weeks - one of whom, Brian Belo, went on to win.The results made for arguably one of the most interesting series in the show's history. Viewers watched as the dynamic and behaviour of all the female contestants changed between when there were no men, then one man, and then several men.""Putting the women in first and allowing them to settle and take control of the house before the men arrive will create an interesting dynamic,"" says Tamsin.""How do the different groups cope with power and what impact does gender really have? Fundamentally though it will be a lot of fun to watch.""Dr Helen Pankhurst, an equality campaigner who is Sylvia's granddaughter and Emmeline's great-granddaughter, welcomed the fact the programme would raise awareness.""Anything that draws attention to the centenary and allows a discussion and gets that message through to different audiences is a great thing,"" she told BBC News last month.""I'll be really interested to hear what the audience have to say about it all and to hear the whole discussion it will promote.""Asked what her grandmother and great-grandmother would make of the plan, Dr Pankhurst said she thought they would laugh, adding: ""I really don't know what they would make of the world we live in.""Most of the contestants for this year's show will be unveiled on Channel 5 on Tuesday evening - although they have already revealed that one will be journalist Rachel Johnson.The most recent series of Celebrity Big Brother, last August, featured Amelia Lily, Paul Danan, Sandi Bogle from Gogglebox and Girls Aloud's Sarah Harding, the eventual winner.Discussing this series, Tamsin says: ""The men will arrive slightly later and Big Brother provides the perfect lens through which to explore what it is to be a woman - and a man - in 2018.""Gender feels like the perfect concept to explore within Big Brother. Our celebrities, as you'd expect, come with differing backgrounds, experiences and points of view, so I think you can expect a lively, opinionated but ultimately entertaining series to kick off the New Year.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He would never use that language now and realises that, as someone who was bullied himself, this kind of retaliatory, inflammatory, insulting language is completely unacceptable.""An ITV spokesperson added: ""Jack has deleted these tweets and has since issued a full apology.""Sunday night's show saw some of the contestants tackling a walk the plank challenge on the roof of a hotel in Australia, 334 feet up in the air.Other tasks included one which saw Johnson, 77, and Vardy putting their hands into holes cut into the side of a wrecked wooden boat that were filled with rats, spiders and crabs.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

'This is huge''So much at stake''A big deal'	"Comic book fans have been left giddy with anticipation by the bumper crop of superhero offerings unveiled by Marvel Studios at this year's Comic Con.Details of Marvel's so-called ""Phase 4"" have also raised hopes about a real step forward for diversity in Hollywood.The next stage of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will feature its first deaf superhero, its first Asian-American superhero and an openly gay superhero.It will also see more women than ever taking the directorial reins.""Marvel are trying to strive for diversity in a way that doesn't feel forced,"" presenter and Marvel fan Claire Lim tells BBC News. ""They're just trying to represent what we see on the streets.""Some cynics have accused the studio of only improving representation after 2018's Black Panther became a blockbuster hit, however.""Does anyone else feel a little icky that in this vast #MCU they didn't care about diversity or representation until phase 3, and then AFTER they made sure it's profitable they announce ALL THE DIVERSITY for #MarvelPhase4?"" wrote LJ Thomas.Fellow Twitter user Hippie J wrote: ""I'm happy we have more diversity in phase 4 but I'm not overly about to praise the mcu and marvel studios be[cause] they waited until it was profitable to do so.""Lim, though, believes there is no ulterior motive. ""I think it's genuine, because a lot of millennial and Gen-Z people expect diversity,"" she says. ""They don't want it as an add-on.""The casting of deaf actress Lauren Ridloff as superhero Makkari in 2020 release Eternals has been particularly applauded on social media.""This is huge,"" wrote Twitter user Adam Pottle. ""Millions of deaf kids will see Lauren as a superhero and feel that they too can act and play superhero[e]s.""""Congratulations, @LaurenRidloff!"" wrote Mary Harman, who describes herself as a ""proudly deaf sci-fi junkie"". She added: ""Can't wait to see authentic representation on the big screen.""Other social media users praised Marvel for casting the black actress as a character who has always been depicted as a white male in its comic books.On Saturday, Ridloff herself expressed delight at the prospect of co-starring with Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden and others under Chloe Zhao's direction.""I am so honoured to be here,"" she signed as she stood on stage alongside her co-stars, who also include Pakistani-American actor Kumail Nanjiani and South Korean actor Dong-seok Ma, aka Don Lee.Mexican actress Salma Hayek also voiced pride at being ""a part of a movie that is going to allow people who never felt represented in superheroes"".According to Claire Lim, Ridloff's casting represents ""a bit of a sea change"".""We talk about LGBTQ+ people, we talk about people of different races and genders, but I think we forget that diversity means people of all different abilities as well,"" she says.Meanwhile, Hawaiian director Destin Daniel Cretton revealed that Canadian star Simu Liu will play the MCU's first Asian-American movie superhero, in Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings.""It's amazing to see Kevin [Feige] and his team create an MCU that reflects all the beautiful colours that we see in this room,"" he said.The actor tweeted afterwards: ""There is so much at stake here. We are fighting for our identity, for our right to be seen, to BELONG.""Many Twitter users were no less delighted that Shang-Chi - a kung fu master who made his first comic book appearance in 1973 - was headed for the screen. ""I know comics are for everyone but this film is clearly specifically for me,"" wrote Amanda Yeo.Others were quick to remind Marvel of some of its previous mis-steps over the representation of its ostensibly Chinese characters. The Shang-Chi movie will feature Hong Kong actor Tony Leung as The Mandarin, a villainous character who previously featured in 2013's Iron Man 3.On that occasion, however, 'The Mandarin' was revealed to be an imposter named Trevor Slattery who was merely pretending to be the fearsome terrorist. ""Is Disney finally admitting that Iron Man 3's Mandarin twist was a terrible idea?"" asked one Twitter user.In 2017, the Power Rangers reboot made headlines for making one of its heroes, yellow ranger Trini, openly gay. Last year, meanwhile, shooting began on a Batwoman TV series that will see Ruby Rose play the comic book world's first openly lesbian superhero.On Saturday, Marvel rather belatedly got in on the act by confirming the sexual orientation of Valkyrie, the female superhero introduced in 2017's Thor: Ragnarok.In the next Thor film, actress Tessa Thompson revealed, Valkyrie's ""first order of business"" would be ""to find her queen"". Marvel supremo Feige later confirmed that meant Valkyrie would be the first openly LGBTQ superhero in a Marvel film.Writing on the LGBTQ Nation website, Daniel Villarreal said the news was ""a big deal"" because ""Marvel Studios' 23 superhero films... have basically had no queer representation"".Yet Gay Times' Matt Moore said ""this moment could have happened earlier"", citing Marvel's decision to remove a reference to Valkyrie's bisexuality from Thor: Ragnarok.For Out magazine's Mikelle Street, though, Saturday's announcement showed that Marvel was ""finally putting its money where its mouth is"".""It's been a bit of a long road to get here,"" the writer continued. ""But however long the road, here we are.""According to Claire Lim, Marvel Studios is reflecting what's been happening in the comics for a number of years.""Black Panther did so well because people were finally seeing themselves on film,"" she said.""There's a generation who don't want to see the same thing. It's boring to see the same thing. And every generation demands change.""Additional reporting by Ian Youngs.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Wallows: Putting Hollywood on hold for the sake of music		"Getting someone... anyone... to notice you is the prime concern of most bands at the start of their musical careers.Sadly for most, the reality is that no-one ever will. For some, hard work and persistence and a bit of luck will pay off.But in the case of US band Wallows, massive interest is a given when your lead singer is in one of the most popular shows on Netflix.Oh, and your guitarist played comedian Ray Romano's son in a comedy-drama for two series.Luckily, the Californian three-piece, fronted by actor Dylan Minnette, the star of 13 Reasons Why, have enough perky indie pop songs under their belt to warrant the extra level of attention they may find themselves dealing with.Their debut album Nothing Happens was released in March, and the band have already booked a massive support slot with their musical heroes Vampire Weekend when they play at Alexandra Palace in London later this year.""They're one of our favourite bands of all time,"" says drummer Cole Preston. ""We did two shows just outside of Los Angeles last year, and those were underplays for them in like thousand capacity venues. But then to do these London shows, like proper, actual headline Vampire Weekend shows... it's going to be insane.""The band have been together since the age of 11, young for most bands. They began life as a duo until a rather fortuitous meeting at an event in California, literally called Join the Band.""They both met before I entered the picture,"" explains Preston. ""They were both from the Midwest and moving out to LA to do acting and their moms met on an online 'mom-moving-to-LA' chat forum.""They bonded over music in South Park and random things that nine-year-olds shouldn't necessarily bond over. And a couple years later, they did this music programme in LA called Join the Band. And then I was assigned as the drummer to the group.""It was a weird luck of the draw.""Braeden Lemasters appeared with Romano in TV show Men of a Certain Age, and along with Minnette is something of a rising star in Hollywood. He says their similar backgrounds and musical diets, formed by early introductions to The Beatles, helped them become friends - even though he admits taking advantage of Minnette's apparently trusting nature.""I didn't start playing like music until I was 11,"" he says. ""When I was nine, my dad played me The Beatles for the first time. And that changed my perception on reality.""When I met Dylan, his dad had a very similar story of playing in bands and then we started writing songs together. And I always used to trick him that I wrote Led Zeppelin songs.""Minnette - whose throat bug has rendered him largely speechless, makes a rare interjection: ""The big one was Tangerine. He's like, 'Dude, let's both write a song called Tangerine and see which one's better.' And I'm over there writing my own song called Tangerine. And then he's playing Led Zeppelin's Tangerine, which was like, perfectly written.""Lemasters adds: ""I used to ask my friends, 'What song's better? I've written a couple'. And I would sing them two Beatles songs. I stopped doing that when I was 18.""It's been two years since Wallows release their Strokes-inspired lo-fi debut single Pleaser, and they recently played their first set of UK headline shows. Already tracks like the hugely infectious Scrawny and Are You Bored Yet? have become fan favourites.""That's the phone song,"" says Minnette. ""People sing that really well. Which is cool.""Which brings up an interesting point. The issue of phones at gigs is a thorny one, with some artists like Jack White banning them from his shows while other artists regularly urge fans to light them up at specific times in their sets.""I see both sides of it. I've been guilty of pulling out my phone at shows,"" admits Minnette. ""It doesn't bother me yet. I could see how it could get annoying. But right now I'm just sort of excited about everything. It's like, 'Oh, that's a sign that people really like this song'. I'm sure in 10 years. I'll be like, 'Really?'""With acting careers to consider, for Minnette and Lemasters the challenge is balancing the music with their day job.""At the moment, Dylan has a crazy schedule,"" says the guitarist. ""But we have such professional management on both ends that it's very easy to map out things.""I feel like music is just something that we're always just doing anyway. We always have guitars around, we're always writing, even when Dylan's gone. Or if I'm gone, we always make it happen. I feel like music is a huge priority, like the main priority in a lot of regards, that it's very easy to balance them.""Minnette says of his bosses at Netflix: ""They're being very supportive of it. As supportive as they possibly be. It's a lot of respect and love all around, I think, which is good. It's all very healthy right now. I definitely want to focus on this as much as possible."""
entertainment	People's Choice Awards: How a fan's One Direction fantasy won a top film prize		"Some of this year's biggest films were trounced at the People's Choice Awards in the US, when a relatively unknown movie based on a piece of One Direction fan fiction was named best drama.After, which has a score of just 17% on Rotten Tomatoes, beat the likes of Us and Rocketman to take the prize.It started life as a self-published e-book about a university student who gets seduced by Harry Styles.In the film, he is played by Ralph Fiennes' nephew, Hero-Fiennes Tiffin.To avoid legal issues, the character is renamed Hardin Scott for the movie - but otherwise, he is the same ""rude boy with too many tattoos and piercings"" who appeared in author Anna Todd's original book.As the title suggests, the People's Choice Awards are voted for by the public.Tiffin, who was previously best known as Tom Riddle in the Harry Potter series, posted a video thanking fans for their support at the US awards show.End of Youtube post by After movie videos All Nike SimonAustralian actress Josephine Langford, who played the film's heroine, Tessa Young, also thanked the ""many people"" who voted for After.""You're the best. It's not a debate, it's not a question, it's just a fact - you're the best,"" she said on her Instagram story.""We wouldn't have been nominated without you, we wouldn't have been able to film the first movie without you, we wouldn't have been able to film the sequel without you.""You deserve your own award.""Todd also thanked fans, saying ""you guys voted your hearts out for our little movie and we don't have enough words to thank you.""The 30-year-old first posted her One Direction fantasy to the story-sharing app WattPadd in 2013, under the pseudonym ""imaginator1D"".""When I started I had no followers but I did it for fun,"" she told the BBC last year. ""After I wrote the first chapter I wanted to know what happened - so every day I would write a chapter and it became more popular.""Written on a mobile phone, the tale quickly found an audience - it has been read more than 604 million times to date - and Todd landed a book and film deal.The movie adaptation came out in April, but failed to find favour with critics. Variety magazine was fairly neutral, calling it an ""innocuous teen pulp soap opera"" but the Los Angeles Times was more scathing, criticising the ""bad writing and barely sketched characters"".The Film Stage agreed, concluding that ""the talented cast is burdened by a dead on arrival screenplay that waters down what could have been an intoxicating tale of first love"".Despite that, fans flocked to see the film, which made $69.5m (£53.5m) at the global box office, against a production budget of $14m (£10.7m).The sequel, After We Collide, recently finished filming and is due for release next year.End of Youtube post by MovieAccessTrailersFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	American Music Awards: Taylor Swift puts feud to one side as she beats Michael Jackson's record		"Going into the American Music Awards, Taylor Swift became embroiled in a feud with her former record label over whether she had the right to play her old hits.In the end, she did get to perform songs like Blank Space and Love Story, while making a subtle nod to the spat.The star took to the stage in a prison-style white shirt, stencilled with the names of the six albums her old label owns, and sang The Man - a song about women's struggle to be taken seriously in the music industry.But the moment passed quickly; and Swift shed the outfit to reveal a more characteristic gold sequinned one-piece outfit, before launching into a 13-minute medley of her biggest songs.She was joined by Camila Cabello and Halsey to duet on an energetic performance of Shake It Off, and ended behind a pink piano, playing her recent single Lover as ballet dancers Misty Copeland and Craig Hall pirouetted in front of her.After standing for applause, Swift was presented with the Artist of the Decade award by legendary singer-songwriter Carole King, whose hits include I Feel The Earth Move and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.King commended Swift for the strength of her lyrics, and the relatability of her music before predicting: ""The best is yet to come.""In turn, Swift acknowledged the impact King's music had had on her parents and her family, saying it was every musician's goal ""to create something that will last"".Addressing her fans, Swift continued: ""This is an award that celebrates a decade of hard work and of art and of fun and memories, all that matters to me is the memories that I've had with you guys, with you the fans, over the years.""We've had fun, incredible, exhilarating, extraordinary times together and may it continue.""The career-spanning honour wasn't Swift's only award at the ceremony - she picked up another five competitive awards, including artist of the year.That brings her total tally of AMA trophies to 29 - breaking a record held by Michael Jackson, who received 24 American Music Awards.But the show, held at LA's Microsoft Theater, wasn't just about Swift.Billie Eilish made her award show debut, surrounded by pyrotechnics as she performed the brooding All The Good Girls Go To Hell.The 17-year-old went on to win two prizes - best new artist and favourite alternative rock artist, the latter of which seemed to take her by surprise.""I'm shaking,"" she told the audience, holding a half-sucked lollipop in her left hand. ""To even be mentioned in this category is insane to me.""I grew up being in love with all of you - everybody in this row, everybody in that row, everybody in this room. And the fact you guys are looking at me right now? That's crazy!""Going into the night, the most nominated artist was Post Malone, who had seven nods, including artist of the year, collaboration of the year and favourite male artist.In the end, he took home one prize, favourite hip-hop album, for his latest release Hollywood's Bleeding.Six-time nominee Ariana Grande, who missed the show to play a concert in Orlando, failed to win any of her categories; while K-Pop sensations BTS won tour of the year, favourite group and favourite social artist.The ceremony had a few awkward moments - Jamie Lee Curtis stood on Camila Cabello's dress, almost causing a wardrobe malfunction, while Selena Gomez suffered pitching issues while performing Lose You To Love Me, a song that contains a lyric about singing off-key.But there were show-stopping performances from Dua Lipa, Lizzo and Toni Braxton, who celebrated the 25th anniversary of her career by performing the multi-platinum hit Unbreak My Heart, accompanied by a string orchestra.Ozzy Osbourne joined Post Malone and Travis Scott to play Take What You Want; and Shawn Mendes got steamy with Camila Cabello during their performance of Senorita.The show closed with Shania Twain, who sang acoustic versions of Drake's God's Plan and Twenty One Pilots' Stressed Out, before launching into a medley of her greatest hits, including Still The One, That Don't Impress Me Much, and Man! I Feel Like a Woman.The performance marked her first AMA appearance since 2001. In the intervening years, she developed debilitating vocal problems that forced her to temporarily give up recording and performing - and her celebratory return brought the crowd to their feet.The full list of winners is as follows:Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Javier Botet: Meet the actor behind Hollywood's monsters		"On first glance, you probably wouldn't recognise Javier Botet.Though not a household name, the Spaniard has a portfolio that many in the movie business would kill for.Over the last few years, the 6ft 6in actor has starred in some of Hollywood's biggest horror and fantasy productions.From It to Mama to Slender Man - with a Game of Thrones cameo along the way - Javier has forged a reputation as one of the best creature actors in the industry.Spending his childhood in a small city north of Madrid, Javier developed a love of science fiction and the supernatural.He grew up drawing monsters and eventually moved to the capital to pursue art. While there, he started getting interested in cinema and producing short films.At one point, he went along to a special effects workshop. Both he and the tutor suggested his frame would be perfect to try out monster make-up on.""I didn't realise but I was born to perform,"" Javier says.""I have a disease called Marfan syndrome. It makes people skinnier, taller, and very flexible.""""So I was all my life very flexible, all my life doing weird tricks and things to enjoy with my friends [using] very creepy movement.""His condition means his limbs and fingers are longer than average and are able to move in unusual ways.The tutor put him forward for roles, and within a couple of months he got a small part in his first Spanish film. This set the ball rolling for exposure.His ""lucky break"" into Hollywood came while advertising his work in a Spanish horror film series, Rec 2, at a 2009 convention in Texas.There, he met Argentine director Andrés Muschietti promoting a short, called Mama, that he hoped to turn into a full feature.He told Javier he'd be perfect in the title role - and one year later, with Guillermo del Toro on-board as the film's producer, Javier was officially asked.But when the film came out in 2013, many fans assumed Mama - a female ghost - was created digitally.""So nobody really knew that 90% of what they saw was totally mine, was physical work,"" he says.In response, the makers decided to upload Javier's movement test, showing him moving eerily, utilising his hyper-flexibility.The clip has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times since. Many directors and producers have credited it for why they hired him.He laughs when joking that his ""best work"" was probably the YouTube clip.""So that was the real point that makes my career grow,"" he says. ""Because a lot of people knew that my work without CGI is almost as good - it doesn't need much more help in digital.""Since, he has starred in massive horror franchises like Insidious, Alien and The Conjuring.He also played parts in The Mummy, The Revenant and made a particularly memorable appearance as a leper in the 2017 remake of Steven King's It.The film became a break-out box office success in 2017 - and later this year he will also star in the sequel with a new adult cast.Most recently, he was seen as a member of the un-dead stalking Arya Stark in an epic episode of Game of Thrones' final series.As a life-long fan of the genre, he describes working on these productions with major Hollywood stars as ""like a gift"".Javier says he never gets scared by what he sees in the mirror. His social media accounts are full of funny behind-the-scenes photographs and videos, often in full costume.After long day working and before remove the make up.

After initially being scared, she now even takes friends along to the cinema to see Javier's films when he is working out of the country.""In the beginning it was a little harder. She'd say 'I want you to play drama roles and a nice guy',"" Javier says.In Spain, it isn't all horror though - Javier stars in comedies and writes and directs his own work, too.But he still really enjoys his Hollywood horror roles - and always tries to learn new techniques, like dance, to enrich his performances.Transforming into these roles can involve hours and hours in the make-up chair.One of the people responsible for bringing his characters to life is Spanish make-up artist David Martí from DDTSFX.He has worked with Javier on several films, including Crimson Peak, which also starred another ""monster"" actor heavyweight in Doug Jones. David won an Oscar for his work on Jones in Pan's Labyrinth.Having also grown up in Spain in the 1980s, David recalls trying to teach himself how to create horror looks, inspired by imported US magazines like Fangoria.It was a lot of trial and error. In one example, he remembers not understanding what ""foam latex"" was and tried to use sofa filling to recreate a look.Thanks to everyone for your beautiful birthday wishes!!! I hope to feel this joy for doing make-up for the next 100 years 😂 Gracias a todos por vuestros hermosos buenos deseos en mi cumple. Espero sentir esta ilusión por el maquillaje en los próximos 100 años! 😂. #birthday #goodvibes #ddt #ddtsfx #makeup #specialmakeup #monsters #makeupeffects #animatronics #silicone #work #professional #art #artwork #ilovemyjob #instapoblenou #barcelonaA post shared by David Marti (@daviddtsfx) on Feb 13, 2019 at 12:24pm PSTEnd of Instagram post by daviddtsfx""It was all, you know, research and you know, and a lot of accidents at that beginning because obviously there was no internet, there was no information,"" he says.He describes the final product of creatures and characters as often a collaboration - with some directors more involved in the concept than others.He says the final look can be a development process, with designs often changing throughout production.David has high praise for the actors, including Javier, beneath all the make-up.""A lot of times they call them creature performers or monster guy - which is not correct, they are actors,"" David says. ""I see people like Doug or Javier and it's like 'What the hell?' You should not wear a mask.""He says he briefly considered whether he should switch professions to CGI in the 1990s after seeing its pioneering use in productions like Jurassic Park - assuming his job would eventually become redundant.""But CGI didn't take us out of a job, it's actually giving us more of a job and that's a good thing,"" David says.Often the two skills can complement each other. On Mama and Crimson Peak, digital effects were added to enhance DDTSFX's work.Javier believes that no matter how far technology goes, actors like himself will always have value in the industry.""When there's something digital, anything can happen. It's like a cartoon - you lose the scare and the fear,"" he says.""I'd rather 100 times that you feel something is real, you can touch it, it exists and it can happen.""The disrespectful @miloanthonyventimiglia with extraterrestrial life 👽.

entertainment	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: Exploring Tarantino's return	Pitt and DiCaprio are the new Redford and NewmanHollywood plays itself on screenThe Manson murders are only part of the storyDiCaprio sets Nazis on fireDiversity still in questionFeet remain Tarantino's fascination	"Lights, camera, action! The first reviews are in for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the latest movie from director Quentin Tarantino, following its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival yesterday.The filmmaker's ninth effort, a typically flamboyant take on 1969 Tinseltown prior to the Manson murders, has so far received glowing praise from critics, with The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw deeming it ""entirely outrageous, disorientating, irresponsible, and also brilliant"".It has also drawn comparisons to Tarantino's 90s pop culture landmark Pulp Fiction, 25 years on from its release at the festival.Here are six talking points from the reviews and its latest trailer, dropped amid the glitz and glamour of the film's debut screening.The pairing of two of Hollywood's most high-profile leading men appears to be an inspired partnership.Rick Dalton, played by DiCaprio, is a failing cowboy actor and alcoholic, whose best friend, Cliff Boon - a long-time stunt double - is brought to life by Brad Pitt.Together the pair are said to deliver ""killer"" performances, ""dripping with self irony and pleasurable chemistry"" according to The Hollywood Reporter.""It's hard not to think back to the energy of the previous best pairing in a Tarantino film, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction,"" added Time Out.Robert Redford and Paul Newman made two classic films together, The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, so should we expect a remake of either in the pipeline?As a ""spectacularly detailed nostalgic splatter collage of a film"" paying homage to the lost era of Hollywood, a number of famed movie industry names are dramatised on the silver screen.Rafal Zawierucha plays director Roman Polanski, while Margot Robbie dominates as his wife Sharon Tate, in the months prior to her tragic murder by the Manson Family.Other notable portrayals include:Prior to the film's release, speculation mounted that the film would revolve around the murderous impact of cult leader Charles Manson upon Hollywood.In 1969, his followers, known as the Manson Family, killed nine people, including the heavily pregnant Tate, while Polanski was filming abroad.One of Manson's young followers, Susan Atkins, stabbed the actress to death and scrawled ""PIG"" on the home's front door with her blood.The murders sent shock waves through the US film industry and has traditionally been credited with bringing a bloody end to the 60s counterculture free love generation.It's a narrative that Once Upon a Time rejects with an ""outrageous riposte"" says The Evening Standard. Instead, it begins six months prior to the murders, exploring ""Tinseltown in that brief moment after the glitter wore off but before the tarnish set in,"" says Sight and Sound.This is not to say Manson does not loom heavily. One of his songs features in the soundtrack, while the murders act as a ""shocking"" curtain-closer states The Telegraph. However, the bloodshed is certainly not the main focus.The exact way it is climactically played out on screen remains a mystery (Tarantino sent a pleading letter to critics asking them not to reveal his approach), but IndieWire's write-up suggests a delicate handling of the tragedy: ""There's even a late monologue from one of the Manson killers about the fetishisation of murder and violence in entertainment,"" it reads ,""that registers as Tarantino reducing his most conservative critics to the worst possible caricatures.""The trailer shows DiCaprio's character Dalton flaming Nazis on set during a flashback to his apparent glory days.It's a tongue-in-cheek throwback to his 2009 film Inglorious Basterds, and typical of Tarantino's fondness for over-dramatic violence.At the time of the film's initial casting announcement, eyebrows were raised about the all-white lead cast roster.Granted, the addition of Moh as Lee has added a brief flash of racial diversity since then, but the trailer remains overwhelmingly white.This almost literal whitewashing has sparked lively debate on social media, particularly given Tarantino's previous support for black talent in the 90s, long before #OscarsSoWhite.The director has also faced criticism for his liberal use of the N word in past scripts, but has been defended by long-time acting partners - including Samuel L Jackson and Jamie Foxx - as simply reflecting the realistic speech patterns of the characters in question.Hawk-eyed followers of Tarantino's work over the past three decades have recognised feet feature prominently in his films.Think of The Bride's ""Wiggle your big toe"" scene in Kill Bill or the aforementioned Inglorious Basterds' Hans Landa verifying a shoe found at the scene of a shootout was that of actress Bridget von Hammersmark - the camera lingering lovingly on her bare foot.An apparent foot fetish? An in-joke? The exact on-screen reason remains unclear.But one thing's for sure, there are plenty of bare feet in Once Upon a Time.""And in case you'd forgotten Tarantino's weird thing about women's feet, this movie is here to remind us in a big way,"" warns The Hollywood Reporter.Or, as Sight and Sound concluded, it's Tarantino's ""barefoot eulogy"" to the industry he adores.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is set to be released in the UK on August 15, 2019.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It inspired Will Schuester - played by Matthew Morrison - to take over the club.The famous photo appeared in the show's final scene, and Galloway Heitz only actually appeared in person on the show twice, in the same flashback scene in 2009 and 2015.Alongside her own acting, she helped to nurture the talents of a young Carell (well known for the US Office and films such as Foxcatcher, The Big Short and The 40-year-old Virgin), as well as chat show host Stephen Colbert.Her casting also helped launch the careers of actors Richard Kind, who starred in Mad About You and Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Modern Family star Eric Stonestreet.Stonestreet led the tributes, crediting Galloway Heitz for his success, while describing her as a ""a great friend and mentor"".She sold her agency in 1997 to pursue her own acting career.As well as playing roles in other TV shows like the US version of Shameless, Galloway Heitz also appeared in films including the 2007 crime thriller, I Know Who Killed Me and David Lynch's The Straight Story, in 1999.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Doris Day, Hollywood actress and singer, dies aged 97		"Hollywood legend Doris Day, whose films made her one of the biggest stars of all time, has died aged 97.The singer turned actress starred in films such as Calamity Jane and Pillow Talk and had a hit in 1956 with Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).Her screen partnership with Rock Hudson is one of the best-known in the history of romantic movies.In a statement, the Doris Day Animal Foundation said she died on Monday at her home in Carmel Valley, California.It said she had been ""in excellent physical health for her age, until recently contracting a serious case of pneumonia"".""She was surrounded by a few close friends as she passed,"" the statement continued.Born Doris Mary Ann Von Kappelhoff in April 1922, Day originally wanted to be a dancer but had to abandon her dream after breaking her right leg in a car accident.Instead she began her singing career at the age of 15. Her first hit, Sentimental Journey, would become a signature tune.Her films, which included Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much and That Touch of Mink, made her known around the world.But she never won an Oscar and was nominated only once, in 1960, for Pillow Talk, the first of her three romantic comedies with Hudson.Honours she did receive included the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 and a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2008.Her last release, the compilation album My Heart, went to number one in the UK in 2011.Day's wholesome, girl-next-door image was a popular part of her myth that sometimes invited ridicule.""I've been around so long, I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin,"" the musician Oscar Levant once remarked.Day herself said her ""Miss Chastity Belt"" image was ""more make-believe than any film part [she] ever played.""Her life was certainly not as sunny. She married four times, was divorced three times and was widowed once.She also suffered a mental breakdown and had severe financial trouble after one husband squandered her money.In the 1970s, she turned away from performing to focus her energies on her animal foundation.According to the organisation, she wished to have no funeral, memorial service or grave marker.Dick Van Dyke, another Hollywood legend from the same era although he never worked with Day, said she had an ""energy about her"".""She wasn't trying to act. It was just who Doris Day was, I think, a great energy and exhilaration, and she seemed to love life, at least that's the impression you got,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""It was a great era.""Star Trek actor William Shatner remembered Day on Twitter as ""the World's Sweetheart,"" saying she was ""beloved by all"".Fellow Star Trek cast member George Takei said she was ""synonymous with Hollywood icon"", while Spanish actor Antonio Banderas wrote: ""Thank you for your talent.""Novelist Paulo Coelho marked her passing by quoting lyrics from Secret Love, one of her numbers in Calamity Jane.""We've lost another great Hollywood talent,"" tweeted Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, while actor Luke Evans said he had ""always loved"" her voice and ""beautiful"" songs.Former Beatles member Paul McCartney paid tribute to Day on his website, describing her as ""very funny lady who I shared many laughs with"", adding: ""I will miss her but will always remember her twinkling smile and infectious laugh"".And his daughter, fashion designer Stella McCartney, shared a photo of her and Day alongside words which read: ""The one, the only, the woman who inspired so much of what I do.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

He also hopes to use it to stage film, music and theatre events.In his previous life, he was an actor, writer, producer and director who never quite made it big in Hollywood.His early attempts to do so were depicted in low-budget documentary Rhinoskin: The Making of a Movie Star.He then wrote, directed and appeared in the well-received independent rom-com The Last Big Attraction, before setting up a film festival and a movie company in his native Michigan and performing stand-up comedy.He's now going back to comedy, turning the lighter moments from his move from Hollywood to Middleton - and his attempts to save his ancestors' crumbling mansion - into a stand-up show.The 49-year-old will perform in Brighton, Manchester and London before going to the Edinburgh Fringe.""The way people in Hollywood do business versus the way English people do business is totally different, and I'm learning a lot from being here,"" he says.""Hollywood is very temporary. When people talk about an old building, it's from the 1920s. It's fun, it's exciting, but when you come to Middleton, this hall's been here for 600 years.""So everything is rooted in a sense of longevity and history and tradition. Life here feels much more grounded and rooted in reality. That's probably the biggest difference. That and the weather.""The Hopwood family lived in the hall until the 1920s, after both sons were killed during WW1. Hopwood DePree is related to them through his great-grandmother, and Hopwood was passed down that line of the family as a forename.The first time the young Hopwood heard about a family pile was when his grandfather would tell him about somewhere called Hopwood Hall.""But I never thought it existed,"" he says. ""I thought he was telling fairytales. And I hated the name Hopwood. I was embarrassed for it because I was an easy target. I used to get beat up for it.""DePree first travelled over from the US to see it in 2014 after hearing about its dilapidated state. He knew he couldn't leave it to rot, and moved his life over the Pond.Much of the comedy in his stand-up show stems from the fish-out-of-water story that ensued.""Coming to a whole new country really was like starting over,"" he says. ""When you come to a new country, you don't have credit, you don't have a car, you don't have a bank account, health insurance, a doctor, a lawyer.""I guess there's a lot of trying to re-learn society. And trying to take up a lot of tea and drive on the wrong side of the road and eat fish and chips all the time. I got laughed out of the local chippy for trying to pay with my American Express card!""He's also been impressed to discover the power of a good brew. ""I love how the key to fixing anything going wrong in Britain seems to be tea,"" he says.""I remember one time when Bob the caretaker said to me, 'The ceiling in the long corridor just collapsed, water is pouring into a leak in the Georgian room and a window in the chapel was just smashed by a rock thrown by a vandal. Can I get you a cup of tea?'""The comedy will also come, he says, from what is in effect the home renovation from hell, and from stories he's uncovered from the hall's history.""There was a murder here in the 1500s, which is a little bit awkward because the neighbours are still the same. It's the same family on the same farm.""What do I do? Do I go over there and bring them a muffin basket? How do I make up for this whole murdering thing?""As well as doing the stand-up show (titled The Yank Is A Manc!), DePree is pitching a reality TV show - part comedy, part history, part home makeover - to US TV.Despite his background in Hollywood, one thing he hasn't done yet is write a screenplay about an LA dude who uproots his entire life to renovate his 600-year-old ancestral home between Manchester and Rochdale.The blond, big-dreaming American incomer would surely be played by Owen Wilson, who starred in 2006 comedy You, Me and Dupree (although DePree insists any similarities with the name and appearance in that movie are purely coincidental).""I haven't written a screenplay but I have been writing a book,"" he says. ""I guess it could be a screenplay, but I haven't got that far yet, mainly because I don't know how it ends.""We need a happy ending.""Hopwood DePree's The Yank Is A Manc runs at the Brighton Fringe from 13-19 May before the Manchester Fringe in July and the Camden Fringe and Edinburgh Fringe in August.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	US school's Alien play impresses Hollywood insiders		"A US high school's elaborate production of the 1979 science fiction film Alien has been praised by Hollywood stars.North Bergen High School, in New Jersey, staged the play on 19 and 22 March.Scenes from the show have gone viral with stars, including Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood, expressing amazement at the production's costumes and sets.All the online attention has led the North Bergen mayor to offer to fund more performances of the play.Ridley Scott's film is about the crew of the mining spaceship Nostromo, who are gradually hunted down by a vicious alien.It made a star of Sigourney Weaver, who played warrant officer Ellen Ripley and launched a film franchise that is still going 40 years later.English teacher Perfecto Cuervo adapted the play for the school's drama club from the film's screenplay.Cuervo also filmed a trailer for Alien: The Play, which was released online ahead of opening night.The students created the alien and space suit costumes, as well as sets that included airlock doors with moving parts and the so-called ""space jockey"" - the lone pilot of a derelict spaceship, which the Nostromo crew investigates.One student, who posted a thread about the play on Reddit, shared details of how some scenes - such as the iconic chest-burster scene - were staged.In the scene, an alien bursts out of one actor's chest, while the crew are sitting down to dinner. The student says ""someone was underneath the table with a hand puppet"" to achieve the effect.The detailed sets and costumes have impressed many social media users, who have shared scenes from the play.Comedian Paul Scheer, who played Stevie in the award-winning political comedy Veep, posted a series of tweets about the play, concluding that he'd like to see it open on Broadway.The governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, congratulated the school on an ""out of this world"" performance.The students' efforts were also praised on the official Alien Twitter account.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Johnny Depp settles long legal battle with lawyer	'Litigation train'	"Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has settled a long-running legal battle with a former lawyer he accused of wrongly collecting millions of dollars in fees.A lawyer representing Depp said he had won an ""eight-figure"" settlement from Jake Bloom's firm, Bloom Hergott.Depp had alleged Mr Bloom improperly collected more than $30m (£23m) over their 18-year working relationship.A trial had been scheduled to begin in December.In a statement, Depp's lawyer Adam Waldman said: ""Today, Bloom Hergott provided Johnny Depp an eight-figure payment to settle Mr Depp's lawsuit against the firm for fraud, conflict of interest, disgorgement of over $30m in voidable fees and other malfeasance that they engaged in over nearly two decades.""Depp, who has starred in blockbuster films including Pirates Of The Caribbean, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Alice In Wonderland, sued Mr Bloom in October 2017.He argued their agreement should have been in writing, rather than based on a handshake as is often the case in Hollywood.Mr Bloom counter-sued and asked a judge to throw the case out. But in August 2018, Depp, 56, scored a key victory when a judge in Los Angeles ruled in his favour.Bloom Hergott's lawyer Bryan Freedman confirmed a settlement has been reached, saying it was for a ""fraction"" of Depp's original demand.He added: ""While the firm was confident it would prevail at trial, we are nonetheless pleased with this resolution as it expedites the firm's winding down process and allows it to get off the endless Johnny Depp litigation train.""Depp was previously involved in another legal dispute with his former managers, the Management Group.He accused them of mishandling his affairs and pushing him to the brink of financial ruin.The group responded by saying Depp had been responsible for his own financial woes, accusing him of spending millions of dollars on luxury homes, wine, art and a cannon used to scatter the ashes of writer Hunter S Thompson. That case was settled in July 2018.The star currently remains locked in a legal battle with his ex-wife, the actress Amber Heard, who he accused of defamation over a newspaper column in which she described herself as a victim of domestic abuse.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Nudity and sex scenes guidance launched for UK directors		"Directors UK has published its first guidelines for scenes involving nudity and simulated sex.The body that represents UK TV and film directors is aiming to show best practice for working with actors, intimacy coordinators, and others.The news comes a day after Emilia Clarke said she found Game of Thrones' nude scenes ""hard"" and that she was pressured to go naked in other roles.""Everyone deserves the right to feel safe at work,"" Directors UK said.""This is just as true when working on a Hollywood blockbuster as it is on a prime-time drama or a debut short film.""The new guidelines, which are supported by industry bodies including Bafta, Equity, the BFI and the Casting Directors' Guild, come in the wake of the #MeToo movement and allegations that some bosses demanded sexual favours for acting work.The guidelines advise a ban on full nudity in any audition or call back and no semi-nudity in first auditions.The document states that ""by their nature, auditions are based on a power imbalance"", and that ""some performers can feel obligated to agree to uncomfortable requests to get a job"".Instead they suggest performers wear a bikini or trunks and also bring a chaperone, as well as demanding 48 hours' notice and full-scripts be given for any recalls that require semi-nudity.Productions must also obtain explicit written consent from the performer prior to them being filmed or photographed nude or semi-nude.""The director, as the creative lead on a production, should set the tone for a professional and respectful on-set environment,"" said UK Directors film committee chair Susanna White.""We are all here because we want to tell compelling and impactful stories, and no member of a cast or crew should ever be put in a position where they feel unsafe, exploited or mismanaged — especially when making sensitive material.""The Bafta-winning director, whose work includes Generation Kill, Parade's End and Bleak House, added: ""Throughout my career, I have seen how vitally important it is to know how to approach sensitive content with professionalism.""The guidelines created by Directors UK set the standard for directing intimate scenes, and will help to foster a safe working environment for everyone on a film or television set.""A statement from Bafta described Directors UK as being ""hugely instrumental"" in addressing ""bullying and harassment"" in the industry.""They've really embraced the agenda and have created a suite of additional resources which build on the guidance and help their members not only to tackle poor behaviour when they witness it, but also to recognise their role in creating an environment where bullying, harassment and all kinds of coercive behaviour are not tolerated.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	The best photos from the American Music Awards		"Taylor Swift was the big winner at the 2019 American Music Awards, taking home six trophies, including artist of the year.The star now has 29 AMAs in total, overtaking Michael Jackson as the show's most-awarded star.And while Swift dominated the prize-giving, there were plenty more memorable moments on the night. Here are some of the best images.Halsey gave one of the night's most memorable performances, duelling in paint with a female backing dancer during the torrid break-up anthem Without You.Pop's hottest couple, Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes, gave a steamy performance of their hit single Senorita, which went on to win collaboration of the year.Show host Ciara made a stunning entrance, descending from the rafters in a glittered hoop; before performing her latest single Melanin.Billie Eilish and Billy Porter upped the headgear ante on the red carpet. We're calling these looks ""beekeper in pyjamas"" and ""Swiss cheese Pope"".Eilish went on to give one of the night's best performances, a pyrotechnically-assisted version of her current single All The Good Girls Go To Hell.It was the 17-year-old's first award show and she went on to win two prizes, best new artist and best alternative artist.""Thank you to the fans and supporters and anyone who gives an eff about me,"" she said, getting censored by US broadcaster ABC in the process.Lil Nas X won best hip-hop single for his viral hit song Old Town Road; and came dressed in a lime-green zebra print suit.Pop star Selena Gomez posed for selfies with fans on the red carpet.The star went on to open the ceremony, with a double performance of her new singles, Lose You To Love Me and Look At Her Now.Despite suffering vocal problems, the star got a good reaction from the audience, with cameras showing fans singing and dancing along to the songs, including her close friend Taylor Swift.Two hours later, Shania Twain closed the ceremony with a hit-strewn, leopard print-heavy megamix of her greatest hits.2019's biggest breakout star Lizzo turned heads by bringing a minuscule handbag onto the red carpet. Presumably it contained the one Strepsil she needed to recover after her throat-shredding performance of Jerome.Green Day celebrating the 25th anniversary of their 1994 breakthrough album Dookie, performing one of their earliest hits, Basket Case to an enthusiastic response.Six-time nominee Ariana Grande couldn't make it to the ceremony, but she lent her ponytail to Dua Lipa who put it to good use in an high-octane performance of her new single, Don't Start Now.Ozzy Osbourne joined Post Malone and Travis Scott to perform Take What You Want.The former Black Sabbath singer, who has suffered from various health issues in 2019, stayed seated in a throne for most of the performance.Post Malone later won best hip-hop album for Hollywood's Bleeding; and closed his acceptance speech with one of the night's most puzzling statements.""I love grapes,"" he said, ""so thank you so much.""R&B star Toni Braxton gave a stirring rendition of her classic ballad Un-Break My Heart (although, to be honest, we always preferred the Frankie Knuckles remix).Carrie Underwood was interrupted as she accepted the award for best country album - to be told she'd also won the prize for favourite country artist.""Oh, so it's a good surprise!"" she said, clearly taken aback. ""I was worried for a minute.""Kesha made a triumphant return to the ceremony after a six-year absence, dressed in pastel pink robes and announcing: ""Welcome to our Sunday Service"".It wasn't exactly a religious sermon, but she took the audience to church by incorporating a snippet of her party anthem Tik Tok in the middle of her new single, Raising Hell.Six years after performing their hit song Say Something at the 2013 American Music Awards, Christina Aguilera and musical duo A Great Big World joined forces again to perform their new single Fall On Me on Sunday night.Aguilera is currently celebrating the 20th anniversary of her debut album; and reminisced about her early days as a cast member on the Mickey Mouse Club on the red carpet.""Those guys, they really know how to recruit some superstars,"" she said. ""Miley had a Disney background, too. And Ariana, I think. They just know how to cast some great people and great kids who just go on to big things. So, yes, Mickey Mouse Club, that was my old stomping ground. So always a Disney girl.""Taylor Swift's feud with her old record label, Big Machine, threatened to overshadow the ceremony, with the singer saying she'd been banned from playing songs like Shake It Off and Love Story during her performance.The dispute was resolved in time for the show - but Swift took to the stage wearing a shirt stencilled with the names of her first six albums, which Big Machine still controls the rights to.She also performed The Man, whose lyrics deal with the lack of equality in the music industry: ""I'm so sick of running / As fast as I can,"" she sang. ""Wondering if I'd get there quicker / If I was a man.""After that, though, the singer shed the shirt and started on a 13-minute greatest hits medley, including a duet with Camila Cabello and Halsey on Shake It Off.Taylor Swift relaxed with her trophies after the ceremony. Although how she stood up with all that weight pinning down her dress is anyone's guess. Perhaps she'll be stuck there forever.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Oscars 2019: Roma's success shows there's more to movies than Hollywood	This year's shortlist is:CapernaumCold WarNever Look AwayRomaShoplifters	Alfonso Cuaron's Netflix epic Roma could become the first ever winner of both best picture and best foreign language film at the Oscars. Its success could change how the category is perceived - and shine a light on the four other worthy nominees.In the last decade, there have been changes almost annually to how the Oscars arrive at their shortlist for best foreign language film.The category has existed since 1947 and the number of films involved grows almost every year. There were 87 this year, and no-one could view them all. So in recent years, volunteers would split into three groups to judge a portion each.But this year there are new bosses and they've changed the system yet again. To boost inclusivity, it was hoped more members would vote, although most will see fewer films each.For now, the unique fact about the 91st Academy Awards is that the hot tip for winner as foreign language film could well clean up in other categories too - Alfonso Cuaron's Roma has 10 nominations in all.Strictly speaking, the Academy Award goes to the winning nation. But since 2015 the director's name has appeared on the Oscar statuette too.Country: LebanonLanguage: Arabic with some AmharicLebanon's track record in this category: The country's first nomination was last year, for The InsultDirector: Nadine LabakiStory:Life among the poorest of the poor in Beirut. Zain is a sparky 12-year-old who's angry at his poor Syrian parents for making his sister go off with a man she dislikes. He runs away and strikes up a friendship with Rahil, a cleaner from Ethiopia who lives in a shack with her young child. This central story plays as an extended flashback as Zain takes his parents to court, suing them for giving him life.Chances of winning:There are strong elements - especially the performances of Zain al Rafeea and Yordanos Shiferaw as Zain and Rahil. Neither is a professional actor. The film gives a convincing picture of life for the poorest immigrants in Lebanon - particularly for women and children.The circumstances Zain grows up in will strike a chord elsewhere. But the framing device feels clumsy and improbable: it undermines a film which otherwise has the power to move.Country: PolandLanguage: PolishPoland's track record: 10 previous nominations. The sole winner was the same director's Ida four years ago.Director: Pawel PawlikowskiStory:The film, shot in black and white, covers some 15 years of Polish history from the late 1940s. Wiktor and the young singer Zula meet and fall profoundly in love - but will they ever get their lives in sync? Wiktor leaves Poland amid the complexities of 1950s politics and the story follows him to Paris.Chances of winning:Modern writers and directors aren't great at constructing grown-up love stories. Pawlikowski, whose career has mainly been in the UK, has shot and co-written a story in which the audience senses that two attractive people were made for one another and wants them to get together.The film also reveals a lot about post-war Poland, creating other convincing characters along the way. It looks beautiful and it's the film with the best chance of pushing Roma out of the way.Country: GermanyLanguage: GermanGermany's track record: 19 nominations (including one for East Germany) including three wins.Director: Florian Henckel von DonnersmarckStory:An epic based in part on the real-life German artist Gerhard Richter, who was born in 1932. Kurt (played by Tom Schilling) is born in Dresden in the Nazi era and becomes an artist in post-war East Germany.He falls in love with Elizabeth, whose father, a hospital administrator, is a former Nazi who conspired in the death of Kurt's aunt. The film (more than three hours long) moves to West Germany for the 1960s.Chances of winning:The director took the foreign language Oscar in 2006 for The Lives of Others, which was set in the German Democratic Republic and which many critics loved. It became a big international hit.But Never Look Away has met less acclaim on US release, with many reviewers considering the running-time excessive. Some praised the film's look and ambition but others found it meandering. Damaging publicity came when Gerhard Richter was sharply disapproving of how the film uses parts of his life.Country: MexicoLanguage: Spanish, MixtecMexico's track record: Eight previous nominations - no wins.Director: Alfonso CuaronStory:Cleo is the live-in maid for a prosperous couple in Mexico. She is of indigenous descent. (Colonia Roma is a middle-class district of Mexico City.) The marriage of Sofia and Antonio is clearly under strain and eventually he leaves, although the children are told he's gone away to work. The children at times seem spoiled but are genuinely fond of Cleo. She becomes pregnant and we come to understand her better and see some of the tensions in Mexican society.Chances of winning:Many view Roma as the inevitable winner in this category. It's a superb bit of film-making and combines narrative drive with a poetic sensibility that doesn't ignore real-life tensions in the Mexico of the early 1970s. Like Cold War, it's shot in black and white. If it becomes the first winner in this category also to take best picture, it will be a big moment in Oscar history. Or will Academy voters decide that to reward Roma as foreign film would be overkill, depriving other film-makers of the boost an Oscar brings?Country: JapanLanguage: JapaneseJapan's track record: 15 previous nominations, four winsDirector: Hirokazu Kore-edaStory:Another insight into the harsh realities of poverty. Osamu and Nobuyo are a couple barely getting by financially in a house in blue-collar Tokyo. They're living with an old woman who enjoys their company. They bring a young girl into the home who they think may be a victim of abuse. In some ways the household is a loving one but the group survives only by shoplifting - a skill in which they've become expert. Eventually their survival tactic is uncovered.Chances of winning:The film offers a view of Japan unfamiliar to outsiders. The screenplay doesn't portray the family as caricature loveable rogues but we do come to understand the pressures they face. Both the adults and the children are well played and we care about what happens to them. It's notable that, as with Roma and Capernaum, fault-lines of class, income and ethnicity shape the narrative. But with two strong frontrunners, it's not likely Japan will take the Oscar this year.The Oscars will take place on Sunday, 24 February.
entertainment	Olivia Colman: From TV comedy actress to Hollywood award winner		From her breakthrough in TV comedies in the early 2000s to her award-winning performance on the big screen in The Favourite in 2019, British actress Olivia Colman is fast becoming both a national treasure and a major Hollywood player.She has already won a Golden Globe for best actress so far this awards season and been shortlisted for a Bafta, with an Oscar nomination likely later this month.At the age of 44, Colman has reached star status after appearing in a vast array of TV shows and films.She first caught our attention as a sidekick to Robert Webb and David Mitchell in sketch shows and sitcoms like Peep Show, Bruiser and That Mitchell and Webb Look (pictured).In 2008, she appeared in a BBC Four drama to mark the centenary of Mills & Boon, playing a typist who writes a steamy hospital romance. The cast also included a certain Jodie Whittaker as the wife of the publishing house's co-founder Charles Boon.Colman played mum Debbie in BBC Two's Beautiful People a year later, a story about a boy who rose from his suburban English upbringing to running a New York fashion house.The wife of Tom Hollander's priest in BBC sitcom Rev often found herself below his flock in her husband's priorities.The actress showed a different side in the hard-hitting independent film Tyrannosaur in 2011, and credits director Paddy Considine with allowing her to show her dramatic skills.That led to roles in tougher shows like Accused (Mo's Story), an instalment of Jimmy McGovern's crime anthology. It earned her a Bafta TV Award for best supporting actress in 2013.At the same ceremony, she also won best female performance in a TV comedy for playing Sally, the PA to Hugh Bonneville's Olympic mandarin in the BBC's Twenty Twelve.Another big hit came in the form of ITV's crime drama Broadchurch, in which she played DS Ellie Miller opposite David Tennant, earning her another Bafta the following year.She popped up as a gloriously hideous stepmother in Phoebe Waller-Bridge's comedy Fleabag - and received yet another Bafta TV nomination.Her role as spy boss Angela in glossy drama The Night Manager led to her first Golden Globe win - for best supporting actress in a limited TV series in 2017.Two years on, she now has another Golden Globe, thanks to her delectable performance as the fragile Queen Anne in The Favourite.And she will be seen playing another monarch later in 2019 when she takes over the role of Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix's royal saga The Crown.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	James Dean CGI 'casting' angers Avengers star Chris Evans		"Plans to feature a CGI version of long-dead actor James Dean in upcoming film Finding Jack have been greeted with scorn by some Hollywood stars.Magic City Films obtained the rights to use Dean's image from his family.""This is awful... the complete lack of understanding here is shameful,"" tweeted Avengers actor Chris Evans, while Lord of the Rings' Elijah Wood added: ""NOPE.""Producer Anton Ernst said he will try to keep Dean's ""legacy firmly intact"".""We feel very honoured that his family supports us,"" he said.""The family views this as his fourth movie, a movie he never got to make. We do not intend to let his fans down.""Zelda Williams, daughter of late actor Robin, was among others to express reservations, accusing the producers of ""puppeteering the dead"".""It sets such an awful precedent for the future of performance,"" she tweeted. ""We should let the great performers of the past rest.""Dean, star of Rebel Without a Cause and Giant, died in 1955 aged 24.He will be recreated in the action drama through a mixture of old footage and computer-generated creations projected over stand-ins.According to the Hollywood Reporter, Finding Jack will tell of a US soldier who nurses a wounded yellow Labrador back to health while serving in Vietnam.The film is based on a 2013 novel by Gareth Crocker that was inspired by the abandonment of more than 10,000 military dogs at the end of the conflict.Dean will ""appear"" as a secondary character called Rogan, a platoon leader whose life is saved by the film's titular animal.""We searched high and low for the perfect character to portray the role of Rogan,"" said Ernst. ""After months of research, we decided on James Dean.""CGI - which stands for computer generated imagery - is increasingly being used in films, television and advertising to resurrect performers from another era.Audrey Hepburn's likeness was used in a 2013 advert, while Peter Cushing's face was digitally mapped onto another actor's features for 2016's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.The same film featured a computer-generated version of Carrie Fisher that recreated how she appeared in the original Star Wars film, 1977's Episode IV - A New Hope.Oliver Reed and Paul Walker are among other actors whose performances were ""completed"" after their deaths using computer imagery and stand-ins.More recently, ""de-ageing"" technology was used to enable Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci to play younger versions of themselves in crime drama The Irishman.Finding Jack is scheduled for release in November 2020.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Hollywood red carpets cancelled out of respect after wildfires		"Red carpets at Hollywood screenings of new films starring Nicole Kidman and Viola Davis have been cancelled as wildfires rage in California.Stars were expected to step out before screenings of movies including Davis's Widows and Kidman's Destroyer at the American Film Institute's AFI Fest.But the glitzy red carpet walks were called off out of respect to those affected by the fires.The official death toll has risen to 48, with dozens of people missing.Annapurna Pictures, which is distributing Destroyer, said the film-makers, cast and crew ""express their deepest condolences to the victims and those who have been affected and are extremely grateful to all who have risked their lives in responding"".20th Century Fox also cancelled its event for Widows, directed by Oscar-winner Steve McQueen.A spokesperson said the studio would match the cost of its post-screening event with a donation to a disaster relief fund based in Los Angeles.It follows the cancellation of red carpets for Mark Wahlberg comedy Instant Family, the Coen Brothers' The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and the Sandra Bullock thriller Bird Box.Meanwhile, after losing their home to the fire earlier in the week, singer Miley Cyrus and her actor partner Liam Hemsworth have donated $500,000 (£385,000) to The Malibu Foundation through Cyrus' charity Happy Hippie.Yesterday, Hemsworth shared a photo of their home's remains.""I spent the day in Malibu yesterday and it was amazing to see the community pulling together to help each other out in any way they can,"" the actor wrote on Twitter.Lady Gaga, who evacuated her home last Friday, was spotted at a Red Cross shelter in California with pizza, coffee and gift cards to give to those who have also had to leave their homes.""Thank you to the Red Cross for all you are doing to provide shelter, love and mental health support to the people of California,"" the pop star wrote in her Instagram story.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Burt Reynolds: Hollywood star dies at 82		"Burt Reynolds, the wisecracking 1970s movie heartthrob and Oscar nominee, has died at the age of 82.He reportedly died in a Florida hospital from a heart attack with his family by his side.The moustachioed megastar underwent heart bypass surgery in 2010. Reynolds is survived by his son, Quinton.He shot to fame in 1972's Deliverance, becoming a Hollywood legend with his roles in Smokey and the Bandit, The Cannonball Run and Boogie Nights.The veteran actor's agent, Todd Eisner, said his death was ""heartbreaking"".Reynolds died at the Jupiter Medical Center in Florida.The movie star's niece, Nancy Lee Hess, told the BBC his death had left the family ""with a broken heart"".""My uncle was not just a movie icon, he was a generous, passionate and sensitive man who was dedicated to his family, friends, fans and acting students,"" she said.""He has had health issues, however, this was totally unexpected.""She added: ""I want to thank all of his amazing fans who have always supported and cheered him on, through all of the hills and valleys of his life and career.""Reynolds' breakout movie role was in 1972's Deliverance, which told the tale of four friends attacked while on a canoeing trip in rural Georgia.The box office hit netted three Oscar nominations and made him a Hollywood sex symbol.That same year Reynolds broke a publishing taboo by posing for a nearly nude centrefold in Cosmopolitan magazine, which he later said was a ""really stupid"" idea.His career peaked in 1977 when he played trucker Bo Darville in action comedy Smokey and the Bandit. Only Star Wars grossed more at the box office that year.Other memorable credits included his 1974 role as a jailed former NFL player leading his fellow inmates in a grudge football game against their prison guards, in The Longest Yard, or The Mean Machine, as it was renamed for UK viewers.The movie was remade in 2005 with Reynolds starring as the team coach.He also appeared alongside Dolly Parton in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, a 1982 comedy musical.One of his last hits, The Cannonball Run, released in 1981, starred Reynolds as an outlaw race car driver. It spawned several sequels.But his work went into freefall in the 1980s and his finances were ruined by failed investments in restaurants and a Florida football team.Reynolds made a 1997 comeback playing a porn film director in Boogie Nights, which won him an Oscar nomination.He was married twice, firstly to British actress Judy Carne in 1963, but they divorced two years later amid accusations of her over-spending and his infidelity.Reynolds went on to marry American actress Loni Anderson in 1988, but that also ended bitterly in 1993. They adopted their son, Quinton.He also had an on-off relationship with co-star Sally Field, who he later said was the love of his life.Field, now 71, said in a statement about her old flame's death: ""There are times in your life that are so indelible, they never fade away.""They stay alive, even 40 years later. My years with Burt never leave my mind. He will be in my history and my heart, for as long as I live. Rest, Buddy.""In 1996 Reynolds filed for bankruptcy with nearly $11m in debts.In 2014, he was forced to sell many prized memorabilia, including the Golden Globe award he won for Boogie Nights.As a teenager, Reynolds won a football scholarship to Florida State University until a knee injury ended his sporting prospects.His police captain father - a war hero who fought on D-Day - disapproved of his son's acting ambitions.Burt landed his first role in a local production of the play Outward Bound. He received the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for that performance.Reynolds is also known for turning down famous roles, including James Bond, Han Solo and Richard Gere's character in 1990's Pretty Woman.""My career is not like a regular chart, mine looks like a heart attack,"" he told The Associated Press in 2001.""I've done over 100 films, and I'm the only actor who has been canned by all three networks. I epitomise longevity.""He penned two autobiographies: My Life, published in 1994, and But Enough About Me, in 2015.""I always wanted to experience everything and go down swinging,"" he wrote in his second book.""Well, so far, so good. I know I'm old, but I feel young. And there's one thing they can never take away: Nobody had more fun than I did.""Up until his death, he had been set to appear in a Quentin Tarantino movie about Charles Manson - Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.In the film, due to be released in 2019, he was to portray George Spahn - the California rancher who allowed the cult leader to live on his property.There has been an outpouring of tributes to Reynolds from the world of showbiz."

Chris Pratt is TOWIE obsessed5. Jennifer Lawrence is also a big fan of Essex6. Emma Stone can't resist Made in Chelsea7. Neil Patrick Harris enjoys Celebrity Big Brother	"While most of us can't resist coming home from work and indulging in the guilty pleasure that is reality TV, it might provide some solace to know that we're in good company.International A-List stars including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Jennifer Lawrence and Chrissy Teigen have all admitted that not only do they love reality TV, their favourite shows are our beloved British ones.Here are seven stars who love British reality TV.In perhaps the most bizarre celebrity news of the week, Hollywood and wrestling superstar Dwayne Johnson, fancies himself as star baker.The 46-year-old Jumanji and Rampage actor is a big fan of The Great British Bake Off, according to The Daily Star.He said: ""I don't really get that much time for TV with a busy work schedule and three kids - but I always try and make time for The Great British Bake Off.""Baking is something I am really fascinated by, mainly because I love to eat the finished product.""Pies, brownies, cheesecake - that is what I eat on my cheat days.""I would do Celebrity Bake Off if I wasn't shooting a movie - especially if it was for charity.""It's a show that had the nation hooked - even Liam Gallagher and Stormzy admitted they were big fans of Love Island.But the most glamorous star of them all is Margot Robbie. While she was in the UK promoting new film Terminal, she told Metro she was shocked that the islanders were comparing contestant Megan Barton-Hanson to her.""The other night we were watching and I think it was Alex who said that, and we all lost it!"" she said.""We were like, ""Oh my God they know who I am on Love Island!""They all have some amazing bodies and they are so gorgeous and are always so done up and looking incredible, and then they said [I look like Megan] and we were like 'oh my God!'""Who would have thought that international supermodel Chrissy Teigen would spend some of her trip to London sitting in a hotel room watching Naked Attraction?Well in 2017 she became hooked on the Channel 4 show where singletons choose dates based on their genitals.She live-tweeted her way through the show and, as you can imagine, a lot of her reactions are not suitable for print.Teigen also joked that when room service came, she quickly switched over to the tennis.Speaking about her love of British shows, she told BBC Radio 1 at the GQ Awards on Thursday: ""I love it here. I love Naked Attraction, I love Bake Off and now I've heard of Gogglebox I mainly stay indoors to watch Channel 4.""Chris Pratt and Anna Farris are sadly no longer together, but at least she left him with the gift of being able to speak with an Essex accent.""We love that garbage TV in the States, and we shot Guardians of the Galaxy here in London,"" he told BBC One's The Graham Norton Show.""My wife Anna came to visit, and she fell in love with the show The Only Way is Essex.""It's like the Jersey Shore here and these folks are just the worst. I'm a parrot a little bit, so when I was hearing it all the time I just started to pick up their accent.""He then did an incredible impression of one of the show's most famous lines.It's well known that J Law is a big fan of Kim Kardashian West and the rest of her reality TV family, but she also loves a show that's closer to home too.But could she one day swap Los Angeles for Loughton?She told The Sun: ""It's like another world in Essex.""You guys have your own version of Jersey Shore which is so ridiculously amazing I can't even begin.""I don't do much when I'm in the UK, though I do watch the TV.""I really like the shows you have there. You guys get to say [swear words] a lot more than our main TV shows do.""It all started when the La La Land actress came to the UK and was introduced to British reality TV by BBC Radio 1's Scott Mills.From that moment on, she was hooked. Speaking to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, she said: ""When I was in England I found out about two shows that I have decided I am going to get really into.""The Only Way Is Essex is basically like Jersey Shore, sort of. Then there's one called Made In Chelsea, which reminds me of The Hills.""She then went on to give an incredible impression of Mark-Francis Vandelli.""And there's a guy on the show that I've seen a clip of, and he says, 'Darling you must come in for a restorative glass of champagne'.""It's not a show that is known for getting huge celebs on board, but the producers really missed a trick by not signing up How I Met Your Mother star Neil Patrick Harris.The Hollywood actor wrote on Twitter back in 2012 that he had become addicted to the series, whose celebs included Michael Madsen and Frankie Cocozza that year.""I've found a new TV obsession: Celebrity Big Brother UK,"" he wrote. ""Can't stop watching YouTube videos! I so badly want to partake!""Channel 5... there's still time to get him involved!Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Actress Kathleen Turner on Hollywood, sexism and rage	"1. On ""rage"" and sexism2. On refusing to be typecast3. On rebuffing advances4. Taking aim at other A-listers5. The Friends cast apparently weren't very friendly6. On Donald Trump's handshake"	"Hollywood actress Kathleen Turner, who found fame in 1980s films like Body Heat and Romancing the Stone, is being lauded online for giving an open and frank interview to New York Magazine's Vulture about the industry and her career.Turner, known best for her iconic smoky voice, dished Hollywood dirt on everything from the cast of Friends, to Elizabeth Taylor's voice and Donald Trump's handshake in the wide-ranging interview.Here are six of the biggest talking points from the piece.Asked by journalist David Marchese what had driven her career aside from luck, Turner responded simply with ""rage"".Pushed further, the actress replied: ""I'm [expletive] angry, man"" about ""everything"" and ""injustice in the world"".The interviewer then presses her on whether this stems from her career being derailed by illness.""I suppose there was a feeling of loss. Rheumatoid arthritis hit in my late 30s - the last of my years in which Hollywood would consider me a sexually appealing leading lady,"" she told the magazine.""The hardest part was that so much of my confidence was based on my physicality. If I didn't have that, who was I?""She later takes aim at accusations she was ""difficult"" to work with on set.""If a man comes on set and says, 'Here's how I see this being done,' people go 'He's decisive'. If a woman does it, they say, 'Oh [expletive], there she goes'.""She discusses resisting playing one type of role, saying actors have a choice between wanting audiences to like them and becoming skilled.Turner takes aim at one unnamed actress for playing the same role for 20 years.""She even looks pretty much the same. She's probably one of the richest women out there, but I would shoot myself if I were like that, only giving people what they expect.""The internet has been trying to guess who she is talking about since the article was published.In the interview she speaks angrily about feeling like a ""sexual target"" and a ""trophy"" after her early breakthrough roles.She says that she always felt insecure in Los Angeles, because of an ""unspoken assumption"" in Hollywood ""that women were property to be claimed"".Turner says she learned that there had been a competition between actors Michael Douglas, Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty about ""who would get [her] first"".""None of them did, by the by,"" she told Vulture.Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor is one of several big names who come under fire from Turner in the interview.She criticises Taylor's performance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? saying: ""I don't think she was very skilled.""Turner describes the actress' voice as ""awful"" and ""badly used"".She also takes aim at Nicolas Cage for his work alongside her on the set of Peggy Sue Got Married, released in 1986.""He was very difficult on set. But the director allowed what Nicolas wanted to do with his role, so I wasn't in a position to do much except play with what I'd been given,"" she said.""If anything, it [Cage's portrayal] only further illustrated my character's disillusionment with the past. The way I saw it was, yeah, he was that [expletive].""Asked to elaborate on whether she meant the comment toward Cage or his character, she responded: ""Listen, I made it work, honey.""She also said that working with Burt Reynolds in 1988 was ""terrible"" and his actions on set made her cry.""His behaviour was shocking. It never occurred to me that I wasn't someone's equal. I left the room sobbing,"" she said.Turner also says she once slapped a male co-star in a theatre production who had bitten her, but doesn't reveal who.Turner, who guest starred as Chandler's father in hit US sitcom Friends, said she ""didn't feel very welcomed by the cast"" on set.""The Friends actors were such a clique - but I don't think my experience with them was unique,"" she said.""I think it was simply that they were such a tight little group that nobody from the outside mattered.""Asked whether she ever bumped into Mr Trump in the 1980s, Turner responded: ""Yes. Yuck. He has this gross handshake.""She elaborated: ""He goes to shake your hand and with his index finger kind of rubs the inside of your wrist. He's trying to do some kind of seductive intimacy move. You pull your hand away and go yuck.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Emmy Awards 2018: Are British actors winning more Hollywood awards?	Brits on TVWhat about the Oscars?	"British actors went home clutching some of the night's biggest prizes at this year's Emmy Awards.The glamorous celebration of TV talent saw Claire Foy win the best actress in a drama award for her performance as the Queen in The Crown, and Thandie Newton win best supporting actress for Westworld.Matthew Rhys also picked up an award for his role in spy-thriller The Americans.In the past decade, British actors have landed some of the biggest roles in TV and film.And success at this year's Emmy Awards could be seen to confirm they are punching above their weight.British popularity is not new, says Tina McFarling, from the British Film Institute (BFI).""There's a massive demand for British acting talent, there always has been,"" she says.But is British success at prestigious US award ceremonies actually on the rise?To try to answer that question Reality Check has looked at the Emmys and the Oscars over the past decade.This year's Emmy-winning trio of Foy, Newton and Rhys meant three victories out of 12 in the drama, comedy and mini-series categories for acting.The last time that happened was at the 2011 Emmys, when Maggie Smith (Downton Abbey), Kate Winslet (Mildred Pierce) and British-born Australian Guy Pearce (Mildred Pierce) won awards.In the past decade, 14 British actors have won one of these awards.Maggie Smith has won three times for her role in Downton Abbey, which has won several awards in the period.Sherlock has also been repeatedly nominated - and in 2014 Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman won best and supporting actor in a mini-series.Last year, Riz Ahmed won for The Night Of.Brits have a long history of success at Hollywood's glitziest awards ceremony - the Oscars.British women have won the Academy Award for best actress 15 times, and men best actor 20 times, since 1927, according to the BFI.Meanwhile, the prize for best director has been collected by a Briton 12 times.Impressively, four of those 20 best actor awards have come in the past decade - won by Colin Firth, Daniel Day Lewis (who holds both British and Irish citizenship), Eddie Redmayne and Gary Oldman.And last year, three of the five nominees were British.But only one British women has won the best actress Oscar in the past decade - Kate Winslet for The Reader in 2008 - although there have been seven other nominations, including Judi Dench, Naomi Watts and Sally Hawkins, nominated for 2017 best picture winner The Shape of Water.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
entertainment	First Man flag row: How selective should Hollywood be with history?		"A new film about Neil Armstrong tells the story of how he became the first man to walk on the Moon. But, some argue, it isn't the full story.Ryan Gosling stars in First Man, which is directed by Damien Chazelle - the man behind Whiplash and La La Land.The movie, an early contender for awards season, explores Armstrong's personal journey and struggles as he attempts the feat.But it fails to show one rather crucial and memorable part of the quest - the planting of the American flag on the Moon.The flag is visible in the background in later shots, so it's more a case of downplaying its importance than actively changing history.In reality, when Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin unfurled the stars and stripes on the lunar surface less than 25 minutes after Armstrong's first small step in July 1969, watched live by hundreds of millions of people back on Earth, it was a symbolic moment.However, the decision not to show the event itself has sparked a row about whether the film-makers have deliberately played down America's superiority.""It did not fit in with their political agenda and, being liberals, they think that what actually happened, i.e history, isn't important and if it offends them it can be rewritten or simply expunged,"" wrote Rod Liddle in the Spectator.""Aside from anything else, this is cheating the moviegoers.""He argues the US flag was a crucial part of the venture.""It was two fingers to the [Russians] and a reminder to the rest of the world that the US was the greatest country on Earth... it won the space race.""You'd think a film which lasts for two hours and 15 minutes wouldn't have skipped any important details.But those involved with the film argue that the Moon landing wasn't solely an achievement for America - but for all of humanity.Gosling told The Telegraph the Moon landing ""transcended countries and borders"".""I think this was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement [and] that's how we chose to view it,"" he said.In a statement, Chazelle agreed: ""To address the question of whether this was a political statement, the answer is no.""Film-makers depicting real stories always have to decide which bits of history to show and which to skirt over - and First Man isn't the only movie to have grappled with the Moon landing.Comedy film The Dish, released in 2000, centred on the role the Parkes Observatory in Australia played in televising the event.Technicians there had the job of taking the images from the Moon and relaying them to the huge global audience.It may have been based on the Moon landing, but The Dish used fictional characters and, like First Man, also played around with some historical detail.""Everyone knows how the story ends so the most important details were the ones that recreated how it felt,"" its director Rob Sitch tells BBC News.Sitch recalls one particular thing they changed for the film - but, he adds, it's one that nobody objected to at the time.""There were three big dishes, not two. To make the story easier to understand we dropped the dish in Spain,"" he explains.""Even when the film was released there, it was never brought up in my interviews. A bit like in Australia, we suspected that it had been largely forgotten.""Some months later, we received an extremely gracious and complimentary letter from Neil Armstrong. At the end, in a warm way, he wondered how the people of Madrid felt about being left out. If he had a sense of perspective I think we should too!""Similarly, Armstrong's two sons have also defended First Man by saying they didn't see it as ""anti-American in the slightest"".""Of course, it celebrates an American achievement,"" they said in a statement. ""It also celebrates an achievement 'for all mankind,' as it says on the plaque Neil and Buzz [Aldrin] left on the Moon.""However, Aldrin appeared to voice his distaste of First Man's flag-planting omission - albeit in a less direct way.Last month, he tweeted a picture of himself and Armstrong on the moon with the flag, captioned with the hashtag ""#ProudToBeAnAmerican"".Former Republican presidential candidates in the US also criticised the editing.Marco Rubio said it was ""total lunacy"", while Ted Cruz added that it was ""wrong, and consistent with Leftists' disrespecting the flag and denying American exceptionalism"".But is it really an insult to Americanism? Sitch thinks that criticism ""feels like misguided insecurity"".""You even mention Apollo 11 and you think of America at its best,"" he says.""If you watch the whole [original] recording of the astronauts, the flag-planting comes well after the first footsteps and as a formality. In a sense, the triumph of the achievement swamped everything, even the live call to the president.""People all over the world were in awe of what America had just achieved. If you think the planting of the flag was the key emotional moment, you're probably missing the point.""As for the suggestion that directors shouldn't take artistic licence with historical fact, Sitch argues it's sometimes necessary in order to tell a story within the constraints of film.""You've got two hours to get to the essence of a multi-decade hugely complex history-making enterprise,"" he says.""That's why artistic licence was invented. You're trying to recreate how the key moments felt.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk"
entertainment	Hollywood hits back at new Oscars 'popular film' category		"The announcement of a new ""popular film"" category at the Oscars has been actively unpopular in Hollywood.The Academy revealed the category on Wednesday, opening the door for films like Black Panther, Mission Impossible: Fallout and Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again to be recognised at the next ceremony in February.""The film business passed away today,"" tweeted West Wing star Rob Lowe, not one to ever mince his words.""It had been in poor health for a number of years. It is survived by sequels, tent-poles, and vertical integration.""He wasn't the only industry figure to criticise the change.Actor and writer Andy Richter said: ""Finally the Oscars will be giving a statue based on popularity so that those poor mountains of box office money won't be lonely anymore.""But it's worth remembering the changes have been made with TV audiences, rather than actors, in mind.Viewing figures for the Academy Awards have been falling in recent years - the most recent ceremony was down 39% on 2014's, according to Nielsen figures.Several theories were forthcoming as to why people were switching off in their droves, with Piers Morgan writing a check list in the Daily Mail earlier this year of things that needed to change.He suggested the ceremony should ban political speeches, be shorter in length, cut the live performances for each of the best song nominees, and ditch the ""boring awards"" - ie the technical categories.Crucially, Morgan said to widespread agreement, films nominated for best picture should be movies the general public actually go and see, rather than obscure titles.Tellingly, after the announcement of the new category, members of the public were far more positive on Twitter than most actors and industry figures.But film critics and Hollywood figures were quick to point out perceived flaws in the thinking behind the new category.""Last year's best picture nominees to gross over $100m were Get Out and Dunkirk - imagine if both had been shoved into 'best popular film' instead and ignored by voters for the big category,"" wrote The Atlantic's David Sims.Vulture's Mark Harris was also among those who were critical, tweeting: ""There is already an award for popular films. It's called 'money'.""It's also been noted by some media outlets, such as Variety, that the Oscars are broadcast on ABC in the US, a company owned by Disney - one of the studios which may benefit from the best popular film award.But the new category isn't the only change to have sparked a backlash from the film industry.It was also announced on Wednesday that the ceremony will shorten the telecast to three hours in an attempt to make the ceremony ""more accessible for our viewers worldwide"".In order to fit in all 24 award categories, some will be presented during commercial breaks with the winning moments edited and aired later in the broadcast.It's likely that the awards relegated to edited highlights will be those in the technical categories, such as lighting, sound and editing.""I'm afraid this will end up being a little demeaning,"" one member of the film editing branch told The Hollywood Reporter.""It's a big thing for those of us 'below the line' to get such an award. It makes a big difference in your life and career.""Another member added: ""Turning the show into a popular variety show is a mistake,"" arguing that the crafts categories are not the reason the show tends to run long.""Most of us are played off pretty quickly; it's all the bloated stuff in between. They could do many things to streamline the show.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

entertainment	Hollywood films 'had fewer LGBT characters in 2017'		"The Hollywood film industry has been criticised for a drop in the number of LGBT characters in film in 2017.The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) found that 12% of mainstream releases featured LGBT characters last year.That was down from 18% in 2016 and is the lowest level recorded by GLAAD, which started the index six years ago.GLAAD's study did find some positives, including that the racial diversity of characters had improved in 2017.Of the 109 studio films released last year, 14 featured LGBT characters, according to the Studio Responsibility Index. Of those LGBT characters, 43% were white, with 28.5% black and 28.5% Latin American.Examples include Zoe Kravitz's character Blair in Rough Night and Demian Bichir's character Lope in Alien: Covenant.GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said there had been some signs of ""welcome progress"" in 2018 with films like Love, Simon; Annihilation; and Blockers.She said: ""If Hollywood wants to remain relevant with these audiences and keep them buying tickets, they must create stories that are reflective of the world LGBTQ people and our friends and family know.""This needs to take place in the major studio releases that play in wide release all over the country - and indeed, all around the world - as well as in the indie films that have long been home to stand-out queer and trans stories.""There was criticism for some superhero movies, such as Thor: Ragnarok, which cut a scene that would have confirmed the character Valkyrie as bisexual.The group also noted how the sexualities of comic book characters Wonder Woman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn didn't make it into film adaptations.Of the ""inclusive"" studio films, 64% featured gay men, 36% had lesbian characters and 14% included bisexual characters, but none had transsexual or non-binary characters.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

full name Louis Szekely - admitted the allegations were true and said he had ""wielded power irresponsibly"".On 10 January, Michael Douglas issued a denial over a claim of improper sexual conduct, which has not yet been made public.The Hollywood star said he ""felt the need to get ahead"" of the situation and to share his ""concerns"" before a story was published.He said a former employee was accusing him of performing a sex act in front of her more than 30 years ago.Douglas told Deadline: ""This is a complete lie, fabrication, no truth to it whatsoever.""Five women have accused James Franco of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behaviour, including students from his acting school.After James Franco's appearance at the Golden Globes in January, wearing a Time's Up badge, his former student Sarah Tither-Kaplan spoke to the LA Times accusing the 39-year-old of sexual misconduct.Two other student actresses also claimed to have had negative on-set experiences, with both saying Franco became angry when no women at a shoot would agree to be topless.Franco's attorney, Michael Plonsker, disputed all of the women's allegations, with Franco himself claiming they were ""not accurate"".On 1 November, the Hollywood Reporter published a guest column by a former intern who accused Dustin Hoffman of sexually harassing her in 1985.Anna Graham Hunter accused the Oscar-winning actor of groping her and making inappropriate comments about sex to her when she was 17.In a statement, Hoffman apologised and said he felt ""terrible that anything [he] might have done could have put [Ms Hunter] in an uncomfortable situation.""In December, another woman came forward accusing Hoffman of an ""horrific, demoralising and abusive experience"" while on a Broadway production of Death of a Salesman.Kathryn Rossetter claims Hoffman regularly groped her and, during one encounter, exposed her to the rest of the crew by pulling her slip above her head.Hoffman has not commented on the latest claims - also published in the Hollywood Reporter.However, the website said it had spoken to several people who had worked on the 1984 production, who questioned Rossetter's account, saying they had not witnessed the conduct described.On 14 January, Eliza Dushku made claims in a Facebook post that she had been abused at the age of 12, while filming True Lies.The actress, famous for her roles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Bring It On, alleged that stuntman Joel Kramer sexually molested her.Kramer denied the claims saying they were ""entirely untrue"", and adding: ""I never behaved in any way inappropriately with her.""On 8 January, Australian actor Craig McLachlan denied allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by three women.The accusations against the 52-year-old concern his time performing in a 2014 production of the Rocky Horror Show.Three cast members accused the former Neighbours actor of inappropriate touching and harassment.As a result, McLachlan stepped down from the Rocky Horror Show's current Australian run, but rejected the allegations as ""entirely false"".""Frankly, they seem to be simple inventions, perhaps made for financial reasons, perhaps to gain notoriety,"" he wrote in an email to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in response to the allegations.Around 18 October, it emerged that Roy Price, the head of Amazon's film and television arm, had resigned after being accused of sexually harassing a television producer.Isa Hackett accused the Amazon Studios boss of repeatedly making unwanted propositions to her during a taxi ride in 2015.Price was also accused by actress Rose McGowan of failing to act on her claim that she was sexually assaulted by producer Harvey Weinstein.Price has not directly responded to the claims.On 1 November, the Los Angeles Times reported on six women who had accused director Brett Ratner of sexual harassment or misconduct.Among them were Natasha Henstridge, who claimed she was forced into a sex act with Ratner when she was a teenager, and fellow actress Olivia Munn, who accused him of masturbating in front of her in 2014.Ratner, director of Red Dragon, X-Men: The Last Stand and the Rush Hour films, denied the claims via his lawyer.On 23 October, the executive vice-president of Conde Nast International instructed staff to drop fashion photographer Terry Richardson from its titles, which include GQ, Vogue and Glamour.The move followed the publication of a Sunday Times article that claimed the photographer was ""the subject of widespread allegations of sexually abusing models over many years"".A representative for Richardson said his subjects had all ""participated consensually"" in his ""sexually explicit"" work and that the photographer was ""disappointed"" by Conde Nast's decision.On 8 November, actress Portia de Rossi accused action star Steven Seagal of unzipping his trousers while she was auditioning for one of his films.Actress Julianna Margulies also accused Seagal of inappropriate behaviour, while model Jenny McCarthy repeated an earlier claim she had made against him.Seagal's manager said the Under Siege star had no comment.In January, former Bond girl Rachel Grant accused the actor of sexual assault at a film rehearsal in Sofia in 2002.The British actress also alleged Seagal attempted to indecently expose himself and claims she later lost her job on the film, Out For A Kill.Lawyers for Mr Seagal say that he unequivocally denies Ms Grant's allegations in their entirety: ""Our client denies having such contact with Ms Grant and further vehemently denies any alleged assault at all, in particular, the alleged assault occurring in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2002.""In an interview published on 30 October, actor Anthony Rapp accused Kevin Spacey of making a sexual advance towards him when Rapp was 14.In the days that followed, a number of other allegations were made against the two-time Oscar winner by people who claimed he had groped, sexually harassed or made indecent overtures towards them.Spacey claimed to have no memory of the events Rapp described and later issued an ""absolute"" denial of the other allegations through his lawyer.The accusations have had a serious impact on his career, with Netflix pulling the plug on his House of Cards TV series and Sony announcing its intention to excise him completely from an upcoming film release.In December, the King of Norway's former son-in-law accused Spacey of groping him after a Nobel Peace Prize concert.The accusations have had a serious impact on his career, with Netflix removing him from the final series of House of Cards. He has also been replaced by Christopher Plummer in Ridley Scott's upcoming film All the Money in the World.A spokesman for Spacey said in November that he was ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"" in the wake of the allegations.In December, Sylvester Stallone denied an allegation of rape after police in California opened an investigation.Santa Monica police said they were examining a complaint of sexual misconduct dating from the 1990s.The Rocky star said the allegation was ""completely fabricated"". His lawyer, Martin Singer, said a woman had filed a police report ""alleging a rape that occurred 27 years ago"".""My client categorically disputes the claim,"" Singer continued.On 8 November it was reported that Amazon Studios had launched an investigation into claims that Transparent star Jeffrey Tambor had acted inappropriately towards his personal assistant. Tambor himself called the allegations ""baseless"".The following week, transgender actress Trace Lysette claimed Tambor had ""got physical"" with her on set. In a statement, Tambor said he was ""not a predator"" and apologised ""if any action... was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive"".The 73-year-old subsequently expressed doubts that he could continue with the show amid reports that Amazon was exploring ways to continue the drama without him.On 22 October, the Los Angeles Times reported that 38 women had come forward to accuse film-maker James Toback of sexual harassment.The paper subsequently reported that more than 200 further women had come forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances, among them actress Julianne Moore.Actresses Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams made their own claims against the Oscar-nominated writer of Bugsy in a Vanity Fair piece.Toback denied the initial allegations but has yet to comment on the others. In an interview conducted before his accusers went public, though, he accused his accusers of spreading ""pathetic lies"".On 17 October, Variety reported on a woman who had accused Bob Weinstein - the brother of producer Harvey Weinstein - of making unwanted romantic overtures towards her.Amanda Segel, an executive producer of sci-fi series The Mist, claimed that Weinstein had repeatedly asked him to join him for private dinners and that he only desisted when she threatened to leave the show.Bob Weinstein, co-founder of The Weinstein Company, strongly denied Ms Segel's claims.The scandal that has engulfed Hollywood was set in motion on 5 October when the New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein.Many more allegations of sexual harassment followed, along with public denouncements from stars with whom the producer had worked. Weinstein was also accused of rape by a number of women.The producer issued an apology after the initial New York Times story, saying his past conduct had ""caused a lot of pain"". After the New Yorker published its own expose, he issued an ""unequivocal"" denial he had engaged in non-consensual sex through a spokeswoman.It was subsequently reported that a Canadian actress was suing Weinstein for two sexual assaults that allegedly took place in Toronto in 2000. A civil claim has also been made against Weinstein in the UK.British actor Ed Westwick issued a strong denial on 7 November after being accused of rape by an actress.The 30-year-old made another denial when another actress claimed she was raped by the actor at his home.The BBC subsequently announced that the actor had ""paused"" filming the second series of White Gold and been replaced in the Agatha Christie drama Ordeal By Innocence.In July 2018, the Los Angeles District Attorney said there was ""insufficient evidence"" for a prosecution to go ahead.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Tab Hunter: 1950s Hollywood idol who hid his sexuality dies at 86		"Actor Tab Hunter, one of Hollywood's biggest heartthrobs of the 1950s, has died at the age of 86.Hunter was a screen idol in the 1950s and early '60s thanks to such hit movies as Damn Yankees and Battle Cry.He also hosted his own TV show, while his song Young Love went to number one on both sides of the Atlantic.But he hid his homosexuality and his relationship with actor Anthony Perkins. JJ Abrams is reportedly making a movie about the pair's relationship.The film, titled Tab & Tony, will be produced by the director of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Variety reported last month.Hunter was often photographed on ""dates"" with actresses like Natalie Wood, his co-star in 1956's The Girl He Left Behind. But they were fabricated for the press.The other producers on the film reportedly include Allan Glaser, Hunter's longtime partner, and Star Trek actor Zachary Quinto.Quinto tweeted: ""So sad to wake up to the news of the passing of Tab Hunter. I was honoured to get to know him in the past year and am so grateful to have experienced his sheer joy and love of life.""Sir Elton John was among the others to pay tribute, writing: ""RIP to the most handsome and special man. Young Love forever.""Choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne said he had been ""one of the most charming men I ever met"", while playwright Harvey Fierstein remembered him as a ""gawjuss gay icon and true gentleman"".Hunter's breakthrough came as a shipwrecked marine in 1952's Islands of Desire, with other popular roles including a brother seeking revenge in 1956's The Burning Hills and a baseball fan in 1958's Damn Yankees.He appeared in about 50 films in total, including That Kind of Woman, The Pleasure of His Company, They Came to Cordura and The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean.For all his credits, Hunter expressed disappointment about how his career developed.""No one took me seriously,"" he told the New York Times in 2003. ""I wanted so much to be accepted as an actor.""After his movie career waned, he turned to television and Broadway. In 2005 he published an autobiography called Tab Hunter Confidential.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Pitch Perfect: Hollywood's surprising success story		"Pitch Perfect 3 is outstanding. Quite literally.Not only is the third instalment of the successful film franchise highly entertaining - but also highly unusual for Hollywood.Seeing an all-female ensemble cast in a storyline where the main objective isn't finding a boyfriend is something you don't often see.Which is perhaps why the movies have become so popular.""I distinctly remember seeing the first one in the cinema and just feeling so great afterwards,"" says Hailee Steinfeld, who joined the cast in Pitch Perfect 2 and reprises her role in the third.""I loved every minute of it, loved the musical aspect, I thought the relationships within the movie were so interesting and fun. I remember thinking if there's ever a movie like this I have to be a part of it.""Hailee's reaction to the first film, released in 2012, wasn't unique (although sadly the rest of us have yet to be cast in one of the sequels).Audiences knew they were in for a very different type of movie from the opening scene, where Anna Camp's character violently throws up on stage, bringing shame on her a cappella group, The Barden Bellas, and setting up the plotline which sees them try to rebuild their reputation.Its script was sharper and more cutting than the average teen comedy movie, and the film was warmly received by critics.""The first Pitch Perfect was a bit of a sleeper hit,"" says film critic Rhianna Dhillon.""It felt like a word-of-mouth movie, because on the description alone it didn't necessarily sound that appealing, hearing actors doing covers of songs without any music, but then when you see it and understand it you realise what a fantastic idea it is.""It pushed for the underdog. It was outrageous. It showcased different types of women than we're used to seeing on screen, it broke down stereotypes. It felt really important but also not forced.""She adds: ""It reminded me of being at uni and making all these friends for the first time, understanding their quirks.""After the somewhat surprising success of Pitch Perfect, a sequel was hastily scheduled, and the imaginatively-titled Pitch Perfect 2 became the highest-grossing musical comedy of all time when it was released in 2015.The franchise's success, and in particular, its famous riff-offs [singing battles], even prompted the BBC to commission a new singing competition for choirs and a cappella groups called Pitch Battle, which launched this year.And yet, the Pitch Perfect story remains atypical in the movie landscape.Think back to 2011's Bridesmaids - which was supposed to be a game-changer for Hollywood.The Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy film was said to be one that would convince movie executives that films with a female ensemble cast can be funny, entertaining, and successful at the box office.""It says something that a movie like Bridesmaids was so successful, I think people love that, and find it refreshing,"" Hailee says.""And for me as an actor, it's fun to be a part of a movie that's about a group of women banding together and lifting each other up and supporting each other. And there's outside relationships involved, but the core of it is between them.""After the release of Bridesmaids, The Wrap published an article (typical for what was being written about the film at the time), entitled ""Bridesmaids sparks a genre: Why we'll see a lot more R-rated chick flicks.""""Bridesmaids has an opportunity to open the door to the crazy, vulgar female comedy,"" screenwriter Linda Voorhees told the website.But, since then, there haven't been quite as many Bechdel test-passing films as were expected - with the occasional exception, like this year's Girls Trip.""We've had films like Bachelorette and Rough Night, but again these all revolve around a marriage, a hen do, which Bridesmaids did first and did so well that everything since is so overshadowed by it,"" Rhianna says.""So they haven't broken out of that idea that women can only get together when there's a union with a man involved, like Pitch Perfect did.""You don't think of the Pitch Perfect films as romantic comedies even though there are some romances in them, I think Hollywood needs to sort of realise that women are quite happy seeing female friendships on screen as much as they are seeing romances.""Many recent films with a female-ensemble cast have been notable, even controversial, for the gender of the main characters - like the 2016 remake of Ghostbusters.""Ghostbusters was almost set up to fail,"" Rhianna continues, ""because it was tackling a much-loved film, and also they specifically said the difference was that they're all women this time, and that doesn't necessarily make a good film.(Ghostbusters wasn't a huge box office success and, prior to the film's release, its trailer became the most disliked in YouTube's history.)""I'm kind of feeling the same way about [the all-female] Ocean's Eight, they could've just done a fantastic heist movie with women, and not have anything to do with Ocean's anything. It's frustrating that they always seem to have to piggy back off a male franchise to make any headway.""Instead, having a film with base material which is unique, rather than just a reboot or remake of an old movie, is precisely where Pitch Perfect excelled.Despite being adapted from a book, it was praised for its originality, largely helped by its gross-out humour and the ad-libbing from cast members like Rebel Wilson.The franchise also doesn't make a big song and dance about the fact the cast is female.They just make a big song and dance, full stop.""We can't believe how successful it's become,"" Rebel told Graham Norton last week. ""And it's so cool because we're all friends in the cast, and so we want to work together again.""Hailee agrees: ""We love each other, it's funny, even after a 16-hour day of working together, being exhausted, and singing the same songs, wearing shoes that were uncomfortable, we would still all want to go out to dinner and hang out.""You essentially live together for as long as you make these movies because you're living in such tight quarters for such a long period of time, so yeah we're all very close and it's a lot of fun.""Journalists aren't allowed to give away any plot details of Pitch Perfect 3 until next week - but you can basically expect all the usual hallmarks of the franchise - along with more cameos from some major music stars.The latest film has been marketed as the third of a trilogy, and the posters carry the brilliant strapline ""Last call, pitches"", suggesting that the franchise could be wrapping up soon.But given the juggernaut the whole project has been, could the Barden Bellas return for a fourth instalment? Or could there be a spin-off series?Come on Hailee throw us a bone here.""I really am not sure,"" she says.Not good enough.""It's funny because even after the second one we were awaiting the call for the third and trying to figure out where it was that they were going.""But I think the possibilities are really endless, especially for the Bellas, and I'd love to pick up with them again and see where they go.""Would she star in a potential Pitch Perfect 4, if asked? ""Absolutely.""Super. Now that that's all agreed and legally binding, we'll be watching out not just for more Pitch Perfects, but perhaps also for more films just like them.Pitch Perfect 3 is released in the UK on 20 December.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Hollywood awards choose all-female presenters	'Stereotypes shattered'	"After the fallout from the Hollywood sex scandal, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards are making next year's ceremony all about female empowerment.The annual awards, which hand out 13 acting honours, will have a host for the first time - Kristen Bell - and all of the presenters will also be women.""It's been the year of the woman,"" SAG Awards executive producer Kathy Connell told Hollywood Reporter.The 24th annual SAG awards take place on 21 January.The presenters have not been named yet, but it marks a change from tradition which dictates that a man and a woman present the prizes.""This is a unifying salute to women who have been very brave and speaking up,"" Connell added.""We don't want to slight the men who have given great performances this year - knowing our membership, I'm sure our men will embrace the opportunity to honour women.'""It's still an awards show and a celebration. We're not here to preach to anybody. To me, just having some of these fabulous women on stage sends its own message.""Frozen star Bell was announced as host earlier this month and Connell explained their choice at the time.""This has been a year in which assumptions have been challenged, stereotypes have been shattered, and precedents have been broken.""We decided to capture the cultural mood by casting aside one of our own traditions, and we're thrilled to have such a talented performer like Bell help us do so.""This year's nominations are led by Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri in the film categories, and Big Little Lies, GLOW and Stranger Things in the TV categories.The SAG awards are often seen as a good indicator of who and what will triumph at the Oscars a few weeks later.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	100 Women: How Hollywood fails women on screen	What is 100 Women?How the films were measured	"Hollywood is failing women when it comes to representing gender on screen, according to BBC analysis.Fewer than half of the 89 films named best picture at the Oscars have passed a common measure of on-screen female representation known as the Bechdel Test.A movie passes the Bechdel Test if there are at least two named female characters that have a conversation with one another about something other than a man.This conversation needs to happen just once for it to pass.The research also shows that a greater percentage of best picture winners passed the Bechdel test in the 1930s compared to the current decade.Recent winners such as Moonlight, Gladiator and Slumdog Millionaire all fail the test, along with two of this year's best picture nominees, teams from BBC 100 Women and More or Less have found.Darkest Hour fulfils the requirement to have two named female characters but at no point in the film do women have a conversation with each other about something other than a man.Dunkirk, set during World War Two, doesn't have any named female characters.Two actresses given a high billing - Miranda Nolan and Kim Hartman - instead play characters known as ""Nurse"" and ""Stewardess"" respectively.""I think people are doing what they always have done, telling stories that are similar to those they have seen before, without questioning it,"" says Ellen Tejle, who has introduced a rating system in Sweden to highlight films which pass the Bechdel Test.""People in the industry need to realise that they have power and responsibility in the process of making a film.""Film correspondent and broadcaster Rhianna Dhillon says women should not end up being shoehorned into films about men.""We deserve our own narrative. Darkest Hour is a male-centric film they shoehorned a female narrative in. Who are they doing that for?"" she says.""It's not good enough to start making a film before realising that it's just white men being represented.""BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories. Find us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and use #100WomenOther stories you might like:The male movie star campaigning for women's rightsWas 2017 a tipping point for women in Hollywood?Women account for 11% of film directorsThe Bechdel Test is named after the artist behind the 1985 cartoon it first appeared in.In Alison Bechdel's comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For, two women are discussing going to the cinema, when one reveals the details of her ""rule"" for picking what to watch.Unable to find a film that meets her requirements, the two characters end up going home.It was never intended to be a serious method of measuring representation, but is now a widely used theory in film criticism.""I love that the Bechdel Test gets the conversation going about what's going on on screen,"" says Holly Tarquini, director of the Bath Film Festival and founder of the F-rating, which alerts audiences to a film directed by women and/or written by women.""What's really difficult is that lots of very misogynist films pass it; it doesn't tell you anything about who's telling the story.""A huge amount of pornography passes. The Bikini Carwash Company passes the Bechdel Test but Gravity doesn't.""The BBC 100 Women team reviewed dozens of films, using the standard Bechdel Test as a measure.Information was also gathered and cross-checked from crowd-sourcing website bechdeltest.com.Where a BBC reviewer had questions about the rating to give a particular film, or disagreed with bechdeltest.com, this was checked with at least two other BBC reviewers and a consensus reached.Ms Tejle uses the test at her cinema in Sweden and films that pass are given an A-rating.""Many films pass in just one scene,"" she says.""We have had a lot of angry emails and shout-outs, saying that a particular film 'shouldn't have passed because of just a few moments'.""But that says something too, that people are looking for that scene and reacting - that means they paid attention and actually care. That for me is a success in itself.""Others point out that the test only addresses gender, without asking whether characters are well-represented in other ways.Corrina Antrobus, founder of the Bechdel Test Fest, says if she were to come up with a new way of testing films, ""it would be something that better addresses intersectionality"", a theory that considers the way different aspects of humanity such as ethnicity, class and sexuality, affect one another.""It would be a measure of how few films portray women of colour, the spectrum of sexualities, religious backgrounds and abilities so that we can get a better snapshot of who is missing or being poorly represented at the table,"" she says.According to analysis by the Annenberg Foundation, 34 of the top 100 films in 2016 depicted a female lead or co-lead.Of those, just three were played by female actors from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group.Nearly half of all 100 top films of 2016 evaluated were completely missing black female speaking characters (47 of 100) and two‐thirds or more were missing Asian females (66 of 100) and Latinas (72 of 100), the study found.""In stark contrast, only 11 of the 100 top movies of 2016 were missing white girls/women on screen,"" the study said.Forty-four of the 89 best Oscar picture winners pass the Bechdel Test, including Argo and Schindler's List.In both of these examples, very few lines are actually spoken by women - it just so happens that one or two instances of conversation meet the requirements of the test. Analysis by BBC software developer Hanah Anderson points to the huge difference in the amount of words given to male versus female characters in several high profile films.And film critics and fans have debated how much the female characters need to say to one another, for a film to constitute a pass of the Bechdel Test.For example, Spotlight, a film about a newspaper investigation into the cover-up of child sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests, proves contentious on the Bechdel Test website.In one scene, journalist Sacha Pfieffer (played by Rachel McAdams) is asked for a glass of water by her grandmother, who is not given a first or last name in the credits.One Bechdel test website user, Leigh, had this to say: ""I don't think the grandmother asking for a glass of water in response to learning about the abuse by men in the church constitutes a pass.""User CA2MA disagrees, writing: ""I actually think this glass of water scene is a critical and powerful sequence in the film.""So while the grandmother isn't named, she is an important character - she is the voice of the average [Boston] Globe reader.""The cover-up that she is reading about is larger than just about men. It is about thousands of people and the failure of an institution.""Equally, Forrest Gump provokes debate about whether two women talking about the veterans from the Vietnam War counts as them talking about men, or talking about an issue.While this research focuses on English-language and US films, it is interesting to note that studies from the Geena Davis Institute suggests that other film-making countries are having greater success in producing more gender-balanced films.China had the highest number of gender-balanced movies, followed by Korea, UK, Brazil, and Germany, according to analysis of selected films released between 2010 and 2013.However very few films worldwide are directed by women - and they include just one Oscar best picture winner.And while Kathryn Bigelow picked up the best director award for The Hurt Locker in 2009, the film itself actually fails the Bechdel Test.""For decades, there has been an assumption that women will go to see these films, whoever is in them, because that's all there is to watch,"" says Ms Dhillon.""Meanwhile men can take their pick because they're always represented. Women are pigeon-holed but we don't realise because it's so subliminal.""Ms Dhillon believes it will be a long time until Hollywood addresses its problems with representation, but films such as I, Tonya and and Black Panther give her hope.""Black Panther is really exciting because its not made a by a small arthouse; this is a huge film from Marvel and Disney,"" she says.Although the film isn't perfect, she points out, there are many examples of ""intelligent and brave"" women who are represented as the ""norm"".""That's one of the reasons why audiences are so excited about it,"" she says.There may be financial benefits for studios making films that are more representative, with some research suggesting that films with gender parity make more money per dollar spent on production.""Dare to break the stereotypes,"" Ms Tejle tells the filmmakers of the future.""You might even make a better film with a better story.""Reporting by Amelia Butterly, Sarah Buckley, Georgina Pearce and Charlotte McDonald.

entertainment	Carrie Fisher: Calls for her to get a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame	How do you get a Hollywood star?	"Star Trek actor William Shatner has joined Star Wars' Mark Hamill in calling for the late Carrie Fisher to be given a Hollywood Walk of Fame star.The actress - famed for playing Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise - died in 2016.Anyone can nominate a star for the Walk of Fame, which costs $40,000 (£31,300).The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce then decides whether to accept the nomination. Posthumous awards require a five-year waiting period.Shatner tweeted his dismay that the actress's name isn't among the 2,600 immortalised on Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street.Shatner later tweeted that he was in touch with Fisher's family to see what their thoughts were.Hamill - who starred alongside Fisher as Luke Skywalker in Star Wars - tweeted last week that a star for Fisher should replace Donald Trump's.The Walk of Fame Committee selects approximately 30 names for new stars every year.In a previous interview with Today, Hollywood Walk of Fame producer Ana Martinez said Fisher had not been nominated for a star while she was alive.It's possible she wasn't interested in getting one - Prince was approached twice regarding the honour but declined both times.Other stars who don't have one include Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Robert de Niro.Fans did, however, create a makeshift star to honour Fisher after she died.To be eligible, you have to have been famous for at least five years and have ""professional"" expertise in television, film, radio, live theatre or music.All applications must include a written statement from the candidate, confirming they want one and that they would attend the unveiling ceremony if their application was accepted.If the celebrity's application is accepted, whoever nominated them needs to pay $40,000 for the manufacturing, unveiling ceremony and upkeep, such as cleaning.There is a five-year waiting period for posthumous stars.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Hollywood films to find home in Liverpool's former Littlewoods Pools HQ		"Hollywood stars will be heading to Liverpool after one of London's leading film and TV studios announced plans to open a major new complex in the city.Twickenham Studios in south-west London has been home to productions ranging from Black Mirror to War Horse.It will expand with a new base at the 1930s art deco former Littlewoods headquarters in Liverpool, which was once home to the football pools.Twickenham Studios' Maria Walker said it was ""a good fit"" for major US films.TV shows will also be made on the Littlewoods building's two new sound stages, and the move comes amid a boom in TV and film production in the UK.Foreign studios spent £1.7bn in the UK in 2017 - almost double the amount spent four years previously.Many recent films and shows - including Peaky Blinders and Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them - have used outdoor locations in Liverpool.Ms Walker, who is chief operating officer of Twickenham Studios, said the Littlewoods building was reminiscent of Los Angeles' landmark studios.""It actually looks like a Hollywood studio,"" she told BBC News. ""It has that right vibe.""I don't know if you've ever seen the studios in Hollywood, studios like the Paramount building - they are not dissimilar. They are white stucco buildings from that period.""In future, films like Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant's Oscar-nominated Florence Foster Jenkins - which was partly shot in Twickenham but filmed exterior scenes in Liverpool - could be based solely in the city.""It's a good fit for those large American films,"" Ms Walker said. ""We haven't got the capacity to build bigger stages [in Twickenham]. What Liverpool has is space. We're restricted in that area.""She said the volume of film work in the UK had grown ""exponentially"" in the last 10 years. But Twickenham Studios, which was founded in 1913, has no space to grow.""There are houses all around so we can't expand,"" she said. ""It's just not feasible, and property in London is at a premium. A stage needs a lot of space and there's only a certain amount you can charge.""So areas such as Liverpool, where you have got the space and the flexibility to expand, it just seems like a natural thing.""Twickenham Studios will take over 85,000 sq ft of the 300,000 sq ft at the Littlewoods building, with other film and TV companies expected to follow.Tim Heatley, co-founder of the building's developers Capital & Centric, said: ""Twickenham Studios couldn't be a better fit.""They'll bring a century's worth of film-making heritage and help to write a new chapter for the creative industries in and around Liverpool.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	The Silent Child: From Hollyoaks to Hollywood?	Profoundly deaf child starLearning a new languageExcitement and dread	"Two former stars of Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks could be jetting out to LA if their short film lands an Oscar nomination on Tuesday.Rachel Shenton, 30, played the soap's wannabe WAG Mitzeee Minniver for three years from 2010.The fact she spelt her first name with three Es said everything that needed to be known about the character.At the same time Chris Overton, 28, played ex-footballer turned cage fighter Liam McAllister.In those days the only nominations that they were in the running for were of the TV Quick Awards variety.That has all changed.Their film, The Silent Child, tells the story of a profoundly deaf four-year-old girl Libby.She lives a silent life until a social worker, played by Rachel, teaches her how to communicate through sign language.Rachel, who is from Stoke-On-Trent, was inspired to write the film because of her own family's experience.When she was 12 her father went deaf after receiving treatment for chemotherapy.""The subject is very close to my heart,"" she says.""My father lived the last two years of his life profoundly deaf, so that gave me the impetus to learn sign language and I very quickly fell in love with it and the deaf community.""Her response was to become a qualified British Sign Language Interpreter and ambassador for the National Deaf Children's Society.""As my involvement grew I saw the needless struggles that deaf children face through a lack of awareness about deafness.""One statistic that particularly shocked Rachel is shown on-screen at the end of the film - 78% of school-aged deaf children attend mainstream schools without receiving any specialist provision.""It's a silent disability, you can't see it and it's not life threatening,"" she explains. ""So unless it's touched your life in some way you wouldn't even think about it.""It was her boyfriend Chris Overton, from Staffordshire, who encouraged her to write a script about the issue.The result was The Silent Child, which he directed.They both agreed that for the sake of authenticity, the title role had to be played by a child who was profoundly deaf and could use sign language.A nationwide search involved advertising on the websites of deaf organisations and then the auditioning of 100 children, before they found their star - Maisie Sly, six, who had never acted before.Her family had recently relocated 160 miles from Plymouth to Swindon, so Maisie could attend a mainstream school where deaf children are supported.Sitting in the school library, with Rachel acting as her sign language interpreter, Maisie explained what it was like for her on set.""It was hard work because sometimes I had to film things again and again.""Acting had never been an ambition, but when she was told about the part, it was something she was determined to do.""I wanted to show people that deaf children can do anything.""Chris went to great lengths to make sure he could communicate with his star, learning basic British Sign Language.""Maisie doesn't speak my language and I don't speak hers, so I learnt all of her lines in sign language and as much basic sign language as I could, because we wouldn't have had a film if I couldn't tell her what to do.""Directing her was my favourite bit of the whole process.""The Silent Child won best short film at the Rhode Island International Festival in August, which meant it could be entered for the Oscars.Then in December they were told that it had been selected for the final 10 in the live action short category.On Tuesday they find out if they have been nominated for the Oscars.Even mentioning this makes Rachel wince with nerves: ""We've heard from those who've been nominated before just what that word can mean in the industry as filmmakers.""But also with what we are trying to achieve with promoting sign language, it would mean a lot.""A nomination would secure them four tickets for the Oscars - which would go to Rachel, Chris, Maisie and her Mum.Rachel and Chris are approaching the announcement with a mixture of excitement and dread.""I might have to go to the gym during it,"" laughs Rachel.Masie is completely unfazed though. ""Oh!"" she says and nods her head, ""I think we're going to go to The Oscars.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Robert Evans, Chinatown producer, dies at 89		"Robert Evans, the larger-than-life producer and studio executive whose films included Chinatown and The Cotton Club, has died at the age of 89.The former actor, whose seven wives included actress Ali McGraw, authored an autobiography, The Kid Stays in the Picture, that itself inspired a film.As head of production of Paramount, he was key to the making of the first two films in the Godfather series.His other credits include Urban Cowboy and the notorious 1980 flop Popeye.Born Robert J Shapera in 1930, Evans started out as an actor and was cast as a bullfighter in 1957's The Sun Also Rises.He went on to become head of production at Paramount, overseeing such hits as Rosemary's Baby and Love Story.""The producer is the most important element of a film,"" he once declared. ""He's on a film for four or five years and gets very little credit for it.""His death was confirmed by his publicist Monique Moss, who said the Evans family had yet to issue a statement.McGraw, who married Evans in 1969 before leaving him for the actor Steve McQueen, said he would be ""remembered as a giant"".""We are so very proud of his enormous contribution to the film industry,"" she continued, saying she and their son Joshua would ""miss Bob tremendously"".Evans' other wives included Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg, to whom he was married for just 10 days.Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw remembered Evans as a ""passionate midwife to the Hollywood new wave"" who mentored Roman Polanski, Francis Ford Coppola and other film-makers.It was for Polanski's film noir Chinatown that Evans received his only Oscar nomination, for best picture, in 1975.""RIP to a legend,"" tweeted the actress Natasha Lyonne, while documentarian Mark Cousins likened him to Renaissance patron Cosimo de' Medici.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Harvey Weinstein statue appears in Hollywood ahead of Oscars		"Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein has made a return to Hollywood in time for the Oscars - as an artwork called Casting Couch.Los Angeles street artist Plastic Jesus created the golden statue, depicting the producer holding an Academy Award.The Oscar-winning producer is facing multiple claims of rape, intimidation and sexual harassment.Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex that have been made against him.The artist known as Plastic Jesus placed his installation next to Elvis Presley's star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame on Thursday.The stunt follows another action by fellow street artist Sabo, who covered three LA billboards with tarpaulins this week that accused the film industry of covering up child abuse.Sabo's provocation follows a number of protests inspired by the billboards featured in Oscar hopeful Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.Plastic Jesus - who, like UK artist Banksy, maintains his anonymity - said his statue took two months to produce and was paid for by donations.The artist's other stunts include building a tiny wall around Donald Trump's Hollywood star and street signs ""banning"" members of the Kardashian family from parking.Weinstein's mock-comeback came on the same day it was confirmed that the company he co-founded has been saved from bankruptcy.The Weinstein Company will now be run by a largely female board after an investor group, led by the businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet, paid $500m (£362m) for its assets.The 90th Academy Awards will be held on Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Harvey Weinstein scandal: What next for Hollywood?	What next for Harvey Weinstein?What next for Hollywood?What next for The Weinstein Company?What films does he have out this awards season?What next for his political connections?	"Oscar-winning movie producer Harvey Weinstein is at the centre of a sexual harassment scandal, which has led to him being sacked by his own company.Actress Meryl Streep - who once called him ""God"" in an awards speech - has spoken out against him, saying the claims left her ""appalled"".Many others have now denounced him for the alleged behaviour, including Kate Winslet, Emma Watson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Benedict Cumberbatch and Charlize Theron.When the claims were first reported in the New York Times, Weinstein apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"". He later disputed the article, however, claiming the report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"".An article in The New Yorker later said that Weinstein had raped three women, which he denies.Others including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have now also spoken out, with Jolie saying she had a ""bad experience"" with Weinstein as a young actress, and Paltrow saying he had placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom.It's a dramatic fall from grace for one of the movie industry's highest-profile producers, which could have wider implications for Hollywood itself.Here are five pressing questions that arise from this mounting scandal.The man behind such hits as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love reportedly did not want to leave The Weinstein Company - but was fired anyway.He was apologetic but bullish last week when the allegations were first published and threatened to sue the New York Times, the paper that broke the story.Since then, he's been deserted by both his lawyer Lisa Bloom and his legal crisis adviser Lanny Davis.And in his personal life, his wife Georgina Chapman has now left him.It remains to be seen whether he will make good his threats of legal action.Weinstein was made an honorary CBE by the Queen in 2004 for his contribution to the British film industry, and there have already been calls for that to be revoked. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she's ""concerned"" about the allegations, but any decision on his CBE would not lie with Downing Street.Yet there is always the possibility he can bounce back, like other disgraced Hollywood figures who have returned to the limelight.Mel Gibson, for example, was back on Hollywood's red carpets earlier this year, despite an anti-Semitic rant during a public meltdown 11 years ago - although the allegations against Weinstein put him in a different situation.Weinstein's firing comes after a number of high-profile men have left their jobs amid claims of sexual misconduct.These include Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly and Eric Bolling at Fox News and Ain't It Cool News founder Harry Knowles. Bill Cosby is also facing a retrial over sexual assault charges.O'Reilly said they were ""completely unfounded claims"" and Bolling described the claims against him as ""untrue and terribly unfair"". Knowles called the initial allegation ""100% untrue"" and later decided to ""step away"" from his role.""Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP,"" said actress Rose McGowan in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.""Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not. It is so not a good look.""Jenni Konner, executive producer of the HBO series Girls, told the New York Times on Sunday: ""I see this as a tipping point.""This is the moment we look back on and say, 'That's when it all started to change.'""Weinstein may have been fired but an internal investigation will still go ahead. The company said it had retained an independent law firm ""to undertake a thorough and independent investigation"".This will be a financial burden on the company, with Forbes reporting such investigations can cost between $20m (£15m) and $40m (£30m) to carry out. Forbes also said the company would find it more expensive to raise funds in the future.Weinstein and his brother Bob own 42% of the company, but it's unclear how profitable the company has been in recent years.It had started to move into TV production, but without its most famous figurehead and driving force it is unclear what will happen to any deals it has signed.One third of the company's all-male board resigned when the allegations emerged.The Wrap has reported that the company is set to change its name in an attempt to move on after Weinstein's firing. The website claims the Weinstein name has been ""irretrievably tainted by the scandal"", although it says a decision has not been formally made.Weinstein is renowned for his campaigning skills, often managing to turn smaller, independent films into Oscar contenders.A 2015 survey of nearly 1,400 Oscar acceptance speeches by the website Vocativ found that Weinstein was thanked more frequently than God.One of his biggest hits was Shakespeare in Love, which won the best picture Oscar in 1999. A sequel has since been announced, with Weinstein as producer.The Weinstein Company also distributed such films as The King's Speech, The English Patient and Chicago, all of which - like The Artist - won the best picture Oscar.This year the company is pushing Wind River, a wintry thriller starring Jeremy Renner and Mary Elizabeth Olsen.The Current War, produced by Weinstein and starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison, is also a possible awards contender, despite receiving mixed reviews. Will the Weinstein connection dent their chances?The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians have come out to say they will now channel Weinstein's political donations towards women's rights groups.The producer was a prominent donor to the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign.""The DNC will donate over $30,000 (£22,850) in contributions from Weinstein to Emily's List, Emerge America and Higher Heights,"" the committee said in a statement.There are also question marks about his other donations and interests.In a statement issued last week, after the allegations surfaced, Weinstein said: ""One year ago, I began organising a $5m [£3.8m] foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC [University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts].""While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year.""USC is understood to have said it is rejecting the donation.Weinstein was a trustee of Bafta (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) in New York but his membership of the organisation has now been suspended, with immediate effect.He was also on the board of directors at the US charity Robin Hood, which describes itself as ""New York City's largest poverty-fighting organisation"", but stepped down after the allegations emerged, the charity told BBC News.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Was 2017 a tipping point for women in Hollywood?	Striking successEquality of opportunity	How significant is it that 2017's three top-grossing films had female leads?The #MeToo campaign was groundbreaking: it was both personal and anecdotal, yet also a collective roar by women all over the world, sharing stories of sexual assault or harassment.They were not just saying how pervasive the behaviour was: it was also a sign of empowerment.Hollywood has been rocked by the Weinstein scandal and others which followed it.And many hope it can re-invent itself in a more healthy shape.Now, a new hashtag, #TimesUp, is rooting the fight against sexual harassment in legal battles.But cultural shifts can take time.For years, the consistent absence of strong and leading roles for women in front of - and behind - the camera has been criticised. That too is changing.And perhaps the reason it is changing is that when it comes to the movie business, it is money that talks.Women have always known that with a great story and good acting, they can carry a film.Hollywood's executives have, for too long, doubted it, but there is proof now.The three most popular films of 2017 in the US all featured women in their lead roles - Emma Watson in Beauty and the Beast, Daisy Ridley in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman.Now, you could argue that in a year when powerful men were named and shamed, it is fitting that powerful women are to the fore.Maybe it is a coincidence, not least when you consider how long it takes for a film to be made.But bear in mind, the last time the top three films were fronted by women was back in 1958.It is significant that there are other films this year fronted by women which have captured the attention of audiences, and may well strike it lucky in the Oscars.It obviously isn't just about persuading Hollywood that women can generate profits.Even before 2017's record-breaking box office receipts had been counted, it had already been proven that Jennifer Lawrence can carry a film, as can Reese Witherspoon, or Kate Winslet, or Cate Blanchett, or many other top names.There are other issues relating to money that are still being fought.Ensuring women command the same salaries as men is a battle yet to be won. Having control of the purse strings, then, is critical.Kathryn Bigelow is still the only woman who has won an Oscar for Best Director. Only four have ever been nominated in that category.Firsts should always be celebrated.But I've always thought that it is when there are seconds and thirds that such things become part of the cultural fabric.And so it is, with female leads in money-making movies. When it stops being something to write home about, then it will simply be part of the way Hollywood does business.And it is all part of a delicate balancing act.Hollywood loves women - they are a core part of the package of the glamour presented to the world.Women buy into this - not just those in Hollywood, but all of us who pay to watch the movies they are in.Alongside all that is the obvious point that is, sadly, still necessary to make: women don't ask for special treatment, just equality. And that also means equality of opportunity.And if what is preventing that is age-old habits of seeing women in a particular way, then perhaps the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements are important bellwethers - but we will only really see the full manifestation of cultural change a little further down the line.
entertainment	Hollywood reacts to Harvey Weinstein abuse claims	'Reckless reporting''I believe you'	"Leading Hollywood figures have reacted to the New York Times' article on sexual harassment allegations made against film producer Harvey Weinstein.The article reported he had reached at least eight settlements with women.Girls creator Lena Dunham thanked one of its writers ""for pushing past [a] flimsy but firm veil of secrecy"".Weinstein has disputed the newspaper report that claimed he harassed female employees over nearly three decades and is taking legal action.The co-founder of Miramax and The Weinstein Company released a statement on Thursday in which he expressed ""regret [for] what happened"".""I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,"" he wrote.Weinstein, a married father of five, said he planned to take a leave of absence from his company and had hired therapists to deal with his issues.Yet the producer of Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and other Oscar winners later said he was taking legal action against the paper for its ""reckless reporting"".""This is a vendetta, and the next time I see [NYT executive editor] Dean Baquet it will be across a courtroom,"" he is quoted as saying by the Page Six website.The 65-year-old has been married since 2007 to fashion designer Georgina Rose Chapman, with whom he has two children.Oscar-winner Brie Larson responded to the allegations by saying she stood ""with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment... as always"".""It's not your fault. I believe you,"" she wrote in a post that did not mention Weinstein by name.""The woman who chose to speak about their experience of harassment by Harvey Weinstein deserve our awe,"" wrote Dunham in another post.""It's not fun or easy.

entertainment	Hollywood descends on Toronto for film festival		"The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) opens later, with tennis drama Borg McEnroe kicking things off.More than 250 films will screen at the 11-day event in Canada's largest city.The festival's opening film sees Shia LaBeouf and Sverrir Gudnason play Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe, recreating their famous meeting in the 1980 men's final at Wimbledon.Many films shown at TIFF, now in its 42nd year, traditionally go on to Oscars success.Unlike many film festivals, Toronto does not appoint a jury to score the films or give prizes.Instead it asks audience members to name a ""People's Choice"" in a public ballot.Previous winners include Slumdog Millionaire, Room, 12 Years a Slave, The King's Speech, Silver Linings Playbook and La La Land.Given the awards success many of those films went on to have, it's understandable why Toronto is seen as such a good indicator of public reaction.This year a number of films are already attracting the attention of critics.Margot Robbie's turn as figure skater Tonya Harding in I, Tonya is set to be a highlight, as are Downsizing, which stars Matt Damon, and The Current War, which sees Benedict Cumberbatch play Thomas Edison.Borg McEnroe isn't the only sports-based film generating awards buzz, or even the only tennis-based film.Emma Stone's portrayal of Billie Jean King in Battle of the Sexes also considered a hot property this year.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Charlize Theron blasts 'caveman-like' Hollywood		"Charlize Theron has called Hollywood ""caveman-like"" for so rarely allowing women to direct big-budget films.""I am ashamed I'm part of an industry that has never allowed a woman to work with a budget higher than what the budget has been on Wonder Woman,"" the Oscar-winning actress told Variety.Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman was made for a reported $149m (£116m) and has made $746m (£582m) worldwide.Theron, 41, also bemoaned the lack of female-driven action films.Her comments come ahead of the release of Atomic Blonde, in which she stars as a British MI6 agent in 1980s Berlin.The actress, who won an Oscar after working with Jenkins in Monster, played another action-oriented role in 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road.Speaking to Variety, though, the South African-born star rued the way the rare female successes in the traditionally male-dominated genre were not capitalised upon.""We've had moments like this, where women really showcase themselves and kind of break glass ceilings,"" she said.""And then we don't sustain it. Or there's one movie that doesn't do well, and all of a sudden, no one wants to make a female-driven film.""Theron sustained various injuries while shooting Atomic Blonde, among them a twisted knee and two cracked teeth.""It was tough,"" she said of the film, released in the UK on 9 August. ""You want to be in your best fighting shape, and it's hard.""Theron's other films this year include Fast and Furious 8, in which she played a villainous role opposite Vin Diesel and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.Earlier this year Michelle Rodriguez revealed she was considering leaving the action franchise over the way it treated its female characters.""I hope they decide to show some love to the women of the franchise on the next one,"" she wrote on Instagram.Wonder Woman became the most successful live-action film to be directed by a woman last month after exceeding the takings of 2008's Mamma Mia!.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

I felt the need to make myself whole,"" she said at a Goop Wellness Summit.In the years since, she has married Good Charlotte singer Benji Madden and published two books - The Body Book, a health and fitness manual, and The Longevity Book, about the art and science of growing older.Once voted the sexiest man of the 20th Century, James Bond star Sir Sean Connery quit acting after filming The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2003.He didn't officially confirm his retirement until he received the American Film Institute's lifetime achievement award in 2006.Although according to his friend Sir Michael Caine, it was the movie business that retired the Bond star ""because he didn't want to play small parts about old men and they weren't offering him any young parts in romantic leads"".Sir Sean has since been enjoying retirement, spending his days playing golf and has been spotted at the odd tennis tournament.Canadian actor Rick Moranis rose up Hollywood's ranks after appearing in hit films such as Ghostbusters, Spaceballs, Little Shop of Horrors and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.However he began scaling back his acting work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 and retired from on-screen work completely in 1997 to concentrate on raising his children.""I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,"" he told USA Today in 2005.""So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.""One of the most famous child actors, Shirley Temple was awarded a special juvenile Oscar in 1935 for her contribution to film that year when she was just seven years old.But as she grew older her appeal declined and she retired from acting in 1950 at the grand old age of 22.She returned to the spotlight in the late 1960s as a politician and diplomat, and became the US ambassador to Czechoslovakia in 1989.She continued to work in public service including for the United Nations until she died in 2014 aged 85.As King Joffrey on hit TV show Game of Thrones, (SPOILER ALERT) Jack Gleeson played one of the most hated characters on TV for three years, but when his character was killed off in season three, the star decided to kill off his acting career too.""I've been acting since age eight,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""I just stopped enjoying it as much as I used to... whereas up until now it was always something I did for recreation with my friends, or in the summer for some fun - I enjoyed it.""When you make a living from something, it changes your relationship with it. It's not like I hate it, it's just not what I want to do.""Gleeson went on to study philosophy and theology at Dublin's Trinity College, although he dipped a toe back into performing when he took a puppet show, called Bears in Space, to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014 and London's Soho Theatre in 2015.Amanda Bynes hit the big time in her teens when she scored her own programme - The Amanda Show - on Nickelodeon.A string of teen films followed which you may have seen more than once or twice on TV recently - What a Girl Wants (2003), where she finds out her dad is Colin Firth who is trying to become prime minister; She's the Man (2006), a modern take on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night; and the big-screen adaptation of the musical Hairspray.Once touted as a young Lucille Ball, her last film role was in 2010 - the same year she tweeted: ""If I don't love something anymore I stop doing it. I don't love acting anymore so I've stopped doing it.""In the years since, she's had more than one brush with the law for drunk driving and substance abuse, but the actress - who is now 31 - recently gave an interview saying she was now three years sober and wanted to start acting again.""I want to be alone,"" Greta Garbo was famed for saying - and in the end, she really meant it.The actress was one of Hollywood's most enigmatic stars in the 1930s. Desperate for privacy, she never gave any interviews, signed autographs or attended premieres - much to the frustration of the press.She retired from acting when she was 36, saying she was ""tired of Hollywood"" and ""wanted to live another life"".But her early retirement and subsequent reclusiveness meant she remained eternally young on screen and in people's minds.After a five-decade career and Oscar wins in 1971 for The French Connection and 1992 for Unforgiven, Gene Hackman told veteran US TV host Larry King in 2004 he was retiring.Four years later in an interview with Reuters he said although he missed acting, he didn't want to do it any longer.""The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore,"" he said.Since he retired, he's written three novels.Doris Day was one of the biggest stars by the 1960s thanks to her double singing and acting career, in films such as Calamity Jane, Pillow Talk and Move Over, Darling.Her last film was in 1968 and after a brief stint on TV, announced she was retiring from acting in 1975.Now 95, she has since dedicated her life to working as an animal welfare advocate, and set up the Doris Day Animal Foundation in 1978.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Diahann Carroll: Pioneering actress dies aged 84		"US actress Diahann Carroll, who won Golden Globe and Tony awards and was nominated for an Oscar, has died.Carroll, who was 84, starred in 1960s TV show Julia, the first US sitcom to centre on a black woman.She was also the first black woman to win the Tony for best actress in 1962, for Broadway musical No Strings. She went on to be nominated for an Oscar for best actress in 1975 for Claudine.In the 1980s, she played the scheming Dominique Deveraux in TV hit Dynasty.She had been suffering from cancer and died at home in Los Angeles on Friday, her publicist said.Born Carol Diann Johnson in Harlem, New York, in 1935, she was modelling by the age of 15 and was reportedly the model for one of the first black Barbie dolls.At the age of 19, she won her first Hollywood role, appearing opposite Dorothy Dandridge in Carmen Jones.She suffered racism both in Hollywood and as on stage as a singer. In her autobiography, she detailed a concert when the orchestra conductor told her the audience didn't want to hear a black person sing. She confronted him, called the police and eventually had the man removed from the show, she wrote.Returning to the big screen, she starred in Porgy and Bess alongside Sidney Poitier, Sammy Davis Jr and Dandridge. Other film credits included 1961's Paris Blues with Paul Newman, and Hurry Sundown in 1967 with Michael Caine and Jane Fonda.In the late 60s, Carroll played the title role in Julia - a nurse who was a Vietnam widow and single mother - and the role earned her a Golden Globe for best female TV star in 1969.She said she saw the show as ""a chance to say something else about the black community"", adding: ""I was amazed at the number of people who had no idea there was a black middle class.""Halle Berry and Angela Bassett are among the stars who have cited her as an inspiration for their careers.Carroll was married four times, had a tempestuous affair with Sidney Poitier for nine years, and was engaged to the British broadcaster David Frost - which she described as ""one of the best things that ever happened to me"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Meryl Streep says boardroom inequality contributed to Hollywood sex scandal		"Meryl Streep has said sexual harassment wouldn't have been tolerated in Hollywood if there were more women on the boards of entertainment companies.The star is getting together with other well-known actresses to demand equal representation in boardrooms.She said balanced boards wouldn't have approved pay-offs like those given to some of Harvey Weinstein's accusers.""If the boards of the company were half female, there wouldn't ever have been pay-offs to anybody,"" Streep said.Speaking on a Buzzfeed panel, she said that if there had been more women in positions of power, ""the shenanigans wouldn't have occurred"".She also said the Hollywood press had ""often been silly and shills for the powerful"" but that powerful people had tried to suppress scrutiny and prevent reporters from running negative stories.""Power tries to suppress the truth,"" she said. ""That's just what happens - in Hollywood, Wall Street, in the news media as well. So everybody has to stay alert and awake and fight against them.""She was promoting her new film The Post, in which she plays former Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, and which tells the story of how the paper helped uncover secret government documents relating to the Vietnam War.Last week, she outlined a plan to get equal representation on the boards of entertainment giants in a speech at the Massachusetts Conference for Women.""Right now, I'm getting together with a bunch of actresses that you know very well, and we're all sort of going to make a set of non-negotiable demands,"" she said, according to People. ""We're after 50/50 by 2020.""She told the conference she was hopeful that the world was changing, but said it was still difficult for women to reach the ""top layer"".""There are always three women on a board, and then there are nine or 12 or 14 other people,"" she said. ""Equal means equal. And if it starts at the top, none of these shenanigans would have filtered down and been tolerated.""Part of the problem is that there's no horrible plot at the top of Hollywood not to keep people of colour or women out of leadership positions.""It's that like hires like. White hires white. A guy who wears his baseball cap backwards hires a guy who wears his baseball cap backwards. So we have to encourage the people who are currently in power, who are of one gender, to open the door.""Streep worked with Weinstein on such films as The Iron Lady and August: Osage County and jokingly referred to him as ""God"" in a 2012 acceptance speech.But after the allegations against him emerged, she said she was ""appalled"" by the ""disgraceful"" news.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Hollywood’s missing motion pictures		"As excitement burbles about who will win at the Oscars in February, spare a thought for the film industry losers.Every year there are countless disappointed runners-up in the race for the greatest prize in showbiz.Sadder still are the vast majority of movie makers that never even get nominated for an industry gong.But the unluckiest of all are those whose hard work doesn't even make it on to the big screen.One director that knows how it feels to have his creative vision canned is Oley Sassone.His infamous 1994 movie The Fantastic Four - charting the origins of the Marvel Comics superheroes - remained hidden from public view for more than two decades.'Kicked in the gut'""I remember exactly where I was when I got the call,"" he says, recalling when he was told the film would never be shown to the public.""I was driving down San Vicente Boulevard in Los Angeles, and I literally had to pull over by the side of the road to take a few deep breaths. It was like getting kicked in the gut by a mule. I'd worked so hard.""The film's exec Producer Bernd Eichinger sat me down and said: 'Oley, I'm sorry, but we can't release the movie. There's a contractual agreement'.""And then a lightbulb went off in my head. I realised we had been made to get it into production by a certain date otherwise Constantin Films would lose the rights to the Fantastic Four franchise.""That was the agreement with Marvel. The movie just had to be made, it didn't have to be shown.""The Fantastic Four is one of a surprisingly common number of movies made each year that stay locked within the vaults of its copyright holders.And it's not just legal reasons that keep these films from ever seeing the light of day. The most common cause is the death of a key actor before filming is completed.Thriller Dark Blood was six scenes short of being finished when its star River Phoenix died of a drug overdose in 1993.Director George Sluizer deemed there to be enough footage to cobble together a final cut, but despite a warm critical reception when it premiered at the Netherlands Film Festival in 2012 to a private audience, the film has never been given an official release.Hidden awaySome movies stay unreleased simply because they run out of money - like All American Massacre, the 1998 sequel to horror classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Even though the entire film has been shot, to this day director William Hooper has been unable to raise the mere $8,000 (£6,400) needed to finish post-production.And some films fall at the final hurdle because they're just plain awful, like 2013 fantasy satire Gods Behaving Badly.Not even a stellar cast including Christopher Walken, Susan Sarandon and Alicia Silverstone could stop critics from labelling it as ""remarkably feeble"" and ""unfunny"" when it premiered at the Rome Film Festival.Since then, there have been no further screenings.Perhaps the most notorious canned movie is The Day The Clown Cried - a wildly misjudged drama about the horrors of the Holocaust starring comedian Jerry Lewis.Filmed in 1972, Lewis plays a clown imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, entertaining children on their way to the gas chambers.He subsequently u-turned on his enthusiasm for the project, but Lewis is known to be in possession of one of the only existing copies of the film.""You will never see it. No one will ever see it,"" he told Entertainment Weekly in 2013. ""Because I am embarrassed at the poor work.""Such was the furore surrounding The Day The Clown Cried, it has attained an almost mythical status amongst film buffs.Sassone believes that by keeping movies locked away, it risks drawing more attention than just letting the film be released as normal.""When people want something that they can't have, it makes them that much more eager to get it,"" he says. ""Rumours swirl about what's in it, and that creates a mystery or a conspiracy. It becomes cultish.""Sassone's Fantastic Four fiasco was chronicled in the 2016 documentary Doomed. The key players quibble over the precise details of why the film never made it to cinemas, but to Sassone what matters most is that those who worked on the movie never got to see it.""I tried to get them to at least give me a copy, so I had a record of my work,"" he says. ""And they said: 'Sorry, we can't do that, the movie's been confiscated.'""Thank God, one guy from the studio had it on three-quarter-inch video. It wasn't great quality, it was just a straight transfer to video, but I took it over to a dubbing house in LA to reel off a few VHS copies.""I'm guessing that some kid working there ran off a few copies for himself, because years later bootlegs started circulating at comic book conventions.""'It does look awful'In 2015, the film was finally leaked on YouTube and currently holds a 29% approval score on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes.""People criticise the movie because it looks awful,"" Sassone says.""And I agree because it does look awful - but the original movie doesn't look like that. They've only ever seen terrible copies of the movie made from VHS to VHS to VHS. And it pains us because everybody put their heart and soul in to this film.""It wasn't about the money - what hurt was that we knew we had a hot little film that cost almost nothing to make. We were never completely satisfied with the special effects, but the drama was so true to the original comic book characters.""Meanwhile in 2005, executive producer Eichinger went on to reboot the Fantastic Four franchise in a mega-budget summer blockbuster starring Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba and Chris Evans. To Sassone's delight, it has a lower Rotten Tomatoes score than his take on the movie.""Will they be talking about the latter versions of the Fantastic Four in 22 years' time? I dunno,"" he says. ""When we had the premiere of Doomed all these kids came up to us and said: 'Your movie is so much better than all those crappy big budget Fantastic Fours!'""I asked why and they said: 'Because you hit the characters! It was real.' Obviously we can't compete with the special effects, but it was some vindication after all those years when they said our film was better than the $50m (£40m) versions.""As a hero of hidden Hollywood, perhaps Sassone has achieved a prize greater than winning an Oscar - his movie is the stuff of Hollywood legend.""It's hard to say how my life would have panned out if the movie had just had a regular release,"" he muses. ""I think I would probably have been offered a studio picture or a bigger movie somewhere.""Instead I went on to make a lot of television like Hercules and Xena: Warrior Princess, so I had a pretty successful career anyway.""But I always tell people, it's the movie business. Pay attention to the word 'business' - because that's what it is.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	It's The End of the F****** World again, and TV critics feel fine		"The second series of The End of the F****** World has received warm reviews from many critics - although most say it doesn't quite live up to the first.The first series of Channel 4's comedy-drama aired in 2017 and became an international hit on Netflix last year.""Against the odds, they've almost lived up to the electric first season,"" wrote Collider's Haleigh Foutch. ""Almost.""Mike Hale of The New York Times said the storyline didn't have the same ""momentum"" as the first season.""It's all still amusing, and the notes of strangled romanticism and just-perceptible nobility are still in place,"" he wrote.""But the plot doesn't have the momentum and the crazy energy it did the first time around, and it's harder to ignore the show's calculating nature: how it uses Alyssa and James's interior monologues to tell us what to think, and the constant musical cues to tell us how to feel.""The series is based on Charles Forsman's graphic novel of the same name and stars Jessica Barden and Alex Lawther as Alyssa and James, the two young outsiders at the centre of the show.The first season saw the pair embark on a road trip in search of Alyssa's real father. The second landed on Channel 4 on Monday and on Netflix internationally on Tuesday.Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian gave the show five stars. ""It is gruesome and violent and scatological, but then it is funny and pointed and wry, and then it defers to a tender look, or an affectionate touch, and shows its heart,"" she said.""One of the skills of this show is its light touch when it comes to humour, which arrives unexpectedly, in the bleakest of moments. The writing is fantastically dry - even a line as stark as 'I killed someone' earns a laugh, through the addition of a pause, and the explanatory addition of 'on purpose'.""However, Ben Travers of IndieWire said the plot was ""largely redundant, reworking the story beats from season one to make explicit everything that was implied"".He wrote: ""By the time you get to the end of season two, very little vital progress has been made, besides moving the characters away from that traumatic final moment on the beach, and in doing so, upending the bite of season one's tragedy and replacing it with something much more palatable and much more commonplace.""In her Collider review, Foutch concluded the new season is ""not as magical or electrifying as the first"", but added: ""It's still an impressive, emotional piece of storytelling that keeps hold of what made us fall in love with these characters in the first place without forcing them to regress.""""Some people think the second season shouldn't have even been made,"" said Cosmopolitan's Emma Baty.""I'm not gonna go that far, because I did truly like this season. However, unless Netflix can come up with a REALLY killer plot for the next season, this should probably be the end of it.""Michael Hogan of The Telegraph said writer Charlie Covell and director Lucy Forbes had maintained the ""sense of millennial angst and the stylised storytelling of a graphic novel"", adding: ""The result was bleak but dry, wry and hopelessly romantic.""The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman said the show was ""still great"" - albeit perhaps not quite as great as the first.""There are some missteps,"" he wrote. ""The voiceover trick that worked so brilliantly the first time around even when it shouldn't have, not surprisingly, is less effective and sometimes egregious this time out. And there are some pacing issues.""That said, the better parts are more frequent than the lacking parts; it's a pleasure to have James and Alyssa back in viewers' lives, no matter how damaged they are.""And the response on social media was mostly positive.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Marvel star slates 'racist' Hollywood over name change		"Chloe Bennet, who stars in TV series Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, has said she had to change her name from Chloe Wang in order to make it in Hollywood.The actress praised Ed Skrein for recently pulling out of Hellboy.His casting had been criticised for ""whitewashing"" the original character, who is of Asian heritage.She told an Instagram follower who queried her name change: ""Hollywood is racist and wouldn't cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable.""""Changing my last name doesn't change the fact that my BLOOD is half Chinese, that I lived in China, speak Mandarin or that I was culturally raised both American and Chinese... It means I had to pay my rent.""She added: ""I'm doing everything I can, with the platform I have, to make sure no one has to change their name again, just so they can get work.""Chloe, who plays a secret agent, has previously explained how her name change led to a more successful career almost immediately.""Oh, the first audition I went on after I changed my name, I got booked,"" she told The Daily Beast last year. ""So that's a pretty clear little snippet of how Hollywood works.""The actress has since created RUN (Represent Us Now) a group which campaigns for Asian American and Pacific Islander communities to be better represented in Hollywood.She praised Skrein's decision earlier this week, saying: ""DAMN, that's a man. Thank you @edskrein for standing up against Hollywood's continuous insensitivity and flippant behaviour towards the Asian American community.""There is no way this decision came lightly on your part, so thank you for your bravery and genuinely impactful step forward. I hope this inspires other actors/film makers to do the same.""Fellas, take note. That's how it's done.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Lili Fini Zanuck: Director says 2017 'wasn't a turning point' for Hollywood		"Last year wasn't a turning point for women in Hollywood, according to the producer behind the multi-Oscar winning film Driving Miss Daisy.Lili Fini Zanuck, who was only the second woman to ever win a best picture Oscar when she took the award for Driving Miss Daisy in 1990, also produced Cocoon and directed 1991's Rush.The 63-year-old has now made a documentary about Eric Clapton, called Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars.""No, we haven't turned a corner,"" she says when asked whether the tumultuous events of 2017 meant the climate was changing for women in the entertainment industry.""We might have more women working, but every year there's an in-depth study produced about how many women editors, directors, cinematographers and writers there are, and the numbers are still poor.""I think we'll have changes, but some of them will be cosmetic. There are two big job openings in Hollywood that I think will go to women, but then women working at an executive level hasn't been the problem.""Zanuck also warns of ""tokenism"" rather than real change following the allegations of sexual assault and harassment made against prominent Hollywood figures in 2017, including producer Harvey Weinstein.""I think you'll have a lot of 'token' stuff happening, and people will make some adjustments in their behaviour. I think you'll definitely see a decrease in overt bad behaviour,"" she says.""People are going to have a big fear factor this year and some of that will be down to the fact that so far there's been no due legal process involved.""I'm not talking about Harvey Weinstein, that's a whole other story. I'm talking about allegations being made and then your career can be over.""I think there will be a lot of scared people in Hollywood. But is this really going to help women in the workplace? I don't necessarily think so.""For part of her career, Lili Fini Zanuck made films with her husband Richard D Zanuck, a producer on the original Jaws movie, who died in 2012. While he co-produced Driving Miss Daisy, she was the force behind it.The story of an elderly woman and her African American chauffeur, played by Morgan Freeman, started as an independent film and went on to win four Oscars, including for Miss Daisy herself, Jessica Tandy. It was nominated for another five.When Zanuck went up in 1990 to receive the best picture award, only one other woman had gone before her - Julia Phillips in 1974 for The Sting, starring Robert Redford.As of January 2018, only one woman has won a best director Oscar - Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker in 2010. For another female to win, Zanuck advises women to ""forget the personal - make your Apocalypse Now"".""Years ago, when people would complain about this to me, I would say, 'Maybe the stories women want to make tend to be very personal,'"" she explains.""I would say, 'When a woman makes an Apocalypse Now, it will happen.' The thing with The Hurt Locker was it really was Kathryn's Apocalypse Now. The best recent example is Patty Jenkins and Wonder Woman - it's taking a genre up to a whole new level.""So it's not that a woman can't be recognised for directing, it's got to be a film that's broad enough to appeal to the entire Academy and they can agree that this film speaks to everyone.""But to be a director, you have to have talent. Forget what they say, there is no luck involved in this industry - absolutely none at all involved in directing.""Zanuck says she didn't necessarily think she'd come back to directing, but her decades-long friendship with Clapton (he did the score for her movie Rush) meant that he approached her to make Life in 12 Bars.""He was asked to do the film and he said he would only participate if I directed it,"" she says. She wasn't surprised, she adds, that the 18-time Grammy winner hadn't been willing to put his name to a film about his career before now.""I think this got made because Eric was in the right mood,"" she explains. ""He's an incredibly private man and despite his immense success, he's never cared if he got any publicity at all, he just loves his music.""I am very grateful he's even willing to speak about this as he could just have easily not have done.""I think it might be something to do with his age, as he turned 70 a couple of years ago. He said to me, 'I didn't want it to be done after I was dead and for it to be wrong.' Maybe he thought his time had come to lay it all out on the table.""Zanuck says the ""luxury"" of directing only came after Driving Miss Daisy, adding that she used the Oscar ""to grab my chance, but one doesn't necessarily lead into the other"".She continues: ""Until then, I was used to not been taken seriously for the first 10 minutes of any meeting. I was a third wife, 20 years younger than my husband, and blonde.""Instead, I built my entire career initially on taking the jobs that other producers didn't want to do. You have to be tenacious and have an overriding belief in your own good judgement.""As I stood up there for my Oscar acceptance speech, I saw a sea of people who had said 'no' to me. But every time I was rejected, there was never any doubt in my mind that I was right.""Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars is released in the UK on 12 January. A Q&A with Clapton and Zanuck will be broadcast live to cinemas around the UK with a preview screening of the film on 10 January.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

'A true legend'	"Michael Parks, who was named by directors Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith as one of their favourite actors, has died at the age of 77.Smith broke the news, describing Parks as ""the best actor I've ever known"" and ""the most incredible thespian I ever had the pleasure to watch perform"".Smith cast him in Red State and Tusk, while he appeared in both of Tarantino's Kill Bill films.Tarantino described him in 1997 as ""one of my favourite actors in the world"".Parks made his name on US TV in the 1960s and with film roles including Adam in director John Huston's 1966 epic The Bible: In the Beginning...He had the lead role in TV series Then Came Bronson in 1969-70 - which Tarantino described as ""the most naturalistic acting I've ever seen on a TV show"".He was likened at the time to James Dean - but never had a major breakthrough and his career faded.There were suggestions that he was shunned by Hollywood studios - which has been attributed to him speaking out about the violence in Then Came Bronson, a contract dispute with Universal, or being difficult to work with.Something of a career revival began when David Lynch cast him as Jean Renault in the second season of Twin Peaks, which aired in 1990.His other film credits included Django Unchained, Grindhouse, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Argo.Director Robert Rodriguez, who cast him in From Dusk Till Dawn, said in 2011: ""He was always considered to be the actor who should replace James Dean when James Dean passed, and his naturalism was just amazing to watch.""Responding to the news of Parks's death, Rodriguez wrote on Twitter: ""A heartfelt farewell to the one and only Michael Parks. A very kind man and a true legend.""In his Instagram tribute on Wednesday, Kevin Smith added: ""He elevated any flick or TV show he was in and elevated every director he ever acted for.

entertainment	The Irishman: Will Gompertz reviews Martin Scorsese's new mob movie backed by Netflix ★★★★☆	Recent reviews by Will Gompertz	"Martin Scorsese says he couldn't get a Hollywood studio to back his three-and-a-half-hour mob movie The Irishman. ""Nobody was interested in making a film with me and Bob [Robert De Niro] anymore,"" he said. ""I just think they thought the audience wasn't there.""Possibly.Although I think they probably ran the numbers first. I mean, if you're a studio exec and have one of the greatest movie directors of all time pitching an idea in a genre he's made his own, starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, you'd listen, wouldn't you?I imagine it came down to money and cautiousness.The three male leads are all in their 70s, which is not a problem in itself, but the majority of their screen-time is spent when their characters are in their late 30s, early 40s. No amount of make-up was going to paper over those facial cracks. Stand-ins were discounted. Digital de-aging was the only option, but it had never been done in the way that Scorsese demanded: no green-screen, no image-capture head-gear - new technology was required.Too risky, maybe. Would it work? Would it cost a fortune? Would the actors play ball?Netflix stepped in and answered all three questions in the affirmative. But for all the very expensive high-tech trickery The Irishman is a staunchly old-school movie spanning half a century of mafia mischief in post-war America.Classic Scorsese, you could say.And so it is, up to a point. Cars are dramatically blown up, there are a lot of cold-blooded murders, and attention to every detail is paid with a historian's soul and an artist's eye.The Irishman is a beautifully made film.It is also very slow.It starts with a long tracking shot inside an old people's home, at the end of which we meet our elderly narrator Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), the eponymous Irishman. He tells us his story in a series of flashbacks in which we see a de-aged De Niro go from a trigger-happy American soldier to a trigger-happy Pennsylvania gangster working for mafia don Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci).Scorsese says Pesci took a lot of persuading to put away his golf clubs and return to acting.For Marty and for us it was time well invested. Pesci's performance as the quietly-spoken, business-like organised crime boss is exceptional.It will take something very special to deprive him of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.The spine of the movie is a road trip he takes with Frank (whom he calls ""kid"" throughout without even the smallest twinkle in his eye) to attend a family wedding. It's a structural device that allows Scorsese to take all the side-tracks he needs to fill in the back story of the three inter-connected protagonists: Frank, Russell, and trade union president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).Russell engineers a job interview for Frank as Hoffa's wingman, which takes place over the phone. ""I heard you paint houses"", Hoffa posits. ""I do"", replies Frank, ""and I do my own carpentry"" - a line that wins an approving Sicilian smile from Russell.They are not discussing DIY.In a 1960s world of phone taps and wire traps, underworld America developed its own patois: hit men were known as house painters. Those who cleaned up afterwards did their own joinery.It's a central exchange in the film, establishing the crime triangle, the pecking-order of the protagonists, and the relationships that would develop.Pacino is excellent, although slightly undermined by the de-aging process which, at times, makes him look more like the camp British TV host Larry Grayson than a tough-as-teak union leader.De Niro is also let down by the technology, which is a shame, because he is on top form. The facial changes are fine, they work. But it still leaves him with a body of a septuagenarian, which looks incongruous when moving stiff-hipped over rocks, or assaulting a local shopkeeper with arms pinned to his body.It's not a disaster, but it looks odd: it jars and distracts from an otherwise first-class film, which wears its duration lightly. In fact, the slow pace acts as another character, giving a very specific personality to the film, which is a re-telling of a true story made public in book form by Charles Brandt, a lawyer and friend of Frank Sheeran.Martin Scorsese says it is about ""power, love, betrayal, and then, ultimately, the price you pay for the life you lead"". I said I thought it was also about old age, which elicited the sort of look you don't quickly forget from the legendary helmsman.""Old age?"" he said, eyebrows raised.""Yeah"", I replied, ""it's about the aging process"".""The aging process"", he says and slowly and nods, ""yes, the aging process ultimately… [pauses, smiles] without scaring an audience saying we won't go and see a film about old age.""A nerve unintentionally touched.Perhaps the perception that it was a film about old folk was an issue when it came to financing.Who knows. But it is.That is the perspective from which the story is being told and rationalised: Sheeran is an old man facing his day of reckoning, like King Lear on the heath: not with two cruel daughters on his mind, though, but the two powerful masters he served.It is a story of divided loyalties we've heard before, from 18th Century commedia dell'arte to the National Theatre's hit play One Man Two Guvnors. They were comedies, The Irishman isn't, but it is not beyond the realms of reason that Netflix ends up laughing all the way to the bank with a hit Hollywood rejected.Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter"
entertainment	Hollywood whitewashing: Is Ed Skrein's Hellboy exit a turning point?	Who is Ed Skrein?Career suicide, or a good move?A turning point for Hollywood?A history of Hollywood whitewashingNot just Hollywood (and not just whitewashing)	"Film fans have inundated Ed Skrein with love after the British actor turned down the role of Major Ben Daimio in the new Hellboy film because the character is of mixed Asian heritage (and he isn't).Skrein's decision comes after years of controversy about Hollywood whitewashing. The rising star has been praised for his stance, especially since he's at a crucial point in his career, and won lots of new admirers.Before becoming Hollywood's real-life hero, the Londoner was best-known for his movie breakthrough as the villain Ajax in Deadpool.He also played the original Daario Naharis in season three of Game of Thrones.Other films included The Transporter Refueled, replacing Jason Statham in the franchise, plus Ill Manors and Kill Your Friends.Skrein's statement is ""very brave"" for someone who's an up-and-coming actor in Hollywood, according to Larushka Ivan-Zadeh, Metro newspaper's chief film critic.""Will he, by standing up for anti-whitewashing, be blacklisted as a troublemaker?"" she asks.""There is that threat. We don't know what goes on behind the scenes, and studios can be very closed ranks. They don't like people making them look bad or causing a fuss.""But I don't think it will do his career too much harm. I hope.""Skrein is on the cusp of the big time, and perhaps the studios will bank on the fact that rather than being tainted by a whitewashing ""scandal"", he has instantly become just about the most beloved member of an industry that is often seen as mercenary and discriminatory.Cultural consultant Harpreet Kaur says: ""If he'd gone ahead and taken the role, it might not have looked so good for his future and his career, but I think he's now a role model for other people, and not just in film.""Skrein is the first actor to have publicly turned down a role because he's the wrong ethnicity. After his example, will other actors be able to play characters from a different ethnic group and hold their heads up ever again?""This is a really unusual thing for someone to do,"" says Larushka Ivan-Zadeh. ""It will become a reference point. This is making a stand because he is standing up for his convictions.""I think it will definitely make other actors consider the parts that they play and take responsibility for it, because that's what he's doing.""As for the studios, Ivan-Zadeh thinks attitudes are changing - slowly.""Things are starting to shift. And the fact that this conversation is not going away, that it keeps happening year after year, is something people can't ignore.""These things keep happening, and having a statement like this keeps that conversation alive on a big scale. But every time you think it's changed, then it seems to go back.""Using white actors to play characters of a different ethnic origin has been going on for decades - egregious examples include Mickey Rooney as Mr Yunioshi in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961 and Laurence Olivier blacking up for 1965's Othello.The debate has intensified in recent years. Jake Gyllenhaal played the title role in 2010's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Johnny Depp was the Native American Tonto in 2013's The Lone Ranger.In 2016's Gods of Egypt, stars like Gerard Butler played Egyptian deities. Earlier this year, an uproar met Scarlett Johansson's Ghost in the Shell, a live action remake of a Japanese manga comic, while Emma Stone played a woman of Hawaiian and Chinese heritage in Aloha in 2015.The argument from studios and financiers has always been that they need a big name to attract enough fans to pay for the tickets - and some ethnic groups don't have many big names.Director Ridley Scott was criticised for 2014's Exodus: Gods and Kings, in which white actors including Christian Bale played Biblical characters.On the BBC's Film 2014, when it was suggested that he could have used Middle Eastern actors, a tetchy Scott replied: ""Yeah, but can you tell me who? If they don't exist? To justify the budget? You wouldn't get it made, dude. You wouldn't get it made. You're dreaming. Dreaming.""There was a similar outcry when Tom Hardy was rumoured to be playing Jafar in Guy Ritchie's new Aladdin. But Ritchie seems to have reconsidered, and that role has actually gone to Dutch-Tunisian actor Marwan Kenzari.Kenzari won a Shooting Stars Award at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2014 and has had parts in films like The Mummy, Ben-Hur and Murder on the Orient Express as well as the lead in Netflix's The Angel.So actors with the right experience and the right skin colour are out there. Perhaps, if they are given a break, we'll now see a new generation of non-white Hollywood stars coming through.Broadway has recently been through a similar episode, when actor Mandy Patinkin withdrew from the Tony-winning musical Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812 after being cast to replace Okieriete Onaodowan, who is black.Patinkin is a bigger name than Onaodowan and was brought in to boost ticket sales - but the move didn't go down well. The show is now closing.And there is a (whole other) debate about able-bodied actors playing disabled characters, and cisgender actors playing transgender characters.Last year, Jeffrey Tambor, the star of Amazon's TV series Transparent, used his Emmy Awards speech to say: ""I would not be unhappy were I the last cisgender male to play a transgender character on television.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Daniel Radcliffe: Hollywood undeniably racist	'Fear and hatred'	"Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has said it is ""pretty undeniable"" that Hollywood is racist.He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the film world was seen as ""very, very progressive"", but was ""lagging behind"" industries in encouraging diversity.Radcliffe also said it was hard for gay actors to come out for fear of being typecast in gay roles.And he stated that he did not want to play Potter again ""at this point"".The 27-year-old British actor has starred as JK Rowling's child wizard in several films since 2001.But his latest screen role, in the thriller Imperium, is as Nate Foster, an FBI agent who goes undercover to infiltrate a white supremacist group.Radcliffe told Victoria Derbyshire this had led him to think more about racial issues, and to consider how close to ""mainstream"" some of the opinions in the film had become.He criticised the Republican US presidential candidate, Donald Trump, saying he had ""stirred up"" feelings of ""fear and hatred"".The US film industry has itself come in for criticism for racism, with actor Dustin Hoffman and director Spike Lee boycotting this year's Oscars ceremony over what has been described as a lack of ethnic minority nominees.Asked whether Hollywood was ""racist"", Radcliffe, who is on the panel that chooses Oscar winners, said: ""It's pretty undeniable.""He added: ""We like to think of ourselves as being a very, very progressive industry, but we have been lagging behind in all kinds of areas. ""Radcliffe also voiced concern that gay actors felt unable to come out because ""I suppose then people just want to cast you as gay"".In 2012, the actor declared himself a supporter of the Labour Party, having previously backed the Liberal Democrats, and has since voiced support for leader Jeremy Corbyn.Asked about recent allegations of anti-Semitism within Labour, Radcliffe - whose mother is Jewish - described them as ""absolutely awful"" and ""shocking"".But he said he was still likely to back Labour at the next election ""if it was a choice between that and the Conservatives"".There has been speculation that the London stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child could be turned into a film, starring Radcliffe.But he said: ""No-one's asked me about it and I definitely don't think that I would do it at this point, certainly.""It's only been six years [since last playing Potter] and I'm really enjoying being able to do lots of different stuff at the moment.""He added: ""Maybe if 30 years had passed I would be thinking differently.

entertainment	Jessica Chastain: 5 ways she wants Hollywood to change	1) Some film critics need to open their minds2) Learning lines needs to be second nature to actors3) More films with female ensemble casts need to be made4) Actors need a little less conversation, a little more action5) Audiences need to be challenged more	"It's difficult to find a more varied CV in Hollywood than Jessica Chastain's.She's played a CIA analyst in Zero Dark Thirty, a housewife in The Help and is about to be seen as a ruthless lobbyist in political thriller Miss Sloane.But having worked in the industry for well over a decade, Chastain says she remains disappointed by many aspects of Hollywood.The actress spoke to BBC News during a visit to London last week, and shared her thoughts on what exactly needs to change.Obviously all actors dislike bad reviews, but Chastain's problem is a little more specific - she thinks some critics are too close-minded.""I had a lot of problems with Zero Dark Thirty and some reviews of Miss Sloane,"" she says.""[Some reviews] said 'Yes it's a great character, but why can't she be a woman, why does she have to be so masculine?'.""And I want to go back to those people and say Elizabeth Sloane is a woman, so that makes her feminine.""Femininity for each person is whatever they define it to be, and to say that femininity is to be soft, kind, loving, compassionate and weak, and masculinity is aggression, power, ambition and strength - [we're in] 2017 and we need to move away from that.""Earlier this month, Johnny Depp's former managers claimed the actor is often fed his lines through an earpiece instead of actually learning them.Chastain had, err, an interesting reaction to this when we mentioned it to her (see the video above).And it's fair to say her policy for learning the huge amount of dialogue in Miss Sloane was slightly different to Depp's.""My technique is working hard,"" she says simply. ""So on the weekends before I go into my work week I spend my entire day working on a script.""I couldn't search for my lines, it had to be cold, it had to be second nature, and the only way to get that is to spend the hours doing it.""You could certainly argue that Hollywood has come along way since Chastain's 2009 film The Help, which had an all-female principle cast.Since then, we've seen films with female ensemble casts slay the box office - such as Bridesmaids, Ghostbusters and Pitch Perfect.But, in the grand scheme of things, such films are still few and far between, perhaps because of Hollywood's reluctance to put women centre stage.""It's so old-fashioned, we don't have very many of them,"" Chastain says.She points out: ""Films with male ensembles don't work all the time and no-one talks about it.""""So I think we need to acknowledge that movies with female ensembles have a greater chance of making money than movies with male ensembles, and it's because the audience wants diversity in their storytelling - they want stories they haven't seen before.""Diversity has been a hot topic in Hollywood for some time, not least with #OscarsSoWhite and the move by some awards ceremonies to scrap gender-specific categories.It's become fashionable for actors and industry types to back campaigns for more diversity, but Chastain thinks not enough people are putting their money where their mouth is.""I think there's a lot of talk going on, but if you're part of the industry you're part of the problem, so you need to put your talk into action,"" she says.""It's not enough to say 'Oh there's a wage gap' and 'Oh only 7% of American film directors are women', you have to say, 'Well if I'm part of the industry I'm part of the problem, what can I do to help?'.""And so I'm doing whatever I can to work with female film-makers. I'm always speaking up whenever I see an injustice. I'm always doing whatever I can to create opportunities for people who haven't had a voice in American cinema.She's not kidding - one of Chastain's most recent films was The Zookeeper's Wife, directed by Niki Caro, who recently became only the fifth woman to direct a film budgeted at more than $100m.""I feel like 'okay I'm doing my part', but everyone needs to do their part and once we do we're going to hopefully have a more balanced industry,"" Chastain adds.Chastain's character in Miss Sloane is ruthless, tough and smart - a role she thinks will help audiences start to see female characters in a new way.""I was really excited about playing the smartest person in the room, I knew it was going to be a big challenge,"" Chastain says of the role.""I liked to play a character who shattered a stereotype of what a woman is supposed to be.""I think an audience isn't used to seeing a woman who isn't a caregiver. Society expects women to be the nurturers of their families and to be mothers and to want that - and Elizabeth Sloane doesn't want that.Miss Sloane is released in UK cinemas this weekend.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Emilia Clarke and Emma Thompson on Last Christmas and reading reviews	'We couldn't avoid Brexit'George Michael's 'poetry'Coffee cup culprit	"One thing we definitely aren't going to do in this article is give away any spoilers about Last Christmas. Apart from anything else, we're quite scared of Dame Emma Thompson.""The correct spoiler etiquette is: don't spoil it!"" the actress and writer tells BBC News after a week of critics' reviews that have revealed the ending.""It's easy isn't it? It's like 'don't punch strangers'. Just don't spoil it. Easy. Easy rule. Not complex.""Luckily, Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke, who plays the lead character Kate in the movie, has plenty of experience in keeping plot lines secret.""I've never done a job that didn't involve a spoiler,"" she points out. ""Literally, there is no job I've done. And some of them are bigger than others. But with this particular twist, there are ways about talking about our characters and the premise without going anywhere near it.""One thing that definitely isn't a secret is that the movie is based on the music of George Michael. His (and Wham's) best-known songs make up the soundtrack, and in a few cases are sung by the characters.Arguably, the most recent Christmas-themed movie to have become an annual audience favourite is 2003's Love Actually - which also starred Dame Emma. But she says trying to make the next great festive film ""wasn't her prime motivation"" for co-writing Last Christmas.""Love Actually, of course, was made by one of my best mates,"" she says, referring to writer-director Richard Curtis. ""And I'm so happy that people are still fond of it. So we certainly weren't thinking we were in competition with anything. I just wanted to try to make a good film, which has Christmas in it. And a bit of love, a bit of drama, and just everything we could throw at it.""Some reviews of the film have been positive. The Mirror gave it five stars, while The Wrap said it ""provides enough of a warm, fuzzy glow to light up a bleak midwinter"".It's fair to say, however, that many critics have been less enthusiastic.""Last Christmas is the worst festive film I have ever seen,"" wrote Dan Wootton in The Sun. ""It's a woke, remoaning, overly politically correct mess of a movie that manages to suck every inch of fun, joy and togetherness out of the season where we should be jolly.""His comments refer to the film's Brexit references, along with fact the central family are immigrants. Dame Emma's character (Kate's mother) comments that the EU referendum result makes her feel unwelcome, while one scene on a London bus shows someone telling off passengers who aren't speaking English.But Dame Emma argues: ""I think [the political references] are very lightly brushed in. Because our main character is the daughter of immigrants, it would be very difficult to tell this story without mentioning, at least, the fear that people have who are immigrants with Brexit.""Because it's set in a very particular time as well, it's set in 2016, we couldn't avoid it. Having it not there would've been slightly psychotic. And I think what's more important about what's under the fun of the movie is a message about kindness.""Clarke has her own policy when it comes to reading reviews. ""I don't look at them at all. It's partly drama school training, and then you do a bit of theatre, and it's just not helpful,"" she says.""The way I see it, right, is that I stopped Googling myself within a year of Game of Thrones happening. Because I was like, 'I don't need to know what people think about the size of my bottom, thank you so much.'""And then when you stop Googling yourself, you then stop reading reviews. If someone says something really good, if you get a 15 million-star review, someone will tell you, and if you get a 'one-star coal in the rectum', someone's going to tell you!"" She laughs while glaring at her co-star Henry Golding.(She's referring to the rather graphic way Rolling Stone described the experience of watching the film, which Clarke says Golding drew to her attention ""right before we stepped on live TV!"")Last Christmas is the latest in a string of movies that have been based on the back catalogues of a particular musical act. Queen, Bruce Springsteen and Elton John have all had the Hollywood treatment recently. ""Maybe Mamma Mia put that idea on the map,"" Dame Emma says.Golding, who is best known for starring in Crazy Rich Asians, says the benefit of such films is that they ""spark joy, memory, nostalgia"".""Especially with Freddie Mercury and Elton John,"" he continues. ""It's music we all grew up with, and to see what was actually happening, a glimpse of their biography, it kind of invigorates us, and makes us fall in love with that artist over and over again.""And hopefully that's what happens with George, and a broader market gets to listen to George for the first time, which I think is going to happen.""Dame Emma met Michael before his death in 2016. The singer gave the movie his blessing, and his family and management have been involved in the production since, even gifting a previously unheard recording to the soundtrack.""The songs just kind of slid in naturally,"" Dame Emma says. ""I didn't realise how his poetry describes so much of the acts of self-care and kindness that this film really speaks about.""The fact that Dame Emma, along with husband Greg Wise, co-wrote the film's screenplay meant she could personally monitor how the movie was taking shape.Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who both wrote and starred in Fleabag, was known for rewriting scenes while shooting. Was that a luxury Dame Emma enjoyed as well?""Deffo. Absolutely,"" she says. ""You go, 'Oh I don't think that's quite right'. Or, 'That could be funnier'. And then we make stuff up as we go. We riff a bit. So yes, it's useful to be on set, because if someone says, 'Oh that doesn't really work', you can think about something else.""This is our first interview with Dame Emma since she personally phoned the manager of Mayfair restaurant Brown's to ask them to reinstate a waiter who was sacked for asking for a selfie with her. Has she heard whether he eventually got his job back?""Oh yes, of course he did!"" she replies. ""Taking a selfie is not a sacking offence. I mean, well done Brown's for bringing it up. But the selfie thing is something we all need to talk about and think about a little bit, face-to-face.""We also have one final question for Clarke before we go, regarding the Game of Thrones coffee cup saga, which has been rumbling on for several months.After the continuity error in the eighth season, Clarke revealed her co-star Conleth Hill had privately confessed he was the one responsible for leaving it in shot.The day before our interview, however, he jokingly told Sunday Brunch that his guilt could not be proved.""THAT LITTLE CHEEKY... NO!"" Clarke explodes while we're only a few words into the question. ""STOP! I'm not having it!""He has, we try to continue through the laughter, playfully threatened legal action against Clarke for dobbing him in.

entertainment	Obituary: Debbie Reynolds, a wholesome Hollywood icon		"At the age of 19 Debbie Reynolds sealed her status as a Hollywood legend with her spirited performance as aspiring actress Kathy Selden in the 1952 musical classic Singin' in the Rain.Her daughter Carrie Fisher was also just 19 when she auditioned for the role that would define her career as the feisty Princess Leia in the Star Wars films.Reynolds died at the age of 84 following a stroke that came on just one day after her daughter's death - the stress was ""too much"", according to her son Todd Fisher.""She wanted to be with Carrie,"" he said simply.Born Mary Frances Reynolds on 1 April 1932, in El Paso, Texas, her father was a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad, and the family moved to California in 1939.She made her entry to the world of American entertainment after being spotted at a beauty pageant in 1948, aged just 16, and she won a contract with film giant Warner Bros and later MGM.It was her wholesome appeal that made her a major star by the mid-1950s, and she appeared in a string of films through the decades. Reynolds even made a stab at a career in pop music with her album entitled ""Debbie"" in 1959.Her performance in The Unsinkable Molly Brown, a true-life rags-to-riches tale of a brash society doyenne who survived the sinking of the Titanic, earned her an Oscar nomination.When accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Screen Actors Guild she told the audience: ""My favourite movie was the Unsinkable Molly Brown and in that movie I got to sing a wonderful song called 'I Aint' Down Yet'""Well I ain't,"" she asserted to huge applause.Her gift for dancing and performance ensured her dozens of roles in the musicals and light comedies Hollywood churned out in this era, but few came close to the fame Singin' in the Rain earned her, considered one of the industry's greatest musicals.Throughout her life she was devoted to the heritage of Hollywood, the industry that made her, by assembling an astonishing collection of memorabilia that included Orson Welles' fur coat from Citizen Kane and a pair of ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz.While she remained largely wholesome on screen her private life was not spared scrutiny.Reynolds was married three times. Her first husband was singer Eddie Fisher in 1955 with whom she had two children; Carrie Fisher and Todd Fisher.Their divorce became one of Hollywood's most notorious scandals when Fisher had an affair with actress Elizabeth Taylor who was at the time a friend of Reynolds'. The story gripped the public with Reynolds sometimes cast in the role of ""America's Sweetheart"". Years later Taylor and Reynolds revealed they had reconciled.But in 2010 Reynolds disclosed: ""I forgave, but I don't forget.""Reynold's second husband was millionaire businessman Harry Karl. By the time that marriage ended in 1973, Karl's gambling and investments meant Reynolds too was facing financial difficulties. She filed for bankruptcy in 1997.Reynolds was also married to real estate developer Richard Hamlett from 1984 to 1996.""All of my husbands have robbed me blind,"" she said in 1999. ""The only one who didn't take money was Eddie Fisher. He just didn't pay for the children.''In her later life, a different image of Debbie Reynolds came through in the writings of Carrie Fisher. Theirs was a tempestuous but close relationship and Fisher's 1987 novel Postcards from the Edge is thought to be a thinly disguised portrait of Fisher's struggle with drugs and her sometimes difficult relationship with her Hollywood royalty mother.In a 2010 interview with the New York Times , alongside her mother, Fisher says: ""If anything, my mother taught me how to sur-thrive. That's my word for it. She would go through these amazingly difficult things, and the message was clear: Doing the impossible is possible. It's just not fun.""Shortly after Carrie Fisher died, Reynolds posted a poignant message on her Facebook page: ""Thank you to everyone who has embraced the gifts and talents of my beloved and amazing daughter. I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers that are now guiding her to her next stop.""She signed off simply: ""Love Carrie's mother""."
entertainment	Oscars 2017: Sartorial protests on the Hollywood stage		"For celebrities and film-makers protesting against recent American political decisions, what bigger stage is there than an awards ceremony watched by millions around the world?Actors and directors used the red carpet at the Oscars in Los Angeles to broadcast their views on President Trump's temporary travel ban on immigrants from seven Muslim majority countries, issued in January.US courts have blocked the ban but the Trump administration is preparing a new executive order.Some stars pinned their politics to their (presumably quite expensive) sleeves and dresses.Blue ribbons with the initials ACLU were seen adorning the outfits of several Oscar nominees.ACLU stands for American Civil Liberties Union - the civil rights organisation that was the first to successfully challenge President Trump's travel ban in a lawsuit brought to a federal court in New York in January.Irish Oscar nominee Ruth Negga wore the ribbon on a flowing red Valentino dress.She was nominated for best actress for playing Mildred Loving in the film Loving which explored the effects of Jim Crow - the legislation that enforced racial segregation in the United States until 1965 - on a mixed-race couple in 1950s Virginia.Full BBC Entertainment coverage of Oscars 2017Mildred Loving's marriage in 1958 to white construction worker Richard violated legal prohibitions of mixed-race marriage in the US state.After being arrested and serving time in prison, Mildred secured the legal representation of an ACLU lawyer and their case eventually led to the Supreme Court ruling in 1967 that the prohibition of interracial marriage was unconstitutional.Award-winning (eventually) Moonlight writer and director Barry Jenkins also wore the ribbon, as did model Karlie Kloss and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda.The ACLU said it was surprised that it had spawned an Oscar fashion trend.The full list of Oscar winnersThe best fashion at the OscarsFollow our Oscars board on PinterestDirector Ava DuVernay took her sartorial protest to the next level by wearing a dress to celebrate the creativity of one Muslim majority country - Lebanon.She wore an embroidered gown made by Beirut-based fashion house Ashi Studio in what she said was ""a small sign of solidarity"".DuVernay directed the critically-acclaimed film Selma, which was the subject of another Oscars controversy in 2015 when the academy was criticised for failing to nominate DuVernay and the black lead actor David Oyelowo.Other stars protested with their feet.One Iranian director condemned the travel ban as ""inhumane"" after he boycotted the ceremony altogether.Asghar Farhadi, who won the award for best foreign film for a second time, sent two Iranian-American representatives to pick up his award for film The Salesmen.They were not just any representatives - one was female Nasa scientist and Mars explorer Anousheh Ansari who read his acceptance speech.His statement read: ""My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US.""A Syrian cinematographer behind the Oscar-winning documentary White Helmets was blocked from attending the ceremony at the last minute.Twenty one-year-old Khaled Khatib, who filmed much of the footage in the documentary that follows the lives of civilian rescue workers called the White Helmets in Syria, had obtained a visa to enter the US but was prevented at Istanbul airport from travelling.He still followed the Oscars though. As the ceremony unfolded, Khatib tweeted a picture of a child he said was the victim of a chlorine gas attack by Syrian government forces in a rebel-held part of the Damascus suburb of Harasta on Sunday.State media reported that ""terrorist groups"" had targeted residential areas of Harasta with a number of rockets, injuring 10 people, but did not mention a chemical attack.Trump's executive order was not the only immigration policy which sparked protests.Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, who last year appeared in American comedy show Stephen Colbert as a Hispanic man who supported the wall, spoke out against the President's plan for a border wall between the US and Mexico.""As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I'm against any form of wall that separates us,"" stated Bernal as he was presenting the award for best animated feature film.By Georgina Rannard, UGC and Social news"
entertainment	Tarantino and Peele: What do these two filmmakers have in common?		"Quentin Tarantino's latest movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is only the second original film of 2019 to break $100m (£82.9m) at the US box office.The recently released film is largely fictional, although it does intertwine real people into the story and uses the Charles Manson murders as a backdrop.Jordan Peel's horror movie Us is the only other original film so far this year to have made more than $100m.All the other $100m films are sequels, spin-offs or franchises.""This is more evidence that Leonardo DiCaprio is the last old-school movie star we've got,"" wrote Scott Mendelson in Forbes about One Upon a Time in Hollywood's success.""This is more evidence that Quentin Tarantino is a ""butts in the seats"" marquee director, especially when he's got big movie stars and/or razzle-dazzle in his corner.""This year's highest-grossing film at the North American box office so far is Avengers: Endgame, having made nearly $858m (£711m) to date.Disney's Lion King remake is in second spot with $473m (£392m). The top five is rounded out by Captain Marvel, Toy Story 4 and Spider-Man: Far From Home.It was a similar pattern at the UK and Ireland box office last year, which was dominated by sequels, spin-offs and franchises, led by Avengers: Infinity War, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again and Incredibles 2.Meanwhile, the new Lion King's global success has led it to become the most successful animated film in history - depending on whether you classify it as an animation.It has earned more than $1.33bn (£1.1bn) around the world, overtaking Frozen's $1.28bn (£1.06bn), according to Box Office Mojo.Disney bills it as ""live action"" because it looks realistic, but director Jon Favreau said that was ""a bit misleading"" because the vast majority of the film was made using computer animation.Favreau told BBC Click: ""Disney even refers to this as a live-action film, which is a bit misleading but tonally correct because we did use those techniques, and hopefully it does feel like something that was actually photographed - even though every shot, with the exception of one, is completely computer generated and every performance is animated.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	The Hollywood stars with the most marriages	Zsa Zsa GaborElizabeth TaylorLarry KingRita HayworthMartin ScorseseOther serial spousesThe younger generation	"""A girl must marry for love,"" actress Zsa Zsa Gabor once quipped, ""and keep on marrying until she finds it.""That was a maxim Gabor, who has died at the age of 99, seemed to live by. With nine nuptials, she was the celebrity world's most prolific knot-tier. But others have come close.Gabor's first marriage in 1937 was to Turkish politician Burhan Asaf Belge - but she later claimed to have had an affair with then president of Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, while married to Belge.She moved to the US and they divorced in 1941. She then met and married hotel magnate Conrad Hilton Senior in 1942 and the union produced Gabor's only child, Francesca. But the pair divorced after two years.Next was actor George Sanders, followed by investment banker Herbert Hutner, Barbie doll designer Jack Ryan and her divorce lawyer Michael O'Mara.Her marriage to Mexican lawyer Felipe de Alba was annulled because Gabor's marriage to O'Mara had not been properly dissolved.In 1986, when she was 69, she married Frederic Prinz von Anhalt, and remained with him until her death.Liz Taylor had seven husbands but eight weddings - she got married to Welsh actor Richard Burton twice.She defended her record: ""I've only slept with men I've been married to. How many women can make that claim?""Her first marriage at 18 was to Conrad Hilton Jr, the son of Conrad Hilton, who had been married to Gabor (see above).Four years later, she married actor Michael Wilding, but after three years she moved on to film producer Mike Todd. When he was killed in an air crash soon afterwards, Taylor was distraught.Singer Eddie Fisher became husband number four in 1959, and Taylor and Burton entered into their first marriage five years later.They became one of Hollywood's most famous couples, renowned for their passionate and turbulent relationship. They divorced after nine years, but reconsidered and remarried two years after that.Their reunion lasted five months and they were divorced for the second time in 1976.Then she met and married a former US naval secretary, John Warner, who became a Republican senator. That lasted until 1982.Finally, she married builder Larry Fortensky in 1991. The couple met in rehab and got married on Michael Jackson's Californian ranch.She once said: ""I am a very committed wife. And I should be committed too - for being married so many times.""Like Elizabeth Taylor, US chat show host Larry King has been married eight times but to seven people.His first marriage was to childhood sweetheart Freda Miller in 1952, but it was over by the following year.Another brief marriage followed, this time to Annette Kay, before he wed a Playboy bunny called Alene Akins in 1961. But the couple divorced just two years later.King then married Mary Francis Stuphin in 1963. However, they divorced three years later and King went back to Akins. But they divorced for a second time in 1972.Maths teacher and production assistant Sharon Lapore was King's fifth wife, followed by businesswoman Julie Alexander. That union was also short-lived.King is still married to his seventh wife, Shawn Southwick, with whom he has two sons.In his autobiography, King wrote: ""When I look back, there are a few regrets. I certainly wouldn't have gotten married eight times. But I don't dwell on regrets.""In 1937, budding actress Rita Cansino married Edward Judson, who was 22 years her senior and managed her early career. He advised her to change her surname to Hayworth and to dye her hair auburn.She became a star - but filed for divorce in 1942.Her second marriage was to director Orson Welles in 1943, but the pair divorced in 1948. In court documents, Hayworth wrote: ""Mr Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.""She then met Prince Aly Khan, who served as Pakistan's UN representative, in 1949. That lasted two years, before Hayworth moved on to singer Dick Haymes.Her final marriage in 1958 was to movie producer James Hill, who cast her in one of her final major films, Separate Tables. That marriage lasted three years.She once said: ""What surprises me in life are not the marriages that fail, but the marriages that succeed.""The director behind films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and The Wolf of Wall Street has been married five times.The first was Laraine Marie Brennan, then in the '70s he tied the knot with writer Julia Cameron. But they divorced after just a year.He was married to actress Isabella Rossellini between 1979 and 1983 before going on to marry producer Barbara De Fina in 1985. That also ended in divorce.But with his fifth wife Helen Morris he has found a lasting union - the pair have been married since 1999.Hollywood actress Lana Turner was married eight times. Singer Jerry Lee Lewis was married seven times, as was comedy actor Richard Pryor, while actor Tony Curtis tied the knot six times.Actor Henry Fonda was married five times - the same number as Ginger Rogers, Clark Gable, Stan Laurel, Joan Collins, Dennis Hopper and Billy Bob Thornton.Some younger stars already have several marriages under their belt.Halle Berry has been married and divorced three times - first to baseball player David Justice, then Eric Benet and finally French actor Olivier Martinez.Demi Moore has been married three times - she first wed when she was just 17, to singer Freddy Moore. She then got engaged to Emilio Estevez before meeting and marrying fellow actor Bruce Willis.The couple were married for 13 years and the pair have three daughters. She later wed actor Ashton Kutcher but they split in 2011.Drew Barrymore also married young first time around. She got hitched to Welsh bar owner Jeremy Thomas aged 19 in 1994, but they split weeks later.In 2001, she married comic Tom Green, but that lasted just six months. She married art consultant Will Kopelman in 2012 and they divorced earlier this year.""Divorce might make one feel like a failure, but eventually you start to find grace in the idea that life goes on,"" the pair said in a statement.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Catwoman: Zoe Kravitz follows Hathaway and Berry in The Batman role	1. Julie Newmar2. Lee Meriwether3. Eartha Kitt4. Michelle Pfeiffer5. Halle Berry6. Anne Hathaway7. Camren Bicondova	"Comic book fans will be purring with delight at the mews that Zoe Kravitz will play Catwoman opposite Robert Pattinson in the next Batman film.Kravitz as good as confirmed her casting when she responded to an Instagram post by Aquaman star Jason Momoa in which he said he was ""freaking stoked"" by her latest role.""Love that Aquaman and Catwoman spend the holidays together from now on,"" wrote the 30-year-old, best known for her appearances in Big Little Lies and the Fantastic Beasts films.Kravitz, daughter of rock star Lenny and actress Lisa Bonet, previously provided Catwoman's voice in 2017's The Lego Batman Movie.The Batman, directed by Matt Reeves and starring Pattinson as a young Bruce Wayne, will be released in the UK in June 2021.Cat burglar Catwoman - aka Selina Kyle - made her debut appearance in the first stand-alone Batman comic when it was published in 1940.She quickly became one of the most popular villainesses in the DC Comics canon, making her return in The Batman a claws for celebration for many.""No actress has ever had a chance to explore her role across multiple entries, something Kravitz will hopefully be able to do,"" writes Richard Newby in the Hollywood Reporter.Join us as we purr-use seven of the other cat-resses who have had prior hiss-tory with this fur-midable character.Newmar became the first actress to be cast as ""The Catwoman"" in the 1960s Batman TV series, despite having never heard of the character before.The ballerina turned actress appeared in 13 episodes in all and would later say how ""satisfying"" it felt to be ""mean, bad and nasty"".Newmar's other achievements include patenting a brand of tights in the 1970s that were marketed under the name ""Nudemar"".The Batman TV series was so successful it quickly spawned a big-screen spin-off that was shot between the show's first and second seasons and released in 1966.Newmar was unavailable to play Catwoman, so former Miss America winner Meriwether was cast in her stead alongside Cesar Romero's Joker, Burgess Meredith's Penguin and Frank Gorshin's Riddler.""I did the role the best way I could and fans accepted it, which was really nice,"" she revealed last year. ""I was so lucky to be working with such a talented group of villains.""Newmar was unavailable again when the third and final series of Batman came to be shot, so Kitt was cast as Bruce Wayne's feline nemesis.""I was in dire need of tremendous help at that time, and like a starving cat I had to find a way to survive,"" she would later tell the Television Academy.""[Being cast in Batman] helped me grow back into being a successful name again. People recognised my name, and still do, because of Catwoman.""The singer and actress, who died in 2008 at the age of 81, appeared in six episodes in all.Catwoman slinked back to the big screen in Batman Returns, the 1992 sequel to Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster.The film saw Michelle Pfeiffer wear a skin-tight catsuit she would later call ""the most uncomfortable costume I've ever been in"".""They had to powder me down, help me inside and then vacuum-pack the suit,"" she told the Hollywood Reporter. ""Originally, they didn't leave me a way to use the restroom.""Pfeiffer, who replaced Annette Bening after she became pregnant, also performed the scene in which Catwoman holds a live bird in her mouth for real.Panned by critics and snubbed by audiences, the 2004 Catwoman film starring Halle Berry was more of a dog's dinner than the cat's pyjamas.Directed by French visual effects specialist Pitof, the film saw its title character reinvented as a mousy graphic designer who falls foul of an evil designer of cosmetics.The film went on to receive four Golden Raspberry awards, one of which Berry sportingly picked up in person.""I want to thank Warner Brothers for putting me in a piece of [expletive] god-awful movie,"" she told an appreciative audience.Catwoman is never referred to by that name in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, which saw Hathaway don the familiar mask and catsuit opposite Christian Bale's Batman.The Les Miserables star worked out five days a week to prepare for a role she would later call her most physically demanding to date.""I love Catwoman's sense of humour,"" she told Fandango. ""I love how sly she is. I love the way she walks a fence, and you don't know which side she's going to come down on.""Hathaway has passed her own goodwill message onto Kravitz, congratulating her for ""landing the role of a lifetime"". ""Enjoy the ride, Selina,"" she wrote on Facebook.TV series Gotham introduced Selina Kyle as a teenage street thief years away from adopting her catty alter-ego.When Camren Bicondova was cast in the role, the actress and dancer said the show saw Selina at a ""different part of her life"" and that she would not be basing her characterisation on previous paw-trayals.The series finale featured flash-forward scenes in which Lili Simmons played an older kit-eration of the Selina character.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Hollywood inequality is 'entrenched', study suggests	'Exclusionary forces' at work'The same groups get the most visible roles'	"Inequality is ""entrenched"" in Hollywood, with women, minorities and LGBT people among those excluded, a new study has suggested.The University of Southern California's report showed that women had just 31.4% of spoken roles in 2015's top 100 films, compared with 32.8% in 2008.Lesbian, gay or transgender characters accounted for less than 1% of speaking parts - or 32 out of 35,205 characters.Researchers described Hollywood as ""an epicentre of cultural inequality"".They said little progress had been made in increasing diversity.Between 2007, when the study was first carried out, and 2015, the authors said there has been no marked change in the proportion of black, Latino or Asian characters - at 12.2%, 5.3% and 3.9% respectively.Study author Stacy Smith, a professor at USC, said: ""We're seeing entrenched inequality.""Whether we're studying gender, race, ethnicity, LGBT or characters with disabilities, we're really seeing exclusionary forces leaving out anybody that's not a straight, white, able-bodied man.""Despite all the chatter and all the activism and all the press attention, it's another year where the status quo has been maintained.''The report also showed:The new figures follow the #OscarsSoWhite controversy earlier this year, sparked by two years of all-white acting nominees at the Academy Awards, as well as concerns over the gender gap in pay and the lack of female directors.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, has expanded its membership in an attempt to improve diversity.Smith said: ""We've seen a lot of talk and little action. What we need now is for companies to take the same leadership position, be transparent in their inclusion goals and be accountable to representing the actual world we live in when it comes to the demography of the US.""The survey found that female lead or co-lead roles increased by 11% from 2014 to 2015 - but only three films cast such a role from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group. There were no Asian male or female leads across all of the films studied.""When we really drill down in the numbers, we see a perpetuation of the same groups getting access to the most visible roles, whether that's in the director's chair or on screen, and that continues to be the problem plaguing Hollywood's hiring practices,"" Smith said.Several of 2015's most profitable films had diverse casts, however, including the seventh Fast and Furious film, Mad Max: Fury Road and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.A number of remakes or reboots with women in lead roles have also been announced, including Ocean's Eight and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

According to the British Heart Foundation, it is a ""temporary condition where your heart muscle becomes suddenly weakened or stunned. The left ventricle, one of the heart's chambers, changes shape.""It can be brought on by a shock. ""About three quarters of people diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy have experienced significant emotional or physical stress prior to becoming unwell,"" the charity says.This stress might be bereavement but it could be a shock of another kind. There are documented cases of people suffering the condition after being frightened by colleagues pulling a prank, or suffering the stress of speaking to a large group of people. It's speculated that the sudden release of hormones - in particular, adrenaline - causes the stunning of the heart muscle.This is different from a heart attack, which is a stopping of the heart because the blood supply is constricted, perhaps by clogged arteries.Read more hereHow does grief cause physical pain?Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

She didn't die alone,"" he said.Born in Hungary, she emigrated to the United States during World War Two and made her Hollywood debut in 1952. She was married nine times.She appeared in more than 70 films, but was more famous for her celebrity lifestyle.She first married at the age of 20 and for the last (and longest) time when she was nearly 70 to the man who outlived her.By her own reckoning she was only married eight-and-a-half times - she said she didn't really count a Spanish duke in 1982.Born Sari Gabor in Budapest in 1917, the future starlet was immediately nicknamed Zsa Zsa by her family.Read more of Zsa Zsa Gabor - in her own wordsHer credits included a long list of roles in such hit films as Moulin Rouge (1952), Lili (1953) and Queen of Outer Space (1958). More recently, she featured in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and in the Naked Gun spoofs.In her heyday, Gabor embodied Hollywood's platinum blonde ideal and was famous for her glamorous gowns and love of diamonds.Her only child was Constance Francesca Hilton, her daughter with hotel magnate Conrad Hilton, who was born in 1947.Gabor was arguably among the first women to be ""famous for being famous"" - a quality often attributed to her great-granddaughter by marriage, Paris Hilton.She was affectionately mocked for her strong Hungarian accent, in which she called everybody ""darling"" - or ""dahlink"" as she pronounced it.""I call everyone 'dahlink' because I can't remember their names,"" the socialite once said.In her 1993 autobiography One Lifetime is Not Enough, she claimed to have lost her virginity to Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, when she was 15.The tell-all account also referred to romances with screen legends Sean Connery and Frank Sinatra, quite apart from her roster of husbands. She claimed to have turned down John F Kennedy and Elvis Presley.Gabor was plagued by ill-health in her later years, and used a wheelchair after a 2002 car accident in Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.She survived strokes in 2005 and 2007, and was left heavily dependent on her husband.In 2011, she suffered an infection that saw her right leg amputated above the knee to save her life.Figures from the entertainment world paid tribute to Gabor as news of her death emerged.US chat show host Larry King said: ""There will only be one Zsa Zsa Gabor. And I liked her a lot. Rest In Peace, my dear.""Actress Barbara Eden, who starred in I Dream of Jeannie, tweeted: ""Rest in peace Zsa Zsa Gabor. She and her sisters were lovely ladies who were always fun and delightful to be around.""Game of Thrones star Gwendoline Christie called the socialite ""fabulous"" and ""unmistakable"".Hollywood reporter Jeanne Wolf, who had interviewed Gabor many times, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""She was full of pep, full of vinegar, full of glamour and full of elegance, very opinionated and very bossy.""But you had to love her.

""They're having that conversation with themselves the whole time. It (her involvement) was much more practical. Just, 'You're a writer, we need some help with these scenes. And you come up with some dialogue for these characters'.""Waller-Bridge is only the second woman to have a writing credit on a Bond film during the franchise's 57-year history. The first was Johanna Harwood on Dr No and From Russia with Love in the early 1960s.Daniel Craig, who's played Bond since 2006, has said it was his idea to enlist Waller-Bridge.She says it was actually the film's American producer Barbara Broccoli who first got in touch.""We met for coffee and then a few months later we met again. And then I met the director Cary Joji Fukunaga and then I met Daniel after that. But I know Daniel and Barbara had been talking about it for while,"" explains Waller-Bridge.She then spent time discussing the script with Craig in New York before joining the cast and crew at Pinewood where she spent ""a lot of time"" on set.She said ""it doesn't get cooler"" than writing lines for James Bond.The film's lead actress is Lashana Lynch, who plays a British agent. She says she was overjoyed when she discovered Waller-Bridge was going to be involved.Lynch told the Hollywood Reporter magazine: ""I very literally squealed when I first heard her name. I thought, 'Oh my gosh, British girl just like me. She's going to know how to actually take care of women onscreen'.""Ana de Armas, who will also be seen in No Time to Die, says Bond fans will notice the shift in dynamics in the new film. ""It's pretty obvious that there is an evolution in the fact that Lashana is one of the main characters in the film and wears the pants - literally,"" she told the magazine.But for fans hoping Waller-Bridge might make a brief appearance, she herself stresses she's not in the film.Can Daniel Craig modernise James Bond?Phoebe Waller-Bridge to make James Bond's women feel 'real'She does however pop up in a behind-the-scenes recording for Children in Need with her Fleabag co-star, Olivia Colman.Colman has provided vocals on a cover of Portishead's Glory Box, with Waller-Bridge backing her up on the ukulele.She says the woman she affectionately calls ""Colly"" sent her a message asking her to help out and she agreed immediately.And she reveals the pair frequently enjoy ""good old"" karaoke sessions.""I've been karaoke-ing with Colly for a long time. So I know the pipes that woman has. And so I was excited that the world was going to get to hear them.""Her friendship with Colman has spanned the two series of the hit BBC comedy Fleabag, and the scripts from the show are now being published in the book Fleabag: The Scriptures, which features unseen stage directions.Waller-Bridge thinks they will give readers ""a more personal connection with the characters"" as well as ""really displaying what the actors brought to it"".""Once you see what's on the page,"" she adds, Colman's performance as Fleabag's evil godmother ""is even more impressive when you see what she was given in the first place"".The book also features new writing from Waller-Bridge in which she discloses more about her creative process.""I rewrite quite a lot on the day,"" she divulges, which means ""I'm so last minute"".Waller-Bridge says she was prompted to write Fleabag ""almost entirely"" because she was being cast in very ""basic"" roles after drama school.And the pressure to look a certain way had her ""teetering on the edge of a depression"".""It really got under my skin,"" she says. ""[There was] this ideal version of a woman everyone had to aspire to from a very young age and the ideal was that she was very sexual and perfect.""I felt so angry about it because I didn't feel I had to justify myself. And I had to prove that first and foremost I had a brain and I was clever. But at the same time I also felt I had to prove that I was pretty and desirable.""In the second series of Fleabag, Waller-Bridge gave her character a love interest in a charismatic priest, played by Andrew Scott.In the final episode, the pair have a brief conversation in an alley before sharing a kiss - it's a scene Waller-Bridge says she hadn't worked out properly.""We'd read it out and I felt like it was not working. I remember saying, 'I'm really sorry Andrew I don't like that and he said it's OK'. He was such a good sport.""But it was the end of the day, time was running out and the director was calling for them to shoot the scene.""Andrew jumped up and was like, 'Yeah let's do it',"" recalls Waller-Bridge. ""It did give it a kind of crazy electricity because we didn't really know what was going to happen.""We did that three or four times on the trot and eventually got the scene we needed.""She also reveals it was Scott who insisted his character say ""I love you too"" to Fleabag at the end - ""and thank God he did,"" she concludes.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	The Great British Bake Off crowns its 2019 winner		"After 10 gruelling weeks of being tested in the Great British Bake Off tent, David Atherton has been crowned 2019's champion.David beat fellow finalists Alice Fevronia and Steph Blackwell in Tuesday's finale, which included chocolate cake and stilton souffle.David, an international health adviser from London, said winning was ""the best feeling in the world"".He triumphed despite not having been named star baker during the series.Steph had been given the accolade in four episodes, and Alice received it twice.""Week on week other people were stronger,"" he said. ""I was always the underdog and yet I just managed to get through.""All of it is a bit surreal and I am still trying to process it, but the whole Bake Off journey is non-stop and part of it is just having the stamina.""Honestly it was never in my mind that I thought I could win this. I have had daydreams of winning Bake Off for about 10 years. The judges always loved my presentation but not my flavours.""The finale was watched by an average live audience of 6.9 million viewers, according to overnight figures.This is down on the 7.5 million people who tuned in to last year's finale live, but overnight figures don't include catch-up services.The final started with David, Steph and Alice being tasked with baking a decadent chocolate cake. Next came a twice-baked stilton souffle in the technical challenge - the round in which the dish is sprung on contestants, whereas they are able to practise for the other two.Finally in the showstopper, as their families gathered outside the tent, the final trio had to create a visual illusion picnic basket using cakes, sweet breads and biscuits.At the end of the episode, judge Paul Hollywood said: ""Well done mate you smashed it… David came in as probably the underdog into the final knowing that twice Alice has won [star baker] and Steph won four times.""He has gone from nothing to win the whole thing - it's priceless, absolutely priceless, he should be really proud of himself. I think he has done an amazing job.""Fellow judge Prue Leith added: ""David is an extraordinary baker and I am so full of admiration for him.""Right from the beginning he has never lost his temper he has always been very neat and organised. It was really a question of the tortoise catching the hare. He just steadily went on and won.""The two other finalists were equally full of praise for the victor.Alice, a geography teacher from Essex, said: ""David just blew us out of the water - the best baker won. I am so happy and really proud of myself and I can really leave with my head held high. It's just the best feeling.""Steph, a shop assistant from Chester, added: ""I have made some amazing lifelong friends. It's just really been the most incredible experience ever.""Series 10 was the third since the show moved from BBC One to Channel 4, and featured a decidedly younger contingent of hopefuls. David beat 12 other contestants, more than half of whom were in their 20s, while the oldest contestant was 56.The average viewing figures for this series have been around 8.9 million per episode, on a par with those in 2018, when Rahul Mandal won.While The Great British Bake Off has not achieved the audience size it enjoyed on BBC One - where it peaked at almost 16 million for the 2016 final - it has been a big success for Channel 4, with some episodes almost reaching the 10 million mark.By comparison, Gogglebox, the broadcaster's next most successful show, averages around four million viewers. And a significant proportion of The Great British Bake Off's audience is made up of the younger viewers particularly prized by advertisers.David has had to keep his win secret since the finale was filmed, keeping the trophy under his bed. ""I am now planning to put a potted palm on it and keep it in the living room,"" he said.He said he was ""looking forward to the exciting opportunities that might come from this"".He also had a final word of advice for anyone thinking about applying for the series.""Don't think you have to be a totally perfect baker to apply for Bake Off. If you think like that you won't ever be ready.""You get a lot of help and you learn so much along the way. It's a great experience and I would encourage any amateur bakers out there to apply.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Katie Jarvis: Ex-EastEnders actress felt 'degraded' by job-shaming story	'Overwhelmed''No shame''Feels like a choice'Believable	"Former EastEnders actress Katie Jarvis says she felt ""degraded"" and ""hurt"" after a newspaper splashed pictures of her working as a shop security guard.On Sunday, the Daily Star revealed the actress, who played Hayley Slater, was now working at a B&M store in Romford.It prompted an outpouring of empathy on social media, as many actors underlined the uncertain nature of the profession.Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show, Jarvis said the tone of the story was ""really quite nasty"".""I woke up really embarrassed and made to feel quite ashamed, to be honest"" said the 28-year-old, who now works alongside her sister.""See over my career I've done by best to try and stay away from social gatherings, get-togethers and celebrity things, to keep my private life as private as possible.""So to wake up with my kids and see myself on the front of the pages just for simply having a job in between my acting, it really did hurt me.""She added: ""It took a day or so for me to actually let it all digest and realise I had nothing to be ashamed about.""Jarvis first made her name starring as Mia Williams in the 2009 British drama film Fish Tank, before heading to Albert Square for a year-long stint which ended in February 2019.The east Londoner explained she's worked in a range of jobs to support her acting career - including as a waitress and for a credit card company.She admitted she's been ""overwhelmed"" by the support she's received from her acting colleagues, like Kathy Burke, who comically re-interpreted the headline of the tabloid story - or non-story, as she saw it.In a show of solidarity, other TV stars revealed they too supplement their acting careers with other types of employment.Tamzin Outhwaite posted: ""Yes, I am a landlady, a voice over artist, car boot salesperson, art dealer, up cyclist, interior designer, motivational speaker, and many other jobs... it's what artists do to earn a living. They work in between jobs.""""It's called grafting!"" she added. ""Or not being afraid of hard work... or loving your family enough to drop your dream for a bit to earn a living so the family can live life. And there is no shame in wanting to work hard to make sure your offspring are cared for.""TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC she understands why actors are getting upset with the newspaper for splashing Jarvis's new non-acting job all over the front page in a ""humiliating"" manner. But, she says, the situation is ""more complicated"" than some soap stars are making out.""I can see both sides of it really as it does feel quite cruel in the way that they did it, kicking her while she's down I suppose,"" says Bullimore.""But with a tabloid hat on, you can totally see that it is the perfect story - she was in one of the biggest shows on TV, had a massive part in it and she was basically in every scene for a little while.""Then she disappeared, slightly oddly, and now suddenly she's working at B&M. I think if she was working at Waitrose it would not be as good a story.""Charlie Condou, who played Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, called the Jarvis story ""shameful journalism,"" adding he'd done something similar himself.""When I left Corrie I had a string of very nice TV and theatre jobs,"" he tweeted. ""Then I didn't.""So I got a job working in a restaurant to pay my bills and take care of my kids. That's what responsible adults do.""In one of her most memorable EastEnders scenes from last Christmas, Jarvis's character Hayley pushed Alfie Moon, played by Shane Ritchie, down the stairs in defence of her relative Kat Moon.Since leaving EastEnders, Jarvis has kept a relatively low profile. However, in March, she tweeted to say she was ""absolutely fine"" following reports she had been ""glassed"" on a night out.She's no longer on social media.Bullimore believes ""it feels like a choice"", in this instance, for her to make the move away from the camera so soon, making the newspaper article all the more intriguing for readers.""I can see why people would want to read it because they'll think 'surely you're really well paid if you're on EastEnders and you're living the life of an actress.' And she was in it so recently, so why would you need the money so quickly?""That's not to say that I think it [the story] is fair, but I don't think it's necessarily any worse than the way that tabloids treat actors in general.""Jarvis is not the first and won't be the last actor to do a ""normal job"" before, during or after an acting career.In fact, award-winning director Ken Loach told the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz he actively shied away from casting big name Hollywood stars in his latest drama, Sorry We Missed You, in favour of actors who have had recent experience working in relevant industries.The film features actor/plumber and van driver Kris Hitchen and actress/teaching assistant and care worker Debbie Honeywood at the head of a Newcastle family, struggling to make ends meet on zero-hour contract jobs.""Finding people to bring a story to life is the second-most important decision you ever make in filmmaking, second to the script - which is the most important,"" explained Loach.""The camera can see who you are, maybe in ways you're not aware of - how you stand, how you use your hands, the quality of your skin depends on your diet. Every mannerism that you're not aware of. And you've also got to believe that people can do the job they say that they can do in the film and reach the character and absolutely have the capacity to draw the audience in.""So the audience laughs with them and cries with them and is angry with them and identifies with them and has solidarity with them. And we were really lucky to find Chris and Debbie.""He added: ""They're both terrific, but they can act, make no mistake.""Elsewhere in the industry, former Hollyoaks and Holby City actor Jeremy Edwards found work, like Jarvis, as a security guard, and as a gardener. As Celebs Now reported, in 2011, he noted: ""I don't know any actors who work consistently without other work. A lucky few, but not many, I had a good 10-year run!""Gemma Merna, who played Carmen McQueen in Hollyoaks for eight years - winning best comedy performance at the 2007 British Soap Awards - now also works as a yoga instructor and personal trainer.Meanwhile, Geoffrey Owens, who played Elvin in the Cosby Show between 1985 and 1992, thanked supporters last year after photos of him working as a cashier at US grocery Trader Joe's were mocked online.Rap star and Cosby Show fan Nicki Minaj donated $25,000 (£22,433) to the ""legend"" after he was similarly job-shamed, however, Owens donated the amount to a fund helping actors in need.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Oscars: Hollywood parties and protests as the big night approaches		"Oscar season reaches its climax on Sunday, and Hollywood's celebrities are in a final whirl of parties, dinners, award shows - and political protests.Instead of a red carpet, stars walked a green carpet (well, a strip of artificial grass) at the Oscar Wildes, dubbed the ""Irish Oscars"", on Thursday.On Wednesday there was a black carpet for the All Def Movie Awards - a cheeky response to the #OscarsSoWhite furore.More exclusive parties - and an anti-Trump rally - are to come on Friday.They are all part of a flurry of events that take place in Oscar week, allowing the film industry to congratulate itself even more and casting some of the limelight on underrepresented groups, worthy causes and brands.Irish Oscar nominee Ruth Negga and Outlander actress Caitriona Balfe were honoured at the 12th Oscar Wildes, staged by the US-Ireland Alliance at director JJ Abrams' Santa Monica HQ.Balfe was greeted at the event by fans carrying a banner reading: ""Outlander: We love you Caitriona"".She said: ""Irish people will always make a little community wherever they go and LA is no different. It's really important that you have this community that you can rely on.""Also on Thursday, the Black Women in Hollywood Awards hosted stars including Oscar nominee Viola Davis and fellow actresses Janelle Monae and Aja Naomi King.That came a day after the All Def Movie Awards, which were set up by entertainment mogul Russell Simmons last year to reward the films that Oscar forgot.He said his ceremony was worth staging again, despite the fact that many more films with black stars and black stories are nominated this year compared with the previous two years.""There's still a lack of sensitivity on the part of the gatekeepers,"" he told BBC News.""I love the industry. I want to see us more inclusive. I broke my neck for the last 30 years to be included, despite the fact that Hollywood's not been breaking its neck to be inclusive.""Other Oscar-related events on Thursday ranged from parties thrown by Dolby, Cadillac and Ebony magazine to a benefit concert staged by Artists for Peace and Justice.Friday is the peak day for pre-Oscar parties.There will be events to celebrate British, Australian and Italian film-makers; a cocktail reception for this year's 46 female Oscar nominees; an award show thrown by publicists; and a ceremony to celebrate Latinos in the media.But the United Talent Agency has decided not to take part in the partying this year. It has cancelled its annual pre-Oscar bash - deciding instead to hold a rally to protest at US President Donald Trump's plan for a travel ban on people coming from seven mainly Muslim countries.Jodie Foster, Michael J Fox, Cynthia Erivo and Wilmer Valderrama are among the actors who are due to give speeches.That means it is likely to garner more attention than all of the more frivolous gatherings - and will give a taste of what to expect on what is likely to be a politically-charged Oscar night.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Mary Berry 'stands by' Paul Hollywood after Bake Off move	'I was never asked'	"Mary Berry has said she is ""standing by"" former fellow judge Paul Hollywood as he continues with The Great British Bake Off in its new Channel 4 home.She told the Radio Times magazine they have their differences but she ""admired him a lot"".""I would always stand by him. Paul and I had our differences about what was important to us, but he is a brilliant bread-maker and I admired him a lot.""She said ""no one was more surprised"" than her when Bake Off left the BBC.It was announced in September last year that the show had been bought by Channel 4 after six years on the BBC.It emerged that the corporation fell £10m short in its offer to Love Productions, which makes the show.The 81-year-old said she was always going to stay loyal to the BBC and wasn't tempted by a potentially bigger salary at Channel 4.""No, I wasn't. And anyway, I was never asked to go,"" she said. ""I avoided being asked. It was suggested what would happen if I did go to Channel 4, what I would get, the advantages.""But I didn't ever have a meeting with them. I'd made up my mind. To me, it's an honour to be on the BBC. I was brought up on it.""The show's hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins also didn't enter into negotiations with Channel 4 and Mary said she was very fond of the ""extraordinary"" comedy duo.""It was the BBC's programme, it grew there. So I decided to stay with the BBC, with Mel and Sue.""She is moving on with two new BBC programmes in the works.But before then she has admitted one issue she had with Bake Off - contestants crying over baking mishaps in the early episodes of the series.""In life you shouldn't keep bursting into tears.

entertainment	Kevin Bishop chases laughs from Hollywood to Young Vic	'Skills honed on screen''Snappy comebacks'	"When it was first staged, Once in a Lifetime provided exactly the wisecracking humour Broadway audiences expected in the 1930s. Actor Kevin Bishop thinks that's more often TV's role today - but he sees a direct line from the heyday of Kaufman and Hart to shows like Friends and Seinfeld.Kevin Bishop has had his own sketch show on Channel 4 and appeared on the same channel's Star Stories in 2006, impersonating everyone from Elton John to Justin Timberlake.He recently played Nigel Farage for the BBC and next year he'll tape a new series of Porridge, playing the grandson of Ronnie Barker's original Fletch, after a pilot episode received good reviews.He also writes and is an expert at sizing up a comedy script.""When I read Once in a Lifetime, there were parts where I thought - this will need cutting a bit,"" explains Bishop. ""Because in the kind of comedy I do, you pare back everything - there can't be unnecessary exposition or any repetition.""He says Harry Enfield, his co-star who plays Hollywood studio boss Herman Glogauer in the Young Vic production, had exactly the same reaction.""This is Harry's stage debut so, like me, his skills have been honed on screen,"" says Bishop.""But when we got the play on its feet in front of an audience, we saw why [George S] Kaufman and [Moss] Hart wrote the way they did. It's very fast - but it's not a quick two-minute TV sketch. There are times where the writers need to let the audience know what's going on. So Richard Jones [the play's director] was adamant about stuff staying in.""In 1930, Once in a Lifetime was the first of seven full-length scripts co-written by Kaufman and Hart. Twenty years later, Kaufman would be the director of the musical Guys and Dolls - and in 1956 Hart directed My Fair Lady.The plot concerns a trio of small-time vaudeville performers who, in the early years of talking pictures, move to Hollywood hoping to make it as experts in elocution.The comic potential of glamorous silent stars who have absolutely zero vocal skills was shamelessly recycled much later in the movie Singin' in the Rain.The play was largely unknown in Britain until a hit RSC production in 1979, starring Zoe Wanamaker and Richard Griffiths.That version turned parts of the play into a semi-musical, but this time Bishop has been happy to concentrate on the dialogue.""You really have to take this play at a click - it's very New York. There's an element almost of farce and the only limitation is how fast physically the cast can deliver the lines.""I really love the era this play is set in. The recent equivalent to this style isn't on stage - it's TV comedies like Friends and Seinfeld.""You still get the same pattern in the dialogue: little laugh, middle laugh, really big laugh. And maybe the big laugh will have a physical pay-off.""Friends was taken slower than our play is: Once in a Lifetime asks its audience to grasp things quickly, in a way TV sitcoms won't generally risk. But the way the dialogue functions, with the snappy comebacks and putdowns and all the insults - that's basically the same.""From 2013, Bishop spent 18 months in the States, working mainly on the TV series Super Fun Night for ABC, starring Rebel Wilson. His wife and young children went too.""From personal experience I would say that for an actor the way Los Angeles works today really isn't so different from the 1930s,"" he says.Bishop shot 17 half-hour episodes of Super Fun Night before it was cancelled.""Actually it was a great experience: I'd shipped my entire home to Los Angeles. There was an attempt to do the series as a multi-camera show with a live audience but finally it became single-cam with no audience. But the mechanics there are that there's no straight news about anything. So every single person on set was saying the show was a hit.""In fact originally I had my doubts about whether it really was a hit, but eventually I bought into what everyone else was saying. So when suddenly the end came, I was shocked. And you see some of the same thing in Once in a Lifetime - people in Hollywood being flattered and pampered and then it disappears overnight.""Maybe showbusiness hasn't changed that much. There's a fine line between positivity and denial.""""In the play, Kaufman and Hart were smart because they created the character May, who's played by Claudie Blakley. She has her head screwed on and sees that a lot of Hollywood talk is just nonsense - so on stage she represents what the audience is thinking.""When I was living in LA you could say it was my wife who had that function. I'd started falling for the sweet-talk but she remained clear-eyed about the whole thing.""After his stint at the Young Vic, Bishop returns to a role he thought he'd done purely as a one-off - the follow-up to the 1970s comedy classic Porridge. There was a single episode in August on BBC One, which got good reviews. Now Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais are writing a series.""When I was approached about the one-off I was delighted - but I was told there was absolutely no chance of a series. In a way that was reassuring, given how brilliant Ronnie Barker had been in the original. Dick and Ian are superb writers and they've already run a few storylines past me. They're still on top form.""Once in a Lifetime is a great comedy but it's totally unlike Porridge. But there's an overlap for me because shooting in front of an audience with Porridge is more like live theatre and the audience does affect where you go with a line.""No one believes it, but with Porridge there's no canned laughter at all - what you hear is the real audience reaction. It's like being at the Young Vic.""Once in a Lifetime is at the Young Vic theatre in London until 14 January.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	La La Land: Gosling and Stone serenade Hollywood		"It's been a long time since either Ryan Gosling or Emma Stone had to audition for a part but their early failures to impress form the basis for La La Land, Damien Chazelle's musical love story set in Hollywood.Stone and Gosling are reunited for their third film together to play two lovers, Mia and Sebastian, who have moved to Los Angeles to try to succeed in showbiz.""Damien asked us to tell him about our audition disasters when we were first trying to make it,"" recalls Gosling. ""I remember going to one and half way through the agent took a call and was talking about her lunch plans all the way through. I was completely traumatised - and I'm still waiting to hear about the role.""That ended up in the film but Emma gets to go through it this time, not me.""Stone, who moved to Hollywood with her mother when she was 15 years old in order to try to act professionally, remembers ""struggling to even get an audition that year and when I did, often being turned down after singing or saying one line"".""It was nothing quite as devastating as what Mia goes through but everyone thinks about packing it in after a terrible audition,"" she continues.""Several times I thought about quitting. Even after I started getting parts in films, I would think, 'You know, maybe I won't do another one.'""Stone has had no bad experiences with La La Land. She was awarded the best actress prize from the Venice Film Festival, while the film, amongst glowing reviews, has been described as ""a sun-drenched masterpiece"". After also winning over North American critics at the Toronto Film Festival, it's now tipped as a best picture contender for the Oscars.Chazelle, who was also nominated for an Oscar last year for another music-centred film, Whiplash, says he ""always wanted to make a musical, even if they're not seen as fashionable any more"".""In many ways Whiplash was the film I made because I didn't yet have the budget or trust to make La La Land,"" says Chazelle.""We all need hope and romance on the screen and I think there's something about musicals - movies are a dreamland, and a world where you break into song when your emotions are strong, that violates the rules of reality. Isn't that what movies should be about?""Stone had just starred on Broadway when she was picked for the role but Chazelle says the couple's overall lack of experience in musical theatre harks back to the Golden Age of Hollywood where stars like Audrey Hepburn weren't initially seen as naturals for musical roles.""I wanted to make characters you could be sitting in a bar with, not people who come to the screen waiting for their moment to shine,"" says Chazelle.""My whole idea was to take the old-fashioned magic of the musical, make it about today where real life can't live up to the dream, and ground every moment of it with actors who were invested in giving it realism. That's actually why it works as a fantasy.""Both actors had to learn ballroom dancing and Gosling went one step further to learn the piano to play the aspiring jazz musician Sebastian.""I didn't learn to read music,"" he says. ""I learned all the songs by heart from a tutor. So we didn't need a piano double in the end. Every frame you see of hands on the piano, it's me.""I still play but I can still only play the songs from the movie.""Gosling and Stone last worked together in 2011 for the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid Love, with a chemistry Gosling says, ""We don't have to work at. We don't have to create a relationship.""Hopefully the fact that we're not necessarily natural choices for a musical means we can make it accessible to those who don't necessarily go and see the genre.""I knew the music was beautiful in La La Land and I thought, 'If we get it right, this will be great.'""Stone calls the film ""the antidote to cynicism, which is so prevalent today"".""It comes down to the hopefulness and the joy of the story. It's not that there aren't cynical or bittersweet moments, but the film itself isn't. It's full of dreams and hope.""La La Land is showing as part of the London Film Festival, running from 5-16 October 2016.The film will be released in UK cinemas in January 2017.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

entertainment	Dark Money: The TV drama that became topical by accident	What are non-disclosure agreements?	"Two years ago, screenwriter Levi David Addai had an idea for a new fictional TV drama. But within months, the storyline suddenly felt much more realistic.BBC One's Dark Money tells the story of sexual abuse in Hollywood, and the efforts to cover it up.When 13-year-old Isaac Mensah is plucked from his regular life at school in London to star in a major new movie, his family is delighted. But while he is in the US shooting the film, a powerful studio executive takes advantage of him.The producer then attempts to buy the young boy's silence, offering his family £3m if they sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) promising to keep quiet. The rest of the series explores the impact of the decision they make.Of course, in the time it's taken to bring the series to the screen, several real-life allegations have been made against high-profile figures, and the widespread use of NDAs has been the subject of debate.In October 2017, producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual abuse by several women - allegations which he denies. The case sparked the #MeToo movement and it came to light that many women who had worked with him had signed NDAs.Then, earlier this year, a documentary about the late Michael Jackson called Leaving Neverland alleged sexual harassment of two underage boys by the singer.But, explains Addai, Dark Money was in progress before either the recent Weinstein or Jackson allegations hit the headlines.""I began developing the idea and writing the script before those stories actually became mainstream,"" he says. ""So I was in this weird position where I was doing this thing that was totally original, as it were, and as it was getting closer to getting green lit, the news just exploded.""And people were like, 'Wow, have you heard?' But for me personally, I was like, 'I know these things are going on, this is not big news for me'. But I was fortunate enough that the BBC allowed me to continue telling my story.""Sometimes known as ""gagging orders"" or ""hush agreements"", NDAs typically prevent staff and ex-staff making information public.Many companies get employees to sign them as a matter of course, as they can apply to commercially sensitive details such as inventions and ideas, or anything likely to damage an organisation's reputation.NDAs have also been used to prevent employees discussing in the media allegations of misbehaviour in the workplace after a settlement has been agreed.They're signed when employees and organisations resolve a dispute - such as a claim of wrongful dismissal - without going through a full tribunal hearing.While the news headlines around abuse and non-disclosure agreements could easily have been a source of research for Addai, he says he decided instead to stick to consulting child psychologists during development. What he found was that, if anything, his proposed storyline hardly scratched the surface of the world of abuse and NDAs.""The production company were good at arranging meetings with Tavistock Children's Services, speaking to child psychologists, who explained that this is nowhere near what's been happening in our country right now,"" he says. ""To hear these guys lay out raw their kind of passion to really do something about it, they're the real heroes really.""And make it unique as well. Isaac's story is Isaac's story. There might be similarities [to news events], but I hope once people get to see the entirety of the series they can see there is hope there, that it's not the end of your story, there is a way you can progress.""In the series, Jill Halfpenny plays Isaac's mother Sam, who grapples with her own conscience over what they should do after the abuse takes place. Isaac's own wish that nobody else finds out effectively encourages the parents towards signing the NDA.""There's a decision that Isaac makes which is he doesn't want anyone to know [about the abuse],"" Halfpenny explains. ""Of course, as parents you want to feel like you'd do everything possible to protect your child, but in some ways it suits Sam and Manny that he doesn't want anyone to know, because they can then just put it in a box, and see if they can survive doing it that way.""Dark Money arrives hot on the heels of Bitter Wheat - a new David Mamet play which opened in London last month. Its plot was inspired by the Harvey Weinstein scandal, making it the first West End play to tackle the subject.""I don't think it's going to be a topic that just sort of fades away, nor particularly should it be,"" the show's star John Malkovich told BBC News at the time.For Addai, who has previously written Damilola: Our Loved Boy, the Bafta-winning dramatisation of the murder of Damilola Taylor, the biggest inspiration for Dark Money came from his own experience as a father.""I enrolled my daughter in a drama school, for an hour and a half on a Saturday, which was great for me because I could catch up with work. It was interesting listening to the promises that'd be made by the drama school leaders.""One of the big selling points would be a showcase in the West End or there being opportunities for auditions for soaps like EastEnders, and it was interesting watching the parents absorb that. And me being in this industry, I know that it's not that straightforward. And I was just really interested to see how easily trusting the parents were to these people that they didn't know, they just saw them as part of this arena of performing arts.""Dark Money begins on BBC One on Monday 8 July at 21:00 BST."
entertainment	Moonlight: The small-budget film that is sweeping Hollywood awards		"It's been hailed by critics as diverse film-making at its best, but the director of Moonlight says the film is not a response to the #OscarsSoWhite criticism of last year's award season.Miami-born filmmaker Barry Jenkins wrote and directed the film, based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney, about a young African American boy named Chiron coming to terms with his sexuality as he grows up in a tough Florida neighbourhood.However, while the shoot took only 25 days, Jenkins says he conceived the project ""at least three-and-a-half years ago"".He explains: ""That's fairly average because it takes a long time for a film to get made.""So all these movies we have this year - Birth of a Nation, A United Kingdom, Loving, Fences - which are being framed as a reply to the campaign about the lack of diversity in the system, probably began about four years ago.""So the cry about the lack of voices and representation on our screens actually goes much further back and now films like ours are beginning to surface.""With a budget of around $5m (£4m), Moonlight has now made twice that figure at the North American box office, and has screened to almost universal acclaim at festivals including Telluride, Toronto and London.Mahershala Ali, best known for playing Captain Boggs in The Hunger Games, and British actress Naomie Harris both secured acting nominations from the Golden Globes.The film is also nominated for best drama, best director, best screenplay and best original score.Harris says she ""put heart and soul into this little film - we all did"".She plays Chiron's drug addict mother and had to complete her scenes in three days.""It had a really small budget, and everyone did it because they were passionate about it. It's a very rare film - it speaks of a very profound love,"" she says.""And the response we've had has been overwhelming - I think people are hungry for these kinds of stories.""Film critics now believe the race for awards glory is between Moonlight, Damien Chazelle's musical La La Land and Manchester By The Sea by Kenneth Lonergan.""You always hope to be part of endeavours that resonate with audiences,"" Mahershala Ali says. ""But you don't want it to reflect how you approach the work.""It's just humbling being part of the conversation, especially after a much-needed shake up in the industry about people of colour,"" he continues.""But I want the film to be rewarded on it own merits, not because it's a film of diversity. As an African American, you just want to see projects go ahead that have 'other' faces in them with the potential to stand up against any film.""You know, we had this same conversation a few years ago when the film Precious came out, about change. I hope it's a wake up call, because I know a lot of wonderful directors and writers who didn't get their films made because they didn't fit the type.""Barry Jenkins's last film, 2008's Medicine for Melancholy, about African Americans struggling to fit in to the hipster scene of San Francisco, also featured themes of being an outsider in a community.While many have highlighted a lack of Hollywood films giving gay characters a platform over the years, Jenkins points out that Brad Pitt's Plan B company part-produced Moonlight, and says there was ""never a sense that what we were doing was unorthodox or provocative"".The film had ""multiple offers of financing"", he explains.""However, I have never seen characters like this in a movie before, and between Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain and now, there have been too few representations of gay characters in cinema.""I would certainly welcome more of it, because there's always going to be some kid who needs to see himself or herself on screen, and the more people who see the film, the more likely that kid is to go out and write something themselves one day, and then the vacuum is further filled.""There's also the need for someone to see it to know they are not the only one in the world going through these ordeals of adolescence, that's been a positive of talking so much about the film. When I actually saw the play those years ago, there was so much up there that reminded me of myself.""Naomie Harris adds: ""I want this film to get as much attention as possible, because it absolutely deserves it, in my opinion. It's got a unique perspective.""Perhaps it's because my mum is a scriptwriter herself, I think the key to success is always in the writing and what we need is to help young diverse talent.""The cry for more diversity on screen was a long time in coming, we've needed it, and I hope this year we are finally beginning to see it.""Moonlight will be released in the UK on 17 February.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Charlie Sheen: Hollywood's troubled star	Battery chargesHospital admissionSitcom return	"On 17 November 2015, after days of intense media speculation Hollywood star Charlie Sheen - no stranger to intense scrutiny of his wild private life - confirmed he was living with HIV, in an interview with NBC's Today show.Sheen, the former star of the US sitcom Two and a Half Men, told host Matt Lauer he was compelled to make such a public statement to end ""this onslaught, this barrage of attacks and of sub-truths"".He added that he had paid out ""millions"" in the four years following his diagnosis with the virus, to try to stop those who knew from making it public knowledge.He said many people he considered friends had turned on him, leading to ""blackmail and extortion and a circle of deceit"".""I think I release myself from this prison today,"" he said, stressing was ""impossible"" that he would have passed HIV on to anyone else.The very public announcement comes after a period of relative obscurity for Sheen, who was once the highest-paid actor on American television, as star of Two and a Half Men.He was paid $1.25m (£830,000) per episode for the ratings hit but it all came to an end when he was fired from the show after a downward spiral in his personal life that played out in public.Two and a Half Men, about an irresponsible writer of advertising jingles who finds his nephew on his doorstep, was a runaway success when it made its debut on US network CBS in 2003.Yet the star's role as a hedonistic, womanising alcoholic was indicative of his life behind the camera as well.In his Today interview with Lauer, Sheen said his use of drink and drugs over the years had been a ""bad decision"" but added that he was no longer taking recreational drugs, although he sometimes ""drinks a bit"".Sheen - the son of Hollywood veteran Martin Sheen and the brother to actor Emilio Estevez - got his big break in 1986 in Oliver Stone's Vietnam movie Platoon.He went on to appear in Stone's Wall Street, the western Young Guns and action thriller The Rookie, opposite Clint Eastwood.By the mid-1990s, however, the actor's partying lifestyle had become tabloid news and led to a stint in rehab.In 1995, he was arrested and put in hospital for cocaine use. The same year he admitted under oath to spending nearly $50,000 (£31,000) at a brothel run by ""Hollywood madam"" Heidi Fleiss.In 1997, Sheen pleaded no contest to misdemeanour battery charges against former girlfriend Brittany Ashland. He was given a year's suspended sentence and two years' probation.Less than a year later, he was taken to hospital again following a near-fatal overdose and was ordered back to rehab.By 2000, Sheen had mended his ways enough to be cast as Michael J Fox's replacement on the sitcom Spin City and a couple of years of relative calm led to his 2002 marriage to actress Denise Richards, with whom he had two daughters.But the couple divorced three years later after Richards complained of Sheen's drug abuse and alleged death threats.Sheen married the actress Brooke Mueller in May 2008. She would later give birth to twin sons.In December 2009, he was arrested and charged with assaulting and threatening to kill her.Two months later he entered rehab again, forcing him to take a three-month break from Two and a Half Men.Not long afterwards, he hinted he was prepared to leave the show if his request for more money from programme makers Warner Bros was not met.In October 2010, the actor was accused of causing damage to a New York hotel room. After security reported him, the actor voluntarily went with authorities for a psychiatric evaluation.The incident was played down by his publicist, who said he had gone to hospital because he had had ""an adverse allergic reaction to some medication"".The star went on to file for divorce from Mueller, citing irreconcilable differences.In January 2011, he was taken to hospital after suffering severe abdominal pains - the result, it was reported, of a two-day ""marathon party"".A day later, Warner Bros executives ordered Sheen to seek treatment and temporarily shut down production on the show so he could enter rehab.Within two weeks, the actor said he was ready to begin shooting again after self-healing his addictions.But production was cancelled after Sheen phoned in to a US radio show to criticise the show's creator, Chuck Lorre.In a rambling rant, he made a series of bizarre statements, including calling himself a ""high priest"" and a ""Vatican assassin-warlock"".He continued his attack on Lorre in numerous talk show appearances over the space of a week.""I am on a drug, it's called Charlie Sheen,"" he told ABC's 20/20 programme. ""It's not available because if you try it, you will die.""Your face will melt off and your children will weep over your exploded body.""It was only a matter of time before Warner Bros took action.In an 11-page letter to Sheen's lawyers, the studio's lawyers said ""the totality of Mr Sheen's condition, statements and escalating destructive behaviour"" made production ""untenable"".It was ""clear"", they continued, that the actor ""does not believe he has a problem and that he will continue to conduct himself in a destructive manner"".After a period in which the show was not in production, CBS announced later that year that Ashton Kutcher would take over as star of the show, playing an internet billionaire called Walden Schmidt.Sheen's future remained uncertain after the actor seemed to be going through a form of breakdown, played out in public on the TV and the internet.He gave interviews and posted videos of himself on YouTube and Twitter, claiming to be a ""warlock"" with ""tiger blood"" and ""Adonis DNA"", and coining the oft-repeated phrase ""winning""But in 2012, Sheen seemed to be back on track, landing a role in another sitcom, Anger Management, in which he continued until 2014.He also made a brief return to Two and a Half Men for two episodes.Asked on the Today show about his future, Sheen said that despite his initial reaction to his diagnosis leading to ""a descent into substance abuse and fathomless drinking"", he said he now felt ""the responsibility to better myself and help a lot of other people""."
entertainment	Hollywood has 'inclusion crisis' suggests study	Hollywood diversity report'Pockets of promise'	"Hollywood has an ""epidemic of invisibility"" for women, minorities and LGBT people that runs across the whole industry, a new study has suggested.The report by the University of Southern California stated that Hollywood has an ""inclusion crisis"" from CEOs to minor characters.""Overall, the landscape of media content is still largely whitewashed,"" the study concluded.It comes days ahead of the Oscars, which has been dubbed OscarsSoWhite.The lack of diversity in the Oscar nominations led Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith to boycott the ceremony and Oscars head Cheryl Boone Isaacs to pledge to double the number of female and minority members of the Academy.""The prequel to OscarsSoWhite is HollywoodSoWhite,"" said associate professor Stacy Smith, one of the study's authors.""We don't have a diversity problem. We have an inclusion crisis.""The report by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative looked at those in front of the camera and behind the scenes in film and TV.414films and TV series were studied. They included11,300speaking characters, of which33% were female28% were minority ethnic2% were LGBT-identified74% of characters over 40 were maleThe study examined:Out of the 414 films and TV series they studied they found only a third of speaking characters were female.About 50% did not feature one Asian or Asian-American character and 20% did not include one black character.Of the characters that were aged 40 years or older 74.3% were male and 25.7% female.Among the 11,306 speaking characters studied, only seven were transgendered (and four were from the same series).Behind the scenes, 15.2% of directors, 28.9% of writers and 22.6% of series creators were female.In film, the gender gap was the greatest, with only 3.4% of the films studied directed by women.This reflects a report released in January by the Centre for the Study of Women in Television and Film that just 9% of Hollywood's highest grossing films last year were directed by women, the same level as 1998.In May, the American Civil Liberties Union in Southern California sent letters asking federal and state civil rights agencies to investigate the systemic failure to hire women directors at all levels of the film and television industry.And in October, it was reported that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the US had begun contacting female directors to investigate gender discrimination in Hollywood.This latest study found only two directors out of the 109 were black women, namely Ava DuVernay, who made Selma, and Amma Asante, who made Belle.The study also included for the first time an ""inclusivity index""' of 10 major media companies which rated their percentage of female, minority and LGBT characters and of female writers and directors.None of the six major studios scored better than 20% overall but there were better ratings with companies that included TV and digital offerings, some of those such as Disney and Hulu reached 65% and above.""When we turn to see where the problem is better or worse, the apex to this whole endeavour is: Everyone in film is failing, all of the companies investigated,"" said Smith.""They're impervious to change. But there are pockets of promise in television. There is a focus that change is possible. The very companies that are inclusive - Disney, CW, Hulu, Amazon to some degree — those companies, if they're producing and distributing motion pictures, can do this.""We now have evidence that they can, and they can thrive."""
entertainment	Marni Nixon: Hollywood's 'invisible voice' dies aged 86	Varied career	"Marni Nixon, known as Hollywood's ""invisible voice"", has died aged 86.The singer appeared, uncredited, on many of the biggest movie musicals of all time - dubbing the voices for Deborah Kerr in The King and I, and Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady.She also sang the high notes for Marilyn Monroe in Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend; and ""ghosted"" Natalie Wood's vocals on West Side Story.Nixon died of breast cancer on Sunday, her agent confirmed to the BBC.For most of her career, the classically-trained musician remained unknown. Twentieth Century Fox made her sign a contract saying she would never reveal the ghost-singing on The King and I. The story only came out later, when Kerr herself credited Nixon's work in a press interview.The clandestine nature of her work led Time magazine to dub Nixon ""the ghostess with the mostest"".The singer likened her work to that of a stuntman, and collaborated closely with the stars to perfect the screen illusion.Kerr ""wanted to look like she was really singing"", Nixon told the Washington Post, ""and wanted to be using the same muscles and the same stretches you do in expressions"".Hepburn even gave Nixon a lift to the set of My Fair Lady every morning; and they worked together to ensure their performances matched.""I sat in on her singing lessons, so I could hear not only the Cockney and the upper-class British, which are two different voices. But I also had to get her very unique speech patterns, so I had to listen very carefully so I could catch it.""""It's fascinating, getting inside the actresses you're singing for,"" she told The New York Journal-American in 1964. ""It's like cutting off the top of their heads and seeing what's underneath. You have to know how they feel, as well as how they talk, in order to sing as they would sing - if they could sing.""Not every actress appreciated her help, however.Wood, playing Maria in West Side Story, thought Nixon would be helping out on the high notes. But director Robert Wise had other ideas.""She didn't know how much of her work would be done by somebody else,"" Nixon later recalled. ""She didn't know that it would all be thrown out and that it would be all my voice. I don't think that Natalie Wood's ego could take that.""Nonetheless, it was Wood's name that appeared on the soundtrack - which went on to sell more than three million copies in the US. As a result, Nixon was not given a share of the royalties, until composer Leonard Bernstein gave up a quarter of one per cent of his own royalty and passed it on to the singer.Born in southern California, Margaret Nixon McEathron was an acclaimed musician both before and after her work in Hollywood.She started playing violin at the age of four and began playing with Karl Moldrem's Hollywood Baby Orchestra six months later. At 11, she won a singing contest at the LA County Fair and decided there and then to abandon the violin.In 1947, the same year she dubbed her first film, she made her Hollywood Bowl solo debut in Carmina Burana under the baton of Leopold Stokowski.By this stage, she had also dropped her ""hard to pronounce"" surname. ""Kids at school called me Mac-Earthworm,"" she said.Her first job dubbing the voice of a film actress arrived when she was working in the post room at MGM film studios, as a way of covering the cost of her singing lessons.Composer Bronislaw Kaper, who was working on the score for the film The Secret Garden, stopped her in the corridor and challenged her to sing a song in Hindi. The youngster obliged and her career was born.But, despite appearing on more than 50 soundtracks, she only sang on screen once - as Sister Sophia, one of the nuns performing How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria? in The Sound Of Music.In later years, Nixon appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic, performed on Broadway and in opera houses and hosted the Emmy Award-winning children's television show Boomerang.She also taught at the California Institute of the Arts, and toured for many years with Liberace.Nixon first had breast cancer in 1985, and wrote in her autobiography of the trauma of appearing on Broadway as chemotherapy caused her hair to fall out when the disease returned in 2000.She was married three times - first to Ernest Gold, the film composer behind Exodus and On The Beach, with whom she had a son, Andrew Gold, who went on to compose the Golden Girls theme Thank You For Being A Friend.Her second marriage, to Lajos Frederick Fenster, ended in divorce, while her third husband, Albert Block, died last year.She is survived by three sisters, two daughters from her first marriage, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	James Franco faces legal action over sexual misconduct allegations	'Debunked'	"Actor James Franco is being sued for sexual misconduct by two former students at his acting and film school.They allege that the Hollywood star engaged in ""sexually-charged behaviour towards female students"".He is accused of abusing his position by pushing female students into taking part in sex scenes and ""dangling the opportunity for roles"" in his films.The Pineapple Express and 127 Hours actor denies the claims, which his lawyer said were ""ill-informed"".The legal case, which has been filed at a court in Los Angeles, says the alleged abuses took place at Franco's Studio 4, which opened in 2014 and closed in 2017.The former students, Sarah Tither-Kaplan and Toni Gaal, said Franco tried to ""create a pipeline of young women who were subjected to his personal and professional sexual exploitation in the name of education"".They alleged that students were encouraged to pay $750 (£608) to join a sex scenes masterclass, for which they had to audition nude or partially nude. The sex scenes ""went far beyond the standards in the industry"", the women said.Those who performed were led to believe parts in Franco's films would be made available, the legal papers say.Tither-Kaplan had previously come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the actor/director, shortly after he won a Golden Globe Award for his film The Disaster Artist last year.When the allegations first surfaced, Franco said they were ""not accurate"".In response to the new case, his lawyer Michael Plonsker said: ""This is not the first time that these claims have been made and they have already been debunked.""We have not had an opportunity to review the ill-informed complaint in depth since it was leaked to the press before it was filed and our client has yet to even be served.""James will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity-seeking lawsuit.""The two women accused Franco, his production company and his two business partners of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, fraud and other wrongdoing. They are seeking unspecified damages and for any video recordings of the sex scenes to be destroyed.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Stars kick off movie awards season at Hollywood Film Awards	The full list of Hollywood Film Awards winners:	"Mel Gibson, Natalie Portman and Tom Hanks are among the stars who were honoured at the Hollywood Film Awards.Gibson won best director for World War II drama Hacksaw Ridge, a sign he has been accepted by the industry a decade after an infamous anti-Semitic rant.Portman won best actress for Jackie, in which she portrays Jacqueline Kennedy after John F Kennedy's assassination.The event styles itself as the start of the awards season, but is regarded with scepticism by some industry observers.Winners were announced in advance with no nominations. Many of the winning films have not yet been released and an anonymous panel chooses the recipients.But that did not stop an A-list crowd turning up to the ceremony, which was compered by TV host James Corden - although he did joke at one point that they were ""fake awards"".The night was also peppered with references to Tuesday's US presidential election.""Tonight is actually rigged,"" Corden told the audience at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, referring to Donald Trump's complaints about the election. ""Literally, none of this is real.""He also joked that it was ""the last awards show before the apocalypse"".Robert De Niro, who won the comedy award for the film The Comedian, compared Mr Trump to the ""totally insane"" General Jack D Ripper from Stanley Kubrick's Dr Strangelove.He said: ""It's two days until a frightening election. The shadow of politics is hanging over us whether we like it or not.""It's hard for me to think about anything else so let me lay it out right here. We have the opportunity to prevent a comedy from turning into a tragedy. Vote for Hillary Tuesday.""Tom Hanks won the best actor award for the film Sully, in which he played Captain Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who safely landed a passenger plane on New York's Hudson River in 2009.Nicole Kidman won the supporting actress award for Lion, while Hugh Grant was named best supporting actor for his role in Florence Foster Jenkins.He was presented with the award by Andie MacDowell, his co-star in the 1994 film Four Weddings And A Funeral.Addressing her on stage, Grant said: ""I'm just depressed at how much better preserved you are than I am after 22 years.

entertainment	Julie Walters 'a Hollywood freak' for not having plastic surgery	'Unusual''Not sure'	"Julie Walters has said she feels like a ""freak"" in modern-day Hollywood as one of the few middle-aged actresses not to have had any plastic surgery.The British film star told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that studios were not ""very good"" at giving roles to older women.But Walters said she would not have cosmetic work done, adding: ""I look real. It's good.""The Labour supporter also described PM Theresa May as ""a good woman"".And she said she sometimes felt that her comedy partner and close friend Victoria Wood, who died earlier this year, was ""still with us"".Walters, 66, who has starred in films such as Educating Rita, Billy Elliot, Harry Potter, Mamma Mia! and Calendar Girls, will appear next week in a Channel 4 drama National Treasure, which focuses on the relationship between a woman and her husband, a famous comedian who is accused of child sex offences.Asked about the attitude of Hollywood studios to older actresses, she said: ""I don't think they're very good with roles for women, are they?""""There are exceptions. Meryl Streep is an exception, isn't she?"" said Walters, who was born in Birmingham and began her working life as a nurse. ""And Julianne Moore, people like that. I mean, she's not that old, Julianne, but she's 50-odd.""And I've just worked with wonderful Annette Bening. Annette Bening doesn't look like she's had anything done to her face and that's unusual in Hollywood. I know if I go out there now I'd look like a freak, because everybody has.""Pulling up the skin behind her jaw to mimic having a facelift, Walters said: ""I don't want to do that.""A study published in 2014 suggested that male Hollywood stars' average pay increased until the age of 51. For women it peaked at the age of 34. There have also been reports that male stars out-earn their female co-stars at all ages.""I suppose they do a lot of those big blockbuster things,"" said Walters, ""violent things that must bring in money all round the world, I suppose - whereas the women tend to do more interesting things that don't bring in so much money.""Victoria Wood, who wrote and then starred with Walters in shows such as Victoria Wood: As Seen On TV and Dinnerladies, died in April, aged 62.Walters said: ""It was really strange. I couldn't kind of respond to it at the beginning, even though we all knew it was probably close...""I found I couldn't respond for some time. I was hugely anxious first of all."" Walters said she had eventually allowed herself to grieve in private and it sometimes felt like Wood was still ""with us"".Walters, a longstanding Labour supporter, called party leader Jeremy Corbyn ""a great bloke"".""I think he's fantastic,"" she added, ""and his speech when he launched his campaign was fantastic. But I can't see him as a leader. He was sort of absent at Brexit. I wasn't aware of him, really, making any speeches.""Asked about Corbyn's opponent in the current Labour leadership contest, Owen Smith, she said: ""I'm just not sure about him.""She expressed concern over Labour's future, saying: ""I feel sad, really. I feel there could be a split, which is really scary.""Walters described Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May as ""better than what they could have had - better than [Michael] Gove and better certainly than Boris [Johnson]."" She added that May was ""better than the women too, the other women"" the party might otherwise have chosen.She was critical of the government's plan to increase the number of grammar schools in England, but added: ""What I feel about Theresa May, though, is that she's a good woman. I do feel that.""I think that it comes from a good heart, that she does genuinely think she's going to give working-class kids a chance, but I don't think it will result in that.""The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Michael Jackson estate calls Leaving Neverland's Emmy Award a 'farce'		"Michael Jackson's estate has called the decision to give Leaving Neverland the Emmy Award for best documentary a ""complete farce"".Leaving Neverland, which first aired in March, focuses on two men who claim the pop superstar abused them as children.""For a film that is a complete fiction to be honoured in a non-fiction Emmy category is a complete farce,"" the estate said in a statement.It said there was ""not one shred of proof"" to support the show's claims.Leaving Neverland earned a total of five nominations ahead of the weekend's Creative Arts Emmys, and it went on to win outstanding documentary or non-fiction special.The controversial film, directed by Dan Reed, includes interviews with Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who were aged seven and 10 when the singer befriended them and their families.When the Emmy nominations were first announced, Reed said the recognition meant a great deal to all involved.""Since Leaving Neverland aired in March, it has launched many important conversations about child sexual abuse and the grooming that accompanies it,"" he said. ""This was why James Safechuck and Wade Robson and their families spoke out, and why we made the documentary.""We're delighted that the Academy has honoured that purpose.""But after the win, the Jackson estate said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter: ""Not one shred of proof supports this completely one-sided, so-called documentary which was made in secrecy and for which not one person outside of the two subjects and their families were interviewed.""After Leaving Neverland's premiere in January at the Sundance Film Festival, Jackson's estate called the project ""a tabloid character assassination"" and insisted it ""isn't a documentary"".Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Toronto 2019: Jennifer Lopez on learning to pole dance in Hustlers		"Jennifer Lopez has said learning to pole dance for her latest movie was ""one of the hardest things I've ever had to do for a role"".The actress stars in Hustlers, which premiered in Toronto on Saturday.""In my mind, it sounds like a really great thing, 'Oh, I'm going to learn to pole dance it's going to be so much fun!"" she said on the red carpet.""But then it was like, oh my God, this is the hardest thing. How are you spinning? How do I stop myself?""Hustlers, released in the UK next week, follows a group of New York strippers who work together to extract as much money as possible from their Wall Street clients.They go to extreme lengths to get them to part with their cash, including plying the clients with drugs and alcohol so they don't realise how much money they're spending.The film, which also stars Constance Wu and Julia Stiles alongside Lizzo and Cardi B in smaller roles, is based on a true story and was inspired by a New York Magazine article that went viral in 2015.Friendship and sisterhood are key themes in the film, but it also relies heavily on gratuitous sexual scenes, including a full pole-dance routine from Lopez to Fiona Apple's song Criminal.The actress said she ""got dizzy"" while training and was left ""bruised"" - despite her considerable dance experience.""You would think it would [help] being a dancer, but it really doesn't, it's totally different,"" she told reporters. ""I mean yes, I'm aware of my body, I move well, but it did not prepare me for the acrobatics, for the strength it would take for me to do what I had to do.""Luckily I had a great teacher, who was teaching me great technique of how to pull it off but it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do for a role, and it really hurt.""More from Toronto:While Hustlers is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival, where many films battle for Oscar attention, this is a movie which is realistically likely to do better at the box office than in awards season.""After the dog days of August, littered with one lazily patchworked Hollywood product after another, there's something wickedly indulgent about the arrival of Hustlers, a slick, flashy, seductively entertaining segue from one season to the next,"" wrote Benjamin Lee in The Guardian.""It's ideally positioned, premiering at the Toronto film festival before a mid-September release: it matches the immediate gratification of a summer movie with the artful substantiveness of an awards contender - yet remains not quite definable as either.""""It's a classic underdog story,"" said The Hollywood Reporter. ""Although the women of Hustlers are clearly stepping over a very thin, dark line between working the system and criminal behaviour, you can't help but root for them and all women who are tired of struggling financially and decide to use what they know to get ahead.""The film impressively somersaults past any stigma attached to stripping and sex work, emphasizing how the main characters are run-of-the-mill American workers regardless of their particular job."""
entertainment	Hollywood's reputation on the line over diversity	New selection criteriaTelevision taking a lead	"Last year they were making jokes about the lack of any black or Latino performers in the acting categories at the Academy Awards ceremony.Host Neil Patrick Harris opened the ceremony with a joke about honouring ""Hollywood's best and whitest. Sorry, brightest"".So why has the repeat situation created such a toxic row, with prominent figures Spike Lee, Jada Pinkett Smith and Michael Moore leading a boycott, and others like George Clooney and Oscar winner Lupita Nyongo speaking out?And what are the possible ""dramatic steps"" that Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) president Cheryl Boone Isaacs has promised the organisation will take to review its operations?Film critic Tim Robey believes a festering wound has grown since both the director and star of the Martin Luther King biopic Selma were ignored - despite great critical acclaim - last year.""There was a feeling going round that because they [Academy voters] had given awards to Twelve Years a Slave the year before, for some reason they thought they were 'off the hook'. So Selma got a terrible handling, really.""Profile of the average Oscar winnerHow to win an OscarHow to become an Academy memberOscars 2016: Nominations listDavid Oyelewo, who didn't get nominated for his lead performance in Selma, revealed on Monday that Isaacs called him in for a meeting after last year's awards ""to talk about what went wrong then"", though it's not known what specific ideas they discussed.The quickest fix would be to get an approved panel to draw up a longlist of nominations for voters to choose from, as many book prizes do.However, it would open up new arguments about who is on the panel and the controversial issue of affirmative action and so-called ""positive discrimination"". It also doesn't guarantee who gets on the shortlist.Both Tim Robey and Tim Gray, awards editor of Variety magazine in Hollywood, say making the shortlists longer would help. If this year's Best Picture shortlist had featured the 10 films allowed instead of just eight, it might have included the hotly tipped Creed or Straight Outta Compton.Diversifying the overwhelmingly white, male and over-50 membership has been much discussed and has been attempted in earlier recruitment drives.Bafta in the UK broadened its membership criteria a decade ago to attract younger people from newer digital and online creative industries - though that hasn't really resulted in much more diverse nominations.But Ampas is an honour society in which experienced industry professionals nominate others in categories for membership and awards. Actors nominate the acting shortlists, directors nominate directors and so on, before voting is opened up for the final winners.Trying to stop retirees from voting or at least nominating is one possibility, but it would mean an acrimonious internal fight.However, anyone who gets nominated for an Academy Award is automatically eligible for membership.Tim Robey says: ""It would be a much more elegant solution to the problem to nominate the worthy performances. Once you're nominated you become a member of the club.""This would still take time to feed through to making a notable difference in voting results though.Tim Gray suggests releasing information on how many votes each nominee on the shortlist received would help reduce acrimony: ""I was personally rooting for Will Smith in Concussion and Straight Outta Compton in multiple categories. But did they miss out by one vote? One hundred votes? We'll never know. But if we found out Smith got a lot of votes the reaction might be different.""Lobbying time-pressed voters to watch your film is crucial, says Gray, who fears the omissions reflect the films that perhaps not enough voters bothered to see.He used his Variety column months back to urge Academy members to see Compton: ""The movie was marketed for the general public as a hip hop movie, but I said it's more complex and more spectacular - and more accessible - than you may think.""Over the years the system has been accused of relying on getting glamorous stars to schmooze easily starstruck, aged voters in their care homes.Gray says that's unfair: ""Outsiders are often horrified by the idea of campaigning, but Hollywood always promotes its product. Disney did not open Star Wars: The Force Awakens without heavy promotion.""Robey agrees: ""It's also a case of the studios involved campaigning properly for the performers they've got. I think there should be much better campaigns for the likes of Michael B Jordan. They should really have made it very clear to the Academy that Creed was a film that needed to be taken seriously.""Fuelled by the risk-taking of cable channels, US TV is now widely regarded as enjoying a golden age for quality and range.Tim Gray believes it is 20 years ahead of the movie industry with shows such as Empire, Scandal and Transparent winning big audiences with diverse casts and production staff.In 2015, Viola Davis became the first African American to win an Emmy for lead actress in a drama for ABC's How to get Away with Murder. It's a virtuous circle, with a genuinely more diverse range of eligible voters in its award-giving bodies.A boycott of the Oscar ceremony, while controversial, might be a short-term shock tactic that does force action. Not just by stars, but by audiences.The Academy Awards' television audience was down 16% last year after the Oscar whitewash campaign grew on social media. If the drop is bigger this year there will be action.There is nothing industry people care about more than their viewing figures.This year's host, comedian Chris Rock, is himself under pressure to step down.Ironically, he wrote a scathing article in 2014 for the Hollywood Reporter about his enduring frustration with trying to build a career and support other men and women in Hollywood: ""They don't really hire black men. A black man with bass in his voice and maybe a little hint of facial hair? Not going to happen. It is what it is.""But Golden Globes presenter Ricky Gervais has encouraged Rock to exploit his power as presenter. ""If I were Chris Rock I wouldn't be considering boycotting,"" he tweeted on Tuesday, suggesting ""serious damage"" could be done on a live show.Tim Robey says: ""The very fact that he's clearly going to make an enormous fuss about it will make it more public, make the problem more evident to people.""""People are talking a lot about it,"" says Tim Gray, who points out Variety was running articles about the lack of decent roles for black actors back in the 1950s.""The pessimist in me says that people have been talking about it for 50 years. The optimist says that social media is going to keep the conversation going, so maybe there will be more action and accountability this time. I hope.""It's worth remembering that Ampas was founded not just to mediate labour disputes but also to improve the movie industry's image.With films like The Force Awakens proving that black and female actors can lead the biggest blockbusters, it's the Academy's image and institutional reputation that is now at stake.The lack of black nominees at the Academy Awards was discussed on Radio 4's Front Row."
entertainment	Return of Great British Bake Off brings 'sweet relief'		"The UK's TV critics have welcomed the return of The Great British Bake Off to Channel 4 for its 10th series.""No surprises hidden like currants in a fruit cake... No boat-rocking channel switches,"" said The Guardian's Chitra Ramaswamy.Scott Bryan also sounded a cautiously optimistic note in the i paper, writing: ""Overall, a strong start.""I just hope the format and its crushing need for standards doesn't suck all the fun out.""This series sees 13 amateurs (a baker's dozen) compete to win.The regular presenting team of comedians and broadcasters Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding, baker Paul Hollywood and writer Prue Leith have also returned.Tuesday night's first episode launched with an average audience of 5.7 million viewers, according to overnight figures, slightly down on the 6.1 million who watched the 2018 launch.In his four-star review, James Jackson of The Times picked up on the show's youngest-ever line-up, which, he said, ""some see as a ploy to grab youthful viewers deserting traditional TV, and potentially a race to the soggy bottom.""One of the more pleasing aspects about Bake Off has been its good-natured blend of generations,"" he continued, ""so it seemed a shame when last night the joshing tended towards Hollywood asking 20-year-old Jamie, 'Does your mum know you're here?' and Toksvig joshing, 'Is your voice breaking?' Jamie took the teasing with admirable good grace.""Contestants were asked to make a fruitcake, carried out a technical challenge involving angel cakes and made their show-stopping dream birthday cake from childhood.The non-break from tradition meant the latest series is ""off to a perfectly fine, if slightly underwhelming, start,"" said The Independent's Clémence Michallon.""This first episode is all classic fare that lacks a certain zest,"" she said. ""What is missing is a hint of spice to lift the overall flavour, a touch of je ne sais quoi to truly pull us in. Here's hoping things heat up throughout the rest of the series.""Christopher Stevens of the Daily Mail opined: ""Week One of Bake Off, now stretched to 90 minutes, is always an exercise in getting to know the contenders, and this time the field is more crowded than ever, with 13 challengers.""The first episode proved to be a hot topic for people on social media."

entertainment	John Malkovich stars in Harvey Weinstein-inspired play Bitter Wheat	'Theatrical clickbait'	"The first West End play to be inspired by the Harvey Weinstein scandal is difficult to categorise.It essentially starts out as a comedy - with an opening scene that zips along with writer and director David Mamet's comedic and cutting fast-paced dialogue, wrong-footing the audience in the process.The tone, however, changes very quickly.Once the lead character, the arrogant and predatory movie mogul Barney Fein, is left alone with a rising young actress, the atmosphere becomes very uncomfortable indeed.But John Malkovich, who portrays Fein, welcomes the platform that theatre provides to tackle difficult issues.""Obviously it's a fairly difficult subject matter,"" he tells BBC News. ""But people make plays or movies about all kinds of things, from mass murders to war crimes to rapists to cannibals.""And at least in the people I know who've seen the play, it has provoked conversation and probably allowed conversation which you may not have otherwise. Pretty much everybody is going to have a different view of this topic.""Speaking about the #MeToo movement more widely, he adds: ""I don't think it's going to be a topic that just sort of fades away, nor particularly should it be.""Of course, the play isn't a direct retelling of what Weinstein is alleged to have done, despite the obvious resemblance the lead character's name has to his.""Mamet's new play, we are assured, is fiction and any resemblance to living persons is 'entirely coincidental',"" wrote Michael Billington in The Guardian.""Given that the protagonist is an overweight movie tycoon ruined by accusations of sexual misconduct, coincidence clearly has a long arm.""The #MeToo movement began in October 2017 after The New Yorker published an article which alleged repeated sexual abuse of several women over decades.Last month, Mr Weinstein settled some of the civil lawsuits he was facing and agreed to pay compensation worth about $44m (£34.7m) to some of the alleged victims.However, in New York he is currently facing criminal charges, including rape, brought by two women. Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.Ioanna Kimbook plays Yung Kim Li - a British-Korean actress who Fein patronises with racial stereotypes throughout the play.""I do feel a lot of responsibility, she's kind of the first victim of the #MeToo movement to be put on a big stage like this,"" Kimbook says. ""But I think David's done a great job of portraying her with dignity. She's very calm, very assured and she deals with the situation well.""Given the nature of storylines in films, plays and TV series about sexual abuse, some studios have started employing intimacy co-ordinators to help actors get through delicate scenes.But, Kimbook says she ""never felt awkward"" during rehearsals. ""[Malkovich] is so giving, and obviously I'm new to this, and he's been in the business for goodness knows how long. He never made me feel like I was new, I felt like I'd been doing this alongside him for 50 years.""Bitter Wheat - the title refers to one of Fein's suggested film names - wasn't universally welcomed by critics after its press night earlier this week.Alice Jones in the i paper described it as ""the theatrical equivalent of clickbait,"" adding: ""Mamet doesn't even bother to give his play a proper ending; he might just as well have zoomed in on Malkovich giving us a big wink.""""Bitter Wheat would be considerably better were it more fleshed out,"" wrote Matt Wolf in The New York Times. ""That's assuming, of course, that it had to be written at all.""Henry Hitchings of The Evening Standard said: ""Despite a smattering of Mamet's famously staccato wisecracks, the play feels lazy, crude and empty.""Dominic Cavendish awarded the show just two stars in his review for the Telegraph, writing: ""The truth is that Bitter Wheat is a bitter disappointment - it doesn't add enough to the subject and, while it courts controversy, there's not enough to get the town talking. It may not knock Mamet off his pedestal, but it warrants no trophy either - quite a fail.""Malkovich reveals the show has been going through regular rewrites since previews began earlier this month.""I imagine will be at work on this for some time to come,"" he says. ""This kind of thing, it's a new play, it's never really finished... I think David had new things pretty much every day, but then there's also, 'where do you put them? Do you get rid of this or get rid of that?'""Before the play had even been performed, some questioned whether it was an appropriate subject to be tackling on the stage.""Because it was a man writing it, with the man as a central character, there was a bit of a backlash before it even started,"" recalls Doon Mackichan, who plays Fein's personal assistant Sondra. ""So when people judge something before they've seen it, I think that's crazy.""""As the older woman in the room, I was very aware of the tone, so I was watching and being very aware of how we were playing it.""For all his monstrous behaviour, [Weinstein] has kicked off a fabulous movement which is changing things for women across the board. So we're at a really good point for this to be aired and talked about. And Mamet has done it super quickly. We need some stories about the victims, some women's sides of the stories.""Malkovich reasons: ""No matter what you did, there'd be outrage anyway. But I wouldn't say it's about Harvey Weinstein, he's at best a kind of stand-in. I think David [Mamet] has probably said what he has to say, people can like that or lump it. Better if they write their own plays.""Bitter Wheat is playing at London's Garrick Theatre until 21 September."
entertainment	Tangerine: IPhone movie shows Hollywood's unseen side		"Micro-budget comedy drama Tangerine, the story of two transgender prostitutes in Los Angeles, is remarkable not just because it shows a side of Hollywood rarely portrayed in the cinema, but because the whole film was shot on iPhones.""All of my films capture street life and are shot clandestinely to a certain degree, but using iPhones on this one helped to even a greater extent,"" says Sean Baker, director of Tangerine, a breakout hit at this year's Sundance Film Festival.""It led to a lot of freedom and experimentation. If you had seen us shooting across Santa Monica Boulevard, you would not know we were a professional shoot, except for perhaps our sound gear. ""Instead of using ""dolly shots"" - with a camera moving on a track - Baker filmed street scenes while riding his bicycle.UK audiences can see Tangerine when it is released in selected UK cities on Friday alongside big studio offerings such as Steve Jobs, starring Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet, and The Lady with the Van, with Dame Maggie Smith.Tangerine, by contrast, features acting newcomers Mya Taylor and Kitana Kiki Rodriguez as trans sex workers on a Christmas Eve odyssey through the streets of LA.Baker admits he is ""pleasantly surprised"" at the ""universal love"" the film has received since its Sundance world premiere in January 2015.""It's the wonderful personas of the two lead characters who are really pulling audiences in,"" he says.""Mya introduced me to Kiki. When I saw the two of them together, I immediately thought 'dynamic duo' - we have to figure out how to get these two on to the big screen.""Inspired by a true story told to him by the actresses, Baker shot the film in the Hollywood neighbourhood where he lived - using three iPhone 5s fitted with special lenses. He treated the footage in post-production to give it a vivid, cinematic sheen.Sean Baker's tips for filming on a phone1. Sound quality. If you're going to shoot a feature film on an iPhone, take your sound seriously. Don't skimp on the sound, because that's the first sign of an amateur.2. Practise. Find the right tools and apps that will help you accomplish what you want. In the last year and a half, tech has advanced to a point where we don't need stabilisers any more - they are all built in to the iPhone 6. I'm jealous of anybody who is shooting stuff today.3. Take it seriously. Accept it and embrace it and find the benefits that can come from it. I'm sure there are millions of benefits that we didn't even find on our 23 days of filming in 2014. People can use this as tool to experiment and to find different ways of telling stories.The film's multiple storylines - which also involve a cheating pimp and an Armenian cab driver - converge in a showdown at an all-night doughnut shop.Because the budget didn't stretch to hiring out the shop for exclusive use, Baker and his cast shot their scenes while the shop was open.""We had to work round real customers,"" Baker says. ""It actually ended up working in our our favour because it looks a working shop - which it was.""""It could be annoying at times, but it worked,"" says Mya Taylor.The actress and singer says she hopes the film will highlight issues affecting the trans community.""It's hard for us to get a regular job as people automatically discriminate against us,"" she says.""Whether you look completely like a girl or not, if they know that you're trans they just don't hire you. I don't have to worry about a regular job any more, but I personally went through that.""Baker regards Tangerine as ""one of a million stories"" that can be told about the trans communities.""I hope that films like this that appeal to a greater audience will raise awareness - and then awareness will lead to acceptance,"" he says.Taylor says there were two rules she laid down to Baker before filming started.She says: ""I wanted this story to be brutally real and honest and I wanted it to be funny - and he nailed it.""Tangerine is released in the UK on Friday, 13 November"

entertainment	Woody Allen settles $68m lawsuit with Amazon over movie deal	#MeToo 'poster boy'	"Woody Allen has reached a legal settlement with Amazon Studios after it abandoned a four-film deal.Allen initially filed a $68m (£52m) lawsuit in February amid resurfaced allegations that he molested his adopted daughter.Amazon argued that his comments about the #MeToo movement ""sabotaged"" its attempts to promote his new movies.The film director denies sexually assaulting Dylan Farrow, who lost a court case against him in 1992.Under the movie deal, signed in 2016, Allen received a $10m advance payment. But two years later, the release of his first film, A Rainy Day in New York, was shelved and plans for three other movies were cancelled.Shortly before Amazon withdraw from the agreement, Allen reportedly expressed sympathy for movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women.Mr Weinstein denied the accusations against him, but has since reached a $44m settlement with some of the alleged victims.Months after these initial comments, Allen accused Dylan Farrow of ""cynically using the #MeToo movement"" after she repeated allegations that he assaulted her when she was seven years old.In an interview with Argentinean broadcaster Eltrece, Allen said he ""should be the poster boy for the Me Too movement"" since he had worked with ""hundreds of actresses"" and was ""only accused by one woman in a child custody case"".Amazon Studios said its decision to terminate the deal was justified because Allen's comments undermined its financial security.It also pointed out that ""scores of actors and actresses expressed profound regret for having worked with Allen in the past, and many declared publicly that they would never work with him in the future"".In response, Allen said Amazon was fully aware of Dylan Farrow's accusation when the deal was signed.His company, Gravier Productions, secured an international release for A Rainy Day in New York this year, but US distribution has not been secured.Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, who star in the film, said last year that they would donate their wages to charity."
entertainment	Blue Story: Vue boss plans to rescreen banned film		"The boss of a cinema chain that banned a London gang film after a mass brawl in Birmingham has told the BBC he plans to resume screenings by the weekend.Vue banned Blue Story after saying there had been 25 serious incidents in 16 of its cinemas.But its chief executive, Tim Richards, said it was now looking at ""beefing up security"" to restart screenings.It comes after Blue Story's director, Rapman, questioned whether there were ""hidden reasons"" for the ban.Rapman, whose real name is Andrew Onwubolu, previously told the BBC there was ""no connection"" between his movie and the brawl in Birmingham, which led to five arrests.""And then you start thinking, is there hidden reasons there? What's the owner like? Has he got an issue with young urban youth? Is he prejudiced?""Does he believe that this film brings a certain type? Is there a colour thing?""Vue has said the decision to pull Blue Story from its 91 cinemas nationwide was ""categorically not"" related to race.Responding to Rapman, Mr Richards said the chain wanted ""more movies like this on our screens, not less"".""Right now we are looking at trying to get that movie back onto our screens by the weekend and possibly, if we can, to accelerate that,"" he said.""Our plans right now are to look at the timings and look at who's buying the tickets, and we're going to be beefing up security where we've had problems.""There will be one or two cinemas, like Birmingham, where it will be very difficult to justify screening it again there.""Blue Story focuses on two friends from different south London postcodes on rival sides of a street war.It is rated 15 for strong language, strong violence, threat, sex and drug misuse.Another cinema chain, Showcase, had also initially stopped showing the film after the incident in Birmingham, but reinstated screenings on Monday night after ""careful consideration and discussions with the distributor"".In a statement, Vue added: ""Following an ongoing review of security to protect the safety of our staff and customers, we hope to be showing the film from this weekend with additional security arrangements in our cinemas to ensure everyone can enjoy the film in comfort and safety.""Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, welcomed Vue's decision and expressed gratitude to ""everyone who fought for this movie like it was their own"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Little Women and 1917: Possible Oscar rivals get rave reviews	'The definitive adaptation of Little Women'1917 is a 'single-shot masterpiece'	"One is a war film made by a James Bond director. The other is a new version of Little Women from the last woman to get an Oscar nomination for best director.They have now both been billed as two of the best films of the year.Reviews for 1917 and Little Women have just come out, and critics are raving about both. Empire magazine said Little Women confirmed director Greta Gerwig as ""a major talent in American cinema"".And The Times declared Sam Mendes' 1917 ""an Oscar-night frontrunner"".""If there were any remaining doubts that Greta Gerwig is a major talent in American cinema, put them to rest now,"" wrote Empire critic Helen O'Hara.Gerwig received an Oscar nomination for best director for Ladybird in 2017 - the only woman to have been up for that award since 2010.Now, she might repeat that feat for adapting Louisa May Alcott's classic autobiographical novel of sisterhood. The star-studded cast includes Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern and Meryl Streep.Little Women has been on the big screen several times before, but O'Hara said this is now the ""definitive"" version. ""Gerwig takes several bold storytelling choices that make this adaptation quite unlike any of its predecessors,"" her five-star review said.Vulture's Alison Willmore said the film ""feels, exhilaratingly, like the throwing down of a gauntlet"". She added: ""It doesn't just brim with life, it brims with ideas about happiness, economic realities, and what it means to push against or to hew to the expectations laid out for one's gender.""Writing in The Daily Mail, Brian Viner also gave the movie a glowing five stars, saying Little Women was ""a proper family treat for Christmas"", adding that Gerwig's vision had produced an ""enormously engaging adaptation"".Viner praised Gerwig's handling of the story, saying: ""She has ingeniously tinkered with the book's simple chronology, daring to move its cherished Christmas Day opening and constantly whisking us forward and backward in time.""However, Richard Lawson of Variety had reservations. Overall, he conceded ""it's often a lovely experience"" and admitted to leaving the cinema ""with eyes brimming"".But when it came to Gerwig's handling of the timeline, Lawson was not so readily swayed. He felt the director was ""too concerned with cramming in every plot beat from her source material"".In 1917, Mendes, who directed 007's Spectre and Skyfall, follows a mission by two messengers in World War One - supposedly inspired by a story the director's grandfather told him as a child.The Times' Kevin Maher gave it five stars and wrote: ""The resulting two hours of amphetamine-rush cinema is both a monumental technical achievement and, instantly, an Oscar-night frontrunner.""Peter Bradshaw, writing in The Guardian, also gave the film five stars, describing it as a ""single-shot masterpiece"", adding: ""Sam Mendes's 1917 is an amazingly audacious film; as exciting as a heist movie, disturbing as a sci-fi nightmare.""The movie appears to have been shot in one take. Cinematographer Roger Deakins ""pushes the single-take concept into new territory"", according to IndieWire's Kate Erbland. ""The idea is wild enough, but to make it look this dazzling from moment to moment is something else entirely,"" she wrote.Forbes critic Scott Mendelson declared that 1917 ""might be the best movie of 2019"". He wrote: ""Universal just dropped a bomb on the ongoing Oscar season, because Sam Mendes' 1917 is indeed one of the best movies of the year, if not THE best.""It works as a visual miracle, a violent action picture, a grim anti-war fable, a character play and an emotional rollercoaster. It's everything it promises to be, visually, narratively and emotionally, operating both as a technical blow-out and just a damn great movie.""But Robbie Collin, writing in The Telegraph, gave it a more lukewarm three stars, making a comparison with Saving Private Ryan in his review.""One of the most devastating manoeuvres in the history of negative Oscar campaigning was carried out in the 1999 season, when word was successfully put about - by the office of Harvey Weinstein, no less - that Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan didn't amount to much more than its undeniably impressive opening 27 minutes.""You sense that slur would be received as rapturous praise by Sam Mendes's 1917, which in spirit is those 27 minutes and nothing but, showily stretched out to feature length.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Star Wars: How did John Boyega's script end up on eBay?		"It's one of the most hotly anticipated films of the year, shrouded in secrecy. Yet that didn't stop the script for the new Star Wars sequel ending up on eBay.And it was all because Britain's John Boyega left it under his bed.Speaking on US TV, Boyega said his Rise of Skywalker script had been found by a cleaner and that it was subsequently offered for sale online ""for £65"".""So the person didn't know the true value,"" he continued, admitting the situation had been ""scary"".""Even Mickey Mouse called me up [saying] 'what did you do?'"" the actor joked - a reference to the Walt Disney Company which now owns the Star Wars franchise.The saga began on Monday when director JJ Abrams revealed an unnamed cast member had allowed a script to slip through their fingers.""One of our actors, I'm not going to say which one - I want to, but I won't - left it under their bed and it was found by someone who was cleaning their place,"" he told Good Morning America.""It was given to someone else who then went to sell it on eBay. And someone at the company said, 'You know, there's a script that looks like it's a legit[imate] script that's for sale on eBay'.""The director said the studio had recovered the script - one of a handful printed on ""crazy, uncopy-able paper"" - before it was sold.The plot thickened on Tuesday when cast member Daisy Ridley told the same show she had not been behind the leak.""It wasn't me,"" she insisted, while suggesting that one of the show's upcoming guests ""can answer the question as to who that was"".That guest turned out to be Boyega, who told the show on Wednesday his script had gone AWOL while he was ""moving apartments"".""I was just like, you know what, I'm going to leave it under my bed,"" he confessed. ""When I wake up in the morning I'll take it and then move.""But my boys came over and, you know, we started partying a little bit, and then the script just, it just stayed there.""Then a few weeks after this cleaner comes in, finds the script and then puts it on eBay,"" he continued.""But it all worked out,"" he concluded, joking it had been his plan all along to let fans ""read the movie before they see it"".It's all good publicity for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which opens in the UK and Ireland on 19 December.And the next time a high-profile screenplay goes walkabout, at least we'll have an idea where to look.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Cats: Claws out for movie trailer		"Universal have released the trailer for the new Cats movie and critics have been digging their claws in.The big screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical boasts a fur-midable cast including Taylor Swift, Idris Elba and Jennifer Hudson.However, many online were left feline puzzled by Oscar-winning director Tom Hooper's new creation.Film critic Wenlei Ma wrote: ""I have no words. It's just a jumble of emotions ranging from horror to befuddlement.""""Oof, this cast is so haphazard,"" opined Candice Frederick - scratching her head. ""I forgot Jason Derulo was in this too... I really wish I saw the Broadway show because I can't make heads or tails of what is even going on in this trailer.""Laura Kramer added: ""Still excited, also very confused.""""What were they thinking?"" asked The New York Times, which notes ""we have five months to get used to it,"" ahead of the movie's December release.Earlier in the week a pre-trailer trailer showed how ""digital fur"" had been used to turn the actors and meow-sicians into all singing/all dancing animals. But some of the CGI designs of the human-cat faces and anthropomorphised bodies have got some people in a flap.One writer compared them to Paramount's Sonic the Hedgehog, who was sent back to the drawing board after his human-looking teeth were criticised online earlier this year.""I don't know why you're all freaking out over miniature yet huge cats with human celebrity faces and sexy breasts performing a demented dream ballet for kids,"" declared Louis Virtil.James Dyer from Empire seems allergic to the Cats trailer too and he was not a fan of this particular pose from Rebel Wilson, who plays Jennyanydots.The trailer gives us a snippet of another Oscar-winner, Hudson - who plays the outcast Grizabella - performing the show-stopping Memory.Get Out filmmaker Jordan Peele, however, enjoyed one joker's suggestion that the creepy-looking production would have fitted better with the music from his horror film, Us.In all fur-ness, Hollywood CGI blockbuster Avatar was widely mocked at first and went on to become one of the biggest-selling box office smashes of all time, while The Greatest Showman suffered similar ridicule before becoming a music film sensation as well.The Huff Post declared: ""The Cats trailer looks absolutely ridiculous, And people can't get enough of it.""Other critics, including Erick Weber, think Hooper's production will ultimately purr-suade people to change their minds. He wrote: ""Could definitely see #CatsMovie having similar BO path as #TheGreatestShowman, critically maligned, audience-adored, absolutely kills it financially through holidays.""Scott Mendleson from Forbes is also looking forward to seeing the full feature play out. ""The first trailer for #CatsMovie is appropriately terrifying and insane, like a drug-induced nightmare made real. I can't wait!"" he grinned.On Wednesday, the studio allowed fans a look inside the making of the film and Hooper, who won the Oscar for best director for The King's Speech in 2011, spoke in glowing terms about its hip-hop influence.He enlisted the help of Hamilton's Tony-winning choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler and dance duo Les Twins to give his cats some street-smart dance moves, as well as introducing Royal Ballet principal dancer Francesca Hayward in a key role.They also made a giant set, so a litter of stars - including Brits James Corden, Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench - could view things from the cats' perspective.Some people, though, think the epic scale of it makes the cats look more like mice.The story, which was originally based on T.S Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats from 1939, is about deciding which of the cats will ascend to the Heaviside Layer - aka cat heaven.According to the director there's a deeper message too that makes it relevant to human life in 2019.""At the centre of this incredibly entertaining comedic fantastical musical is a very timely story about the importance for inclusion and redemption,"" said Hooper, who also adapted another classic musical, Les Miserables, for the big screen with big names in 2012.Now, far from killing it, fans' curiosity about his new film could yet keep the Cats box office dream alive. But after the first trailer, it seems it's on to the second of its nine lives already.Cats is out in UK cinemas in DecemberFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Bat For Lashes' latest record is the soundtrack to an imaginary 1980s vampire movie		"Since she moved to Los Angeles, Bat For Lashes has been in an 80s mood.""Driving up the coast and seeing all the pine trees and sunsets and strange old piers and abandoned theme parks - it feels like I'm living in that suburban place where ET could land at any moment,"" she says.The singer, aka Natasha Khan, left England in 2016 as her record deal with Parlophone came to an end, pursuing her dream of becoming a film-maker.Inspired by her surroundings, she started work on a script about a gang of ""bad-ass girls who look like they're vampires"" but are slowly revealed to be ""supreme witches"" who ""harness the power of nature to bring good into the world"".But getting a film off the ground isn't as easy as it seems. As Richard Curtis once said: ""The difference between having a good idea for a movie and a finished movie is the same as seeing a pretty girl across the floor at a party and being there when she gives birth to your third child... It's a very long journey.""In the meantime, Khan was asked to provide a song for Stephen King's TV horror show Castle Rock, with the brief stating ""they wanted music made now that sounded like it came from the 80s"".She went to meet the show's composer Chris Westlake and, within a day, they'd come up with Kids In The Dark - a gleaming synth ballad that sounds like Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time waltzing with Berlin's Take My Breath Away on Betamax, in a wind tunnel, with Molly Ringwald.""I was like, 'Oh my God, this sounds like all my favourite music,'"" says Khan.Pretty soon, her script was being retro-fitted as an album produced by Charles Scott IV, as the singer indulged all her 80s fantasies.""I rewatched The Lost Boys, Repo Man, ET, The Goonies, Karate Kid,"" says the singer. ""I mean, I watch those films quite a bit anyway, but also The Hunger with David Bowie and lots of horror films.""And then Charles and I would listen back to the guitar sounds The Cure used, or the drum machines Robert Palmer used, or the synth sounds Peter Gabriel used.""We wouldn't necessarily copy them, but it was inspiration to create our own versions of those things.""It's not the first time the Brighton-born musician has drawn inspiration from the 80s - the artwork for her 2009 single Daniel shows Khan on a windswept beach with a full-back tattoo of The Karate Kid's Daniel LaRusso - but the decade's darker aesthetics are a perfect foil for her breathy, soft-focus melodies.On The Hunger, icy keys and staccato guitar lines prowl menacingly as Khan's vampiric characters chant: ""I want to bleed / And feed us forever"".Feel For You, on the other hand, flutters around a syncopated syn-drum loop as Khan repeatedly declares her love to, one presumes, her latest victim.""It was liberating to just have two lines in the chorus and not be so precious about being poetic and deep and all that stuff,"" she laughs.It's certainly a world away from the bleak misery of her last album, 2016's The Bride, which told the story of a woman whose fiancé died on his way to their wedding.""This is definitely much more playful and tongue-in-cheek,"" she says. ""And that's definitely an aspect of me: I love to dance, I love romance and music and laughter - but I suppose I've never pushed it so much in my music.""She even road-tested the songs with her friends to ensure maximum danceability (""If they wiggle, then you know it's a good one"") but it wouldn't be a Bat For Lashes album without an overarching narrative concept.So remember those vampire biker girl witch people? It turns out they each have ""different aspects of womanhood"" - and when they kidnap the story's protagonist and take her to the Mojave desert, it's an attempt to save her soul.""The metaphor of the story, really, is that in order to live and love in the normal world, everyone has to delve into their subconscious and reconnect with elements of their psyche that may have been abandoned, or left in the shadows,"" Khan explains.She worries that the ""superficial"" and ""over-stimulated"" modern world allows us to bury our most troubled thoughts and impulses, instead of hashing things out with friends and family.""I couldn't write a song with my phone next to me, I wouldn't even think about doing that, so why do we think we can conduct relationships and conversations with our families in that way?""Left to fester, she says, those unspoken emotions grow into something altogether more disturbing.""If as a society you don't visit the dark side or the shadow side, you get projections of that out in the world - crazy politics, or demonising groups of people. And so we get these very black and white viewpoints happening, which I think is dangerous.""People I know are really hungry for community and the rituals that we've lost: The cycles and pagan traditions that help keep us connected to the life and death process.""We don't have places of worship or places where we gather - unless they're pubs or festivals or things that involve lots of drinking; and a lot of people seem to be feeling quite lost and disconnected.""It hardly needs to be said but, for Khan, music and film are the ways she deals with her darker impulses.""They're always pulling me down into those depths - probably more than is necessary,"" she laughs. ""It's always a balancing act between losing yourself too much to reality, or losing yourself too much to fantasy.""Yet she's always presented her music through characters, concepts and narratives, saying she finds that ""easier than going out and baring my soul in really confessional love songs"".It's helped her deal with the anxiety that comes with playing live - a prospect that's looming on the horizon this autumn.""I've been in LA living in my own world and it's been very magical and quiet and creative - so this stage is quite scary,"" she admits.""You're changing form, and turning this small creature into a big, glamorous pizazz-y beast - but otherwise I sort of feel like, 'It's just little old me, why am I going to go and stand on a stage?'""So it's funny and surreal and it takes a bit of time - but right now, I feel like I'm in a good place to reach out.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Avengers: Endgame set to pass Avatar as top box office movie	What are the numbers?What's it all about?Pats on the back from the bosses	"Avengers: Endgame is set to pass Avatar this weekend to become the highest-grossing movie of all time.The weekend take of the Disney and Marvel Studios' sequel should push it past the record held by James Cameron's epic of $2.7897bn (£2.23bn).Marvel chief Kevin Feige hailed the achievement at Comic-Con in San Diego on Saturday, although it was still officially $500,000 short at the time.Disney boss Alan Horn said fans had taken the film to ""historic heights"".Avengers: Endgame has not just been a success at the box office, it has also drawn widespread critical acclaim. Reviews when it was released spawned descriptions such as ""glorious"", ""irresistible"", ""intensely satisfying"" and ""masterful"".Its Rotten Tomatoes reviews are over 90%.On Friday, Avengers: Endgame's global gross was $2.7892bn, half a million dollars short of Avatar, but its weekend take was always likely to push it through the barrier, as last weekend it raked in $2.8m across the world.The figures are not adjusted for inflation and Avatar would still be ahead it they were.Avengers: Endgame already had other achievements - including the biggest global opening of all time at $1.22bn when it was released in April, breaking the record of 2018's Avengers: Infinity War.An Avengers: Endgame re-release with added footage at the end of June, and the recent release of Spider-Man: Far from Home, have helped give Endgame a box-office kick.Endgame is the 22nd offering in the Marvel Studios superhero franchise and the fourth in the blockbuster Avengers series.Film experts say fans embracing the Avengers characters has helped create a worldwide phenomenon.We're not about to give away spoilers here - although by the looks of it there's no-one left who hasn't seen Endgame anyway.Suffice it to say the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise began with Iron Man in 2008.Most of the storylines in the Marvel movies since then have had objects called Infinity Stones playing a part and, well, it was up to the final movie to sort it all out, particularly as it had not gone well for the superheroes in the immediately previous movie, Infinity War.Kevin Feige slipped out congratulations at Comic Con as he announced a bumper crop of 10 new superhero movies.He admitted it would be ""a matter of days"" before Endgame became ""the biggest film in history"" and that ""if you adjust for inflation, [James Cameron] still holds the title"".But he added to a large ovation: ""But for right now today in Hall H, thanks to you, Avengers: Endgame is the biggest film of all time.""Alan Horn said in a statement: ""Huge congratulations to the Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Studios teams, and thank you to the fans around the world who lifted Avengers: Endgame to these historic heights.""Actor Chris Hemsworth - aka Thor - said on Instagram: ""Thank you to all the fans around the world that lifted Avengers Endgame to historic heights making it the top grossing film of all time!""Oddly, Avatar is now also a Disney film, after Disney acquired much of 21st Century Fox in March.Mr Horn said he looked forward ""to the future of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Pandora (the Avatar milieu)"".Avatar 2 has a current release date of December 2021."
entertainment	Avengers: Endgame overtakes Avatar as top box office movie of all time	What are the numbers?What's it all about?Pats on the back from the bosses	"Avatar's 10-year reign as the world's highest-grossing film has ended.On Sunday, Marvel's Avengers: Endgame crossed $2.7902bn (£2.23bn) at the box office, pushing it over the $2.7897bn earned by James Cameron's sci-fi epic.Marvel chief Kevin Feige hailed the achievement at Comic-Con in San Diego this weekend, although it was still officially $500,000 short at the time.In the UK, however, the film can only claim fifth place on the all-time box office chart.Star Wars; The Force Awakens is still the country's top-earning movie, after taking £123.2m at the box office in 2015.It is followed by two Bond movies, Skyfall and Spectre, and Avatar, which is £3m ahead of Endgame's current tally of £91m.The Force Awakens is also the box office champion in North America, meaning Endgame's record-breaking haul was down to a strong international showing.The film, which starred Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Chris Hemsworth as Thor, collected $629m in China, $105m in South Korea and $85m in Brazil.Disney boss Alan Horn said fans had taken the film to ""historic heights"".Avengers: Endgame has not just been a success at the box office - it has also drawn widespread critical acclaim.Reviews when it was released spawned descriptions such as ""glorious"", ""irresistible"", ""intensely satisfying"" and ""masterful"".Its score on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes is over 90%.Disney bought Marvel Studios in 2009 and recently completed its acquisition of Fox, which owned the rights to Avatar.That means the ""House of Mouse"" is now home to seven of the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time - including all four Avengers films.Marvel announced its next 10 superhero movies, with seven due in 2021 alone, at Comic Con in San Diego this weekend.Avengers: Endgame has set numerous box office records already - including the biggest global opening of all time at $1.22bn when it was released in April, breaking the record of 2018's Avengers: Infinity War.An Avengers: Endgame re-release with added footage at the end of June, and the recent release of Spider-Man: Far from Home, helped give Endgame a box-office boost.It finally surpassed the $2.9bn mark on Sunday - but box-office figures are not adjusted for inflation and Avatar would still be ahead if they were.Even then, though, James Cameron's ecological allegory wouldn't be the top dog. Film historians estimate that Gone With the Wind still has a case for being the most successful film of all time.According to the Guinness Book of Records, its inflation-adjusted box office takings would be $3.44 billion (£2.7bn).Endgame is the 22nd offering in the Marvel Studios superhero franchise and the fourth in the blockbuster Avengers series.Film experts say fans embracing the Avengers characters has helped create a worldwide phenomenon.The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise began with Iron Man in 2008.Most of the storylines in the Marvel movies since then have had objects called Infinity Stones playing a significant role.Kevin Feige slipped out congratulations at Comic Con as he announced a bumper crop of 10 new superhero movies.He admitted it would be ""a matter of days"" before Endgame became ""the biggest film in history"" and that ""if you adjust for inflation, [James Cameron] still holds the title"".But he added to a large ovation: ""But for right now today in Hall H, thanks to you, Avengers: Endgame is the biggest film of all time.""Alan Horn said in a statement: ""Huge congratulations to the Marvel Studios and Walt Disney Studios teams, and thank you to the fans around the world who lifted Avengers: Endgame to these historic heights.""Actor Chris Hemsworth - aka Thor - said on Instagram: ""Thank you to all the fans around the world that lifted Avengers Endgame to historic heights making it the top grossing film of all time!""Avatar 2 has a current release date of December 2021.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Sir Elton John's best movie moments	Tommy (1975)The Lion King (1995)Spice World (1997)Almost Famous (2000)Gnomeo and Juliet (2011)Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017)	"The much talked-about Sir Elton John biopic, Rocketman, touched down in the UK this week following its glitzy launch at the Cannes Film Festival.The movie, directed by Dexter Fletcher and starring Taron Egerton chronicles the colourful career of the musician; from his early life as Reginald Kenneth Dwight to becoming the knight of the rock 'n' roll realm we know today.Speaking at the Cannes press conference, actor Bryce Dallas Howard said it was ""incredibly surreal to hear Elton crying a few seats away"" at the premiere.Sir Elton has been no stranger to the silver screen himself down the years, so let's take a quick look back at some of his most memorable celluloid moments.Having played himself in the 1972 concert film, Born to Boogie - alongside Marc Bolan and Ringo Starr - Sir Elton first showed his credentials as a character actor a few years later in The Who's film, Tommy.He played the role of the Pinball Wizard - dressed in seven foot high boots - in the movie adaptation of the band's 1969 rock opera.After years of being the champ, Elton's man had to hand over his pinball crown to the title star; ""that deaf, dumb and blind kid,"" played by frontman Roger Daltry.In fact, Sir Elton quite literally takes his hat off to him at one point.Tina Turner, Eric Clapton and Jack Nicholson all appear in the flick, as do Oliver Reed and Ann-Margret, who was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe for her performance.He may already have had more music awards than you can safely store in your garage, but Sir Elton had to wait until 1995 to get his hands on an Oscar.There was a lot of love felt that year for Can You Feel The Love Tonight, which he wrote in collaboration with Tim Rice for the Hans Zimmer-scored Disney animation, The Lion King.Sir Elton fended off stiff competition from, well... himself, twice - The Circle of Life and Hakuna Mata - to take the prize for best original song.The song specifically soundtracked the romantic scene between Simba and Nala - you know the one (tissues at the ready).It also won Elt' another Grammy for best male pop vocal performance.OK, so he was never going to be given any gongs for this one; the briefest of cameos in the Spice Girls movie - but it still goes down in 90s pop culture history.The scene basically involved him saying a quick hello to Sporty, Scary, Ginger, Baby and Posh while exchanging kisses in the corridor.There's a brilliant outtake, that you can find online, of Sir Elton delivering the gag: ""Damn, never happened with Take That.""The girls went on to perform his track, Don't Go Breaking My Heart, alongside him for ITV's An Audience with Elton John later that year.In 2018, the artist formerly known as Posh Spice - Victoria Beckham - told Vogue magazine that she decided to quit the group after seeing her friend Elton in concert and realising that she didn't feel anywhere near the same ""passion and enjoyment"" for performing as he does.Oh Sir Elton, how could you?Cameron Crowe's cult retro indie film, about a schoolboy infiltrating the rock 'n' roll world while working for Rolling Stone magazine during its 70s heyday, had a fair few bangers in it.However, the most memorable musical moment arrives when the entire Stillwater - that's the fictional band, by the way - tour bus burst out into an emotionally-charged impromptu rendition of [by-now Sir] Elton's Tiny Dancer.You could argue it effectively made Sir Elton cool and relevant again.The US director later revealed his lifelong love of the Watford singer and how he wanted to pay a ""proper tribute"" to him during the film's central scene.""Tiny Dancer is wrapped up a lot in 1973 in my heart,"" said Crowe, ""so I wrote it in the script, it was originally the part of that scene that meant the most to me, even the soul of the movie.""Elton is always authentic, he feels like he's talking directly to you. It's really what you dream of when you're making a movie, to speak directly to one person and his music has always helped me do that in films.""He added: ""And I always wanted to feel that I was able to earn the song.""The scene apparently took two days to get just right, meaning that ""everyone sang a million times"". Everyone apart from Noah Taylor that is, who played the band's tour manager as ""he's a punk rocker!""Sir Elton repaid the compliment to Crowe by telling him: ""I'm gonna have to start playing that in all my concerts now.""""It's just slightly surreal and great"" beamed the man in the director's chair.The soundtrack for the animated rom-com, based loosely (very loosely) on William Shakespeare's classic play, Romeo and Juliet, reads like the track-list for an Elton John greatest hits collection.Ordinarily that would cost a filmmaker and arm and a leg, but handily the very same songwriter was the executive producer on this one.The movie stars the voices of James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Michael Caine, to name but three.The standout scene is set to the tune of Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting; a rocking little number that was originally recorded for Elton's 1973 record, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.However, even way back then he was probably dreaming that the track would one day find its true spiritual home as the soundscape for a fast-paced fictional alleyway lawnmower race.Vroom Vroom.Last but not least, the same song got a rather more violent run out a few years ago in the second instalment of Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman movie series.The UK director actually wanted Elton to be in the first film three years earlier, but alas it was not to be. So when Vaughan finally got his man, it's fair to say he made the most of it, dressing the singer up in one of his old exotic bird stage outfits and having him kung-fu kick someone in the face in a pair of his trusted old Tommy-era platform boots.""It was so weird getting into those old clothes again,"" said Elton, in conversation with Vaughan on his Beats 1 radio show.The Layer Cake director explained his choice of Saturday for the ridiculous piano-side fight scene.""It's incredibly cinematic,"" said Vaughan, ""and it's got three acts to it which means I can build the action to it.""In the movie we used five different live versions and mixed them all together which was [very] difficult to do!""He added: ""It's fun, energetic, great for action but also warm and feel good - it made my film 100 times better.""Next time around, Sir Elton, who acted opposite Julianne Moore and Colin Firth, said he wants to be one of the actual Kingsmen and not just a colourful sideshow.Well, its prequel; The Great Game, is pencilled in for a February 2020 release, so we won't have to wait too long to see if the sun has gone down on perhaps his best chance of a cinematic lead role.If Rocketman goes down well, at least he won't ever have to play himself again.Rocketman is out in UK cinemas nowFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Frozen 2: Heartwarming or a 'dire case of sequelitis'?	'Conglomerate overlords''A mildly depressed accountant'	"Six years on from the original, Frozen 2 is almost here. Film critics have given their verdicts ahead of its cinema release on 22 November.Some had their icy hearts thawed by the sequel, but others remained cool about Anna and Elsa's latest adventure.On the one hand, The Telegraph's Robbie Collin said it's a ""generous, charming"" film that ""hits all the right notes"".On the other, Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson diagnosed Disney with ""a dire case of cynical sequelitis"".He wrote: ""From my sorry adult view, this sequel is entirely unnecessary, except in its duty to serve the needs of capital.""Frozen became a phenomenon in 2013, making $1.27bn (£986m) at global box offices and becoming the most successful animated film ever.While admitting there was ""sweetness"" in the film, Lawson said the directors and writers ""grasp for a new mythos to match the original's, but come up woefully short"".He added: ""In that striving to justify a sequel, the Frozen team is forced to go bigger, grander, more existential, while still keeping things accessible to children. That's a really tough balancing act, one Frozen 2 can't manage.""Of course, the first movie also spawned the hit song Let It Go. Lawson said the sequel ""is a lot of hurrying to get to what the conglomerate overlords surely care most about: achieving a Let It Go-esque moment of pop-ballad triumph, a true clarion call of marketability"".He was not impressed by the results. ""Not a half-hour after seeing the movie, I couldn't call up a single melody.""Others picked out the song Into the Unknown as a hummable highlight, however. Robbie Colin revealed: ""I sung it to myself for the entire train journey home, fell asleep singing it, woke up singing it, and am in fact still singing it right now, while typing this.""His four-star review said that, on the whole, Frozen 2 ""tacks excitingly away from the Disney princess template"" and has ""an air of freshness"" to it.Empire magazine's Ben Travis also awarded four stars, saying the sequel ""goes bigger, bolder, and more epic"".He wrote: ""Where Frozen II does surpass its predecessor is in the jaw-dropping animation - one moment involving water drawn from a plank of wood is near-photoreal. Elsewhere, the film is far more stylish and playful than the prosaic original.""There were four more stars from the London Evening Standard's critic Charlotte O'Sullivan, who said it ""doesn't improve upon the original"" but combines ""Broadway razzmatazz"" with a ""quiet weirdness"".She wrote: ""It's hard to carp, given the amount of technical invention, not to mention wit and emotion, crammed into every set-piece.""The Times' Kevin Maher distributed just two stars, saying the movie ""consistently ticks boxes and executes songs and set pieces with all the verve of a mildly depressed accountant talking you through his latest spreadsheet"".The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw gave away three stars, while Screen Rant's Molly Freeman was marginally more generous with 3.5.""It's not as cohesive a movie as Frozen was, which may be down to the sequel never even attempting to introduce a villain,"" she wrote.""Instead, Frozen 2 takes the risk of forgoing the typical Disney movie story structure for a more mature style - and while it doesn't entirely work, other aspects of the film are compelling enough to keep viewers engaged.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Wolf of Wall Street show: Step into Jordan Belfort's world		"Six years ago the film The Wolf of Wall Street was a box-office hit for Martin Scorsese. But it started with a book by Jordan Belfort describing his rise as a young New York stockbroker - and how everything then came tumbling down. Now the book's been adapted as a live immersive experience in London.Name recognition for The Wolf of Wall Street probably comes mainly from the 2013 film with Leonardo DiCaprio. But the man who now has to make the story work with live actors points out the show he's written and directed has nothing to do with the movie.Alexander Wright says he believed the story would make great immersive drama.""This isn't a show where you sit in a seat for two hours. When you walk in you're treated as a new employee on Day One at the stockbrokers Stratton Oakmont. There's going to be immediate interaction with actors cast as other employees.""And you soon realise you've turned up on a big day: the firm's handling the massive IPO (Initial Public Offering) for [fashion designer] Steve Madden shoes. That's where the story starts.""In real life the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont, run by Belfort, took Madden public in 1993. Belfort was later indicted for securities fraud and given a four-year sentence.Wright's cast of 20 has recreated a multi-layered slice of New York life in a terrace of houses behind Liverpool Street Station. The space is due to become a boutique hotel next year. The location is close to major City of London employers such as Deutsche Bank and UBS; Wright knew he wanted a location in the financial district rather than an established theatre.After an initial briefing, audience members face the kind of options common to many immersive shows. At certain points they choose which storyline to follow as Stratton Oakmont first booms and then crumbles. You can remain a devoted Strattonite or take an interest in how FBI agents build their case against the firm.And if you prefer, you can focus on the tense home life of Belfort (played by Oliver Tilney), his wife Nadine (played by Rhiannon Harper-Rafferty) and young daughter Chandler.Harper-Rafferty is appearing in her first immersive show.""What I really like is the access you get to the audience. Physically they're very close so you see what is affecting them. But they can also morph what's happening in the action - it's two-way.""There are moments when, if I feel it's going to work, I ask the audience for advice about the strains in the family. The reply is often that I should leave Jordan - though a couple of days ago someone asked why doesn't he just take his money and retire?""There's a scene at home celebrating Chandler's seventh birthday. It's like the audience becomes part of our group and you can feel them trying to protect the Chandler character. An audience member may stand in the wrong place or maybe make an unexpected comment out loud. But if that comes from an emotional place it can actually help.""Tilney also took the central role in Wright's immersive version of The Great Gatsby.""This is still a relatively new form and we're learning all the time how it works. Sometimes immersive theatre can be free form, where the audience goes wherever it wants. Or there's a promenade experience where you might go fairly strictly from A to B to C.""I would say The Wolf of Wall Street sits somewhere in between: audience members have a choice of where to go but we talk about 'tracks' which pretty much guide the audience through the narrative.""More inquisitive people can peel off and follow a different strand of the story - and sometimes it's useful for us if we invite them to do so. That can work if an audience member is in some way interesting or is asking particular questions. They may end up learning something which others don't or having a particular experience. We call those Easter eggs.""The play retains the original 1990s setting. Wright says today's City workers, with so many nearby, may find parallels with recent events in the world of finance.""It'll be really interesting to sit with them in the bar after the show and talk about what resonates today and what's more from 90s business culture. But if it starts as a story about stocks and banks and money and excess it becomes a story about people. The last thing we want to be is preachy.""Audience members need to accept a certain amount of shepherding from one space to the next. Attentive production staff wrangle them with a firm touch. There are quite a lot of stairs and swear words.Wright says structuring Gatsby gave him valuable experience to help make the new show work.""The immersive industry attracts a varied audience which has grown but also the character has developed. Wolf is getting people in who wouldn't dream normally of going to the theatre - in some cases theatre would be their nightmare evening out. So that's a whole new audience.""But also we've definitely seen people come over from traditional theatre to give immersive a try. They might be people who would go to the National Theatre or to the West End. We're now seeing families and tourists turn up and I don't think immersive is seen as purely a fringe thing any more.""There are parts of the show which are very funny. But there are elements of tragedy too - Jordan flies high but he crashes to earth. It's like a great classic King Lear: it all comes down to ambition and relationships and people making mistakes and having to decide what matters to them and the damage they do along the way to everyone around them - even to people they love.""We have an incredibly complex but rigid show plan about what needs to happen when. We have worked out exactly how the audience will journey through the action. But hopefully the audience isn't aware of that at all. What matters are the characters and how they interact - it's ultimately what keeps people watching.""The Wolf of Wall Street is playing at Stratton Oakmont Inc. on Sun Street in London."
entertainment	MTV Movie Awards: Avengers and Game of Thrones win big	'Hollywood was going to conform to me'Doing it for the kidsShouting out the stunt performersMTV Movie Awards 2019 winners in full	"Avengers: Endgame and Game Of Thrones were named best in class at the MTV Movie & TV Awards on Monday night.Marvel's record-breaking blockbuster also won best hero for Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man and best villain for Josh Brolin's Thanos.Lady Gaga won best performance in a movie for her role in A Star Is Born, while Elisabeth Moss won the TV equivalent for The Handmaid's Tale.The awards have not split the acting categories by gender since 2017.Endgame, which was released released in April, has been a huge commercial success and is second only to Avatar in the list of highest-grossing films ever.Anthony Russo, who directed the film with his brother, Joe, accepted the prize for best film after seeing off competition from BlacKkKlansman, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, To All the Boys I've Loved Before and Us.He said: ""A movie like this one is only possible because it's been built on the shoulders of so much great work, so many talented artists and storytellers stretching back decades and generations now.""All the way back to its origins with the late, great Stan Lee.Despite mixed reactions to Game Of Thrones' eighth and final season earlier this year, it won best show ahead of Riverdale and The Haunting Of Hill House.Here's a round-up of what else went down at the ceremony:Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson reflected on his early career in Hollywood as he was honoured with the generation award.The 47-year-old professional wrestler-turned-actor, who played his first leading role in 2002 action movie The Scorpion King, said when he first arrived in Hollywood, the film industry ""didn't know what the hell to do with me"".The father-of-three entered the stage at the Barker Hangar to the tune of Queen's We Will Rock You and opened his acceptance speech by telling fans ""the most powerful thing that we can be is ourselves"".He said: ""This half-black, half-Samoan, six-foot-four, 275-pounds pro wrestler. Hollywood did not know what to do so I was told at that time you've got to be a certain way; you've got to drop some weight, you've got to be somebody different, you've got to stop working out... you've got to stop calling yourself The Rock.""Johnson said he took the advice for his first few years in Hollywood, which left him ""miserable"".""So I made a choice, and the choice was I wasn't going to conform to Hollywood, Hollywood was going to conform to me.""So Hollywood conformed to me and here I am with all of you receiving the generation award.""The actor, who will reprise his role as Luke Hobbs from the Fast And The Furious movies in spin-off Hobbs & Shaw alongside Jason Statham later this year, finished his acceptance speech by saying: ""It's nice to be important but it's more important to be nice.""Sandra Bullock was the first big winner of the night, taking home the prize for most frightened performance for her role in Netflix horror Bird Box.After being released on 21 December, Netflix said Bird Box had been viewed by 45 million accounts in its first week, making it the most-watched film within the first seven days on the platform.The movie featured Bullock trying to protect her two children from supernatural monsters who make people go insane by locking eyes with them.It sparked a wave of internet memes thanks to the sight of Oscar-winner Bullock wearing a blindfold and the British Transport Police had to investigate YouTube footage of pranksters doing the 'Bird Box challenge'.Netflix was forced to issue a message telling fans not to take part in the challenge.In her acceptance speech, Bullock, explained she took part in the film for her son Louis, nine, and seven-year-old daughter Laila.She said: ""I made Bird Box because my children asked me why I never made anything for them.""So when Bird Box crossed my path, I knew this was a story I needed to make because it was about family.""And when I finished the film, I went to my babies and said 'here, mommy made this for you and even though you can't see it until you're 21, because apparently a movie about being a mommy is a horror film, you will know when you see it there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you'.""The Oscar winner said her children were her ""first thought in the morning"" and her ""last thought at night"".She added: ""I was put on this Earth to protect you. You are my world. I love you so much. I will move mountains to make sure that you are safe.""Captain Marvel actress Brie Larsson invited Renae Moneymaker and Joanna Bennett on to the stage in Santa Monica, California, to accept best fight in recognition of the her character's battle with Minn-Erva.After thanking MTV for the prize, Larson said: ""But I wanted to take this moment to really say thank you to the two women that are standing here beside me.""These are the women who trained me and were also the stunt doubles for Captain Marvel.""I could not have made this film without them. They are really the baseline for who she is. They are the living embodiment of Captain Marvel.""Taking the mic, Bennett said: ""It was such an honour to work on this film and be part of bringing such a strong female character to life and to be able to do it together was just such a special experience for all of us.""Moneymaker added: ""Joanna and I actually grew up together. As young girls, we wanted to be just like Lara Croft and GI Jane, so it's a real honour to be a part of this character and hopefully pass along some of that inspiration and strength that those iconic women brought to us.""To get into shape for the film, Larson embarked on a gruelling regime of intensive weight training, as well as taekwondo, judo and boxing, which left her able to deadlift 225lb and push a Jeep.Best show - Game Of ThronesBest musical moment - A Star Is BornBest villain - Thanos (Avengers: Endgame)Best real-life hero - Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RBG)Most frightened performance - Sandra Bullock (Bird Box)Generation award - Dwayne 'The Rock' JohnsonBest host - Nick Cannon (Wild 'n Out)Most meme-able moment - Colton Underwood jumps the fence (The Bachelor)Reality royalty - Love & Hip Hop: AtlantaBest fight - Captain Marvel vs Minn-Erva (Captain Marvel)Best performance in a movie - Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born)Trailblazer award - Jada Pinkett SmithBest kiss - Noah Centineo and Lana Condor (To All The Boys I've Loved Before)Best hero - Robert Downey Jr (Avengers: Endgame)Best documentary - Surviving R KellyBest performance in a show - Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid's Tale)Breakthrough performance - Noah Centineo (To All The Boys I've Loved Before)Best comedic performance - Daniel Levy (Schitt's Creek)Best movie - Avengers: EndgameFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Amazing Grace: Why Aretha movie lay hidden for 50 years		"An unseen 1972 movie of Aretha Franklin recording the most successful gospel album to date was shelved and remained hidden for nearly 50 years, partly due to the singer's frustration over Hollywood's failure to make her a movie star, according to its makers.Amazing Grace, recorded in a Los Angeles church over several nights in 1972, was supposed to be the vehicle by which the Queen of Soul also became the Queen of Hollywood, says its producer Alan Elliott.It was directed by Oscar winner Sydney Pollack. But a technical mistake meant it was impossible to sync the sound and pictures, and the project was reluctantly dropped.In the digital age, when Elliott realised the film could be repaired, Franklin still refused all attempts to get the film released, up until her death from pancreatic cancer in 2018. Her family agreed after her death that the film should be seen.""On a professional level, Aretha was promised that she'd be a movie star with this film, and her contemporaries Diana Ross and Barbara Streisand go on to make movies, Diana Ross made Lady Sings the Blues and Barbra Streisand does Funny Girl and The Way We Were - with Sydney Pollack,"" Elliott explains.""Aretha Franklin was denied the chance to be a movie star, and that was her whole problem with the release of the movie. She wasn't against it, she just had very big expectations and she also wanted to get a lot more money than anyone ever paid for a documentary.""""She was old school, she wanted cash and she gave us a high mountain to climb in terms of getting her on board,"" says Joe Boyd, another producer, who was present in his role as a music executive when the film was recorded.Nevertheless, Franklin did see a version of Amazing Grace before her death, ""and she loved it,"" says Elliott.""We knew Aretha Franklin was sick with pancreatic cancer, and we agreed that the film was put on hiatus until the family was ready. But she did love the film. That's the crazy part of it. Knowing she was sick, I'm glad she loved the movie.""Aretha Franklin, 'Queen of Soul', dies aged 76Obituary: Aretha FranklinAretha Franklin: Stars pay tribute to 'the Queen of our souls'Boyd expresses doubts whether in 1972 Hollywood ""was equipped... to make a star of a black woman"", even though Franklin, then aged 29, was at the height of her career, with hits such as I Never Loved A Man, Respect and Baby I Love You.""The studio was thinking of teaming Amazing Grace with Superfly (a ""blaxploitation"" crime drama film with a soundtrack by Curtis Mayfield),"" adds Elliott. ""I just don't think there was that sensitivity.""Even without an accompanying film, Amazing Grace as an album went on to sell more than two million copies on release. According to Boyd, the documentary is a ""time capsule from 1972"".Modern audiences watching the film see the music star barely speak three sentences in between songs. With few costume changes, Franklin is glistening with perspiration on a sweltering Los Angeles evening. James Cleveland, known as the ""King of Gospel"" joins her on stage.""If you watch modern music documentaries, you have all these talking heads who explain it and lead you by the hand through the whole thing, but in this, the music envelopes you, there's no chat,"" explains Boyd. ""And her look is in keeping with her sound - live, in the moment, not over-produced, beautiful. It's a different era now - there weren't many moments like this after 1972, much less in the second decade of the 21st Century.""Elliott believes Amazing Grace's release now is a ""eulogy"" for the superstar.""I think the family is really pleased it exists,"" he says. ""Their Queen Mother lives on at the height of her voice.

entertainment	The real story behind Prince's Little Red Corvette	LITTLE RED CORVETTE1999D.M.S.R.AMERICASOMETIMES IT SNOWS IN APRILALL MY DREAMS	"Little Red Corvette is the song that made Prince a star - a breathless ode to casual sex that gave him his first US top 10 hit in 1983 and introduced him to the mainstream.The story goes that Prince came up with the opening lines - ""I guess I should have known, by the way you parked your car sideways, that it wouldn't last"" - after falling asleep in the back of a car owned by his keyboard player Lisa Coleman.And that's true... to an extent.The BBC got the full story behind the song, and some of Prince's other hits, directly from Coleman and her musical partner in crime, Wendy Melvoin.They were perhaps Prince's most important musical collaborators, working solidly with him throughout the early '80s as members of The Revolution, introducing elements of jazz and classical to his provocative blend of funk and rock.After he dismissed the band in 1986, Wendy and Lisa released several successful albums as a duo and went on to score hit TV shows like Nurse Jackie and Heroes. They're currently working on an album with comedian Maya Rudolph and celebrating Prince's legacy by reforming the original line-up of The Revolution.The duo reminisced about their favourite Revolution songs ahead of the release of a deluxe edition of Prince's fifth studio album, 1999, this Friday, containing 35 previously unreleased songs.End of Youtube post by PrinceLisa: ""Prince was always borrowing my car because it was awesome. It was a '64 Mercury Montclair, pink and white, and it was just the perfect cruise-mobile on a beautiful day in Minneapolis. He actually put a couple of dents in it, because it was so big. He'd come up to me and mumble, 'Hey Lisa, sorry about your car'. So I'd run out to inspect the damage and there'd be a little dent with some yellow paint from a pole he'd reversed into, and I'd go, 'Damn it. Watch where you're going!'""Is it true he wrote Little Red Corvette while he was sleeping in the back of the car?""Well... I guess. He was 'sleeping' with someone we knew called Denise Matthews [aka Vanity] and she was 'sleeping' in the back of the car, too. I even found some of her hair wrapped around the handle that winds the window down.""So I imagine they were making out, or doing whatever, in the back seat and they probably had a wonderful moment of afterglow, which is when he got the seed of the idea... But it's not a red Corvette, it's a pink Mercury!""The song became his mainstream breakthrough. Did you know it was special?""Yeah, definitely. It was pure hit material and Prince coveted it for a little while.""Before it was recorded, we'd play it in sound check and our manager Steve [Fargnoli] would freak out. Prince used to laugh at him: 'Oh, Steve has babies when we play this song!'""End of Youtube post 2 by PrinceLisa: ""I have a really clear memory of the first time I heard that song. I'd gone to rehearsal early, but Prince was already there playing the main keyboard riff. He motioned me to come over, and said, 'Play this', then he went down and picked up the guitar and started fooling around with it. Then, when everybody else started showing up, he showed them their parts and we all kind of fell in.""I was in good favour that day, because I decided to hold down D and F in the chorus. He was like, 'Alright, that's great! Listen to Lisa, she's producing herself. Why don't the rest of you guys do that?' He was always nice and then he'd have to say something mean after. Like, 'I can support you but don't forget you're not all that.'""You get to sing the first line of the song. How did that come about?""Prince got the idea of splitting the vocals up from Sly & The Family Stone, and how everyone had a presence in that band. We actually added Jill Jones's voice because she's a better singer than I am. So it's the two of us singing together. I have the dreamy quality and she has the fire.""End of Youtube post by Prince - TopicLisa: ""I still love playing that song. I love the funk and the Minneapolis sound of it, with the Oberheim [synthesizers] and everything. It has a party vibe going all the way through.""The groove on that song is so persistent. You must play the main riff a couple of hundred times.""Right, exactly. It's almost meditative. That was one of the great things about being in the Revolution. We were like whirling dervishes, because we would take a groove and play it for hours on end. It was not only good for training our bodies - but imagine what that did to our brains. There were times in these jams and rehearsals where I'd really feel elated. It was so good. You just become part of the music, there's no other way to explain it.""The lyrics are all about personal liberation and celebrating your sexuality, which was quite unusual in 1982.""It was definitely out of phase. I was always proud of him because it wasn't in fashion to talk about those things back then. He had a vision about people, about how we could be together, and he managed to create an oasis in Paisley Park for people who heard the message.""End of Youtube post 3 by PrinceGuitarist Wendy Melvoin joined the Revolution in 1983, playing her first gig on the night Prince debuted Purple Rain.Lisa told the BBC about the creation of that song in a previous interview, so we skipped ahead to 1985, and the release of Prince's seventh album, Around The World In A Day. The record, which featured the hits Pop Life and Raspberry Beret, also contained a funk jam called America, which served as the ultimate showcase of The Revolution's musical muscle, especially on the unedited 21-minute version that appeared on the 12"" single.Lisa: ""The first time we played America was in a tent in the south of France, while we were filming Under The Cherry Moon.""Wendy: ""There was no ventilation and it was over 100 degrees in the tent. And if you've watched the video, you can see we are full-on running around the stage. I remember both Prince and I had to have oxygen tanks brought to us because we almost passed out from heat exhaustion.""Lisa: ""I remember Prince laying down on a road case and somebody brought him some orange juice. I mean, he was just dripping with sweat.""Wendy: ""He was wearing a trench coat!""Prince is essentially conducting the band during that song, calling out changes on the fly, and even jumping on the drums at one point. How do you rehearse for something like that?Wendy: ""It's not an easy answer. We were good listeners, and we had worked on the groove for quite some time, so we knew what was expected of us. It was all basically just, 'Keep your eye on him', and he'd give us signals on where he wanted to go.""Lisa: ""Sometimes he'd come up to my keyboards and jam a little bit and say, 'Play something like that'. But in this case, he just gave me the lead line, so I have the most boring part!""Wendy: ""Really? Is that line all you do?""Lisa: ""Well, I sing my ass off.""Wendy: ""I'm busy up there. The guitar part's very intricate.""Lisa: ""Sometimes, when I got really easy parts I'd get mad at Prince and play with a yo-yo on stage, going, 'I'm bored!'""End of Youtube post by princevevoSometimes It Snows in April is the final track on Prince's second film, Under the Cherry Moon. It's an uncharacteristically spare and melancholy addition to the star's songbook, and deals with the passing of a beloved friend. After Prince died in April 2016, the song became his eulogy, and The Revolution regularly revisit it in concert.Wendy: ""We were at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, Prince, me and Lisa, just the three of us, and we were all in quiet moods. I picked up an acoustic and Lisa was playing piano and we just started coming up with a motif, a progression. Prince is very quick with words, so it kind of just happened in a couple of hours. He'd written the whole lyric and sung the whole song. It came very fast.""Lisa: ""He pushed for that dissonant chord when he sings 'Sometimes I wish'. He called it the 'Lisa chord' but it was actually his harmony that made it dissonant. It's beautiful the way it resolves.""Wendy: ""It was a nice night. I remember being very, very calm. There was no drama of any kind.""There's a real fragility to that song.Wendy: ""There were a few around that time. Power Fantastic had a lot of tenderness, and so did The Tears In Your Eyes. They all had that same kind of gentle quietness.""Tell me more about the 'Lisa chord'.Wendy: ""I'll tell you one thing about Lisa: All of the musicians that Prince hired over the years, including me, he can do all of their parts. The only musician he ever hired that he can't mimic was Lisa. She became invaluable to him and I believe, truly, that Lisa was his ultimate musical muse. I've always felt that way and I stick to my guns on that one.""Lisa: ""Wow.""End of Youtube post by Partager RegimentPrince was recording several potential albums, including the triple-disc Crystal Ball, when he suddenly called time on The Revolution. Bootlegs from those sessions have circulated amongst fans for years, and this All My Dreams is Wendy & Lisa's personal favourite.Wendy: ""I wish Lisa and I could get our hands on All My Dreams and finish it up for him.""Lisa: ""That was such an interesting, fun, crazy day in the studio. When you listen to it, it's like a little movie or something. It had a carnival atmosphere.""Wendy: ""Do you remember around that time we took him to see Kid Creole and the Coconuts and he fell in love with August Darnell singing through the megaphone? He made [studio engineer] Susan Rogers buy him one for that song.""Lisa: ""It's so full of imagination. He sings, 'Lisa, I'm going to give you the paintbrush and you're going to paint the side of the train'. What does that mean?! And then I do some crazy piano solo, just pounding around, and we were just like, ""Y'arr! This is great! This is just fantastic!'""Wendy: ""I remember me and Lisa and my twin sister Susanna pulled out recorders we had from our school days, and Prince was like, 'Bring it on!' It was just a crazy time.""You're in a reverie remembering it.Wendy: ""Oh yeah, for sure. It was such a beautiful time of exploration.""Lisa: ""Sometimes the work was just work. But this? It was like kindergarten for songwriters. As musicians, as songwriters, we were a little bit nuts.""Why did Prince withdraw from that psychedelic style?Wendy: ""Because we were gone. And once we were gone, he turned into a different person. That's the nature of who he was.""Lisa: ""Prince always wanted to be great, so he needed to regroup and think, 'How do I reach the next level of my greatness? Is it a movie? Is it a different band?' He didn't know, but he had to find out - so it was like, 'Sorry, you guys. Too bad. See ya.'""The deluxe edition of 1999 is released on Friday.

entertainment	George Michael: Upbeat new song premieres on Radio 2		"A previously unheard George Michael song has premiered on BBC Radio 2.Called This Is How (We Want You To Get High), the supple, funky track was recorded during the star's final studio sessions in 2015.His witty, self-aware lyrics look at how parents pass on their worst habits, with George declaring: ""I will always try to get my life together.""""It's made me really emotional,"" said Radio 2 DJ Zoe Ball after playing the track. ""Absolutely beautiful.""This Is How is the first new music from George Michael in seven years, and features in the forthcoming rom-com Last Christmas - a movie co-written by Emma Thompson and based around the star's songbook.The movie stars Emilia Clarke as a bored Christmas-store worker who keeps bumping into Henry Golding's character around London in serendipitous circumstances.Thompson recently discussed how the star gave her his personal blessing before his death, aged 53, in 2016.""He was just the loveliest guy you could imagine,"" she recalled. ""[He loved] all of these themes in the movie; he was passionate about homelessness, and he had this great social conscience.""Thompson continued: ""I got really enthused and we started to write, and then - of course - he had that tragic early death in 2016, on Christmas Day. So we lost him, and I miss him so much.""The star's estate subsequently greenlit the use of This Is How in the film's closing scenes; and director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Ghostbusters) vowed to include all six minutes of the unheard material.""When you get a song that has never been heard, you don't want to just use, like, 15 seconds of it,"" he told the BBC earlier this year. ""The song starts at the end of the film, and then goes into the credits.""This Is How will be included on the film's soundtrack album, which is released on Friday.In a statement, George's family said they hoped fans everywhere would ""rejoice in hearing this great new song written as ever with Yog's immense passion and pride.""This new track we proudly send as his gift to you this season to bring you all love and festive joy, whoever you worship, whoever you love.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Will Gompertz on horror movie Us directed by Get Out's Jordan Peele ★★★☆☆	Some recent reviews by Will	"The jolly female film critic sitting one seat to my right in the cinema felt it only proper to manage expectations.""I've seen the trailer,"" she said, ""and it looks really frightening.""""Good,"" said the chap from a slasher movie website sitting between us.""No,"" she said. ""I don't like horror films. I'm going to scream. A lot.""We thanked her for the heads up, mentally prepared for her terrified outbursts (couldn't wait, TBH), and sat back to watch Us - Jordan Peele's follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut, Get Out, which was not only very good but also plenty scary in a Michael Haneke Funny Games sort of way.Us starts on a summer's night in 1986 with a little girl called Adelaide and her parents enjoying themselves at a fun fair. They stop at a stall. Dad throws some balls, and wins his daughter a Michael Jackson Thriller T-shirt.She pops it on and turns towards the camera leaving the audience in no doubt that the message it carries is ominous (because of the song's lyrics, not the recent doc Leaving Neverland).She wanders off alone, walks past a creepy guy holding up a cardboard sign that reads Jeremiah 11:11, and ventures into a spooky looking Hall of Mirrors. It is as freaky as hell and that's before the lights go out. She runs for it, gets lost, sees what she thinks is a reflection of herself but isn't quite, and is never the same again. So far, so Scooby Doo.Cut to the present day. Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) is now a mother with two kids - Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex) - and a jovial husband called Gabe (Winston Duke) who is driving them to the coast for a holiday in Santa Cruz. As luck would have it, they're heading for exactly the same spot Adelaide had her something-nasty-in-the-woodshed experience all those years ago.Doh!Understandably, she is on edge from the moment they arrive at their stylish holiday home. Not so gung-ho Gabe, who is chuffed to bits with the ropey old speedboat he's scored for the family's amusement. They go down to the beach, hang out with some annoying friends, and then head home for a relaxing night of fun and games.That's what Gabe and the kids think anyway. But Adelaide knows different. They are in a bad place. They should go. Now. But it's too late... a boiler-suited family of doppelgangers is standing outside and they haven't dropped by to borrow some sugar.What follows is a beautifully shot, superbly acted, blood-soaked, slasher-horror movie with a nicely sharpened comic edge.The themes of identity, duality, race, the American Dream (the clue is in the title), privilege and subjugation run through it just as they did in Get Out. Nothing wrong with that. But Us lacks the psychological tension that made Peele's first film such an outstanding piece of work.I suppose an appropriate metaphor would be to say it was like watching shadow boxing: you see loads of punches being thrown but none of them land.I couldn't work out if the problem was with the editing or the directing, but too often when a scene was reaching its dramatic, horrific climax - the point at which you are thinking about raising a hand to cover your eyes - the tension dissolves like a sneeze that never materialises. It's like Gabe's boat, the timing is a bit off.It doesn't stop it being a good movie, rich with visual allusions and biblical overtones, but it does fall short of being a great film. Not by much - just a second or two here and there - but enough to leave you a tad disappointed. Mind you, there was an upside. I left with my eardrums intact.The lady to my right didn't scream. Not once. She didn't even emit so much as a tiny ""eek"". In fact, she was as quiet as a girl wearing a red boiler suit with mad staring eyes and a pair of scissors in her hands.And she was totally silent - as you will see if you watch the trailer."
entertainment	Disney+ streaming service UK launch date confirmed		"Disney's streaming service, which will include the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar and National Geographic, is hitting the UK on 31 March.Disney+ will also arrive in Germany, France, Italy, Spain on the same date, having already soft-launched in the Netherlands.The service's biggest launch will be The Mandalorian, Jon Favreau's TV series set in the Star Wars universe.The US gets the hotly-anticipated show when Disney+ launches on 12 November.Disney, which will rival services including Apple TV+, Netflix, Amazon Prime and the upcoming Britbox, will feature many staples from its own back catalogue, including Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Pinocchio, Dumbo and Bambi.The studio's films have taken $8.3bn (£6.4bn) at box offices worldwide so far this year, and account for about $4 in every $10 spent at North American cinemas. It also spent $70bn on 20th Century Fox in March, so is able to able to incorporate content such as the first 30 seasons of The Simpsons.But according to Tech Radar, just seven of the 23 hugely successful Marvel films will be initially available to watch, partly due to rights issues and also because ""it's possible that Disney doesn't want to make its entire Marvel movie catalogue available right away - there are DVD and Blu-ray sales to maintain after all"".Disney+ will be hosting Marvel TV series including Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston, and The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, starring Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, although they're not expected to hit screens until at least next year and beyond.But Marvel boss Kevin Feige recently told Bloomberg that Marvel fans will need to watch the Disney+ shows to keep on top of plotlines for the Marvel films.Bloomberg reported: ""If you want to understand everything in future Marvel movies, he says, you'll probably need a Disney+ subscription, because events from the new shows will factor into forthcoming films such as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.""The Scarlet Witch will be a key character in that movie, and Feige points out that the Loki series will tie in, too. 'I'm not sure we've actually acknowledged that before'.""Disney+ will cost: $6.99 in the US per month, but the UK price is yet to be announced.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Whoopi Goldberg returns to Sister Act stage musical	Sister Act on screen	"Whoopi Goldberg is to return to the London stage musical Sister Act - this time in the starring role she originally played in the two hit films.The actress and comedian will play Deloris Van Cartier, the singer who hides in a convent disguised as a nun after she witnesses a murder.Jennifer Saunders will play the convent's Mother Superior in the newly-adapted version of the hit musical.Goldberg briefly appeared in the Mother role in 2010 in the West End show.As well as performing, Goldberg will act as producer of the new version at London's Eventim Apollo, as she did when the show first debuted in the West End in 2009.In a video posted on Twitter, Goldberg said: ""Yeah, the original Deloris Van Carter is back. A little older, a little seasoned but really still kind of out there.""Saunders suggested Goldberg's performance as Deloris ""could be the event of the century"".Co-producer Jamie Wilson said Goldberg would be ""playing the part she is so famous and so loved for"".On Thursday matinees, Deloris will be played by West End star and Loose Women panellist Brenda Edwards.When Goldberg first joined the cast of the original London production at the London Palladium it was for a limited engagement.She was forced to cancel her final appearances owing to family reasons, but made five subsequent appearances in October of that year, the week prior to the show's closure.The musical's plot closely follows that of the first Sister Act film, where singer Deloris witnesses a murder and is forced to go into witness protection, joining the last place she's likely to be found - a convent.As she initially struggles with life at the convent, under the guise of Sister Mary Clarence, Mother Superior sets her the task of working with the choir - leading Deloris to find her own voice as well as helping her friends find theirs.The stage show features songs from Alan Menken, the award-winning composer known for his scores to Disney films such as The Little Mermaid and Aladdin.The musical numbers from the movie are not used in the stage version due to copyright issues.The stage production, which was originally staged in California in 2006, has since run on Broadway and been performed by touring companies around the world.The first Sister Act comedy movie opened in 1992 and went on to become one of the most successful films of the early 1990s, making $232m (£180m) worldwide.A 1993 sequel, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, sees Deloris having become a famous performer in Las Vegas before she has to return to her Sister Mary Clarence persona.The film was not as big a hit as its predecessor and went on to make $57m (£44m) at the global box office.Goldberg is currently one of the hosts on US talk show The View.Sister Act the musical will run at London's Eventim Apollo from 29 July to 30 August 2020.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	How Pope Francis became a movie star	'We felt the fury in him''Not just a Christian message'	"German director Wim Wenders tells the BBC why the chance to make a documentary with Pope Francis was a heaven-sent opportunity.Over the course of a 50-year career, Wim Wenders has worked with such international luminaries as Mel Gibson, Alicia Vikander and rock band U2.Yet the German film-maker witnessed global recognition on a whole new level when he accepted an invitation from the Vatican to make a film about the Pope.Combining interviews with the pontiff with footage of his travels, Pope Francis: A Man of His Word shows its subject commanding audiences far greater than any star could muster.So did Wenders see any similarities with some of his other collaborators during the four afternoons he spent conversing with His Holiness?""The Pope has the same presence as some of the greatest movie stars I've worked with,"" says the director of Paris, Texas, Wings of Desire and Buena Vista Social Club.""But it comes from inside, from his convictions and his faith, and from his desire to talk to all of us.""He doesn't have it because he's full of himself,"" continues the 72-year-old. ""He's incredibly modest - a real, humble man.""It's not an act; he's not an actor. He's interested in everybody he meets, and in true communication.""Wenders believes it was the Pope's desire to reach as wide an audience as possible that led him to make his big-screen debut.It certainly wasn't because he was familiar with Wim's work. ""I know for a fact the Pope doesn't know movies,"" he shrugs.""The first thing he said to me was, 'I've heard good things about you, but I must confess I haven't seen a single one of your films.'""The initial approach instead came from Dario Vigano, the film-loving head of the Vatican's communications department.Monsignor Vigano has since resigned after facing criticism for doctoring a letter sent by Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI.Wenders insists no subject was off the table and that the Pope ""wouldn't have had it any other way"".During the documentary, which had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, the 81-year-old is seen addressing the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic Church in recent years.""He talked about paedophilia without hesitation, and that was when he was at his angriest,"" says the director.""We really felt the fury in him - that he would like to do so much more but he's only one man.""At other points in the film, Pope Francis expresses concerns for the environment and his more general hopes for a more equal world.Central to his thinking are ""the three Ts"" - ""Tierra, Trabajo y Techo"", the Spanish words for land, work and housing.""You don't expect the Pope to mention salaries, but he doesn't hesitate to be concrete,"" Wenders continues.""It takes guts to say we're destroying our planet and we're all going to go down if we don't take care of our own house.""Spending time with the Pope clearly had an impact on the three-time Oscar nominee, who found himself questioning his own tendency towards acquisitiveness.""I have a big addiction,"" Wenders confesses. ""I buy a lot of music because I want to stay on top of things.""I realised that a lot of this music I only listen to once. I keep buying more and it's ridiculous.""Given there are an estimated 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world, there is sure to be an audience for Wenders' film.Yet the director hopes Pope Francis: A Man of His Word will do more than preach to the choir.""The film is about a man who wants to move his church and talk to everybody, not just Catholics and Christians,"" he concludes.""His is not just a Christian message. It's a message to all people of good will, and that's who he wants to address.""Pope Francis: A Man of His Word is out in the UK on 10 August.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But I won't count any chickens, thank you, until it is out, until we know how it is doing.""Lord Fellowes is no stranger to Hollywood success, however, having won the Oscar for best original screenplay for Gosford Park in 2002.Going from television to film does present different challenges, he said.""[In a series] we usually give the big stories to maybe three characters a week... By the end of the series everyone would have big stories and it would all be plaited together.""In a film you can't do that. Every character you include you must have their own story. The viewer can judge whether or not I have been successful, I wouldn't make any claims.""I had to make sure every story of every character was completed within the movie. That did take a certain amount jiggery-pokery, but I am pleased with where we came to and very pleased with the reassembled cast.""I was at Highclere [where the TV series was shot] on Friday and there was something almost surreal seeing them back in their costumes.""It was a very happy time for us all. It was a big hit all over the world. It was a very nice cast and I think they made a lot of good friends among them so there was something of a reunion like the first day back at school... a very happy school.""Details of the film's plot are being kept tightly under wraps, and Lord Fellowes said he never answers questions about the storyline.Nostalgic fans will have to wait until next year for the Downton Abbey movie to be released.The TV series ran from 2010 to 2015, winning 15 Emmys and three Golden Globes, with the finale watched by almost 11 million people in the UK on Christmas Day 2015.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Georgia seeks to put itself on movie map	'Gender equality'	"Once famous as a powerhouse of Soviet films, the Black Sea country of Georgia is working hard to promote itself in the lucrative world of international film locations.Girls of the Sun (Les Filles du Soleil) by Eva Husson, a French drama about female fighters in Kurdistan, is in competition at the 2018 Cannes Festival and is helping elevate Georgia's reputation as an up-and-coming film destination.The Black Sea country, famed for its mountains and beaches, has been actively courting foreign film makers to use Georgia as a backdrop in movies and commercials.Girls of the Sun may be the highest profile film made in Georgia to date. Other prominent filmmakers have also been attracted by exotic locales in the country, as well as the government's incentives.Country profile: GeorgiaWhile the country still lags behind Croatia and other Eastern European film locations, its proximity to major EU cities, comparatively low prices, and bounty of filming locations are drawing directors from around the world.For instance, Michel Hazanavicius, director of the Oscar-winning The Artist, opted to film in Georgia when shooting The Search in 2014.In addition to Western film makers, several Bollywood films and music videos have been shot in Georgia in recent years. Prominent Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf shot an entire feature film in Georgia in 2014.Why Georgia?One of the most recent films to have been shot there is How to Sell a War, starring Katherine Parkinson and Lily Newmark.Directed by Rudolph Herzog, it's a comedy about fake news, where a PR consultant (Parkinson) has to invent a war so that a global charity concert can go ahead.Filming for the Irish-Georgian co-production has been taking place in Georgia in April and May.How to Sell a War producer Sam Taylor, who has now worked on four films partly or completely filmed in Georgia, says that, initially, filming in Georgia was a pragmatic move.""When I first came to shoot here in 2015 the decision was purely hard-nosed. It is cost effective, a safe country and production values are high. Anyone looking to film a multi-location story - or a costume drama - will be offered a vast array of locations within a short travelling distance from Tbilisi.""The sheer variety of backdrops - from snow-capped mountains and black sandy beaches to Soviet-era brutalist architecture and ancient ruins - are one of Georgia's biggest selling points, in addition to tax breaks and low prices.State-run Film in Georgia offers a 20 per cent rebate to qualified filmmakers for the expenses incurred in Georgia.""Georgia is the cheapest filming location in Europe. Absolutely all public locations are free of charge, but we also help producers to get discounts in the locations which are not,"" says Tatia Bidzinashvili, Film in Georgia programme manager.""The work force is cheap, compared to European prices,"" she adds.The Georgian government is also a member of Eurimages, the Council of Europe fund that supports European films.Sam Taylor notes that Georgia offers filmmakers a lot more than just low prices and picturesque locations.""Perhaps the reason we love working here is that unlike many film-making industries in other parts of the world, around 50% of the film directors in Georgia are women,"" she says.""If you compare this to the UK, or German or the USA (approximately 4% of directors are women), you can see that Georgia is far advanced in terms of gender equality.""Taylor says, however, that some challenges still exist. For instance, the Georgian film industry still lacks some of the skill sets that are commonly used in Europe and elsewhere.""A script supervisor is virtually unknown on a native Georgian set - and the skill base in certain departments needs attention - but it's an exciting time for Georgian film-makers and that transmits to the crew we bring in from abroad. They love the energy and enthusiasm, we end up forcing them to go home.""BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

entertainment	Ryan Gosling's Neil Armstrong movie to open Venice Film Festival		"Summer 2018 has so far given us plenty of hot weather and a World Cup which broke the record for most own goals scored in the tournament's history.The last thing anyone is thinking about is the winter film awards season.But despite it still being July, the starting gun for the race which will culminate in the Oscars in February has now been fired.It's been announced that First Man will open the Venice International Film Festival this year - traditionally thought of as the first of the awards season festivals.It's based on the Apollo 11 moon landing, and stars Ryan Gosling as astronaut Neil Armstrong - who became the First Man (y'see) to walk on on the moon in 1969.The movie is directed by Damien Chazelle, whose film La La Land - also starring Gosling - opened the same festival in 2016.The musical went on to pick up a whole host of awards - although not, notably, best picture at the Oscars.(Famously, the film was initially announced as the winner by mistake, before it finally went to Moonlight).Claire Foy - best known for playing a young Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown - will star as Armstrong's wife Janet, while Corey Stoll and Lukas Haas will portray astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins respectively.The film will be released in the US on 12 October.""I wanted to look at just how radical, crazy and controversial the whole mission was,"" Chazelle told BBC News last month.""What's the psychology it takes to be the individual taking those first steps? At a time when a lot of people think it will be a failure that will potentially cost your life?""I became fascinated by Neil, and in what must have been going through his head in the months and years leading up to that mission - and how superhuman it was.""The opening film at Venice normally serves as one of the earliest and most high-profile bids for awards season.Several films to have launched the festival in recent years have gone on to awards glory - such as Birdman and Black Swan.Gravity, Everest, The Reluctant Fundamentalist, The Ides of March and last year's Downsizing have also served as the opening night film.Venice's 75th annual festival begins on 29 August and runs until 8 September.It coincides with the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto Film Festival, which are also both traditionally Oscars indicators.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Roseanne Barr was the villain of the night4. Chadwick Boseman shared the spotlight with a special guest5. The message in Love, Simon triumphed	"Messages about tolerance, trolls and gun violence punctuated this year's MTV Movie & TV Awards, where sci-fi drama Stranger Things won the main prizes.The Netflix series won five categories, including best show; while Black Panther took four awards, including best film and best film performance.Tiffany Haddish hosted the event, spoofing both Black Panther and Cardi B's breakout hit Bodak Yellow.She also won the award for best comedic performance for Girls Trip.The MTV awards is renowned for its controversial moments, comedic film spoofs and star-studded guest lists and Sunday night's event was no different.Here are the five biggest moments from the evening.The host of the awards wore a series of outfits, including a replica of Meghan Markle's royal wedding dress and Audrey Hepburn's outfit from Breakfast at Tiffany's, but one of her choices seemed all too familiar.Back in July last year, she wore a white Alexander McQueen gown to the premiere of her film Girls Trip, which then reappeared when she hosted Saturday Night Live in November.During a comedy monologue on SNL, she joked about being an ""outfit repeater"", so lo and behold it not only made an appearance at this year's Oscars, but also at Sunday's awards.""Welcome back, and welcome back to my Alexander McQueen dress one more time,"" Haddish joked after coming back from an ad break.""If you don't have anything nice to say, just don't say it,"" she said.""There should be no space in this world for bullying, and I'm not going to tolerate it.""This was Millie Bobby Brown's message to bullies as she spoke via video link to accept the award for Best Performance in a TV Show, for her character Eleven in Stranger Things.It was perhaps a response to the trolling she received on Twitter, which could have been the reason she recently deleted her account on the social media platform.The cancelling of comedian Roseanne Barr's show by ABC after she made racist remarks on Twitter was mentioned by not one, but two stars at the awards.While presenting the award for best hero, Olivia Munn said she had a real life hero of her own to thank: ""That guy who fired Roseanne"".Black Panther actor Michael B. Jordan also made a comment during his acceptance speech for best villain, saying: ""I'm shocked that I won this award for best villain.""I thought for sure Roseanne had that in the bag.""While his co-star was the best villain, Chadwick Boseman accepted the award for best hero and best performance in a film for playing T'Challa in Black Panther.When he collected the award for the former, Boseman invited James Shaw Jr to the stage to thank him for protecting other restaurant-goers from a gunman who opened fire in a waffle house in Tennessee.He gave Shaw his popcorn trophy and said: ""This is gonna live at your house. God bless you, man.""Love, Simon was a surprise hit in cinemas and was credited with being the first mainstream teenage film to feature a gay lead character and was lauded for helping young people come out.Winning Best Kiss at the awards, stars Nick Robinson and Keiynan Lonsdale took to the stage to accept their statuette.Lonsdale said, ""I just want to say to every kid, you can live your dreams and wear dresses.""You can live your dreams and kiss the one that you love, no matter what gender they are. You can live your dreams and you can believe in magic. You can live your dreams and you can be yourself.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	TLC: How we made (and survived) CrazySexyCool	They started with the title and worked from thereWaterfalls changed their careerTLC knew the record would be a hitThe album received Prince's blessingTheir first magazine shoot got them in troubleThen the band held their boss hostage...Their financial troubles are over nowThey're ready to celebrate CrazySexyCool's anniversary	"Twenty-five years ago, on 15 November 1994, TLC released CrazySexyCool - a pioneering blend of rap, soul and R&B that made them the best-selling female band in US history.The title supposedly referred to the band's personalities: Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes brought the crazy, having recorded her vocals on day release from court-mandated rehab, after burning down her boyfriend's house in a jealous rage. Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins, with her no-damns-given demeanour and raspy vocals, was effortlessly cool; while Rozanda ""Chilli"" Thomas was, for the sake of this anecdote, ""the sexy one"" (she also had an incredible voice and no shortage of attitude).Propelled by the hit singles Creep and Waterfalls, it became the first album by a girl group to reach diamond status (representing 10 million sales) in the US. Globally, only the Spice Girls' Spice has sold more.To mark the record's anniversary, the band have announced a one-off show at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire next June; and Chilli jumped on the phone to the BBC to talk about the making of the album; and how they ended up filing for bankruptcy after its release.Although the song Kick Your Game incorporates the phrase ""crazy sexy cool"" in its lyrics, the album's title predates the whole project.""We went in letting producers know that this was the name - and that's how the album should sound,"" explains Chilli.""CrazySexyCool was our version of I'm Every Woman. Every woman has a crazy or a sexy or a cool side. You can be all three, but one is definitely more prominent than the other.""What's the dominant characteristic for her?""A-ha!"" she exclaims with a hearty laugh. ""It depends on the day. The crazy might be the more dominant one at times. But cool or sexy? I don't know. It just depends.""End of Youtube post by TLCVEVOTLC's signature song is a socially conscious ballad that tackles drug addiction and the HIV epidemic (making it the first number one single to mention the disease). It changed people's perception of the band, and earned them two Grammy nominations and MTV's Video of the Year award.With its intricately-woven harmonies and rubber-band bassline, the track was evidence of the band's growing confidence in the studio.""We were just beginning to understand how our vocals meshed together, with T-Boz's scratchy voice, my high notes and Lisa's rapping,"" she says.""It didn't matter what type of song it was, once our voices got on there, it became a TLC record.""And what does ""don't go chasing waterfalls"" actually mean?""Anything that's self-destructive, that's chasing a waterfall.""""Making the album was a lot of fun. We didn't feel the pressure of the second album jinx - we were just excited to be in the studio coming up with new material,"" says Chilli.""And I remember when we were done, a guy at Arista records said, 'It's a great album and you guys will probably sell a couple of million'.""We were like, 'A couple of million? We're going to sell five million. At least'.""But we weren't looking at it like, 'We think we're great'. We just knew it was special. It was one of those albums where you didn't want to skip to the next song. It's rare to have a project like that.""The song If I Was Your Girlfriend is a cover of a Prince single - originally an ode to his girlfriend Susanna Melvoin, in which he fantasised about switching genders so he could have the same emotional intimacy she shared with her best friend.TLC's version loses those psychosexual complexities, but otherwise sticks fairly closely to Prince's version. Chilli says they were careful to be respectful for one important reason: Prince wanted to hear the finished version before giving his approval.""The fact that Prince even allowed it to happen was a big deal because he never approved anybody doing covers of his songs,"" she says.""It was always, 'No, no, no,' and we felt like it'd probably still be a no for us. So when he gave us the green light we were like, 'Whaaaat?!!'""After that, all we cared about was, 'Is he going to be OK with it?' And it's so crazy because, of course, we don't sound like Prince. Tionne's scratchy voice certainly doesn't sound like his.""But he heard it and he loved it, so that's all that matters.""To announce the album's arrival, TLC gave an interview to Vibe magazine - the first time they'd met the press since Lisa Lopes torched the house of her football-playing partner Andre Rison.""I'm looking at wardrobe they'd provided and they had police uniforms and fireman uniforms,"" recalls Chilli.""Everything Lisa had done was behind me. I wasn't even thinking about it. It didn't even dawn on me that they were being a little ratchet about having that type of attire for us to choose from.""So I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, we've got to wear this fireman stuff! This is so dope!' And of course that was the cover - TLC: Burning Up The Charts and Burning Down The House!""Lisa was on probation and of course the judge saw it, so it was like we were just some little bad girls being nonchalant about this huge situation.""But I swear it didn't occur to us until the magazine hit the stands and I said, 'Oh my gosh, we're in so much trouble!'""Famously, TLC filed for bankruptcy shortly after CrazySexyCool was released. According to T-Boz, the record might have made $75m for their record company, but the bandmates were paid only $50,000 each.Frustrated with being given conflicting information about who controlled their payments, the trio decided to go straight to the top - marching into their record label and holding Clive Davis, then President of Arista Records, hostage.When the scene was recreated in a 2013 movie about their career, many fans thought it had either been exaggerated or invented.""Oh no, honey, that was not fiction at all,"" laughs Chilli. ""As a matter of fact, it was a little toned down for TV.""""We were hot [angry], because we didn't understand how we were selling all these records with nothing to show for it. So it was like, 'Alright, let's just go to the source'.""We brought along some girls Lisa met when she was in the Diversion Center. These were big girls, huge and scary, and we put two outside Clive's office and one girl inside. And unless we gave them the nod, no-one could come in or out, no matter who it was.""It was like a real movie and, looking back, I'm like, 'What were we thinking?' But we didn't have anything to lose.""After the New York Police Department intervened, the stand-off with Clive Davis ended; but the band won, and their contracts were re-negotiated (filing for bankruptcy was actually a key step towards restructuring their finances).In recent years, they've also re-recorded all their old songs, giving them ownership of the masters, and a greater share of royalties.""Now, if anyone wants to license any of those songs, they can come to us, instead of going somewhere else,"" says Chilli.End of Youtube post 2 by TLCVEVOHow the album has reached its silver anniversary is a mystery, says Chilli.""My great-grandmother used to tell me when I was little, 'When you become an adult, the years will go by super-fast'. I didn't know what she meant when I was a kid, but I get it now!""But she and T-Boz are ready to take the record back out on the road in 2020.""We have a bunch of beautiful visual surprises and we're very proud of the hard work we've put into putting the show together, so we're very anxious for you to see it,"" she says.Is it hard to perform the songs without Left Eye, who died tragically young in a car accident 17 years ago.""We felt [her absence] more obviously right after she passed, when we had to continue to work,"" says the singer. ""But over the years you heal. And I don't think you can ever heal 100%, 'cos that's our sister and we love her. But her memory lives on through us, and we don't look at it as a sad thing any more.""And what does she make of the rumours that TLC will make their Glastonbury debut next summer?""Is that what you heard? I heard that too. That's what I'm hearing,"" she giggles, slyly.""I'm hoping. Fingers crossed, toes crossed, legs crossed. Everything that it's possible to cross, it's crossed.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Grammys 2020: Snubs and surprises	"Mixed news for Taylor SwiftBillie Eilish could break one of Taylor's records...Lizzo's ""song of the year"" is two years oldThe Boss is shut outWait, how is A Star Is Born eligible again?BTS were robbed!!!!!!!Ariana Grande moves up to the big leaguesThe Beyoncé BounceRandom facts and trivia"	"Getting a Grammy nomination isn't easy. Even a low-key award like ""best jazz instrumental album"" received 302 entries.For the more coveted record of the year prize, a staggering 1,160 candidates were submitted. Members of the Recording Academy narrowed that down to eight nominees, with the likes of Taylor Swift, Lizzo and Billie Eilish all in the running.That category sets a pattern, with female artists dominating the ""big four"" awards - best new artist, song of the year, record of the year and album of the year.Lil Nas X also has a lot to celebrate - with nominations in record of the year, album of the year and best new artist.But, even with 84 categories, there's always a debate over perceived snubs. And this year is no different, with Ed Sheeran and Maren Morris shut out of the main categories.Here are some of the other notable facts, figures, stats and surprises.End of Youtube post by TaylorSwiftVEVOTaylor Swift is a darling of the Grammys, with 10 wins under her belt - including two album of the year awards. But the Academy didn't shower her last album with love. The shadowy and vengeful Reputation received a single nomination for best pop album.Swift did better this year, with four nominations - but she's still frozen out of the best album category; which she was widely predicted to walk away with.She can console herself, though, with the citation for song of the year, which recognises the craft of songwriting. Lover, the starry-eyed title track of her seventh album, is the only song in the running to be written by one person. And that's one Taylor Alison Swift.End of Youtube post by BillieEilishVEVOAt 17 years old, Billie Eilish is the youngest singer in Grammys history to receive nominations in all four of the main categories.She turns 18 next month but, even so, she stands to be the youngest-ever winner of album of the year for her snarling, macabre debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go.If she does, she steals the crown from Taylor Swift, who was just 20 when she won album of the year for her second record, Fearless, in 2010.Lizzo's breakthrough this year has been as loud and joyous as the artist herself; and the Detroit-born musician rightfully gets a nod for best new artist.More controversial is her record of the year nomination for Truth Hurts. Why? Because the salty empowerment anthem was originally released as a stand-alone single in 2017.Luckily for Lizzo, it was never submitted for a Grammy at the time; and made its first appearance on an album this year - Truth Hurts appears on the deluxe edition of Cuz I Love You, which was released in April - meaning the Academy gave it the go-ahead.Bruce Springsteen's Western Stars was met with almost universal acclaim earlier this year, with critics praising his finely-detailed storytelling and weather-beaten melodies.But the star, who has 20 Grammys to his name, was conspicuously absent from the nominations; even in the Americana categories where Western Stars would have found its natural home.His movie, Springsteen on Broadway, was also passed over for best music film.End of Youtube post by LadyGagaVEVOSparks flew as Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed Shallow at this year's Grammy ceremony - and their steamy performance was followed by an award for best pop duo/group performance.So it's a surprise to see the soundtrack for A Star Is Born nominated this year. Luckily, there's a simple explanation: Shallow came out as a single right before the end of the eligibility period for the 2019 Grammys. But the film's soundtrack was released too late to be considered.All of which means Ally and Jack could be reunited in Los Angeles next January. Fingers crossed.Well, if you believe their fans, that is.The South Korean boy-band broke all sorts of records this year, headlining two nights at Wembley Stadium, and scoring their first top 10 single with Boy With Luv.Their fiercely-dedicated fans fervently hoped that'd lead to a Grammy nomination but sadly it wasn't to be... The best pop group performance category, which was their most likely target, was dominated by collaborations like Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello's Senorita; and Lil Nas X's hook-up with Billy Ray Cyrus on the all-conquering Old Town Road.And to be fair, all of those songs made a bigger impact on the charts and the radio than anything BTS released in the last 12 months. Maybe next year, guys.Given that she's one of the biggest stars on the planet, it's shocking to consider that Ariana Grande has never been nominated for one of the Grammys' main prizes. In fact, she only won her first trophy earlier this year - picking up best pop album for Sweetener.That changes in 2020, as Thank U, Next gets a nod for album of the year; and the single 7 Rings makes the grade for record of the year.The recognition comes as Grande moves away from production-line pop to a more conversational, confessional style - with her fifth album frankly discussing the depression and anxiety she suffered after the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller.She's not the only star to get an upgrade: Lana Del Rey's sublime Laurel Canyon songbook Norman F***ing Rockwell earns her her first nomination in one of the ""big four"" categories.End of Youtube post by BeyoncéVEVOEven in a year without a ""proper"" Beyoncé album, the star picks up four nominations, for her work on Disney's The Lion King; and her triumphant concert film Homecoming.In total, she's now had 70 nominations across her career - which means she's closing in quickly on Quincy Jones, who is the all-time leader with 80.Michelle Obama picks up a nomination for the audio book of her memoir, Becoming. If she wins she'd become the second first lady to hold a Grammy. The first was Hillary Clinton, who got a trophy for It Takes a Village in 1996.Rosalíá is the first ever best new artist nominee to recognised for music recorded entirely in Spanish. The star, whose music combines elements of flamenco, reggaeton and hip-hop, featured in the BBC's Sound of 2019 at the start of the year.Sam Smith's Dancing With A Stranger was widely expected to see some action in the pop and dance categories, but fails to make the grade. The star, who won four Grammys in 2015, hasn't been nominated since.And country darling Maren Morris must be scratching her head. Last week, she won album of the year at the CMA Awards; but she only just scrapes into the Grammy shortlist, with a single nomination for her Brandi Carlile duet Common.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

In terms of Black Panther, no studio can say again, 'Oh, black movies don't travel, overseas interest will be minimal.'""Based on Disney's estimate of ticket sales, the film passed the $1bn mark on the 26th day of its release.Film information site IMDB says 32 movies have scored a box office billion, including 2012 James Bond offering Skyfall, the 2017 Beauty and the Beast reboot starring Emma Watson, and modern children's classic Frozen.Earlier this week UK figures showed Black Panther was out-selling fellow superhero outings Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, after grossing £35.4m in three weeks.Of the 18 Marvel films released to date, only two had made more money in the UK at a comparable stage - 2015's Avengers: Age Of Ultron (£40.4m) and 2012's The Avengers (£40.3m).Signs of the film's success were good from the start - Black Panther more than doubled the amount it was predicted to take in the US and Canada over its opening weekend.Last month, director Mr Coogler wrote a heartfelt letter thanking fans for their support.""I am struggling to find the words to express my gratitude at this moment."" he wrote.""Never in a million years did we imagine that you all would come out this strong.""Thank you for giving our team of filmmakers the greatest gift: The opportunity to share this film, that we poured our hearts and souls into, with you.""Patty Jenkins, the director who smashed records herself with 2017's Wonder Woman, shared her delight at Black Panther's ""incredibly meaningful success""."
entertainment	John Legend and Kelly Clarkson update Baby It's Cold Outside for #MeToo era		"US singers John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have recorded an updated version of the Christmas hit Baby, It's Cold Outside which ran into controversy with the #MeToo movement.The song, written in 1944, takes the form of a back-and-forth conversation between a man and a woman.However, last Christmas it raised questions about consent.It was suggested one line - ""Say what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)"" - could refer to date rape.In an interview with Vanity Fair, Legend said he and writer Natasha Rothwell had penned some new lyrics for the song and he had recorded it with Clarkson.He said the new version included the lines: ""What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice) / If I have one more drink? (It's your body, and your choice).""The new version will feature on Legend's seasonal album A Legendary Christmas.Last year's controversy began when the Star 102 radio station in Cleveland, Ohio, removed Baby It's Cold Outside from its playlist following complaints.Critics saw it as the story of a man pressuring a woman into spending the night with him when she doesn't want to.Station host Glenn Anderson blogged that although the song was written in a different era, the lyrics felt ""manipulative and wrong"".He said at the time: ""The world we live in is extra sensitive now, and people get easily offended, but in a world where #MeToo has finally given women the voice they deserve, the song has no place.""The song, written by Frank Loesser in 1944, was recorded for the 1949 film Neptune's Daughter and won an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1950.It has been covered by Lady Gaga, Michael Bublé, Tom Jones and Cerys Matthews, and actors Will Ferrell and Zooey Deschanel in the movie Elf."

It is directed by the star of the US version of The Office, John Krasinski, who plays a lead role alongside his real-life wife Emily Blunt.The script has very little dialogue and lots of dramatic (and quiet) tension.It has already topped the US box office, but is unlikely to be great for cinema popcorn sales, as people have been shaming other movie-goers for eating, or even breathing, too loudly during screenings.The BBC's Nick Grimshaw was one of those frustrated by nearby cinema snackers over the weekend.Here are just some of the posts on social media complaining about others crunching and munching their way through the film.Other users shared their own anxiety about chewing too loudly during the horror flick.A lot of people said the film was a unique, but positive, cinema experience and celebrated the film for using a real-life deaf actress for the daughter character.The film's creators have said they pushed for the casting choice on purpose.Actress Millicent Simmonds has been celebrated for her performance. The 14-year-old also starred in drama Wonderstruck alongside Julianne Moore.""She came to set and taught everyone sign language. It was really amazing and brought an extra depth to the film,"" said Scott Beck, co-screenwriter of A Quiet Place."

entertainment	The Razzies: Emoji Movie named worst film of 2017		"The Emoji Movie, an animated film starring James Corden and Patrick Stewart, has swept the board at Hollywood's Razzie awards, which highlight the year's worst films.It was given four Golden Raspberry titles, including worst picture, director and screenplay.In a statement, Razzies organisers branded the film a ""talking poop opus"".Tom Cruise was named worst actor for his performance in the reboot of The Mummy.The film was poorly reviewed by critics, who described it as ""empty headed"" and ""one-note"".""Cruise should have played the Mummy - that way his face would be swathed in bandages and his fans wouldn't have to see him sweat so hard,"" Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone.The worst supporting actor award was given to Mel Gibson for the comedy Daddy's Home 2.He follows in the footsteps of US President Donald Trump, who won the title in 1990 for his cameo in Ghosts Can't Do It.Tyler Perry won the worst actress award, dressed as an elderly woman in Boo 2: A Medea Halloween.He was nominated for the same award last year.Worst supporting actress was Kim Basinger for Fifty Shades Darker. The film adaptation of the erotic novel is the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey which won four Razzies in 2016.The Razzies' tongue-in-cheek awards ceremony is held in Los Angeles every year, the day before the Academy Awards.Organisers lampoon the nominees, voted for by the public, in a series of comedy sketches and show tunes.Ahead of the awards, organisers said 87 of the top-earning 100 films last year were ""sequels, remakes or rip-offs""."
entertainment	Why Marvel's Black Panther is no ordinary superhero movie		"Disclaimer: There are spoilers in this article.The Black Panther first entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2016 in Captain America: Civil War.Now he's got his own film, which goes way beyond the usual expectations of fantasy, fight scenes and romance.Having a plot based around a black superhero with a predominantly black cast is a first for Marvel, but the film builds on this concept in a massive way.Directed by Creed's Ryan Coogler, it is set in the mythical country of Wakanda: a hidden African kingdom with incredible technological power, due to its reserves of the world's most useful precious metal.Chadwick Boseman, who plays its king T'Challa and (more importantly) the Black Panther, tells the BBC that getting Wakanda right was the most important thing.""This is fantasy and we have to create a culture,"" he says. ""It's not necessarily because it's the first time we're seeing a black superhero; I think it's because we have to define what Wakanda is.""It can't be some generalised version of what the country is or the accent.""It can't be generalised in why we wear certain clothing or why we have the number of tribes we have - what are those tribes?""We have a river tribe and a border tribe for example.""This is echoed by his co-star Lupita Nyong'o, who plays Nakia in the film - his love interest and moral compass rolled into one.The Oscar-winning actress tells the BBC: ""We're in Africa and we meet an entirely new nation that the world has never been to, and it delivers on feeling like another part of the world.""This is a nation that is highly developed, and they are so because they didn't get interrupted by or assaulted by colonialism.""Boseman says both he and Coogler were concerned with how the Black Panther character would deal with conflict in the film, as his life is essentially well protected.""He has superpowers, he has a suit that's bulletproof and some nearly unstoppable soldiers around him,"" says the 41-year-old actor.""He's in a country which people don't know exists in this way, so no one can get to him. We were trying to figure out what would make this the most real.""This the essence of the film - it tussles with the dilemmas of a man who is ignorant to the suffering the rest of the world faces.It comes to a head with the introduction of the villain, Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B Jordan.Half American, half Wakandan, Erik comes to the kingdom on a mission to help oppressed Africans suffering around the world after experiencing it first hand.""The arguments of all the characters in this film are so valid, so well thought-out, and that's what creates such a unique tension,"" says Nyong'o, star of 12 Years a Slave.""The fact that in this film you meet a villain and you see where he's coming from, he's so empathetic, it can hopefully spark a really robust debate in the real world.""Nyong'o hopes that the film not only ""brings people together to experience something mythological and folkloric"" but also allows them to ""reflect on some really deep and important issues"".Her co-star Danai Gurira - who plays Wakanda's military leader Okoye - says the film also addresses the importance of having well-rounded female characters, as opposed to just ""strong"" women.It comes at a time when inspirational female superhero films are thin on the ground.Marvel's rival, DC Comics, may have brought out Wonder Woman last year, but the former's female-led Captain Marvel film is not due for release until 2019.There was also criticism of Marvel's Iron Man 3 in 2013, after it scrapped the idea of having actress Rebecca Hall play a villain.Instead it brought in a male villain, played by Guy Pearce, and reduced Hall's role to one of much less significance.Gurira says ""strong is definitely great, but it's a component - we want a fuller picture.""Its about [having] a more complex and consistently complex narrative around the female contribution to the story.""Gurira, best known for playing Michonne in The Walking Dead, says that when she writes plays, she wants to write characters ""where the actor gets a full work-out when they step into a role"".""It is about being fully human and being allowed to be a stakeholder in a narrative. It's about being allowed to be complex, to have dimension and to play a character,"" says the author of Eclipsed (2009).Nyong'o says part of Black Panther's significance comes from the way it shows how developing the harmonious world of Wakanda allows its ""citizens to realise their fullest potential"".""You see women alongside men sitting in their power and making a different to the future of their nation in a very exemplary manner,"" she continues.Black Panther is out in the UK on 13 February.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Toronto 2019: Once Were Brothers opens film festival	How prestigious is opening Toronto?'Self-mythologising'	"The Toronto International Film Festival is officially under way, with documentary film Once Were Brothers kicking off proceedings.The Canadian movie follows the career of Robbie Robertson and the creation of the roots-rock group The Band.At 26 years old, its director Daniel Roher is one of the youngest ever to have been selected to open TIFF.Robertson told reporters on Thursday he had a ""gut feeling"" Roher was the right person to direct, despite his age.""In so many creative endeavours, you think 'this is taking a shot, taking a risk', but something tells you, 'go forward'... It's quite mysterious in a way, what trust you can have,"" he said.""And I said to him, by the way, how old are you? And he said 24 [Roher's age when production began], and I was 24 when I made Music From Big Pink with the band, and it just rang a bell, and I thought, let's give it a shot.""Robertson served as both lead guitarist and primary songwriter of The Band, who had a string of hits across the 1960s and 70s. He was born in Toronto, making it a fitting film to open the festival.At Thursday's news conference, Mayor John Tory presented Robertson with a Key to the City, a prestigious award that honours outstanding civic contributions of its Torontonian recipients.There's no doubt that it's an honour to open TIFF, but the opening film is generally of less significance than the winner of the People's Choice Award, which comes at the end of the festival.While the audience prize winner is a better indicator of success later in the awards season (Green Book went on to win the Oscar for best picture after its triumph at TIFF last year), the opening film can often be a little more obscure.""In one way, Once Were Brothers is an odd choice to serve as the opening-night film at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival,"" wrote Steve Pond in The Wrap. in one of the movie's first reviews.""At a festival chock-full of major awards contenders with big movie stars, it's a documentary about a musician whose music is mostly heard on the occasional oldies station or Americana Spotify channel, by a director with only one previous feature on his resume.""So is Once Were Brothers any good? Well, if you're a fan of The Band and have followed the career of Robbie Robertson, the answer is absolutely yes.But, unless you're particularly keen on beards and black-and-white photos, there's arguably less on offer here for the casual viewer.""Beyond TIFF, where the opening-night audience members of a certain age will eagerly soak up all those late '60s/early '70s vibes, the market would seem to be less assured,"" suggested Michael Rechtshaffen in The Hollywood Reporter.It was announced at the press conference, however, that the film had already secured an international release thanks to distributor Magnolia Pictures.Successful music documentaries in recent years include Searching For Sugar Man, the story of how US musician Sixto Rodriguez became extremely famous in South Africa without him knowing, and 20 Feet From Stardom, which told the stories of backing singers in the music industry.But unlike those films, which had more mainstream appeal, Once Were Brothers ideally requires a background knowledge of The Band's work to be fully appreciated.The first reviews of the film have been broadly positive - but many critics have highlighted the self-indulgent nature of the film and a lack of journalistic rigour - a result of the chosen contributors.Writing in IndieWire, Kate Erbland said: ""Without a more well-rounded selection of voices (everyone onscreen agrees Robertson is a genius, a visionary, the undisputed leader of the group even decades on) or a more critical-minded director to give the film perspective, Robertson is free to obscure the bigger questions and deeper meanings, opting for self-mythologising over self-reflection.""Part of this is due to Robertson being one of two surviving members of the five-piece. The other, Garth Hudson, features far less in the documentary than Robertson.""Director Daniel Roher's job here is to faithfully represent his subject and gather the voices who confirm his recollections - and to put some amazing vintage black-and-white photographs on screen,"" said Variety's Chris Willman.Speaking at the press conference, director Roher praised the executive producers on the film, including veteran directors Martin Scorcese and Ron Howard, for their support in making it.""What was unique about this project is that it was a very archive heavy documentary,"" said director Roher. ""I have this legendary team surrounding me, and I really only felt empowered.""Editorially I had a pretty clear sense of what I wanted this film to look like. [Robertson's] memoir reads like a piece of cinema and I wanted to tap into that.""Speaking about opening the festival, he added: ""TIFF is the biggest event in Canadian cinema... I never dreamed this was possible. A Canadian documentary has never opened TIFF before.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Vicky Krieps on why Phantom Thread is a feminist movie		"Phantom Thread's Oscar nominations rather took Vicky Krieps by surprise.Not because the Luxembourg-born actress was expecting it to be ignored, but she had completely forgotten the nominations were even happening.""I was doing press work in Berlin, and the journalists asked if I was nervous, and I said, 'Eh?'"" she laughs, recalling the day the nominations were announced.""Because I've been travelling so much, when I get home, I really try to just be home, with my kids, my book, my neighbours and my grocery store, I just try to forget about everything and switch off.""And I completely forgot. I didn't know it was that day, so the interviews were going on all day, and at one point a woman opened the door and said 'So congratulations you have six nominations' - and I was very happy.""Those nominations include best picture, best director for Paul Thomas Anderson and best supporting actress for Krieps's co-star Lesley Manville.Naturally, Daniel Day-Lewis also received a best actor nod for his role as dressmaker Reynolds Woodcock - said to be the 60-year-old's last before he retires from acting.But what a way to go out.The film, set in a fashion house in the 1950s, follows Woodcock as he designs dresses for movie stars, royalty and socialites.Early in the film, we see him meet a young woman (Alma, played by Krieps) who becomes his muse. Together, they quickly develop a complicated relationship.The film was described by the BBC's Caryn James as a ""brilliantly nuanced, psychologically complex story about obsession, love, control and surrender"".Although it's not always clear who is controlling whom.Of the film's heightened emotional atmosphere, Krieps says: ""Every scene you see which was very intense, felt like that [to film].""The fashion show scene looks fun but it was intense for me, I wanted Alma to not be too perfect, so I didn't want to prepare, so I only allowed myself to prepare one or two days before.""So I was very afraid that it wouldn't be enough, that I would fall over the dress or the shoes. I'm not a model or anything, I'm really more the opposite.""One of Phantom Thread's key strengths is its subtlety. A thousand words are conveyed in a single glance. The emotional undercurrent of Reynolds and Alma's relationship is palpable in every scene.The result is a quiet and somewhat understated film where several of the scenes have minimal dialogue, but - Krieps points out - despite the age of instant gratification, audiences still have an appetite for nuance.""If you don't allow people to learn, and experience a pause, they won't know what it is. They will think they need something going on all the time,"" she says, clicking her fingers.""But you need to give them, especially young people, the chance to experience the feeling of a pause. The feeling of silence. How does it feel?""I think they forgot because they have earphones and they have this and they have that. And that's all good with me, but you shouldn't forget about..."" she whispers the next word: ""Silence.""The film has sparked a debate about toxic masculinity, with some reviewers suggesting Alma and Reynolds have an abusive relationship.But Krieps says she ""absolutely"" considers Phantom Thread a feminist movie.""It's interesting, because there were women saying it was 'frauenfeindlich' [a German word for misogynistic], which I find so funny because to me it's just absolutely not, it's the opposite.""It's just very honest and therefore stronger, because Alma is not being a feminist by banging the drum.""She is playing a drum which is the drum of the heart. It's much more difficult to see but it's much stronger. So she's just very honest and close to her own feelings and own beliefs, which makes her stronger, and a real feminist, because she's not doing it for the approval, she's not doing it so that someone goes and says 'Oh well that's a feminist'. She's doing it out of her own emotion.""The intricate designs of the dresses, and Reynolds's sewing of them, could arguably be seen as a metaphor for his control of the women around him. It's his way of having power over his subjects and lovers.""How I explain it is that, his first dress was for his mother, which was to get close to someone he might not have been able to be close to, and yet he loved,"" Krieps explains.""And so to decide to put clothes on people to be close to them, but also control them, and control his own feelings.""One of the first things Alma is doing is to get out of this control. She just does her own thing and goes her own way.""The role has drawn a lot of attention to Krieps - who has previously starred in A Most Wanted Man and Hanna, but was relatively unknown to audiences before now.Many film-goers who have seen Phantom Thread struggled at first to place her accent.""The thing is they never know where I'm from, I love that. So it's like I'm from nowhere. Because the Luxembourg accent cannot be recognised,"" she says.""It's a mix of German, French, Belgian and something else. But I love accents.""I was told at the beginning of my career to get rid of my accent, and stubborn as I am, I said 'No, I don't want to because this is me,' and I'm very happy I didn't.""Phantom Thread opens in the UK on 2 February 2018.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

We want to see that reflected in the programme,"" she said.Tuttle acknowledged the whole industry does need to do more, particularly with its most high profile releases.""When you look at films that are probably going to be competing in that major awards season space, [there are] still very few films by female filmmakers,"" she said.""And I think this is down to the glass ceiling for female filmmakers not being funded at the same level male film makers are being invested in.""Among the films directed by female film makers being screened at this year's LFF are Mirrah Foulkes's live action recreation of the famous puppet show Judy & Punch, Sarah Gavron's London-based teen drama Rocks about a young girl facing tough challenges in her home life, and Marielle Heller's A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood starring Tom Hanks and Matthew Rhys.Heller's previous film Can You Ever Forgive Me? played at 2018's festival.Other potential highlights include Our Ladies, the big screen version of Alan Warner's riotous novel about a group of schoolgirls competing in a choir competition. The story has previously been adapted for stage in the Olivier award-winning Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour.The London Film Festival runs between Wednesday 2 October and Sunday 13th October."

But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility. That's why we're calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.""The letter asked the studio to lobby for gun reform, help fund survivor funds and gun violence intervention schemes, and end political contributions to candidates who take money from the National Rifle Association.In its response, the studio said it has ""a long history of donating to victims of violence"", including the 2012 cinema shooting in Aurora, Colorado.It added: ""Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.""Joker, which is released in the US on 4 October, has received rave reviews and has been tipped for Oscar nominations, but is also stirring controversy for its portrayals of mental illness and violence. It shows the origin story of Batman's nemesis.Time magazine's Stephanie Zacharek said it was guilty of ""aggressive and possibly irresponsible idiocy"", while Variety's reviewer Owen Gleiberman said the film ""does something that flirts with danger - it gives evil a clown-mask makeover, turning it into the sickest possible form of cool"".IndieWire's critic David Ehrlich wrote that there were ""moments of shocking violence"", and that the ""story can't help but feel aspirational"".Phoenix, who plays the title role, left an interview with the Telegraph when he was asked if he was worried that the film might end up inspiring the kind of people it's about, with potentially tragic results. He later returned, explaining that he was thrown because the question hadn't crossed his mind.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

The lorry was found at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex and police said 38 adults and one teenager were pronounced dead at the scene.This is far from the first time a TV network or film studio has pulled the broadcast or release of certain projects after a real-life tragedy has hit the headlines.A movie or TV series which unintentionally reflects a recent horrific event can feel insensitive or distasteful - and they often end up being reshot or rescheduled as a result.In August, Universal Pictures cancelled the release of horror movie The Hunt, which was set to star double Oscar winner Hilary Swank and Glow's Betty Gilpin.The satirical and gory film told the story of liberals who hunt Trump supporters and kill them for sport, a storyline intended to reflect the divided nature of politics at the moment.But after the shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, the trailers were taken off air - including one which opened with the sound resembling an emergency broadcast signal - before the film was pulled altogether.A statement from Universal at the time said: ""We stand by our filmmakers and will continue to distribute films in partnership with bold and visionary creators, like those associated with this satirical social thriller, but we understand that now is not the right time to release this film.""Other films to have been affected by real-life tragedies include Bastille Day, which starred Idris Elba.But the film, which was about civilians killed by a bomb explosion in Paris, was pulled from cinemas in France the day after it was released because of the 2016 terror attack in Nice.StudioCanal stopped adverts for the film immediately after the attack and soon cancelled its release altogether, commenting that it was ""not in line with the national mood"".""Studios, like many major corporations, are risk averse,"" says Andreas Wiseman, international editor at Deadline.""The performance over its opening weekend can often make or break a film, so distributors spend a long time strategising over an optimum release date.""If there is a chance a social or political context might turn media or audiences against a film, studios will reroute.""The studio's request to pull Bastille Day out of French cinemas was supported by the film's lead actor. Elba told The Sun that the producers probably thought the film was ""insensitive"" and did not ""feel right to have out there"".Yet some French film fans were disappointed with the studio's decision. One told Reuters he ""didn't make the connection with Nice"".""There are so many differences,"" said the cinemagoer. ""I think it's a coincidence and I find it a shame for the people who made the film.""Producing a film or TV series is a long and laborious process - the whole operation can often take years.So when a project is thrown into uncertainty as a result of reality, studios often try to just delay (rather than cancel) its release.In 2017, a remake of Death Wish was pushed back by several months after a mass shooting in Las Vegas.And TV series Shooter - a drama about a sniper - was postponed after unrest prompted by the shooting of black men by police.USA Network initially delayed the show's debut by a week - and ""after further consideration"", it was subsequently postponed until the autumn.Paris-based film journalist Lisa Nesselson, who saw Bastille Day in a French cinema after the Nice attack, says she is unsure whether TV networks and film studios should react in the same way.""I don't know if films are delayed or pulled out of respect for terror victims, or because it's assumed that nobody will be in the mood to see that topic or a little of both,"" she says.""I might be in favour of changing television programming in deference to a violent national event,"" she continues.""But I find it much harder to grasp why a movie that requires an individual to make the decision to pay to get in should be punished for being about the 'wrong' thing at a particular moment in time.""Perhaps the biggest single event of recent times to affect the film and TV industry was the 9/11 attack in 2001.A scene in Spider-Man featuring the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center was deleted from the film and the trailers in light of the sombre national mood, and the location was also edited out of Men In Black II and Zoolander.Friends - one of the most successful TV sitcoms of all time - cut an entire storyline from one episode which saw Chandler detained at an airport after making a joke about a bomb.It was replaced by a new storyline involving Monica and Chandler, and the already-filmed footage was only released years later as part of a box set.In the UK, one of the longest delays to a major film came in 2007 when Gone Baby Gone was due to be released.It came out in the US in October and was set for a UK release in December - but was halted by the disappearance of Madeleine McCann as the producers felt the plot, which dealt with a young girl going missing, was distasteful.Wiseman says that while audiences like to identify with characters and storylines, a story which appears to reflect a real-life horror can be difficult to watch.""Hollywood studios want and need audience identification in their films, but too much identification can become uncomfortable for some unsuspecting viewers who find material too close to real-life tragedy.""He adds that once promotion has begun, films can be more difficult to change or postpone than TV shows.""Delays can be very costly, especially if they happen after advertising has already been booked and campaigns are under way.""If a campaign is fragmented or becomes confused in its timing, then audiences are likely to find something else to watch.""However, he says it ""can work both ways"".""While many films about terrorism were shelved around 9/11, a whimsical and sweet film like Amelie unexpectedly took off in the US and in many other countries [because] audiences wanted a joyful escape.""Earlier versions of this article have previously appeared on the BBC News website.Follow us on Facebook and on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Women confront Harvey Weinstein at New York event		"Several women were booed or asked to leave as they confronted Harvey Weinstein at an event in New York on Wednesday.The movie mogul was in the audience at a showcase for emerging talent when comedian Kelly Bachman criticised him on stage.Weinstein has been accused of several counts of sexual assault, which he denies.Bachman referred to him as ""the elephant in the room"" and ""Freddy Krueger"" as she spoke at the event.His representative said the behaviour of the women was ""rude"" and ""uncalled for"".""I didn't know we had to bring our own Mace and rape whistles to Actor's Hour,"" Bachman is seen saying in video footage posted on Instagram.She was booed and told to be quiet by members of the audience, to which she replied: ""Sorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors.""However, some members of the audience then cheered and applauded her.After the event, Bachman told the Guardian she ""felt like the air was sucked out of the room"" when she spoke about Weinstein on stage.Fellow comedian Amber Rollo and actress Zoe Stuckles reportedly approached Weinstein's table at the interval of the event in the city's Lower East Side.""Nobody's gonna say anything?"" Stuckles shouted in the direction of the filmmaker - who was sitting with two bodyguards - before both she and Rollo were asked to leave.Footage of the exchange was later posted on Facebook and reproduced by The Guardian.Rollo tweeted afterwards that she had called him ""a monster"" and told him he should ""disappear"".Weinstein has made few few public appearances since widespread allegations of sexual assault were made against him, prompting the rise of the #MeToo movement.In a statement, the producer's publicist Juda Engelmayer said: ""Harvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down.""This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.""The 67-year-old is currently on bail and due to stand trial in New York in January over rape allegations.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	The Emoji Movie gets thumbs down from critics	Charles Bramesco - The GuardianKatie Walsh - Los Angeles TimesGlenn Kenny - The New York TimesJohn DeFore - The Hollywood ReporterTim Grierson - Screen DailyAlonso Durade - The WrapDavid Erlich - Indiewire	"The reviews are in - and it's not looking great for The Emoji Movie, despite it starring the likes of James Corden and Patrick Stewart.Film review website Rotten Tomatoes, which collates reviews, currently has the movie on a 0% rating.Which means not one of the 23 critics whose reviews are on the site so far have given the film the thumbs up.The film invites viewers inside a smartphone, where an emoji called Gene has a glitch which allows him to use expressions other than his ""meh"" face.But when Gene comes under threat of deletion, he goes in search of a hacker who can reprogramme him and eliminate his unwanted facial expressions.Here's a rundown of the reaction to the film, due for release in the UK on 4 August.The most disturbing part of this toxic film is the way it infects audiences with its ugly cynicism. A viewer leaves The Emoji Movie a colder person, not only angry at the film for being unconscionably bad, but resentful of it for making them feel angry. A critic can accept the truth that art and commerce will spend eternity locked in opposition. Nevertheless it's still startling to see art that cheers commerce on while being stamped in the face by its boots.Read the full review here.The Emoji Movie isn't terrible, it isn't offensive or outright bad. It just is, and there could be far worse ways to spend 86 minutes. But maybe, just maybe, it'd be the better choice to spend those 86 minutes outside, or reading a book, or talking face-to-face with another human being. Because The Emoji Movie could not be more meh.Read the full review here.This movie's ""believe in yourself"" message is borne out, in a perverse way, by the very fact that it even exists. And yet the whole thing remains nakedly idiotic. To add to the pain and despair of the experience, The Emoji Movie is preceded by a short, Puppy, featuring the characters from the Hotel Transylvania animated movies. It is also idiotic.Read the full review here.Given the right combination of inspiration, intelligence and gifted artists, any dumb thing can be turned into an enjoyable film. But Tony Leondis' The Emoji Movie, a very, very dumb thing, comes nowhere near that magic combination. It is fast and colourful enough to attract young kids, but offers nearly nothing to their parents. If only this smartphone-centric dud, so happy to hawk real-world apps to its audience, could have done the same in its release strategy - coming out via Snapchat, where it would vanish shortly after arrival. But even that wouldn't be fast enough.Read the full review here.A film as mindless and disposable as most smartphone apps — and nowhere near as addictive — Sony's animated The Emoji Movie is a calamitous comedy that inadvertently shows how difficult it is to pull off the witty, imaginative world-building that Pixar makes seem so breezy. Despite wanly espousing the importance of individuality, this anonymous product couldn't feel more strained or cautious, playing down to its childhood audience while offering plenty of screen time to the myriad brands featured in this movie-length advertisement.Read the full review here.It is a soul-crushing disaster because it lacks humour, wit, ideas, visual style, compelling performances, a point of view or any other distinguishing characteristic that would make it anything but a complete waste of your time, not to mention that of the diligent animators who brought this catastrophe into being.Read the full review here.Once upon a time, something like The Emoji Movie would be regarded as a dire commentary on the culture that produced it. These days, the culture so consistently comments upon itself that something like The Emoji Movie just makes you wonder what's left to be said. Yes, this is ugly swill that will make parents daydream about going back to work, but at least the poop emoji is wearing a bowtie. At least he's a good dad (yes, the poop emoji has a son). At least he knows that he stinks.Read the full review here.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	How Brittany Runs A Marathon makes strides for body positivity		"In an era of body positivity, the film Brittany Runs A Marathon would, on paper, seem completely off message.Stripped back, it's a story of a plus-sized, shambolic young woman, who embarks on an extreme health kick, loses a shed load of weight and finally finds happiness in her new self.Add that it's a comedy, when body image can for many people - especially women - be no laughing matter, and you could think the director had scored a massive own goal.But appearances are deceptive.Using them as a barometer to judge others and yourself is wrong-footed. And on full examination, it's this that lies at the heart of the tale.Brittany, played by comedy actress Jillian Bell, is in free fall. Once full of promise, she's now lost in low self-esteem and self-neglect. She succumbs to the ""fat sidekick"" stereotype, especially with her manipulative, narcissistic flatmate Gretchen. And to men, she's easy prey for instant sexual gratification.It's a visit to the doctor that brings a bitter prescription for Brittany: Shake up and shape up or risk serious consequences.""She's raw, funny, but troubled,"" Bell tells BBC News. ""Many of her struggles are the same as I've been through. I had messed up ideas about weight loss and how I would be treated.""Here, it's about putting yourself first. That beauty comes in all body types. Often in transformation films, a woman loses weight and life is perfect. But there's real emotional struggle in finding out how to set your own values.""Brittany wakes from her stupor, turning to running as her solution - with the ultimate goal of the New York marathon.Yet, like that epic feat, her journey is riddled with potholes, the deepest being the increasing obsession with her weight loss and how society treats her more kindly as a result.Finding an equilibrium and learning to like herself on her own terms, at whatever weight, then becomes as important as the marathon - and a marathon in itself.Most reviewers have praised the film, including Rolling Stones' Peter Travers who describes it as ""a fun ride, spiked with touching gravity… When you cheer at the end - and you will - the laughs and tears feel honest and richly earned"".He described Bell, who has previously appeared in 22 Jump Street, as a ""comic force of nature"".To understand her character's trials fully, Bell lost 29lbs before filming and another 11 during. She also took up running.Her regime was, like Brittany's, strict, ""exhilarating and very lonely. I was not having much of a social life. It was sort of all consuming,"" she says.Psychology professor Kerstin Blomquist approves of the film's message but calls out Brittany's extreme diet. ""Brittany stops eating foods she likes or she eats only lettuce for lunch… These are not the messages we want to send. Eating pizza or ice cream is not bad,"" she says.Bell recalls how even when filming had wrapped, she still felt the the scrutiny of a judgemental society.""I had people say things that, if I hadn't been in a better headspace then, would have been more damaging. A close guy friend said that [thinner] was the way I should be.""And someone in the industry said, 'I hope you're getting laid right now with the body you have'. It's terrible to equate happiness and my sexual life to weight.""Director Paul Downs Colaizzo says he always intended to use prosthetics, whatever Bell's shape, to show Brittany's weight loss. (And it's what happened anyway.)""It would have been weird for a male director to be like, 'Hey, we're doing this movie about women's bodies, can you lose 40 lbs?' I was going to have our character be wherever Jillian was as a human.""We didn't want to give any view point on weight, the focus was empowerment and personal triumph and to lean into the uncomfortable truth that the world treats you differently based on how you look. Is it a body positive film? I'd call it a life positive film.""The story is based on the real experiences of Colaizzo's friend Brittany O'Neill. She had a good job yet her personal life was going south. But she pulled off a ""triumph of personal change"" and going for her first run was the catalyst.If Colaizzo chose to make a comedy from some pretty serious issues it was largely down to the real Brittany, who is ""just the funniest person I've ever met"", he explains.And if his screen Brittany is overweight, again it's because she's inspired by the real life version. But there was also the deeper intention of turning stereotypes on their head.""There's this archetype of the funny fat comic relief. Brittany feels like she has to fill that role. Humour is a great tool for deflection. We're asking audiences not to objectify. I wanted to show the pain and pathos and that she no longer wants to be that person, but in a way that's still funny,"" says Colaizzo.In fact, a number of the characters are not quite what they seem. They include Brittany's new running friend, the previously loathed ""sorted"" neighbour Catherine who has hidden trauma.While the nightmare (now former) flatmate is revealed as just as big a bag of insecurity as Brittany.""You have to weed out those people who are not making you feel good and are depleting your energy,"" muses Bell.But as Brittany's state of mind deteriorates, she pushes away those who are truly trying to help. And, as many will have experienced, she has to hit rock bottom to be jolted back up by a second life-changing wake-up call.Some commentators have expressed disquiet over the film's handling of Brittany's mental decline. Writing in the New York Times, Teo Bugbe acknowledges the film's focus on health not shape, but adds ""there's no suggestion that her mental health might benefit from the same attention given to her physical health"".Bell says the message is definitely there, increasing in strength over the course of film, in direct correlation with the confusion in Brittany's head.""It's a layered thing but it hits home in what has been the hardest thing I've ever had to shoot,"" she says of the pivotal ""wake-up"" moment when Brittany herself suddenly becomes a ""fat shamer"".""You're being asked to feel for the woman who becomes the victim of Brittany's wrath but also feel for her who is in so much pain.""She's worked on her outside but not her head. She realises she's been going about things the wrong way. It's a coming of age story - taking responsibility for herself,"" says Bell.Bell says ultimately making the movie has amounted to much more than a career move.""When I finished I thought, 'Okay, I did that for Brittany and now I want to do things for myself'. I ended up cutting my hair really short and I gained about 20 lbs and I thought, 'I like this; this is where I feel more myself. I had a deep look at how I was treating myself and how I want to be better and kinder.""She launched the hashtag #IGotALottaBodies, asking people to celebrate their bodies along with her, and posted Instagram pictures of herself at various sizes.She still has moments of acute anxiety, ""feeling like I'm falling out of nowhere"", but knows to talk it through with someone she trusts.""You have to replant the seeds that society has been telling women for years about beauty and body type,"" she says.""Your weight can't be the most interesting thing about you and there are more important things you can be doing with your life."""
entertainment	Morrissey movie director: 'We don't want to upset him'		"As subjects for music biopics go, there can be few trickier than Morrissey, the idolised, enigmatic, prickly former frontman of The Smiths. However, that reputation did not deter an Oscar-nominated film-maker who grew up down the road from the singer.Morrissey has a funny place in British culture - he's an aloof national treasure whose melodramatic croon and pithy pop poetry are burned into the hearts of millions, yet whose hallowed status has been somewhat eroded in recent years thanks to his outspoken online rants.Despite all that, there are plenty of people who are wary of an attempt to tell his story in fictionalised form, who are fiercely protective of him and his band, and who see it as sacred ground.""I just have to ignore them,"" says Mark Gill, who has directed and co-written England Is Mine, the movie about the singer's pre-fame years.Gill grew up less than a mile from Morrissey's house in Stretford, Manchester, and, like countless other 1980s music fans, was ""obsessed"" with The Smiths. So he was desperate to be the one to tell Morrissey's story.""I wanted to make this film and I was determined that if anyone was going to cock it up, it would be me.""England Is Mine follows Morrissey from moping mop-topped teenager to bequiffed budding idol. It ends when he meets future bandmate Johnny Marr.The consensus seems to be that Gill hasn't cocked it up, while the director says he thinks he has created ""something really special"".Gill became a fan of The Smiths after being given their first LP at the age of 15. But his dad wouldn't let his teenage son travel into Manchester to see them live before they split up in 1987.""My dad loathes The Smiths,"" he says. ""He absolutely cannot stand them. He used to come in and say, 'Turn that off.'""So what does Mr Gill senior make of the fact his son has directed his debut feature film about them?""Who knows what he thinks. He probably thinks, when am I going to stop with this band?""The release of England Is Mine comes three years after Gill and producing partner Baldwin Li were nominated for an Oscar for best live action short.Gill says he and England Is Mine co-writer William Thacker tried to strip away the persona that Morrissey has created since finding fame.""We wanted to make him just a very human character,"" the director says. ""I kept saying we weren't making a film about Morrissey.""It was about this young kid, and despite the fact he goes on to be somebody of great importance artistically, he did start out as a normal teenage kid going through the same sort of stuff that the rest of us have gone through.""In a sense it relieved us all of that pressure of making a film about an icon, because we weren't. He goes on to do that. To me, the more interesting thing was the journey towards that.""I grew up in Stretford in the '80s and it wasn't a ghetto by any stretch of the imagination, but if you were slightly different, the pack closes in on you.""And Morrissey was very different, 10 years previously. So I often think, how did he survive?""Steven Patrick Morrissey is played by Jack Lowden, who can also be seen currently in a very different role - that of a World War II Spitfire pilot in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk.At 27, Lowden was born three years after The Smiths split up and was not a particular fan before he landed this role.""Obviously I knew of him and I knew the reputation he had of being quite morose,"" Lowden says. ""And the script was so funny for me that I thought, we have to go for this.""It was ""freeing"" to think only about those early years and not the singer's later image, the actor says.""You cannot play a guy in the early part of his life if you're constantly aware of what he went on to become. And I think it did help that I was a Smiths virgin.""Gill says he has not been in touch with the real Morrissey directly, but that the film-makers have ""done everything we can to be respectful"".He says: ""We don't want to upset him. And you'll see it's not that type of film.""In recent years, Morrissey's most prominent forays into the public eye have been in the form of outspoken interviews and blogs.As well as his zealous protection of animal rights - his favourite subject - he also raised eyebrows with comments about politics, the royal family, the media and Islam.To some his candid views are refreshing. Others find him increasingly unsavoury.""You can separate the person from the art I think,"" Gill says when asked what he thinks of Morrissey now. ""He says some things which you just laugh out loud at and there are other things I don't agree with, but that's the same with anybody.""But one thing I do like about him is that he is one of the only artists who has consistently remained authentic. I don't see any difference between some of the things he says now and some of the things he said in The Smiths.""His views may have hardened or softened in certain directions, but nowadays it's incredibly rare for somebody like that to speak his mind. Who else does that? Nobody.""So what if Morrissey launches one of his famous tirades against this new film and its makers?""I'll frame it,"" Gill replies with a smile. ""Nothing's going to change - the film's coming out.""It would have been nice to have a conversation directly to say, 'This is what I'm doing. Trust me.'""England Is Mine is out in the UK on 4 August.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Prince's memoir: Seven things we learned	1) Prince was not a fan of Ed Sheeran2) He was a fan of Kung Fu Panda 33) He hoped his autobiography could 'solve racism'4) The young singer learnt the facts of life from an R-rated movie5) He had his first kiss playing happy families6) Prince was working on the book four days before he died7) The Beautiful Ones was to be the first in a series of books	"""Yesterday I tried to write a novel, but I didn't know where to begin,"" sang Prince in his 1982 song Moonbeam Levels.More than three decades later, in 2016, he announced he had started to write his autobiography.The purple prose was never finished.On the 21 April that year he died aged 57, three months into the project, having hand-written 28 pages about his childhood, using his trademark abbreviated spellings, U, R, 2, 4 and ""eye"" for I.""The book coincided with an inward turn in what he was experiencing, in what would turn out to be his final years,"" says Dan Piepenbring, 33, the writer Prince chose to collaborate with on his memoir The Beautiful Ones, named after his track on the Purple Rain album.""I think for the first time he was aware of his legacy, aware of that he had power to shape the narrative around him. And maybe he was coming to be more aware of his mortality,"" Piepenbring tells the BBC.After Prince's death, his estate contacted Piepenbring, asking if there was a way he could turn what had been written into a book and offering access to the archive at Prince's Paisley Park HQ.Using photographs, family memorabilia and writing his own introduction to explain the context of Prince's pages, The Beautiful Ones is the closest there will ever be to a Prince autobiography.Here are seven (that most Prince of numbers) things we have learnt about the pop star from the book about him:In a section on his worries about the future of radio, Prince complains: ""They keep trying to ram Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran down our throats and we don't like it no matter how many times they play it.""So what was his problem with Ed?Piepenbring admits: ""To be honest I was so much in agreement with him on that subject that there didn't seem to be any more to say about it at the time. More than a grudge with a few artists in particular, what he was bemoaning was a culture that simply doesn't allow artists to colour outside the lines.""Prince often hired out his local cinema in Minneapolis, late at night and invited friends and bandmates to private screenings. Dan was there for one such outing. Prince's choice of film? Kung Fu Panda 3.""He had his assistant bring him some popcorn,"" Piepenbring recalls. ""He sat alone in the back row, but I remember hearing him laugh a few times. Right when the credits rolled he got up and skipped down the stairs. He was wearing these light-up sneakers. He was so childlike in that moment. I know he also liked Finding Nemo. He enjoyed these fairy tales.""The book also reveals Prince as a fan of the Richard Curtis's 2013 time-travelling tearjerker, About Time, particularly the scene where Rachel McAdams meets her love interest in a sensory deprivation diner. ""Imagine that meal"" writes Prince.Imagine Prince watching About Time.Prince believed that his book could be powerful. Very powerful.""In one way he wanted it to be an autobiography, a fairly straightforward story about his life, his childhood and especially his parents,"" Piepenbring says.""But he also saw the book as a way to extend the activism that he had begun, especially his work with Black Lives matter. 'Could it solve racism?' That really stopped me in my tracks.""To sit in a room with him and lock eyes with him and to hear him utter that question. Something that feels impossible in any other context, in that context suddenly feels natural, and makes you bristle with excitement.""Prince was never directly told about the birds and the bees. His stepfather saved himself from having ""The Talk"" by taking him and a couple of his friends to what he described as ""a raggedy R-rated [age-restricted] drive-in movie"".Prince concluded that this was not the best way to learn about sex. His preferred method? ""Having the Song of Solomon read & discussed with U by someone who loves U."" The Bible wins out in Prince's mind.Piepenbring was relieved at Prince's willingness to write about his sexuality, saying: ""I had worried, given his aversion to his racier songs - he no longer played Darling Nikki or Head, or any of those. I feared that the book's pages might shy away from his sexuality, but it was all there - very humorously, cheekily rendered.""It is perhaps not surprising that Prince developed an interest in girls at a very young age.In a chapter called Kiss he details how a girl called Laura ""who was only five or six"" enlisted him for a game of House, saying: ""We weren't the 1st interracial couple in Minneapolis, but we were no doubt the youngest"".He was kissed three times during the game, once on the way to ""work"", once when he returned and ""one b4 U went to sleep that night"". Each kiss lasted less than three seconds, but meant ""everything to him"".On the 15 April 2016 Prince's private jet made an emergency landing and he was hospitalised. That week he called Piepenbring to let him know that he wanted to continue with the book.""When my phone lit up with a Minneapolis area code I was overjoyed. I was so relieved to hear that he was alright and he wanted to tell me he was still thinking actively about the memoir.""He went into the thoughts he was having about his parents and said that one of his life's central dilemmas was figuring out what they meant to him and how he was living out their lives with his own.""He said he was going to stop touring and would really get down to business. I came away from that call with a tremendous optimism. Of course, it wasn't to be"".The memoir was not going to be a one-off.""This book, to his mind was going to be the first of many,"" explains the author.""And for the rest of my life I'm going to be wondering what else there was to say, and what form the book could have taken if he'd lived. There's definitely a sadness and a sense of wonder in everything he didn't get to say"".The Beautiful Ones by Dan Piepenbring is published on 29 OctoberFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Angelina Jolie: Strong women are 'shaped by men around them'	'How to use that power'	"Angelina Jolie has championed the role men can play in shaping the personalities of young girls.The actress, who stars in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, also said female characters in films should not have to be portrayed as physically tough in order to be considered strong.""I think that, so often, when a story's told which says 'this is a strong woman', she has to beat the man, or she has to be like the man, or she has to somehow not need the man,"" Jolie told journalists at the film's launch.Referring to her own character in the film and Princess Aurora, played by Elle Fanning, Jolie said: ""We both very much need and love and learn from the men.""And so I think that's also an important message for young girls, to find their own power, but to respect and learn from the men around them.""She added: ""We have strong women, but the character that is wrong in the film and has to be taken out is also a woman. We show very diverse types of women between our characters, but also we have extraordinary men in the film, and I really want to press that point.""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the sequel to 2014's Maleficent, is released in the UK later this month and also stars Ed Skrein, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michelle Pfeiffer.Fanning, who reprises her role of Princess Aurora in the film, echoed Jolie's comments and said her character's strength is not necessarily physical, unlike many princesses in children's films.""Aurora's strength is her kindness, and she stays very true to herself, which is something I wanted to keep in the film. She is soft and feminine and wants to be a wife and have babies, and that's a beautiful, strong thing that isn't portrayed a lot on screen.""A lot of the princesses are like 'we're gonna make her a strong princess! And make her tough, so we're gonna make her fight!' And it's like, is that what being a strong woman means? Like, we just have to have a sword and have armour on and go fight? Aurora can do that in a different way, in a pink dress, and it's beautiful that she keeps her softness and vulnerabilities.""Many of the female leads in action or children's films focus on the character's physical strength. Wonder Woman, for example, or Merida in the Disney's 2012 film Brave. Indeed, one of Jolie's previous roles was playing action hero Lara Croft in Tomb Raider.Explaining the premise of the Maleficent sequel, Fanning said: ""Five years have passed in her life, and she's now Queen of the Moors, and she has this new responsibility, and she's trying to figure out who she is as a ruler and how to use that power.""The movie's plot sees Jolie's Maleficent conflicted over her maternal feelings towards Aurora, and facing competition from the neighbouring Queen Ingrith (played by Michelle Pfeiffer).Queen Ingrith causes a rift between Maleficent and Aurora, when her son Prince Phillip proposes to the princess. Ingrith intends to use the marriage to divide humans and fairies, and it falls to Maleficent to stop the impending war.Official reviews are still under embargo, but critics who attended early screenings of the film have been allowed to share their first impressions on Twitter.""Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is like Pirates of the Caribbean; there's lots of convolution and contrivance, but has star power,"" said Courtney Howard, who reviews films for Variety and Awards Circuit. ""Angelina Jolie, Michelle Pfeiffer and Elle Fanning are a holy trinity with bumpy arcs.""Scott Menzel, the editor of We Live Entertainment, described it as ""a visually spectacular sequel that proves once again that Angelina Jolie was born to play the title character. [It's] a modern day fairytale where badass women take centre stage. The battle sequences are epic and the costumes are stunning.""""Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer having a sass-off in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is every bit as good as you'd hope,"" said Digital Spy. ""The movie needs more of it, but it's still a visually bold, fun and superior sequel.""The film received its London premiere on Wednesday.Fanning said: ""I definitely felt a real responsibility to do the second film, the first film was the first film I'd ever done of that scale, and so many young kids saw the film, and especially young girls would come up to me, and they'd look at me as the character.""So hearing that we'd be doing the sequel, I felt a responsibility to those girls for sure, and just to get to show Aurora as a young woman growing up. Obviously in the first film, I was 14 when I did that, and Aurora still has the qualities that she does of kindness, innocence and sweetness that she embodies, but it was so fun to come back.""The three of us [Fanning, Jolie and Pfeiffer], we were there in the beginning, our relationships have changed and grown, I'm 21 now, so I wasn't the kid on set anymore. I really felt accepted on set in a way. Especially with Michelle and Angelina, I felt like they included me as if I was one of their peers.""Jolie says the films have come to reflect the life cycle of a woman - something that wasn't necessarily the intention when the first movie was conceived.""One of the interesting things is, without realising, we've hit the chapters of the growth of a woman,"" she said. ""Her birth, her christening, to being a little girl, a teenage girl, to now being a wife. And so in a way the chapters are following a few things, but one of them is how a woman grows and evolves.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Did critics like the latest Marvel Guardians movie?		"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't out until 5 May but in an unusual move, Marvel has allowed a group of critics to offer their verdict extra early.The film was unveiled for a group of press on Monday night who have been allowed to offer reaction as long as they don't give away any spoilers.And it's all looking pretty positive for the team of superheroes.Collider.com's Steven Weintraub tweeted that the film ""kept a smile on my face from beginning to end.""He added: ""Funny, action packed, emotional, and tons of surprises. Thumbs up.""Hollywood Reporter's Aaron Couch tweeted: ""Don't think I've heard so much laughter at a press screening. People seemed to really be digging Guardians Vol. 2. Can't say more (yet).""Fandango's Erik Davies wrote: ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is exciting, funny, gorgeous & a helluva tearjerker.

Uses every damn colour in the crayon box.""Guardians 2 picks up on the adventures of Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel).Official reviews aren't due out until next week so the fact Disney and Marvel relaxed the rules on this occasion is probably a sign of how confident they are about the sequel.The film opens in the UK on 28 April and in the US on 5 May.And there's more good news for Guardians fans - director James Gunn announced on Facebook earlier that he would be returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.""In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula - and some of the other forthcoming heroes - goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit,"" he told fans in his post on Tuesday.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	The Goldfinch suffers box office crash landing		"The Goldfinch looks likely to become one of cinema history's biggest flops after making only $2.6m (£2m) at the US box office on its opening weekend.The film of Donna Tartt's Pulitzer-winning novel had been expected to make $12m (£9.6m) on 2,542 screens.That makes it the sixth worst US opening for a film shown on between 2,500 and 3,000 screens since records began in 1982.It cost $40m (£32m) to make and has received largely poor reviews.The Goldfinch stars Ansel Elgort as Theo, a young man who turns to art forgery after losing his mother in a freak tragedy.It also stars Nicole Kidman, Sarah Paulson, Jeffrey Wright and Luke Wilson and is directed by John Crowley.Initially considered an awards contender, the movie was called ""a vapid prestige picture"" and ""grotesque"" by Matt Goldberg in Collider.""Rather than exploring tragedy and grief in any meaningful or thoughtful way, it offers a vague homily. It seeks to comfort without compassion,"" he added.""A gauzy, bloated slab of Oscar bait"" is how the movie was described by Dave Ehrlich in IndieWire.Benjamin Lee of The Guardian was more lenient, describing it as ""neither a rousing success nor an embarrassing failure"".Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros, which co-financed the film with Amazon, said the film was not what audiences wanted.""The audience wasn't interested in seeing this literary work on screen,"" he told Variety.""There were many things that didn't work, but the biggest was probably the marketplace.""The Goldfinch opens in the UK on 27 September.Worst North American opening weekends to date (between 2,500 and 3,000 cinemas since 1982)1.

entertainment	Star Wars: Marvel boss Kevin Feige to develop film for Disney		"The man behind Marvel Studios' string of comic book movie blockbusters is to develop a new Star Wars film, a senior executive at Disney has revealed.Alan Horn, co-chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said it ""made sense"" for Kevin Feige to work with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy on the project.The film would be part of ""a new era in Star Wars storytelling,"" Horn told the Hollywood Reporter.Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios are both subsidiaries of Walt Disney Studios.Horn described Feige - who has been president of Marvel Studios since 2007 - as ""a die-hard fan"" of the Star Wars universe.Under Feige's leadership, the films that make up the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) have made more than $22 billion (£18 billion) worldwide.Disney is working on a number of Star Wars projects to follow the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker this December.That film - directed by JJ Abrams - will bring to a close the ""Skywalker saga"" that began with George Lucas's original Star Wars film in 1977.Last year it was announced that the creators of the Game of Thrones TV series were working on their own series of Star Wars films.Lucasfilm's Kennedy called David Benioff and DB Weiss ""some of the best storytellers working today"" when the announcement was made.Rian Johnson, director of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is also working on a trilogy of Star Wars films with all-new characters.Four Star Wars movies have been released since Disney bought Lucasfilm from Lucas in 2012 for $4.05 billion.Star Wars: The Force Awakens made more than $2 billion when it came out in 2015, while The Last Jedi and prequel Rogue One made more than $1 billion apiece.Yet last year's Solo: A Star Wars Story was a box office disappointment, leading Disney CEO Bob Iger to concede the studio had perhaps overreached.""I just think that we might've put a little bit too much in the marketplace too fast,"" he told the New York Times.Concerns have also been raised that the recently-opened Star Wars attractions at Disney's US theme parks have failed to meet expectations.Speaking last month however, Iger said interest in the attraction, known as Galaxy's Edge, was ""extremely high"" and the company had no ""long term"" concerns.News of Feige's involvement in the Star Wars series has generated much interest online.""Feige making a Star Wars movie is better than Christmas of '83 when I got an AT-AT,"" wrote Jeremy Conrad, referring to the armoured transport vehicles from The Empire Strikes Back.Yet one fan pointed out that Samuel L Jackson's presence in both the Star Wars and Marvel universes might cause difficulties.Jackson played Mace Windu in George Lucas's Star Wars prequels before going on to play Nick Fury in the MCU.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Ricky Gervais's Brent movie splits critics		"Ricky Gervais's feature film outing as David Brent has received mixed reviews following Wednesday's world premiere.Titled Life on the Road, the movie, unveiled in London, is a spin-off from the hit BBC TV series The Office.While some critics thought it ""excruciatingly brilliant"", others judged it a ""slowly unfolding disappointment"".The movie sees the former office manager now selling cleaning products but dreaming he is a rock star.He decides to pursue his goal of stardom by touring with his self-funded band Foregone Conclusion.As part of the movie's launch, Gervais performed on a makeshift stage in Leicester Square as his smarmy alter ego with his fake band.The film is released in UK cinemas on 19 August. Here is a selection of the critics' opinions:Robbie Collin - the Daily Telegraph (4*)""If Gervais was working with more resources here than he was 13 years ago, there's zero evidence of it on screen. Happily, what's in no short supply is the same mix of uproarious failure and sledgehammer pathos that Brent at his best was always all about.""Sean O'Grady - The Independent (4*)""If you have missed Brent, more or less absent from our screens in the 12 years since the last episode of the original The Office series was run, then you will be pleased to learn that he is back, and more grotesque, more embarrassing, and more humiliated by life than ever.""Henry Barnes - The Guardian (2*)""It's clear from early on that this is a Ricky Gervais solo outing. The moderating influence of his Office co-creator Stephen Merchant (not involved - something about 'schedules') is missing, leaving a patchy comedy that lacks discipline. The mockumentary format, used so brilliantly in the original show, goes for a wander once the action gets going.""David Edwards - Daily Mirror (5*)""Hilarious, horrifying and even heartbreaking - Ricky Gervais has made a movie that is somehow unmissable and often unwatchable at the same time... Not since Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat 10 years ago has there been a mockumentary that is so appalling funny.""Brian Viner - Daily Mail (2*)""Alas, this big-screen 'mockumentary' sequel, written and directed by Gervais alone, is a slowly-unfolding disappointment. Comic characters conceived for TV very often misfire in the cinema, but there's an even more worrying development here as the line between Gervais and his embarrassing alter ego, Brent, becomes blurred.""Stephen Dalton - Hollywood Reporter""This time around, Gervais is sole writer, director and star, and keeps the focus firmly on himself... Consequently, much of Life on the Road feels like the debut solo album by the lead singer of a once successful band, who is now surrounded by paid session musicians unwilling to challenge the boss over his substandard, self-indulgent coasting.""David Brent remains an enduring comic grotesque, but this sporadically amusing big-screen resurrection is more cash-in reunion tour than killer comeback album.""Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Mustang movie channels female 'power'		"A family wants to find husbands for their five daughters - but this is no Pride and Prejudice. Instead, the storyline of Turkish-French movie Mustang, a first feature film by director Deniz Gamze Erguven, turns the desire to marry off the teenage sisters into a psychological thriller set in modern-day Turkey.The film, nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe, won five Cesar Awards in France and 2015's Lux Prize - a cultural trophy given annually by the European Parliament to films tackling issues of social debate.After the five girls are caught playing on a beach with local boys, their home turns into a prison, with bars on the windows, they are withdrawn from school, dressed conservatively, and marriages are arranged so no more ""shame"" is brought on the family.However, the youngest girl, Lale, is determined not to lose her freedom, and she and her sisters begin to fight back.Erguven, who was born in Turkey but now lives in France, says the emancipation of women has always stirred her - her first short film in 2006, Bir Damla Su, was the story of a Turkish woman, played by the director herself, rebelling against the male authority figures in her community.She describes how the opening scene on the beach in Mustang was based upon her own life, saying ""stories about Turkey particularly engage me because I still have family there and the region is just buzzing"".""I wanted to talk about the condition of women in modern-day Turkey,"" she says.""Whenever I'm back, I feel a form of restriction.""Femininity is reduced to sexuality.""Everything that a woman or a teenage girl does seems to have sexual connotations.""In some schools, boys and girls aren't even allowed to use the same staircases in case they come into contact with each other.""This separation just leads to everything coming back to sex.""Turkey was actually one of the first countries in the world to give women the vote, and the situation makes me sad.""However, the film's producer, Frank Henschke, says: ""There is a conservative government right now, but some parts of society, particularly in the cities, are incredibly liberal.""There is not one truth, and, at the end of the day, this is a feature film, not a documentary - it is not every Turkish girl's experience, and there is a lightness of touch to it, despite the subject matter.""When Mustang was released in Turkey there were some people who loved it and some people who hated it. Deniz got a lot of abuse on social media from people telling her that she wasn't Turkish anymore, they compared her to Edward Snowden, implying she was a traitor. But the reaction is across a broad spectrum, it's exactly as you'd expect from a big country where there is a lot of social change.""Of all the prizes we won - and being nominated for an Oscar was so wonderful and unexpected - the Lux Prize in Strasbourg was possibly the most valuable. It meant that the film was translated into every language in Europe, and so suddenly there was this possibility that everyone in the EU could see and understand the film, and we could provoke a discussion.""The film was shot 600km north of Istanbul at Inebolu on the Black Sea. The director, who was four months pregnant during the shoot, found her five teenage actresses through advertising.Only one of them, Elit Iisscan, had any professional experience. The others, Tugba Sungurogglu, Guness Sensoy, Doga Doguslu and Ilayda Akdogan, Erguven describes as ""coming together and it being love at first sight"".""The girls are all designed to move together and behave as a single organic being - like the five-headed Hydra of mythology.""I called the film Mustang as it means a wild horse. They are five spirited heroines and they gallop together as one. Really, they are who I dream of being.""The director says she wasn't influenced by Sofia Coppola's film The Virgin Suicides, another story of five adolescent girls sheltered by their parents, but comparisons have been made.But Henschke says Hollywood was intrigued by a film that combined five female lead actresses with a female director and another female co-writer - a French director Alice Winacour, who herself recently made the film Disorder.""Mustang was all about what you would call 'girl power',"" laughs Henschke. ""I'm proud that we helped Deniz make it happen. And really, when the discussion in Hollywood is so focused on diversity and how to empower women in the movies, and we turned up with our little creation, it created a lot of talk.""That is precisely what Erguven wants to provoke. ""I know for many around the world this will feel quite exotic. So I just look forward to all the reactions - I just want to make people think, and then open up doors in Turkey, and anywhere where I feel women's voices aren't fully heard.""Mustang is released in the UK on 13 May."
entertainment	Do critics think Lion King is a 'roaring success'?	'Truly timeless''Internalised and sinister'	"Disney's Lion King remake, starring Donald Glover and Beyonce, has been described equally by pun-tastic critics as both a ""roaring success"" and ""tame"".The original 1994 animation won two Oscars for best music and score, while the stage version is also Broadway's top grossing musical.Director Jon Favreau, who also remade The Jungle Book, has used photorealistic animation in the film.Glover and Beyonce are the voices of lions Simba and Nala respectively.British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor provides the voice for the villainous Scar.In a four-star review, The Telegraph said ""the power of this new Lion King comes from the outside"".""You soak up its astonishing photoreal visuals,"" wrote Robbie Collin, ""and marvel at the extraordinary progress that can occur within a single generation, yet still ache for the beauty and purity of the hand-crafted animation that was lost to make way for it.""He added: ""You might imagine that easy-breezy, Hakuna Matata-chanting middle act would only work when drawn by hand. Yet cinematographer Caleb Deschanel's expert command of ""natural"" spectacle and the sheer exuberance of Rogen and Eichner's performances make it the film's most purely delightful section.""The Lion King is the latest in a line of big new remakes, following Cinderella, Beauty And The Beast and Guy Ritchie's Aladdin.The film features songs by Sir Tim Rice and Sir Elton John, 25 years after their original Oscar-winning efforts.The Guardian, were less impressed with the film, writing that the ""deepfake copycat ain't so grrreat"".Peter Bradshaw declared: ""This is an anthro-leonine deepfake of impressive proportions, but the new Lion King gains in shock and awe while losing in character and wit.""The Independent was impressed by the way Disney managed to keep ""finding new ways to tell old stories"". Writer Clarisse Loughrey gave it four stars, praising the movie as a ""technological marvel of unprecedented hyperrealism"".""If anything,"" she added, ""The Lion King uses nostalgia as a springboard for experimentation, finding new ways to tell old stories, while reminding us what makes those stories feel truly timeless in the first place.""Variety's Peter Debruge was blown away by the CGI, saying the ""animals look utterly convincing"", adding that the film would impress old fans and win new ones too.He said: ""By focusing his attention on upgrading the look of the earlier film while sticking largely to its directorial choices and script, Favreau reinforces the strength of the 1994 classic.""Todd McCarthy in The Hollywood Reporter was less gushing with his praise, saying very few remakes had adhered as closely to their original versions as this one.""Everything here is so safe and tame and carefully calculated as to seem predigested,"" he said. ""There's nary a surprise in the whole two hours.""""If you were never a fan of The Lion King, then nothing here will win you over. On the other hand, for those too young ever to have seen it, this could be a life-changing experience.""The Daily Mail's Brian Viner disagreed and went as far to say this version of The Lion King ""might just be the best"" Disney remake yet, but with one or two reservations.He said while the animals' faces were less expressive than they were in the original, and Ejiofor ""can't match"" his predecessor [original Scar actor] Jeremy Irons ""for fruity, baritone menace"", the movie was a ""terrific film in its own right"".Kevin Maher in The Times gave it four stars, and agreed that ""it's better than the original"". He also preferred Ejiofor's portrayal of Simba's uncle and the jealous younger brother of Mufasa, calling Ejiofor's performance ""masterful"".The film-makers, he said, had ""swapped the theatrical camp of Jeremy Irons for something far more internalised and sinister"".Website IndieWire concluded Disney's remake was ""a disastrous plunge into the uncanny valley."" David Ehrlich wrote: ""Unfolding like the world's longest and least convincing deepfake, the new Lion King fatally misunderstands what once made Disney special.""The Lion King is out in UK cinemas on 19 July.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Amy Adams takes control in Arrival movie		"While Hollywood has made many science fiction stories about encounters between humans and aliens, the film Arrival by Denis Villeneuve is one of the few where a lone female protagonist makes first contact with extra terrestrials.Amy Adams plays Dr Louise Banks, a linguistics professor chosen by the US Government to communicate with Heptapods, the species that suddenly appears on Earth in disc-shaped spaceships. She says she welcomed the chance for her character to lead the way.""That was something Denis was constantly in touch with, that this film be all from a woman's perspective,"" she explains. ""He was always saying 'at the end of the day, it's this woman's story, it's her journey, that's all we need to worry about. Nothing else matters as much'.""This is the third time the Quebec-born film-maker has chosen a woman as his lead character, and admits he often places them in dangerous situations - his last film, Sicario, saw Emily Blunt as a female police officer in a drugs raid in Mexico.But he points out: ""It shouldn't ever be a question as to why we would choose a female lead for an action movie, and I hope that one day it will be normal rather than unusual.""In some ways it's not my choice this time as the short story on which Arrival is based, The Story of Your Life, depicts a woman scientist going through the process.""But there is no doubt that a woman will have different reactions to communicating with alien life than a man, and it's no surprise that it's the woman in the group, Dr Banks, who is patient enough to break through and communicate with the Heptapods first.""Avengers actor Jeremy Renner plays a supporting role in the film as a scientist and explains that ""being the back up in the movie"" is the reason why he wanted the role.""It's not like the character was a departure for me or someone I had never played before,"" he says, ""but I loved the script, loved what it was about and I wanted to be there for Amy. That's a powerful female perspective Denis has put on screen and I was raised by women and am raising a girl - I wanted to support it.""The hard hitting sci-fi drama, based on the short story from 1998 by author Ted Chiang, focuses around humanity's efforts to communicate with Heptapods and learn their language - Heptapoid - in order to discover whether their purpose on Earth is friendly or not.Villeneuve, who is currently in the middle of making Bladerunner 2, jokes that he ""always wanted to make a science fiction story and now I have two at once"".""But really, I had been looking for a subject for a long time and then I read this short work that we ended up basing Arrival on. Initially I was worried I couldn't adapt it.""The story is all about the linguistics, and it's beautiful, but without the dramatic structure you need. Fortunately we had a screenwriter who managed to bring drama into the framework.""But Arrival's a different concept to a lot of previous explorations of extra-terrestrial life. It's really about how would you actually go about communicating with aliens. That was exciting to me.""While Renner and Adams's characters lovingly nickname the alien figures they meet as ""Abbott and Costello"", powerful politicians start talking the rhetoric of war. Adams believes the deeper message of Arrival - that language is the ultimate weapon - is timely.""The wrong words can matter more than the right words and so being careful of what you say is important,"" she says.""We live in a world where media is so quickly and immediately available and easily taken out of context. Some people do need to be edited - I won't name names - but hopefully we can have honest voices in society that aren't inflammatory.""Villeneuve agrees: ""Language is available to be used as a weapon of hate and I have a strong feeling of regression at the moment.""We hailed the start of the internet as something that could bring communities together and yet it seems full of the worst of humanity - speaking without reflection, and a general narcissism.""Arrival's first screening at Venice Film Festival drew praise from critics for its ""eerie poetic grandeur"" and ""spectacular ideas"" - although it's been pointed out that Adams may end up in competition with herself during awards season as she also takes the leading role in another heavyweight contender for Oscar glory, Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals.While some critics have drawn comparison between her character's journey and that of Sandra Bullock's astronaut in 2013's Oscar winner Gravity, Adams dismisses the idea that Arrival is a ""space film"".""This is so much more about language, and ideas about time, rather than just action and adventure. We present time in the film the way the aliens, the Heptapods, think of it - as circular and non-linear.""It will make you think of time as very precious - that it's all too fleeting and too quickly become memory. That's the nature of being human - we are doomed to miss so much.""Arrival was screened as part of the Venice Film Festival and is also part of the Toronto Film Festival, which runs until 18 September.The film is released in the UK on 10 November.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Moulin Rouge musical is 'mostly delicious' on Broadway	Musical additions to the stage show	"Moulin Rouge!, Baz Luhrmann's 2001 musical, was the film equivalent of absinthe - mind-alteringly great for some, queasily awful for others.The stage musical has now arrived on Broadway with an updated soundtrack but the same love-it-or-hate-it results.In a three-star review, The Guardian's Alexis Soloski asks: ""Can Moulin Rouge deliver? Yes it can-can.""But the FT's Max McGuinness compared it to ""a school disco with fancier costumes and more exuberant dancing"".The new adaptation had its official press night at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre in New York City on Thursday night.Adapted by John Logan and directed by Alex Timbers - who's had recent success with Beetlejuice - the cast includes Les Miserables star Aaron Tveit as writer Christian (played in the film by Ewan McGregor), who falls in love with the beautiful courtesan Satine.She is played by Karen Olivo, a role which earned Nicole Kidman a best actress nomination at the 2000 Oscars.""The genius of the movie was not its narrative,"" continued The Guardian's review. ""It was its lavish design... its deep knowledge that popular music unpacks our hearts and help us to feel our feelings.""When Satine and Christian proclaim their love for each other by trading snippets of song, a set piece of the movie neatly rendered here, the effect is Shazam for the soul. Here, the original soundtrack - Lady Marmalade, Your Son - has been updated and enlarged with hits from Adele, Beyoncé and, to introduce the duke, the Rolling Stones.""However, the paper had faint praise for the show's leading man Tveit adding ""a handsome face attached to a rich lyric tenor, has... all the sexual charisma of a baked potato. His scenes with Olivo seem friendly, nothing more.""The stage show, which was first performed at the Emerson Colonial Theatre in Boston last year has added a number of new songs which were not in the original film.Tracks by Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Lorde, Gnarls Barkley and Adele are all referenced in the musical.The show has lost One Day I'll Fly Away - Kidman's impassioned torch song cover of Randy Crawford's song but retains the famous cover of Lady Marmalade, the number one hit for singers Christina Aguilera, Mýa, Pink and rapper Lil' Kim.""Of course, 70 songs does not mean that they're all performed in full,"" said Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos in her review.""Most of the time, significant lines from the pop songs the show covers are used as operatic dialogue. This is where the show becomes disjointed: the mix of humour and earnestness meant to be elicited from the song references doesn't quite mesh and the lines between those prominent aren't properly drawn.The music magazine argued the production's stage setting means the ""fantasy is forced to be grounded in reality and loses some of the film's spectacular spectacular-ness in the process"".""Drunk off its own accoutrements (specifically, the glossy roster of songs it packs in under three hours), the show loses touches of the emotion that made the film a modern classic in the first place.""The sheer number of songs was also the main issue for the Financial Times reviewer, who accused the creators of having ""taken a large jukebox and pressed the shuffle button"".""The film itself borrowed tracks from Elton John and Sting among others. This Moulin Rouge! reprises many of those hits while sampling dozens more, ranging from Beyoncé and Lorde to The Rolling Stones and Eurythmics.""""Unlike Luhrmann's flamboyantly shot film,"" it added, ""Alex Timbers's staging fails to conjure an arresting visual spectacle to make up for the story's paper-thin characterisation.""This musical aspires to recreate the heady blend of art and showbusiness that characterised the Moulin Rouge in its heyday. Instead it resembles the same cabaret today - tacky, expensive, full of tourists, and living off past glories.The movie, won two of its eight Oscar nominations in 2002, for best art direction and costume design.In an otherwise glowing four-star review, Time Out's Adam Feldman said: ""Like the film, John Logan's script trades in unvarnished melodrama. The characters function mostly on the level of archetype: They exist to flesh out the songs, which happily include many of the most memorable pop hits of our time.The production is reported to have cost in the region of $28m (£22.5m) and Time Out agreed Moulin Rouge ""looks and feels expensive"".""It's a very fancy heart-shaped box of Valentine's Day chocolates, and though you know exactly what you're going to get, each bite is still a little surprise: sometimes gooey, sometimes nutty, sometimes fruity, sometimes sweet, sometimes stale but mostly delicious.""Some of the US's film publications and websites sent reviewers along to the first night.In a fairly lukewarm review, Deadline's Greg Evans said ""certainly the track listing itself can be fun in a guess-what's-next, parlour-game sort of way, at least initially. Wears thin fast, though, certainly by the time we get to the end of the overlong first act"".However it conceded the ""something-for-everyone approach has its advantages - not least a steady stream of applause and recognition chuckles that make Moulin Rouge! feel like one of the liveliest shows on Broadway.""The reviewer from Variety's Marilyn Stasio agreed, praising the show's ability to live up to ""what Broadway actually can do for a beloved musical property: bring it to life.""""In the film,"" it said, ""the plot is yet another tragic story of mismatched lovers... I'm not sick of it, and nor should you be. Tales about true love transcending divergent social origins and personal destinies never go out of fashion.""Not to appear understated, The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney said: ""The show is A LOT, in every sense, both intoxicating and exhausting in its unrelenting visual and sonic assault. But it virtually defies you not to be entertained.""Calling it a ""wildly extravagant production"", the trade papers said there is ""no mystery as to where its reported $28 million budget has been spent. Negotiating the music rights alone must have cost a small fortune, while the sumptuous design elements induce whiplash as you try to take them all in.""Moulin Rouge! The Musical, it concluded ""is definitely all about the emphatic exclamation point, rarely about the subtler moments, and it could just as easily play Vegas as Broadway.""It's a postmodern La Boheme on hallucinogens."""
entertainment	Brit Awards 'will review' male and female categories		"The Brit Awards say they will review the way they distribute prizes, with one option being the abolition of separate male and female categories.But reports that gendered awards have already been axed are ""based on rumour and speculation"", organisers said.""We can 100% confirm that there will be male and female awards in the UK and international categories in February 2020,"" they told the BBC.The statement was issued after a story in The Sunday Times at the weekend.The paper said organisers wanted to accommodate non-binary artists - who identify as neither male nor female - and that scrapping gender-specific categories was a likely outcome.The report came a week after pop star Sam Smith asked fans to call them by the pronouns ""they/them"", not ""he/him"".""After a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out,"" they wrote on Instagram.Many other artists have rejected the traditional constraints of gender, including Christine + The Queens, King Princess, Kim Petras, Sophie and Anohni (formerly Antony and the Johnsons).But the Brit Awards would not be the first ceremony to scrap separate male and female prizes.The National Television Awards (NTAs) first changed its best actor and actress categories to best drama performance and best serial drama performance in 2008; and the Grammys scrapped male and female awards in 2012.In 2017, the MTV Movie Awards also went gender neutral, with Emma Watson becoming the first recipient of its ""best movie performance"" prize.In her acceptance speech, the Harry Potter star praised the decision to merge the categories.""With acting, you put yourself in someone else's shoes,"" she said. ""The only distinction should be between each outstanding performance.""But rumours of the Brit Awards shake-up prompted an outburst from Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan, who accused organisers of ""wrecking"" their reputation.""I suspect what will happen is male performers will end up winning all of the awards than the women. The whole point of having the gender categories is to make it fair and equal, now we're going the other way and that apparently is progress. I think it's a load of nonsense.""However, the history of the MTV Music Awards suggests otherwise.Since they replaced separate best male and best female prizes with an overall best artist award in 2017, the winners have been Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello and Ariana Grande.At the National TV Awards, the best drama performance prize has been shared equally between men and women, with recipients including David Tennant, Richard Madden, Suranne Jones and Sheridan Smith.Organised by trade body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the Brits have awarded prizes along gender lines since their inception in 1977.Although that will not change next year, Award organisers did concede there would be ""significant changes"" that would ""involve more music and some category changes"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	The Matrix: How have other 'fourth' films fared?	'More relevant now'Toy Story 4Ocean's 8Indiana Jones and Rambo	"This week's announcement of a fourth instalment in the Matrix franchise, 16 years after the second and third sequels, has been even slower to arrive than the bullet time effect introduced in the first movie.Still the news has come as a joy to many fans.""I can't believe I'm about to go through this whirlwind again"" tweeted Sucre.Others online, like Spider-Man fan Cameron Magruder, however, appeared to have more pressing film news priorities. He posted: ""So instead of making the Matrix 4... how about we just keep Spider-Man in the MCU and call it even.""The original Matrix movie in 1999 was credited with predicting the future and influencing everything from 21st Century fashion, to the rise of social media and the breakdown of the binary genders.Now, stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss (aka Neo and Trinity, respectively) are set to return for the latest edition, which will be director siblings Lana and Lilly Wachowski's first Matrix movie since their gender transitions.Twitter user Lady Aeva declared she hoped the forthcoming flick would confirm ""the last three movies were just an allegory... for trans stuff.""Andrew Todd correctly pointed that both lead characters actually ""died in the last movie"" [2003's The Matrix Revolutions], suggesting we could be in for another ""weird"" ride.Due to the rapid and widespread social and technological changes we've seen since the first three films, Total Film news editor Jordan Farley believes ""it's a good time"" to reload The Matrix.""The whole idea of a virtual world and people living online and in the real world is just so much more relevant now than it was in 1999, where the internet was still quite nascent,"" he tells the BBC.""People hide behind social media profiles and virtual reality itself is now a consumer-facing thing. I have a virtual reality headset sat next to my TV right now that I can put on and enter some crazy world that is completely different to our own.""He adds: ""So there's definitely mileage just from the fact that we're much closer now to a world like The Matrix than we were in 1999.""It seems even Neo himself would struggle to predict how this one is going to play out... So while we wait for the Wachowskis' latest creation, let's strap on our headsets and see what can be learned from a look back at how other movie franchises have fared late on into the fourth innings.Earlier this year Disney released the latest in the much-loved animated movie series Toy Story. The film found Sheriff Woody - again voiced by Tom Hanks - Buzz Lightyear and co joined by new friend Forky on a road trip adventure.Far from having outstayed its welcome, the latest Toy Story surpassed a billion dollars at the box office and fast became the ninth highest-grossing animated film of all-time - ahead of both of the first two films.It was described, in one review, on aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes as: ""Heartwarming, funny, and beautifully-animated.""Toy Story 4 manages the unlikely feat of extending - and perhaps concluding - a practically perfect animated saga.""Total Film's Farley feels the latest Toy Story was actually more like an ""epilogue"", tagged on the end of the other three, rather than wrapping up a pre-planned quadrilogy of films (or quartet if you prefer). So the big challenge for makers of The Matrix - ""a trilogy in retrospect"" - he says, is in finding exactly where the fourth film fits in.Incidentally, Reeves was in the new Toy Story as the much-loved Canadian stuntman Duke Caboom. He's also recently starred in John Wick 3, appeared in Netflix's Always Be My Maybe and even lent his image to a forthcoming video game Cyberpunk 2077 - leading Farley to believe 2019 could be Keanu's year.""I think people people are very excited by the fact that he's going to be in a new Matrix film as well because he's the talk of the town at the moment,"" he states.Despite the title, Ocean's 8 was the fourth in the heist movie series' arsenal.It contained all the same professional criminality as the first three but this time George Clooney and his band of merry men were replaced by Sandra Bullock - as Clooney's character Danny Ocean's sister Debbie - and a string of other leading ladies, including Rihanna.The film received a lukewarm response from critics but started a debate around whether there were in fact enough female reviewers.Might the first Matrix movie since the #MeToo era then see Reeves take a step back and allow Moss or another woman entirely to take on the lead role? Or could the characters even transition, like their creators?""Absolutely,"" says Farley. ""The Matrix really lends itself to doing practically anything with it, and because it's such a vast open space it's an incredible sandbox to play in.""So there's no reason why Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss can't take on slightly different roles.""He adds that while changing their roles would be welcomed by many, stretching them too far may be a risk and ""slightly challenging"" for some viewers.""Neo and Trinity are such iconic characters, I think it would almost be jarring to see those actors in a Matrix film and for them to not be playing those characters.""Absence often makes the heart grow fonder, but in the case of Indiana Jones it seems Harrison Ford may have left it a little too late.2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull arrived a whopping 19 years after the hero's Last Crusade and was loved and loathed in equal measure.If you think Ford had it tough, spare a thought for Sylvester Stallone who trod a similar path as the Vietnam War veteran Rambo. He returned to action after two decades away in the eponymous fourth movie in the combat series the same year.Many reviewers thought both looked faintly ridiculous as action men in their 60s, but then it didn't prevent either franchise from being re-commissioned for a fifth film this year.Farley feels that like with gender, there are no such age-related issues inside The Matrix - where the time is a relative concept.""A big part of the film is this virtual world where people have avatars that reflect their own impression of their selves and their own sort of mental image, so I think you can sort of get away with the actors looking any way they want,"" he says.As Variety notes, the film are believed to searching for a younger actor to take on the role of Morpheus - as previously portrayed by Laurence Fishburne.""I mean, you could re-cast them younger and get away with it,"" the film writer goes on.""The weird thing for me is the fact that I don't know if Keanu and Carrie are going to be playing their original characters or not because the third film pretty definitively says that those characters are dead! I don't know how they're going to bring them back.""Almost anything goes in The Matrix, so the opportunities are limitless.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Toronto 2019: Why David Copperfield's colour-blind casting 'felt natural'		"A new adaptation of David Copperfield is the latest project to take a colour-blind approach to casting.Dev Patel plays the titular character in The Personal History of David Copperfield, which is directed by Armando Iannucci.Speaking to BBC News at the film's Toronto premiere, Iannucci said the casting process felt ""very natural.""""When I wanted to make David Copperfield, I instantly thought of Dev,"" he explained.""Because he has those qualities of naivety, awkwardness, and yet strength at the same time. And he instantly was, for me, David. And he said yes, thankfully, because I couldn't think of anyone else, I didn't have a plan B.""And I also wanted it to feel contemporary, although it's set in 1840. For the characters in it, it's the present day, so it should feel like the present day, and feel reflective of now. I didn't want to feel bound by how you make a costume drama.""Actors who have previously played the role have been generally white - such as Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe, who made his acting debut as the young Copperfield in a 1999 adaptation on the BBC.The new adaptation also stars Peter Capaldi, Rosalind Eleazar, Tilda Swinton, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Benedict Wong alongside Patel.The Personal History of David Copperfield's debut at the Toronto Film Festival was highly anticipated by film fans, as few details about the movie had emerged in advance.An official trailer for the movie has still not been released, but the absence of any public reaction hasn't stopped it being snapped up by Fox Searchlight for distribution.The film is due to play at the London Film Festival next month before its 2020 release.Patel said: ""I think [Iannucci's] choice to just cast the right faces for the part opened this movie up in such a way where you won't have people meeting him for the first time, and asking 'Who's David Copperfield, is he the magician?' - which is what I did.""You'll have young children in schools looking at this movie and finding a face they can relate to, I hope,"" added the actor, who was Oscar-nominated for 2016's Lion and starred in 2008's Slumdog Millionaire, which won eight Oscars.""For me, I just think back to my younger self and what he would think about older Dev being able to be part of this movie with this cast, and I feel so lucky, and I want that opportunity to extend to my peers as well, because this is why we do it. We don't do storytelling and exploring to be put in boxes, we do it to be free and live dreams so we can put them on screen.""Like practically all awards season films, the new Copperfield is long - around two hours - but in this case that's largely justified by the vast scope of the original Charles Dickens novel.""If there's too much plot in the film to jam into this synopsis, be assured there's too much plot in the novel to fit in the film,"" wrote John DeFoe in The Hollywood Reporter.He also praised the director's pacing of the film, commenting: ""Iannucci has shown more visual invention than in his earlier work, with dazzling little transitions that help us not to be too grumpy about how little time we spend in some sequences.""[The film] turns the author's well-loved autobiographical epic into a fast-moving yarn, sometimes hilarious and always entertaining.""It's been two years since Iannucci was last in Toronto, launching The Death of Stalin, which starred Steve Buscemi and Jason Isaacs.The writer and director is best known for his biting political satire, particularly in his creation of TV series Veep and The Thick of It.Copperfield, therefore, marks a slight change in tone for the director. It's a softer and more human character study, with significantly less swearing than is usual for an Iannucci project.""I've never really thought of myself as someone who specialises in swearing,"" he laughs, ""it just so happens that [those shows] conveyed worlds in which people do an awful lot of swearing.""However, what I did want to make sure was we didn't shy away from quite tough moments. The physical abuse of a child, the working conditions, the homelessness. I didn't want to shy away from that, but I also wanted this to be a film that any generation could come and see.""The Personal History of David Copperfield also stars Gwendoline Christie, Ben Whishaw and Hugh Laurie, who points out his character Mr Dick was one of the earliest explorations of mental health in literature.""He's an unusual character in that it's one of the first efforts that I know of in novel form to deal with a character who suffers from mental illness, who has been traumatised and has become in some cases delusional and actually psychotic,"" Laurie told BBC News.""And to see not exactly healing of that problem but to see the joy in him, which he's still capable of, to see that develop through his relationship with David Copperfield is a beautiful thing.""Remember this was a time when the mentally ill were very often consigned to institutions, where there was no real prospect of a way out, of any sort of care. That was just the sort of understanding we didn't have of mental illness.""Speaking about the themes of the novel more widely, he said; ""I hope that it's fresh and relevant after all these years because the basic constituents are eternal. It's love and it's home and it's finding your place in the world, it's loss, and grief, and all those things that just don't go away."""
entertainment	Toy Story 4: What did the critics think?	'Separation and loss'	"The fourth (and supposedly final) instalment of Toy Story has been warmly welcomed by critics.Woody, Buzz and Jessie are returning nine years after they said goodbye to Andy and settled into their new home with Bonnie at the end of Toy Story 3.The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy said: ""It's now certain what one of the summer's blockbusters will be.""More than that, how many other film series can legitimately claim to have hit four home runs in a row?"" he added.Variety's Peter Debruge said the movie gives ""satisfying emotional closure"", adding that ""the fourth movie wraps up the saga beautifully"".He added the film ""explores the idea of purgatory: What's it like for a plaything to be ignored, overlooked or entirely unused?""Toy Story 4, which is released in the UK on 21 June, sees the toys grapple with the idea of the jumble sale crate, and the possibility of being left without a purpose when their owners grow up.It also introduces Forky, a spork who has been given a makeover in a craft project and is in denial about the fact he's now a toy.However The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw awarded it just three stars, adding the film is ""a repeat of earlier ideas and plotlines"".But he added: ""Compare it to the fourth films in other franchises and Pixar's latest is an amusing and charming gem... it is in a different league.""It is sprightly, sweet-natured and gorgeous to look at (and how blase we've all become about animation standards that 10 years ago had us hyperventilating with astonishment). There are some nice lines and a nifty allusion to Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.""Writing in The Mirror, Chris Hunneysett highlighted the contrast between Toy Story and the slew of superhero films hitting cinemas.""With cinema dominated by universe-smashing superheroes, Toy Story's sweet brand of wholesome and slightly scary fun seems almost quaint, but as a parent it's great to have a film which offers more gentle and almost innocent pleasures.""Many reviews talk about the message behind the Toy Story films, with Alex Abad-Santos of Vox saying this film's ""lesson is about how love defines us"".In his five-star review for The Telegraph, Robbie Collin wrote: ""Woody and co will have you sobbing like a lawn sprinkler"", and that ""Toy Story has always been game to grapple with the big questions of life and purpose"".The film, which was directed by Josh Cooley, who co-wrote and storyboarded Pixar's emotional hit Inside Out, also made the newspaper's reviewer ""shake with laughter at least once every five minutes"".Mashable's Angie Han said: ""Forky's questions aren't invalid for being fundamentally unanswerable, and they eventually become the catalyst for Woody's own journey of self-reflection.""""Pixar has done it again with the funniest of the series"" and ""Toy Story 4 is a complete and utter joy,"" The Sun's film critic Jamie East said:.He echoed Bradshaw in The Guardian, who said: ""There's little point in talking too much about the storyline because it's largely more of the same - toys escape/go missing/get rescued - which has been the constant throughout. I don't mind though, because I don't think that is the films' strength"".The Independent's Geoffrey Macnab added that ""separation and loss are the key drivers in Toy Story 4... there is no permanence in the relationships depicted here.""""There is still a valid tale to tell,"" said the Daily Mail's Brian Viner, ""that of Woody (voiced, as ever, by Tom Hanks) resolving his existential crisis by finding an enduring purpose in a post-Andy world.""Nigel Andrews of The Financial Times simply adds: ""Don't hang about if there is a cinema near you. If there isn't, take a train or bus. This is a funny, clever, inventive, richly endearing film.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Toronto 2019: Tom Hanks says cynicism 'has become our default'		"Tom Hanks has said the increasing level of cynicism in society is partly what led him to take a role as a loveable children's entertainer.The actor plays Fred Rogers in his new movie - a legendary US kids TV host whose brand was wholesome and warm.""Cynicism has become the default position for so much of daily structure and daily intercourse,"" Hanks told reporters.""Why? Because it's easy, and there's good money to be made.""He added: ""Cynicism is a great product to sell, and it's the perfect beginning of any examination of anything. And part of that is conspiracy theories and what have you.""But I think when Fred Rogers first saw children's programming, he saw something that was cynical, and why would you put something that is cynical in front of a two or three-year-old kid? That you are not cool because you don't have this toy? That it's funny to see someone being bopped on the head?""That's a cynical treatment of the audience, and we have become so inured to that, that when we are met with as simple a message as 'Hey you know what, it's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood!' we get slapped a little bit. We are allowed, I think, to feel good. There's a place for cynicism, but why begin with it right off the bat?""A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood serves as the title of the Rogers film, which is directed by Marielle Heller - well known for the Oscar-nominated Can You Ever Forgive Me?Heller has explained that, because Mr Rogers (as he was known) had such little conflict in his life, he was not an obvious protagonist for a movie, and his career alone wouldn't have served as a strong enough storyline.Instead, A Beautiful Day In The Neighbourhood follows the relationship between Mr Rogers and a journalist for Esquire magazine, who wrote a profile of the entertainer in 1998.The journalist who wrote the original piece, Tom Junod, possessed by trade just the kind of cynical personality Hanks refers to. But when he met Mr Rogers, he found a more complex character than he was expecting.Over a series of sittings, he and Mr Rogers developed a friendship. The entertainer won Junod over with his seemingly unrelenting kindness and empathy, helping him examine his own issues and find a deeper appreciation for life.lt is, frankly, an outstanding film - one of the best seen so far at the Toronto Film Festival and undoubtedly an awards season contender.""Marielle Heller excels at pulling heartstrings from sturdy foundations, injecting smart and insightful details into material that could easily default to sentimentality,"" wrote Eric Kohn in IndieWire.""Hanks isn't just good - he's transporting,"" added Variety's Owen Gleiberman. ""He takes on Mr Rogers' legendary mannerisms and owns them, using them as a conduit to Rogers' disarming inner spirit. He makes you believe in this too-nice-for-words man... [the film] is a soft-hearted fable that works on you in an enchanting way.""The Hollywood Reporter was more sceptical: ""It is a sympathetic and yet entirely predictable in its dramatic trajectory of making a believer of an angry, cynical journalist. Still, the lure of the Hanks/Rogers match-up looks to stir some reasonable commercial returns.""More from Toronto:The script for A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood had been floating around Hollywood for some time before production began.Hanks even passed on the role several times - but then ended up saying yes once director Marielle Heller became attached to the project.The pair had been looking to work on a film together for some time and Hanks said he felt she was the right person to deliver it to the screen.Matthew Rhys, who plays the journalist, said the film taps into a vulnerability which men in particular often keep hidden under the surface.""Marielle talked about giving men in general a greater emotional vocabulary, or working towards articulating their emotions, and not just generally men, I think society in general would benefit from it,"" he said.""And I think it was instantly relatable that someone was so desperately wanting to be seen, but hiding behind this castle that he built for himself, and I think it's a message of hope.""Mr Rogers, who died in 2003, isn't well known in many international territories, however, in the same way he is in the US.Therefore, while a Tom Hanks movie can generally be expected to draw the public to the cinema, the distributors may have a struggle on their hands to market it in some international territories.But by the time it reaches UK cinemas, the awards season buzz it is generating may well be enough to carry it to significant box office success."
entertainment	Woody Harrelson shoots live movie hours after 'WW2 bomb' discovery		"Woody Harrelson said directing his ground-breaking live film project was like ""walking on a high wire"".Lost in London was filmed in multiple locations in the capital in the early hours of Friday.In a cinematic first, the film was shot in a 100-minute single take and broadcast live to 550 US cinemas - and one in the UK.But the project was almost derailed by the discovery of a suspected World War Two bomb just hours before the shoot.Waterloo Bridge - where the closing scene of the film takes place - was closed for a few hours but reopened just in time for the live shoot to go ahead as planned.Speaking after the filming ended around 03:40 GMT, Harrelson was incredulous at the timing of the ""bomb"" discovery.""That thing has been there for 70 years and they discover it tonight? That's impossible!""Lost In London was shot on a single camera, involved a crew of 325 and more than 300 extras who had been rehearsing for four weeks.""I would never do this again. No way. It felt like walking on a high wire,"" said Harrelson afterwards.There were no major gaffes - although one actor walked out of a scene, forcing Harrelson to ad lib during a phone call until the character returned.""It felt like five minutes,"" Harrelson said. ""It was only a matter of seconds. But, boy, those were some painful seconds.""The film was screened in just one cinema in the UK, London's Picturehouse Central, where it received an enthusiastic reception.The comedy plot was loosely based on a real-life night out that Harrelson had in the capital in 2002 in which he ended up getting arrested and spending time in a police cell.The film opens with the words: ""Too much of this is true.""Harrelson, playing a version of himself, is seen coming off stage in the West End to discover he's the subject of a tabloid sex scandal just before he goes to meet his wife in a restaurant.The film includes a fight in a nightclub and chase sequences on foot and by car.Much of the comedy comes from the scenes with co-star Owen Wilson - and the script is sprinkled with references to Harrelson's past projects, including Natural Born Killers and Cheers.""It was pretty thrilling,"" Wilson said after the filming.""I had a lot of anxiety about doing it a couple of weeks ago but we practised... and I was really happy to be a part of it. Maybe I should start doing theatre.""Musician Willie Nelson turned up in a cameo role as did U2's Bono, as a voice on the end of a phone.""I felt like we took some risks. It was scary - the whole process,"" Harrelson said.Harrelson's next project will see him join the Star Wars franchise with a role in the spin-off movie about the young Han Solo.Did he think Hollywood would ever adopt the as-it-happens style of Lost in London?Harrelson laughed: ""If someone was thinking of doing it all they'd need to do is talk to me and I would talk them out of it.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Game of Thrones' coffee cup and 6 other TV and film bloopers	This article contains spoilers for Game of Thrones season eight, episodes three and fourGladiator's gas cylinder (2000)Braveheart's Ford Mondeo (1995)Downton Abbey's plastic bottle (2014)Indiana Jones' faulty geography (1981-2008)Back to the Futuristic guitar (1985)Mad Men's Saturday Night Football (2010)	"Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke has revealed who was responsible for the show's infamous coffee cup scene.In one episode of the eighth season, eagle-eyed viewers spotted a coffee cup on the table in the great hall, as Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen sat, more appropriately, with goblet in hand.Now, Clarke has revealed her co-star Conleth Hill, who portrayed master of spies Lord Varys, admitted to being responsible for the error during a pre-awards show party in September.""We had a party before the Emmys recently and Conleth, who plays Varys, who's sitting next to me in that scene, he pulls me aside and he's like, 'Emilia, I have got to tell you something, love. The coffee cup was mine',"" Clarke recounted to US talk show host Jimmy Fallon.""It was his! It was Conleth's coffee cup. He said so. He said ' I think it was, I am sorry, darling, I didn't want to say anything because it seemed the heat was very much on you.' I was like 'what? what!?'""The cup was originally identified as being from Starbucks but later confirmed to be from a local coffee shop in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, where much of Game Of Thrones was filmed.HBO has since removed the cup from re-runs of the fourth episode of the final season.The show's producers admitted the error at the time in a humorous tweet posted after the broadcast.The hazelnut latte of Winterfell is the most recent high-profile example of a modern item making its way to a different time and place, it is certainly not the first.Ridley Scott's Roman epic - fronted by a vengeful, best actor-winning Russell Crowe - dominated awards season. But it has since also found blooper fame.During a battle in the Colosseum, a horse-drawn chariot flips over onto its side, revealing a gas cylinder.A quite remarkable technological feat given that the movie is set in 180AD and stainless steel gas cylinders weren't invented until the 1800s.The sight of US actor Mel Gibson playing Scottish independence hero William Wallace raised more than a few eyebrows at the time of the film's release.But that was not as surprising as the appearance of a Ford Mondeo in a horseback battle against English invaders.Talk about horsepower...Producers of the period drama were left red-faced after a modern plastic bottle appeared in a promotional photo for a forthcoming series in 2014.Perched on a mantelpiece behind Hugh Bonneville and Laura Carmichael, the bottle was spotted by eagle-eyed fans when the image was posted on Instagram.Plastic bottles were not in wide use in the UK until the 1960s - 36 years after the series of Downton took place.Although later deleted from Instagram and the ITV press site, the internet never forgets, no matter what the year...Steven Spielberg might be the visionary behind some of the best-loved films of the last 40 years, but it seems he wouldn't be much help in a geography test.His Indiana Jones series - starring Harrison Ford - includes glaring map reading errors.Its opening instalment, Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936, sees a plane fly over a map that includes Thailand and Jordan.But there's a problem. Thailand was called Siam until 1939, while Jordan was known as Transjordan until 1949.And Spielberg's cartography did not improve before 2008's fourth instalment Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which shows a plane flying over Belize in 1957, at which time it was still known as British Honduras.The inclusion of an anachronism in Back to the Future - a film about time travel - feels as head-spinning as it does fitting.Its opening instalment sees era-hopping 1980s teen Marty McFly, played by Michael J Fox, travel back to 1955, ultimately filling in on guitar at his parents' high school dance.McFly shocks the crowd by playing power chords during a performance of Chuck Berry's Johnny B Goode. ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet,"" he tells the bewildered teens. ""But your kids are gonna love it.""Prophetic words, as the guitar McFly is using is an Gibson ES-345, which was not introduced until 1958.Famed for its historical accuracy, Matthew Wiener's long-running US advertising drama Mad Men did not quite manage to maintain a spotless record.News anchor-turned-TV sleuth Brian Williams used his NBC blog to point out that its brooding lead Don Draper simply would not have been able to watch a night-time NFL game on TV in 1964.That's because prime-time football didn't start until 1970.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It's going to be a true epic saga.""At the 20th Century Fox event, it was also confirmed there would a sequel to the hugely successful Deadpool, which stars Ryan Reynolds as a foul-mouthed superhero.The film, released in February, took more than $757m (£534m) worldwide."
entertainment	Toronto Film Festival 2019: How Sarah Paulson bagged The Goldfinch role		"Nothing was going to stop Sarah Paulson from bagging a role in the film adaptation of a novel she had so loved.The US actress appears in The Goldfinch, based on the 2014 Pulitzer-winning novel by Donna Tartt. The movie had its premiere in Toronto on Sunday.Paulson, who plays Xandra, told BBC News she was ""obsessed"" with the book, but knew when auditioning she wouldn't be the director's first choice.""I don't think I was at the top of the ideas that were percolating,"" she said.""I had read it years ago when it first came out. And I just remember saying out loud, 'If they make a movie of this, I would love to play Xandra'.""And I was not the choice of [director] John Crowley at the beginning. I think he had a particular image in mind, which is the image you see in the movie, which is not how I [usually] present.""Xandra could not be further as a character from Marcia Clark, the whip-smart lawyer Paulson played in The People v OJ Simpson, a role that bagged her an Emmy Award for outstanding lead actress in a limited series.Her character in The Goldfinch is the gum-chewing, scantily-clad, spray-tanned girlfriend of protagonist Theo's father, but she knew the character was a departure from her usual roles.""So I hired someone to put a wig on my head, I got a spray tan, I brought cigarettes into my audition, spent an hour in my car screaming to make my voice have a bit of a rasp, because that's how Donna Tartt describes Xandra's speaking voice,"" Paulson says.""I did all that and made the tape and I got a call saying, 'Uh-oh, you did very well'. And they weren't expecting that. Sometimes I think you have to change your physical appearance... I understand why it was hard for people to make the jump [from playing Marcia Clark].""More from Toronto:Crowley told BBC News he was ""a huge fan"" of Paulson. ""But when she was mentioned for Xandra I was like 'really?' She's great but I couldn't quite see that,"" he said.""But boy, is the last laugh on me. She went at it with a great character actor's eye for detail, a love for the book, and she just colonised that role in a way that was amazing.""Even when her audition tape was approved by Crowley, however, Paulson's casting still had to be signed off by the film studio.""I still had to wait for Warner Brothers. Everybody had to approve everything and I was like, urgh, I just did Ocean's 8 for them!"" she laughs. ""I wanted the part so badly and they made me wait it out for so long.""The finished product premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. But while it was originally considered a serious awards contender, some critics were not convinced.""It's neither a rousing success nor an embarrassing failure, falling somewhere in between, closer to admirable attempt,"" wrote Benjamin Lee in The Guardian.""[The storyline] is like taking a long road trip that reaches a dead end, and as the film starts to wrap up, there's not enough of a throughline to justify both the film's mammoth length and its grand sense of self.""Writing in Collider, Matt Goldberg said: ""The Goldfinch is not only a vapid prestige picture; it's also grotesque. Rather than exploring tragedy and grief in any meaningful or thoughtful way, it offers a vague homily. It seeks to comfort without compassion.""""A gauzy, bloated slab of Oscar bait"" is how the movie was described by Dave Ehrlich in IndieWire.""The big problem with The Goldfinch - a lifeless film that doesn't consist of scenes so much as it does an awkward jumble of other, smaller problems stacked on top of each other like kids inside a trench coat - is that it mistakes its source material for a great work of art.""Crowley's simple direction flattens the entire story into a styleless mash, while [Peter] Straughan's nonlinear screenplay knots it into a self-conflicted tangle. The result is a stately, lugubrious mess that feels at odds with such an eccentric adventure.""Donna Tartt herself took a fairly hands-off approach to the film. Most of the cast members had no contact with her during filming, and nor have they had feedback directly from her.As the director, Crowley is one of the few who met Tartt - an author who rarely does interviews and doesn't keep a high profile.""I met her once,"" says Crowley, ""which was when I was being interviewed for the job. I had a series of interviews with the producer and Warner Brothers, and the last stage of that was being sent to meet Donna in Charlottesville.""We had lunch together, which was fantastic. There was already a first draft of the script at this point. I talked about my approach to it as much as one can in an hour, but gave her the essential elements that I felt were important to maintain. And I got back on a plane and by the time I got back to London the next day, it had been announced in the press that I got the thumbs up!""She was in the middle of writing her next novel, so she wasn't involved in the practical details, so I didn't have any contact with her from that point on. She presumably gave me her blessing, and that was the end of that.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

entertainment	Sheepish success of Icelandic Rams movie		"Take two brothers who haven't spoken in four decades and an outbreak of scrapie amongst their prize-winning herd of sheep, and apparently, you have the ingredients for one of the most successful Nordic films to date - Rams, by Icelandic film-maker Grimur Hakonarson.The tale of elderly brothers Gummi and Kiddi, played by Sigurdur Sigurjonsson and Theodor Julisson, who farm next door to each other in a bleak Icelandic landscape, is Hakonarson's second feature film, but it won the prestigious Un Certain Regard prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, and has gone on to be released in more than 40 countries.With no women in their lives, and no one for company apart from their sheep, the estranged brothers send any necessary messages to each other via their sheepdog - or occasionally, a shotgun.But when the lethal disease scrapie breaks out in their valley, all herds are culled. It's effectively a death sentence for the famers too, leaving Gummi and Kiddi to save their industry from extinction.With a plotline like this, and two lead actors that trade magazine Variety describes as ""King Lear-like"", many international audiences have been surprised to find Rams described as comedy, but that, according to Hakonarson, comes down to cultural nuances.""It's a very Icelandic sense of humour,"" he explains. ""If you think of the old Icelandic sagas, describing battle and death, we find some of these descriptions funny. It's a very bleak sense of humour, but we come from the far north, without much light, and depression is intrinsic to our humour.""Perhaps it's more accurate to describe Rams as a tragi-comedy. There's a cocktail of drama and comedy in the script that is very subtle, and the comedy comes from the ridiculousness of the situation. It's absurd that elderly men who live next door to each other have to rely on a dog to pass messages, it's sad and funny at the same time.""Hakonarson, 39, grew up in rural Iceland, and took a job on a sheep farm as a teenager, which would eventually give him the idea for Rams.""I´ve experienced the life of the sheep farmer and I know people who have a great passion for sheep,"" he says.""I know this may sound humorous to you, but there seems to be a strong connection between men and sheep in Iceland, stronger than other animals. Not only because of historical and cultural reasons, people seem to get emotionally more attached to their sheep.""I wanted to do a film about this connection; about the relationship between farmers and their sheep. Many farmers I know are bachelors; they live alone. The sheep become their family and best friends. The ties become stronger.""Then I heard a story of two brothers who lived next to each other and didn't speak for 40 years. I think however, this was over a woman, but I found that story interesting and tragi-comical and maybe a bit Icelandic.""Many Icelanders are stubborn and very independent. So I combined these two ideas into a script.""While TV shows from the Nordic countries - Iceland, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden - have shown across the world, the most high-profile, including Borgen, The Killing and The Bridge, originated in Denmark.Feature films from the five countries have found it harder to reach an international audience; the most successful, apart from The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series, is 2012's Headhunters from Norway, an adaptation of a Jo Nesbo thriller, and 2014's The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of a Window, again an adaptation of a bestseller.Iceland's last Oscar nomination was in 1991, for Fridrik Thor Fridriksson's Children of Nature. While Rams, or Hrutar in its original language, did not make the final Academy Awards shortlist, it's one of the most commercially successful films yet to come from the Nordic countries, and Iceland's largest international film to date in terms of box office - something Hakonarson is finding hard to grasp.""We made this film for under two million euros and now we've been negotiating for release in China,"" he says. ""It's very rare for a film to be both successful at home and abroad - our culture usually doesn't travel. It's also rare for our films to be both a critical and commercial success.""In Iceland, we don't have much money to make films. Therefore we make rather simple and humanistic stories. We can't afford to make period movies either. I'm very happy that a film about sheep farmers who don't talk to each other can be so successful abroad. We can't compete with Hollywood in genre films, it's better for us to make films like Rams.""What has startled me the most is the questions about the landscape from international audiences, which is very much another character in the film. Urban audiences in particular are very keen to experience it for themselves - I'm starting to feel like an ambassador of the Icelandic tourist board.""With a 100% rating on movie critic site Rotten Tomatoes, Rams has been described as ""a far from woolly tale"" with ""bone dry humour"". But its director thinks that despite the strangeness of the volcanic surroundings and of the story itself, what really draws audiences is a more familiar theme.""There's a sense of loneliness and isolation that you can get even if you live in the middle of a town,"" he says. ""The conflict between the brothers affects everyone, no matter where they live, because everyone has conflicts within close family. The story is universal.""Rams is released in the UK on 5 February."
entertainment	Last Christmas: Paul Feig on the George Michael-inspired film		"An unreleased, six-minute song from the late George Michael will feature in a new movie loosely based on his music.Last Christmas, released later this year, is set to star Emilia Clarke, Henry Golding and Emma Thompson.Its director Paul Feig told BBC News: ""[George Michael] was putting together his new album when he passed.""And one of our tracks is one of those songs, and it's just an absolutely amazing song that I'm so excited the world is going to get to hear now.""George Michael was found dead on Christmas Day in 2016 at his home in Goring, Oxfordshire.Last Christmas focuses on a young aspiring singer (played by Clarke), whose hero is George Michael. Feig explains the singer's music ""sort of travels with her as she goes through her life"" in the storyline.Speaking about the new track, he continued: ""It's a very celebratory song, I would dare say. And we were able to play the entire song, which is almost six minutes long, in the film.""Because when you get a song that has never been heard, you don't want to just use, like, 15 seconds of it. The song starts at the end of the film, and then goes into the credits.""Last Christmas is set to be released next July (just kidding, it's out in November) and stars Henry Golding and Michelle Yeoh, both of whom also appeared together in Crazy Rich Asians.The first trailer for the film premiered on Wednesday morning.Until now, the exact format of Last Christmas has been unclear, with fans wondering whether Michael's music would be just used as the soundtrack, or whether songs would actually be sung by the characters.""It's not a musical, but George's music affects the story,"" Feig clarifies. ""There are a couple of sections where the actors are actually interacting with the music and other sections where George's music is driving, or underscoring the story. So it's a nice mix of being neither a jukebox movie nor straight up musical.""It is far from the first film to be based on the back catalogue of a particular band or artist. Mamma Mia and its sequel were huge box office smashes, while Bohemian Rhapsody took home four Oscars earlier this year.Movie trailers nowadays can be instantly dissected and dismissed by Twitter, the immediacy of which means a film can suffer an instant backlash long before it's even hit cinemas.The Cats trailer was a victim of this recently, with fans complaining about the appearance of some of the characters. And Feig's own Ghostbusters reboot became YouTube's most disliked movie trailer after a concerted campaign by fans of the original to vote it down.Does the critical world of social media make directors like Feig more nervous about trailer premieres now?""I mean, you get nervous for everything that comes out, you get nervous when the poster comes out, when the trailer comes out, when the movie comes out. But that's why we have taken our time to get this out, because we wanted to get it right.""But I'm at the point now, where, where I'm just excited to get it out there because we spent so long kind of wringing our hands and going, 'is this right? Try this, try that'.""So now we throw it to the internet and see what they say. Everybody kind of likes to take their shots at people in showbiz, but I would like to say that our intentions are completely pure. We're never like, 'alright, let's see what these suckers will go for'. It's like, 'Oh, we love this. We can't wait to share this with you', we're really proud of it.'""The trailer received a broadly positive response on social media after its premiere on Wednesday morning:This movie combines all of my interests (seasonal hijinks! Romantic trysts with Henry Golding! Emilia Clarke’s eyebrows! A heartbreaking backstory! “Written by Emma Thompson”!) and I am here 🎄for 🎄 it 🎄 #LastChristmasMovie pic.twitter.com/SPiTwS77oJEnd of Twitter post by @AshleyySpencerI...CAN'T...WAIT... #LastChristmasMovie pic.twitter.com/XXCa3uqIj4End of Twitter post by @ClarkeTforLYFE#LastChristmasMovie I adore british films and love Christmas films ...but this dont look too good.

entertainment	'Why can only guys make movies?'	Empowered	"In the almost 72-year history of the Cannes Film Festival only one female director, Jane Campion, has ever won the prestigious Palme d'Or prize for best film.Furthermore, just 86 movies by female directors have ever been in competition for the festival's main prize, compared with more than 1,650 films by male directors.This year, the 21 film shortlist features a joint record four women, showing how far the event - which boasts the late feminist director Agnès Varda as its poster girl - has to go in terms of gender equality.However, delve a little deeper into the festival programme and there's no shortage of talented women telling their stories, with those from Latin America leading the charge.Melina Leon last week became the first female director from Peru to be invited to premiere a film at Cannes - and her black and white production, Song Without a Name (Cancione Sin Nombre), has been mentioned by many critics as worthy of winning The Caméra d'Or, or Golden Camera, awarded to the best feature by a first-time director.The film, which premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section, is set in the politically turbulent Peru of the 1980s and follows Georgina, a young indigenous woman from the Andes, whose newborn daughter is stolen from a health clinic.Leon arrived a year after star protests led Cannes to sign up to a 50:50 gender parity pledge, balancing its 2019 jury and selection committee accordingly; and the festival has hosted a series of talks about 'Women in Motion'.She welcomes conversations around the issue, even if they're difficult.""Just the fact that we're talking about it [is good],"" she tells the BBC. ""It might be uncomfortable - but everything that requires change is going to be uncomfortable and there's going to be be confrontation.""There's so many female students of film and then when it comes to making the first [full-length] feature it's only the guys - why?""Unfortunately we don't get the opportunity. There's only I believe 10 per cent of films by women, so how could you choose 50?""But yeah, the fact that the juries that are mixed, I think that's great. For many years, that wasn't a concern here or anywhere.""The Peruvian writer/director, who is calling out for 'rebel spirits', adds: ""I hope over time we get more opportunities to make more movies so we can really demand 50;50. Of course go for quality, not just gender, but we need the opportunity to make [films] so our work can be judged!""There is this prejudice that we are not good enough, that it's not a work women can do because it's such a stress to handle big budgets and if we don't have enough females in the crews, especially photographers...""There's not gonna be change if all the parts don't come together.""In the first week of the festival, French-Senegalese director Mati Diop became the first black female director to premiere a film in competition (Atlantics), and at the press conference for opening movie, The Dead Don't Die, actor Tilda Swinton declared that top female filmmakers were clearly out there, whether they were being recognised and written about or not.Swinton said: ""I would remind us that women have been making films for 11 decades now, there are countless films out there by women.""The question is: Why do we not necessarily know about them?""We need to look at the canon and appreciate it and screen it and we need to buy tickets for films by women.""It all exists we just have to really pay attention to it and bring it all up.""One woman on the way up is Sofía Quirós, who holds the fresh ""honour"" of becoming the only female director to have a feature film competing in International Critics' Week - which runs parallel to Cannes - and the first from Costa Rica.Her film, Land of Ashes (Ceniza Negra) is based on a short film she brought to Cannes a few years ago and tells the story of 13-year-old Selva - played by first-time actor Smachleen Gutiérrez - and how she learns about life through the death of her closest family members.The director, who studied filmmaking in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aries and prefers to work with non-actors says it's ""very strange"" to be the only woman up for the alternative prize, noting that her own country has made huge strides towards achieving equality in the arts.""In Costa Rica we have a very special case, as almost all the best directors and producers are girls,"" she says.""Our country is a special thing, we are in a bubble, It's such an honour to see the girls in our country are so empowered and so professional. But then I go outside and it's another thing, you know? It's difficult.""The 29-year-old believes opportunities for her came about after many of her country's male directors focused on more commercial ventures, allowing the girls to ""shine on the international area"" with more ""sensitive art house films"".Like Leon before her though, she still sees many women ""disappear"" after the short film stage, before getting the chance to attempt a feature length movie.That's borne out by Cannes' programme - where 26 per cent of the full-length films submitted this year were made by women. In the short film section, that figure rose to 32 per cent, while it was 44 per cent in the category for student films.Quiros was keen therefore to surround herself with female colleagues while making her film, to help inspire greater opportunities.""For me it was a very free process,"" she says. ""I feel very comfortable with them, they were all friends and we decided to make a process with a lot of freedom, working with non-actors in a creative group since the beginning, all saying things about the script and the photography.""I feel [I was able to do it] because I have this team of girls working with me since from the first years.""Cannes' closing ceremony takes place on Saturday, with the big announcement of the Palme d'Or winner. And while neither newcomers Quiros or Leon find themselves in the running yet, look out for their names and more emerging female filmmakers in the near future.The names Diop, Jessica Hausner, Celine Sciamma, and Justine Triet are on that most esteemed of lists but with 17 men also up for the award (including Quentin Tarantino, Ken Loach and Pedro Almodóvar), as ever at Cannes, the odds remain stacked against them.Could this year be the year?"
entertainment	Entourage movie 'not misogynistic'	'Sexist place''Shallow hedonism''Created a monster'	"""I feel like there's been a weird backlash from the critics. I find it laughable,"" says Entourage creator and the movie's director, Doug Ellin.Ellin, who is also behind the film's script, is referring to the disappointing reviews that the big screen instalment of the HBO show has received.The movie picks up where the eighth season hit series left off when it wrapped in 2011. The comedy-drama tells the story of movie star Vincent Chase, his actor half-brother Johnny Drama, manager Eric ""E"", and driver-turned-entrepreneur, Turtle .The series saw the posse relocate from Queen's to Los Angeles, where Vince is represented by explosive super agent Ari Gold, played by Jeremy Piven, who describes him as ""an equal opportunity offender - he offends everyone around him.""The film's plot turns to Vince's decision to direct as well as star in a new movie that will also be Ari's first venture as studio chief.The series was considered by many to be a male fantasy with the gang hanging out on super yachts and private jets, driving fast cars and dating super models - themes that continue to dominate throughout the movie, to the frustration of some critics.Brandon Judell, of The Huffington Post, remarks that the movie ""appears to have been conceived by a gaggle of misogynistic, beer-chugging adolescent virgins who brag about getting laid"".But Emmanuelle Chriqui, who plays the movie's lead female character, E's on-off girlfriend Sloane, says ""the depiction of the bikini-clad women and hangers-on is real.""""Obviously this has come up a lot, and it's interesting for me to respond to it because I totally consider myself to be a feminist.""""Hollywood is a very sexist place where we as women are objectified a lot. To act, in the movie, like that doesn't exist would be absurd.""She adds that the key female roles in the show - studio executive Dana Gordon, publicist Shauna Roberts, Gold's domineering wife Melissa and herself - are ""strong, intelligent, ballsy and fierce women.""Piven remarks: ""I can't control the fact that women were throwing themselves at Vinny Chase as do women with movie stars in Hollywood. It's out there.""After the 2008 market crash and subsequent recession, critics have also been quick to dismiss the gang's lavish lifestyle as somewhat dated, or crass.""You could accuse it of glamorising the shallow hedonism it depicts, but that charge would only stick if the movie had any genuine flair, romance or imagination,"" says A O Scott of the New York Times.But Ellin says that ""you can't adjust a movie star's life based on the economy. The truth is, their lives don't change.""""Through all the recessions, people have always wanted escapist entertainment. These characters came from modest means and they are enjoying their success. It is something to aspire to.""Kevin Connolly, who plays ""E"", is also quick to point out that Entourage should be taken as ""a heightened reality… we never wanted to be too political. We just wanted to have fun.""Four years have passed since the team were all together last but Kevin Dillon, whose character Johnny Drama gets a big break starring in the new movie that his brother is directing, says that as soon as they started running lines filming ""was a breeze"".Jerry Ferrara's Turtle, who became a millionaire at the end of the TV series with stocks in a successful tequila brand, has a love interest in Ultimate Fighting Champion Ronda Rousey. ""I was scared for you,"" jokes Dillon about Ferrara getting in the fighting ring for a physical scene with Rousey.""I just thought there was something about her that had an amazing star quality,"" says Ellin, on the casting choice. ""She's beautiful and can obviously kill everybody too!""Rousey is one of a plethora of big name cameos including Pharrell Williams, Liam Neeson, Tom Brady, Kelsey Grammer and Jessica Alba, who Ellin points out appear in the movie for free - ""they come because they're fans and they like it.""Despite the movie under performing at the US Box Office - it came in fourth in its opening weekend, bringing in just $10.4m - talk of a movie sequel is positive, with all cast members declaring their interest, bar one.Piven's performance as Ari Gold has received the most praise from critics but he is reluctant to commit.""You have to know when to leave the fair. I really tried to move on from this, especially to do Mr Selfridge.""I thought this movie's script was so good that it would be fun to go back and investigate it, but I didn't miss playing Ari at all. Not for an instant. Even if I stumbled upon it on television, I wouldn't watch it.""This, he says, is in part down to the characterisation of his uber-offensive movie mogul, which conflicts with Piven's Jewish-Buddhist belief system.""Having confidence and a distinct purpose (like Ari) is beautiful, but to treat people badly and to dress them down is not something that I would teach anyone to do.""I feel like I've created a monster. I'm not inspired by him at all."""
entertainment	Julianne Moore movie sees women 'call the shots'		"The lack of diversity within the film industry has been the major talking point of 2016. Yet, when statistics show only a fifth of films have a female protagonist, and women directors are outnumbered nine to one in Hollywood, along comes Maggie's Plan - a movie written and directed by a woman, and with two female stars.Julianne Moore and Greta Gerwig star in Rebecca Miller's comedy about a woman who decides to get her partner back with his ex-wife. Moore says: ""It's about the fallacy that we can control our lives and our relationships, to produce a certain result. It doesn't work that way.""Gerwig plays Maggie, the control-freak heroine, who begins the film planning to find a sperm donor as she thinks it's the right time to have a child, while Ethan Hawke plays the married lecturer she falls for. Moore takes on the role of ex-wife Georgette, a slightly eccentric Danish-born New Yorker.Nevertheless, the film's script centres around the two female leads - still a rare thing, according to the Geena Davis Institute of Gender in Media, which in 2014 found that only 23% of films had a leading female character.Moore says it ""was women calling the shots in this picture"".""It's refreshing,"" she says. ""It was very female-heavy on set, and that's what happens when you have a woman, in this case Rebecca, at the helm.""""Ethan Hawke told me he has made around 40 films but that I was the first woman director he had worked with,"" says Miller.""I suppose that gives you an idea of where we are with the statistics, of the ratio of working female directors to male.""""There's been a lot of talk about diversity in film-making this year, and the only way that will happen is if you have diverse kinds of film-makers,"" says Moore.""When you talk about a story being told from a female point of view, it's generally because a woman has written it or is telling that story.""An Oscar winner for her depiction of a woman with Alzheimer's disease in Still Alice in 2015, the actress also worked with Lisa Chodolenko on the critically acclaimed 2010 drama The Kids Are All Right, which focused on the story of a lesbian couple.Since then, Moore believes she has ""met more female directors than before... [but] there's a long way to go"".""Having this conversation in itself is a significant change,"" she says.However, while other successful actresses, including Angelina Jolie and Elizabeth Banks, have also made the leap into directing, Moore is less keen.""I feel like I would rather do a project first and then announce it later, rather than announce it first and never do it,"" she says.New York-based Miller, who is also a novelist, says she found the idea in a book by Karen Rinaldi, The End of Men, which the author sent her before finding a publisher.""It had the story of Maggie and the switch she tries to make, and I thought it was a fabulous idea and one I should try to adapt,"" she says.""Karen's story was more serious, but I thought the premise was wonderfully absurd.""I added storylines and characters on from there. I think the look I really wanted was from those screwball romantic comedies of the 1940s.""Moore says she rarely gets offered comedy scripts and therefore deciding whether to do Maggie's Plan was ""a bit of a no-brainer"".She says: ""Rebecca and I have been friends for so long, I had a small part in The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, which Rebecca also directed. We live in the same neighbourhood, we have kids the same age, we've even both been with our respective husbands for around 20 years.""But this isn't an average comedy. Rebecca's very smart; she wanted to make a very romantic comedy that takes in the complications of modern life. One of those is the breakdown of relationships, and though I am not an expert on it, ask anyone who's been divorced, and they'll tell you it's miserable.""Relationships are challenging, and I think that it's important not to be black and white about something. I think some people make it through and some people don't, and some people split up and wish they hadn't split up. That's why the film is so clever.""Society is chaotic - we try and put all these structures in place, including time, to try and make sense of it all, but really all these different orders like community, government, religion - they are just ways to try and figure out the chaos.""The actress will next work with director Todd Haynes, on her fourth project with him, a film called Wonderstruck, based on a novel. She says ""there's no grand strategy with my work, although it was lovely to be given the Oscar last year"".""It's nice to think that your name was on a list and people had to tick the box and bothered to vote for you,"" she says.""I never even had a plan with making any of my films, or a career plan, just to tell interesting stories - and I am not sure that any of my films have anything in common, there's no correlation between them.""And I wouldn't say there's a correlation between myself and any of the characters I've played either. So it's an interesting supposition, that Maggie can make a plan in life. Poor Maggie doesn't have a chance.""Maggie's Plan is released in UK cinemas on 8 July.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

entertainment	Toronto 2019: Michael B Jordan's 'responsibility' on Just Mercy		"Michael B Jordan has described the ""huge responsibility"" he felt while playing a real-life lawyer who represents black inmates on death row.The actor's latest film Just Mercy premiered in Toronto on Friday.Jordan plays Bryan Stevenson, an Alabama lawyer who defends inmates who have been wrongly accused or not afforded proper legal representation.""I wanted to do whatever I could to get this story out to the masses,"" Jordan told BBC News.""Bryan Stevenson is an extremely important man, he's a national treasure. So whatever I can do to help this man do his job, if this movie is a tool for him, I feel like I've contributed a little bit.""The big screen adaptation of Stevenson's 2014 memoir - Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption - is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and also stars Oscar winners Jamie Foxx and Brie Larson.The film sees Foxx play Walter McMillan, a man imprisoned after being accused of the murder of a young white woman, despite evidence which proved his innocence.He is placed on death row a year before he has actually been put on trial, and is one of the inmates whose case is taken on by Stevenson.More from Toronto""Being from the south, having gone through certain things myself gives me the DNA of what this is about,"" Foxx said on the red carpet.But, he stressed: ""They tested the movie with an all-black audience and it tested at 97 [out of 100], and then they tested it with an all-white audience and it tested at 98. So it lets you know people are ready to see it and feel it.""Stevenson told BBC News: ""I think we've heard the data, we've heard the statistics, but we haven't really understood what it means to be the nation with the highest rate of incarceration in the world. To be a nation that condemns people wrongly and unfairly.""It's only when you see what happens up close, the trauma, the abuse, that I think you're motivated to demand change.""I'm really hoping the film mobilises people, energises people, encourages people to expect more from our systems of justice, that too often treat you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. I'm hoping the film will wake people up to that reality.""The lawyer and author joked: ""I told Michael B Jordan he could keep his Black Panther body when he played me, I didn't want him going on a diet or anything!""Jordan admitted: ""Four years ago, when I first got approached for the project, I didn't know that much about the work he was doing down in Alabama. So I took that as a personal challenge.""The actor is well known for portraying Erik Killmonger in Black Panther - the hugely successful Marvel movie which also starred Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong'o. Jordan has also starred in Creed and That Awkward Moment.Just Mercy received broadly positive early reviews after its Canadian debut on Friday night, with several critics making reference to its potential in awards season.""In what is already shaping up to be a fierce competition in the lead and supporting male acting categories, Jordan and Foxx just entered the race,"" said Marc Malkin in Variety.""A couple of Foxx's scenes are transfixing enough to make you hold your breath without realising it,"" added John DeFoe in The Hollywood Reporter.But, he said: ""The big courtroom moments the film constructs for Stevenson, by contrast, sound like prepackaged American idealism. That's not to deny that every thing he says is 100% true; but speeches don't always make for great movies, even in courtrooms where they beg to be delivered.""Writing in IndieWire, Eric Kohn said the film's main storyline ""doesn't contain nearly enough twists to justify the 136-minute runtime, especially given how many of its circumstances are predetermined"".He concluded: ""It may not be groundbreaking cinema - but as a celebration of what it takes to eke out justice in a broken system, it's a welcome return to formula."""
entertainment	Lego movie sequel release date delayed until 2019	Award-winning	"The release date for The Lego Movie sequel has been pushed back nine months to February 2019.No reason has been given by Warner Brothers for the delay, according to the Hollywood Reporter.The original movie, based on the famous toy bricks, was a surprise box office hit in 2014.It made more than $468m (£294m) worldwide and a sequel was soon announced with a release date of May 2018.The next Lego film to open will be the Lego Batman film, which is scheduled to open in February 2017.It will be followed by Ninjago, which is based on the Lego ninja characters, in September 2017.When the line up of three Lego films was announced in 2015, Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution at Warner Brothers, said the three films were ""just the beginning of a creative and diverse animation slate that will be delighting audiences for years to come.""The original animation starred Chris Pratt as an everyday Lego figure who has to save the universe.The film won the best animation Bafta.Speaking after their win in 2015, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who wrote and directed the film, admitted they were behind schedule writing the follow-up.They told BBC Newsbeat a heavy workload and the fact they were control freaks were to blame.The storyline for the sequel has not been revealed but speaking in 2014, Lord and Miller said they will create more female role models for the sequel.""It's important to us that the movie plays broadly and that we inspire young women as much as we inspire young men,"" Lord told the BBC.Asked what female roles were planned for Lego Movie 2, Miller said: ""I don't want to give spoilers but there will be more female characters and more female stuff."""
entertainment	Toronto 2019: Renee Zellweger gets standing ovation for Judy Garland role		"A new film based on the life of Judy Garland has been warmly welcomed at the Toronto Film Festival.Renee Zellweger plays the titular role in Judy, which is released in the UK next month.Set in 1968, the film follows Garland as she was battling addiction issues and struggling financially.""In 15 years at #TIFF I have never seen a standing ovation like the one for Renee Zellweger at Judy,"" said Variety's Jenelle Riley.After sustained applause, Zellweger joked: ""OK quit it - you're messing up my make-up!""The film sees Garland launch a residency in London as she tries to get her life and finances back on track. But she was in a fragile state of mind and behaving erratically in the final months of her life - something the film does not shy away from.Garland eventually died of an overdose aged 47, six months after her London shows ended.The film features flashbacks to her time filming The Wizard of Oz, which suggest her addiction issues started young and were not helped by those around her.The audience response in Toronto follows warm reviews for the film from critics and is likely to put Zellweger in the frame for a potential Oscar nomination.""Her transformation is quite astonishing here, and the extended sequences at the Palladium demonstrate her ability to recreate Garland's physicality and mannerisms,"" said Fionnuala Halligan in Screen Daily.""The casting makes bittersweet sense,"" added Guy Lodge in Variety. ""A onetime American sweetheart who relinquished the burdensome title, she plays Garland, with palpable affection and feeling, as one who's been over the rainbow and back again.""Vanity Fair's K Austin Collins said: ""Judy isn't visionary or perfect, but it convinces us of its ideas - and it's a fine scaffolding for Zellweger, already a potential awards contender for reasons that seem obvious.""Collins addsed: ""What I hope doesn't get lost in the inevitable awards melee - with the way it flattens films and actors into worthy or not, ""likely"" or not - is a sense of how utterly idiosyncratic Zellweger's performance is.""Zellweger has previously won best supporting actress at the Oscars, for her performance in Cold Mountain in 2004, but she is perhaps better known for her leading roles in the hugely successful Bridget Jones films and Chicago - which won best picture at the 2003 Academy Awards.British actor Royce Pierreson, who has starred in Murdered By My Boyfriend, Line of Duty and forthcoming Netflix series The Witcher, plays Garland's pianist and musical director in the film.More from Toronto:He told BBC News the cast tried to ignore the weight of expectation on the movie as it was being filmed.""As it went on, you do hear buzz, and you do hear things from outside, but when you're working on a project, everybody's so focused on it,"" he said.""Especially here, there was so much concentration and focus on creating this world and depicting it as truthfully as possible. You kind of forget about everything else.""It's only when you finish and you're away from it. You look back in hindsight and think Yeah, yeah, actually, that was as a whole really special experience.""Much press attention has focused on Zellweger and her tendency to stay in character while filming.The movie's costume designer Jany Temime told Vulture: ""Renee was extremely emotionally and artistically involved in Judy. It was her film. I think she really got into Judy's skin.""""We didn't call her Judy on set or anything, but she was pretty much transformed from the time we were called till we wrapped, so I rarely saw her step out,"" said Finn Wittrock, who plays Garland's fifth and final husband.""But it was like all the great sides of Judy and none of the diva because she was kind of a social butterfly. The AD [assistant director] would come get her to take her to set, and she would stop five times because she was asking the grip [camera operator] how his dog was. That kind of person.""He added: ""She was always in the wig and had a bit of a prosthetic nose and dark contacts. It wasn't till the wrap party that she came out and she was blonde and wearing a stunning dress, and I was like, Oh, right. That's the movie star.""Pierreson agrees, describing Zellweger as the ""most inclusive and generous actor"" he has ever worked with.""I was lucky to have a few scenes with her. And we shared quite a lot of screen time together. And she was she was incredibly inclusive.""When there was something not right, she would / we would find a way to get to that point without without making it untruthful. And I learned a lot from her and she stayed in character all the time I knew her. But she was still incredibly easy to connect with and learn from and ask a question to.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	He-Man: Clerks director Kevin Smith to revive 80s series for Netflix		"By the power of Grayskull! Clerks filmmaker Kevin Smith is teaming up with Netflix to revive the He-Man and Masters of the Universe series.The early 80s animated franchise started life as a Mattel toy range inspired by the success of the Star Wars action figures.It was later turned into a film starring Rocky actor Dolph Lundgren.Last year, Netflix premiered She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, a spin-off praised for its LGBT representation.""This is the Masters of the Universe story you always wanted to see as a kid!"" Smith told the audience at the annual Power-Con convention in California at the weekend.The series premise revolved around the conflict between heroic He-Man aka ""the most powerful man in the universe"" and the evil sorcerer Skeletor on the planet Eternia,""I'm Eternia-ly grateful to Mattel TV and Netflix for entrusting me with not only the secrets of Grayskull, but also their entire Universe,"" Smith added.The new series, Masters of the Universe: Revelation, will apparently pick up where the original animated series left off and will use Japanese anime-style animation.Smith will serve as showrunner and executive producer while Mattel Television will act as producers.The 1987 movie, which also starred Frank Langella and a pre-Friends Courteney Cox, was a critical and commercial flop which failed to earn back its reported $22m budget.But the film has since attained cult status among some fans and the characters remain popular, even appearing in a recent British TV advert which saw enemies He-man and Skeletor recreate the climactic dance scene from the movie Dirty Dancing.Twenty-two-year-old actor Noah Centineo confirmed earlier this year that he has been cast as the musclebound hero in a live action remake of Masters of the Universe.He told The Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon: ""It's quite an opportunity.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Alex Scarrow's virus thriller inspired by 1950s B-movie	'Film nerd''Fan fiction is a gateway to writing'	"An eyeball stares in terror. A crab-like creature flexes a menacing claw.Welcome to the terrifying front cover of Remade - author Alex Scarrow's latest young adult thriller, about a virus that wipes out most of humanity.""The idea originally sprang from something I saw as a toddler,"" Scarrow says when we meet at his publishers in London, in a room adorned with freshly printed copies of his new book.""There was a film I saw called The H-Man - a classic 50s B-movie where radiation zaps a guy and everyone he touches they liquidise. I saw that as five-year-old, and it stayed with me every since.""Remade tells the story of teenager Leon and his younger sister, Grace, who are adjusting to life in London after moving from New York with their mother when reports of a virus in Africa begin to fill the news.""As I was writing it there were Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, and I did wonder whether I should dial it back a bit,"" says Scarrow. ""You should see the first draft.""As the virus spreads rapidly across the world, turning people into pools of sticky liquid, Scarrow does not skimp on the horror.Some images - such as one involving a man melting in a toilet cubicle - are likely to haunt the reader long after the book is finished.""When I had this concept mapped out, I thought there is no avoiding those scenes,"" Scarrow says, ""which means leaving you with images that are going to trouble you.""Formerly a rock guitarist and computer games designer, Scarrow had his first adult book, A Thousand Suns, published in 2005.But he is best known for Time Riders, his series of nine young adult novels about a group of teenagers recruited to a secret agency to prevent time travel destroying history.Its various nods to The Terminator are further evidence of the strong influence of film culture on Scarrow's work.""For a number of years, I was trying to break into the movie industry,"" he says. ""Before books, I was writing scripts, and my background is computer games, so visual mediums are in my DNA.""I was writing Time Riders for my son, who was 10 at the time, like me a bit of a film nerd but not a great reader.""So I was looking for hooks that would encourage him to read.""Scarrow estimates his readership for Time Riders is a 50-50 split between boys and girls.""Getting boys to read is a really tough gig, and, so, you have to play every trick in the book,"" he says.""In Time Riders, I was deploying a lot of my games-design tools - for instance instant rewards and short chapters.""You've got to make it as visual an experience as possible, which is hard because it's like making a chocolate milkshake taste like a strawberry milkshake. But it can be done.""Scarrow, who lives in Norwich with his family, likes to write his novels in one of the city's coffee shops.""I used to write at home, but I got terribly lonely,"" he says.""My routine tends to be a large cappuccino and a triple chocolate muffin, and, by the time both have gone, I've usually written 1,500 words - and then it's back home to put up a shelf.""Remade will be a three-book series. Scarrow is already half-way through writing book two and says he had the entire story mapped out from the start.""I know other writers who can wing it, but, me, I'm a meticulous planner. I can't do anything without knowing exactly how it all goes.""He spent two years plotting Time Riders - which equals a lot of frothy coffee and cake.""I actually wrote the last chapter of the last book before I started writing Time Riders because that way you've got a direction of travel,"" he says.""It's bit like coding. You need to know what the structure is before you write that first line of code.""Scarrow reveals that although the Time Riders came to an end with the publication of The Infinity Cage in 2014, he may not be finished with the series.""I deliberately left book nine as the last of the series with the door open partly because one thing I really wanted to encourage was fan fiction,"" he says..""I think it's a great way to get writers into writing - start with someone else's idea and run with it, and, then, pretty soon, you'll have your own ideas.""Fan fiction is a gateway to writing. I wanted an ending that would stimulate fans to go and write their own book 10 or 11.""He says the fan fiction started as ""a slow trickle"" but now he gets ""a few every day"" posted on his website.""The quality varies, sometimes it's bad and sometimes it's so good I think I need to raise my game,"" he says.""Now, 18 months later, I'm coming back and thinking, 'I want to write that fan fiction now,' and write book 10 and perhaps even set up a new series.""Both Time Riders and Remade seem obvious candidates for screen adaptation. Scarrow says there are ""interested parties"" but is tight-lipped on detail.""All I can say is, 'We are in conversation with...' - it's like trying to herd cats,"" he says.""There's the finance to raise, talent to find, and trying to get all these things to line up like stars in the sky.""Having spent 10 years playing in bands, does he ever regret not being a rock star?""The obvious answer would be yes, but actually no,"" Scarrow says.""I was watching something on TV about band reunions. If I'd made it, here I would be in my 50s with shelves of DVDs and videos of me when I was young and beautiful.""How agonising must that be? I think I dodged a bullet.""I'm really lucky to have success late in life rather than early. I'm old enough to appreciate it. I'm grateful for life dealing me that hand.""Remade, published by Macmillan Children's Books, is out now"
entertainment	Roland Emmerich defends 'personal' Stonewall movie		"Known as cinema's ""master of disaster"", director Roland Emmerich has moved away from his apocalyptical blockbusters such as 2012 and Independence Day to a project he describes as ""deeply personal"" - a self-funded movie about the start of the gay rights movement.Stonewall, a fictional account of rioting by the gay community in New York's Greenwich Village in 1969, premiered at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, with Emmerich saying he was ""deeply relieved"" that the whole film had been shown to audiences.When the trailer for Stonewall was released in June, many in the LGBT community called it a ""whitewash"" of history, as Emmerich's main character, Danny, played by War Horse's Jeremy Irvine, is a blond blue-eyed boy from Indiana.An online petition collected nearly 25,000 signatures calling for its boycott, stating that the riots were a ""multicultural movement"" with transgender woman Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, Storm DeLarverie, an African-American lesbian, and Sylvia Rivera, a Puerto-Rican drag queen acknowledged as some of its central protagonists.""It's a good thing the film is out there now, but I never quite understood the fuss,"" Emmerich says.""It was a trailer, and people always complain that trailers show everything. We didn't want to make that mistake.""But it clearly was a big mistake for some people out there. The film is racially and sexually far more diverse than some people appear to think.""""It's just a trailer,"" Irvine adds, ""but it's perhaps misleading because there's a second in there where my character throws a stone and it might look like he starts the Stonewall riots, but nothing could be further than the truth.""Many of the real-life activists of the time are characters in the film. It's been taken out of context.""The police raid at the Stonewall Inn on 28 June 1969, started three days of rioting from the gay community who frequented the bar, and led directly to the instigation of the gay Pride marches the following year.German-born Emmerich, who is openly gay, believes its significance as part of the civil rights movement is often overlooked.""Over the years I realised how little people knew about the riots, and this is actually the event that started everything - and it was a group of homeless kids at the centre of it.""I work with the gay and lesbian centre in Los Angeles and I realised this little known fact - that around 40% of homeless youths in the United States are LGBT.""The problem on the streets hasn't changed since 1969. We may have gay marriage now, but most of these homeless kids come from the small towns where growing up gay is still terribly difficult, and I wanted this story at the heart of the film.""Above all, I wanted to make a movie that felt personal - the ones I normally do, not that I hate to do them, but they are not very personal. They have to appeal to nearly everyone and this is a different approach.""It was the first time on a film set that I was able to tell a straight actor like Jeremy how he should feel as a gay man. I put a lot of emotion into making this movie.""The 59-year-old director also put a lot of his own personal finance into the film, which had a budget of around $15m (£9.8m) - a far cry from the $200m (£131m) that he commanded for 2012.Emmerich says ""not one studio in Hollywood wanted to make the movie, we had to do it totally independently and that was much harder work.""I had forgotten how hard it was, it's much easier to have a studio behind you, and I guess I've had it easy because of my past success.""When Ang Lee's Oscar-winning Brokeback Mountain was made a decade ago, it was considered a potentially risky project for its stars, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.If Emmerich says he still struggled with the studios, Irvine believes the situation has changed drastically for actors.He says lesbian actress Ellen Page was right to say in a recent interview that she was ""bored"" of straight actors being called ""brave"" for taking on a homosexual role.""Stonewall was a no brainer for me,"" says Irvine.""Good scripts are few and far between, and when I read it, I jumped on a plane and went to Roland with a stack of notes and ideas.""Am I worried about doing a 'straight' movie with an actress I am not attracted to? No. It's exactly the same thing. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is in this film as my love interest, and I could have done a lot worse.""Will 2015 be the year gay cinema becomes mainstream? As well as Stonewall, Julianne Moore and Ellen Page star as a lesbian couple in Freeheld.Todd Haynes's Carol, starring Cate Blanchett, examines a forbidden lesbian relationship in the 1940s.Eddie Redmayne plays a transgender woman in The Danish Girl - which is being released by Universal studios.Emmerich says it's ""the year of the transgender person - it started with Caitlyn Jenner on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine"".His next movie, Independence Day: Resurgence, the long-awaited sequel to the 1996 original, will feature gay characters, Emmerich adds.""But we're not even close to the day when a gay person in a movie is not an issue,"" he concludes.""The time when we don't discuss it is a long time in the future. We may have marriage now, but in terms of the gay civil rights movement, we have just got started, I really believe that.""Stonewall is yet to receive a UK release date."
entertainment	No heroes for Denmark's A War movie		"In the heat of battle in Helmand province, Afghanistan, an army commander with an exemplary military record has to choose to save the life of one of his men, or a group of local civilians. He chooses his soldier. On his return home, he faces charges for unlawful killing. This is the scenario at the heart of A War, this year's Danish Academy Awards entry.A War is made by Tobias Lindholm, who co-wrote the political TV series Borgen, and who also made acclaimed Danish film A Hi-Jacking. Lindholm cites Michael Cimino's 1978 Vietnam war movie The Deer Hunter as his biggest influence for this project.But Game of Thrones and Borgen actor Pilou Asbaek, who plays commander Claus Michael Pedersen, believes A War ""heralds a new type of war film - one where there are no heroes"".Denmark, working with the USA and UK, deployed troops in Afghanistan from 2001 until 2013. The director says he wants ""to provoke a conversation - not a debate - about how the Danes, both positively and negatively, contributed to the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our war involvement has defined my generation"".Criminal charges against troops deployed in both Afghanistan and Iraq are not uncommon - this week the Iraq Historic Allegation team, set up by the UK Ministry of Defence, said that British soldiers could face prosecution for their actions, including murder charges, in as many as 150 cases.In 2013, Royal Marine Alexander Blackman received a life sentence for the murder of an Afghan fighter.But Lindholm says his film was not inspired by any one real life military case, rather ""the obsession of our world with right and wrong"".""Reality is far more complex. Is it wrong to let your buddy die on the ground when you could save him? Yes. Is it wrong to let a group of defenceless civilians die instead? Yes. Faced with that choice, who can say what is the right thing to do?""We want everything to be simple - and now we want to get to the heart of a situation in less than 140 characters on Twitter, in a Facebook update, in a politician's soundbite on the evening news.""We want punishment for mistakes, and this obsession with simplicity is hiding the true complexity of human life. So there are no heroes in my film - just humans.""Only three professional actors, including Asbaek, were employed for the war scenes, which were shot in Turkey. Instead Lindholm employed Danish troops who had served in Afghanistan, as well as Afghan refugees.""I use actors for acting, but no one can march and hold a gun as well as a soldier who has done it thousands of times before,"" says Lindholm.""Even in the court scenes, I employed a real-life judge, who knew how to control a courtroom.""Unusually, A War also shows Pedersen's wife at home in Denmark, played by Swedish actress Tuva Novotny. Struggling to bring up her three children at home alone, Novotny says that for the first time ""a woman left at home has her point of view told"".""When you have to keep your family together, when your kids only get to speak to their father down a crackly phone line, what does that do to you? So you may have no experience of war, but you might understand how that feels.""""My wife cried when she saw that part of the film,"" continues Asbaek. ""Because she understands all too well about being on her own while I am away. Quite a few of the military couples to whom we showed the film were in tears, as they had an insight of what each other's lives were really like for the first time.""Lindholm adds that, to him, the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are ""unique in that no one was quite sure what the mission was"".""It's not to protect our borders or to save our own families, but we asked young people to fly over to the other side of the world, to do what? Build democracy? Win hearts and minds? A lot of the soldiers I spoke to really didn't know. Yet all of them told me that after 10 years of tours of duty, they had all changed immeasurably as human beings.""As Denmark's Oscar entry, and with wide critical praise across Scandinavia, Asbaek hopes A War will help the public understand the consequences of any decision to go to war.""There is a part in the film where an Afghan man says to my character, 'it's all right for you - your children are not in danger as they sleep at night'. But as human beings, we are all living with the consequences of these political decisions and perhaps it's time that we all - Britain and the US as well as Denmark - sit and figure out what we did.""A War is on release in the UK."
entertainment	Saoirse Ronan to star in Chesil Beach movie		"Oscar-nominated actress Saoirse Ronan is to star in a movie version of the bestselling novel On Chesil Beach.The 2007 Booker Prize shortlisted novel by Ian McEwan is set in 1962 and tells the story of young newly-weds on honeymoon on the Dorset coast.Ronan - up for the best actress Oscar for Brooklyn - will play the young wife Florence but her co-star, playing her husband Edward, is yet to be announced.The film will be Ronan's second McEwan adaptation after 2007's Atonement.Atonement, which also starred Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, won Ronan her first Oscar nomination and was directed by Joe Wright.She was up for best supporting actress for playing the little Briony Tallis whose misunderstanding of a situation she unwittingly witnesses leads to the tragic events that drive the story on.On Chesil Beach will be led by the theatre director Dominic Cooke, who was formerly the artistic director of London's Royal Court theatre.And the production company will be Number 9 Films, the team behind the award-winning Carol, whose star Cate Blanchett and co-star Rooney Mara are also in the running for best actress and best supporting actress Academy Awards.Producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Stephen Woolley said of their new project: ""It's an extremely exciting prospect to be reunited with Saoirse Ronan on such a beautiful and heartbreaking project.""Ronan previously worked with the production company on the 2012 film Byzantium, a drama also set in a remote coastal location.McEwan's story, which some class as a novella since it is only just over 200 pages long, is set on the laconic beach of the title, where Florence and Edward are staying in a modest hotel.Chesil Beach, a real and well-known location, is famous for its 18-mile length, of which much is separated from the mainland by a sea-salt lagoon, and the special quality of its stones.This is the first time McEwan's story has been adapted for the screen. The same is true of Brooklyn, which is a film taken from a novel by Irish author Colm Toibin.Filming for On Chesil Beach will begin this autumn.Before then, Ronan will next be seen on stage in The Crucible on Broadway from 1 March."
entertainment	Joker and Roman Polanski win at Venice festival		"Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix, has taken the top Golden Lion prize at the Venice Film Festival.Director Todd Phillips' film about the comic villain, starring Joaquin Phoenix, is already being tipped for the Oscars.Roman Polanski won the Grand Jury Prize for An Officer and a Spy, despite controversy over its inclusion.The director was convicted of statutory rape in 1978 and has faced various other allegations of sexual assault.Polanski did not attend the ceremony. His wife Emmanuelle Seigner, who stars in the film, took to the stage instead.The chair of the jury, Argentine director Lucrezia Martel, had previously defended the film's inclusion, while admitting it made her ""uncomfortable""""I will not congratulate him, but I think it is correct that his movie is here at this festival,"" she said during the festival's opening press conference.The festival had also been criticised for its male-dominated line-up, with just two of the 21 films coming from female directors.However, it was climate protesters who occupied the red carpet ahead of the closing ceremony.They were protesting against huge cruise ships visiting Venice, something, they say, which is damaging the environment.Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger and actor Donald Sutherland were were among those to acknowledge the protesters and back their cause.The pair were promoting Giuseppe Capotondi's film, The Burnt Orange Heresy, which they star in."
entertainment	John Travolta film The Fanatic bombs at US box office	Star cast	"John Travolta's latest film is heading for a box office bombing in the US following its debut at the weekend, according to The Hollywood Reporter.The Fanatic took just $3,153 (£2,615) on Friday from 52 cinemas, with final totals for the public holiday weekend still to be tallied.It stars Travolta as an obsessed fan of a film star and marks the fourth box office failure in a row for the actor.The Fanatic is directed by Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst.Travolta is Moose, a rabid movie fan who's obsessed with his favourite celebrity action hero, Hunter Dunbar. When he is cheated out of his opportunity to meet his idol, Moose's actions begin to take a dangerous turn.Speaking to the BBC at Cannes last year, Travolta said: ""Moose was one of my best experiences. Fred Durst is stunningly gifted as a director and as a human being he was capable of communicating differently from anyone else.""I loved Moose; it's phenomenal. Moose is an eccentric special needs character who's obsessed with a movie star. I can't describe how special this character is; he's one of my favourite characters I've ever played. I loved working with Fred.""Most critics could not summon up Travolta's enthusiasm, however.Rex Reed, writing in Observer in the US, described the film as ""a disaster"", while the Chicago Sun-Times critic, Richard Roeper, wrote: ""This drifts into the category of campy oddity, leaving us once again waiting and hoping for John Travolta to find his next great part.""The New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski wrote: ""Travolta, earnest but ridiculous, spends his time furiously rocking back and forth and bellowing to the heavens.He continued: ""I'll give Travolta this: He commits. This is not a flattering project for him, and the actor is obviously deeply invested in the material. He produced it. But he needs a director who will tell him to rein it in.""Wall Street Journal's John Anderson was more impressed though: ""One can understand the draw of The Fanatic for someone like Mr Travolta: It calls for full immersion, mentally and physically. And he pulls it off.""The Fanatic is only playing in a small number of cinemas before being made available on premium video-on-demand (VOD) on 6 September.Even still, the film is faring worse than Travolta's other recent releases, In A Valley of Violence (2016) and Killing Season (2013), both of which were also dual theatrical/VOD titles.In A Valley of Violence, which co-starred Ethan Hawke, took $29,343 from 33 cinemas on its first weekend, eventually making just $53,647.Killing Season, co-starring Robert De Niro, took a similar amount, with a final tally of $53,646.Travolta's last film, Gotti, had a traditional release but that only took a total of $4.3m (£3.6m) domestically.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Troy: Will Gompertz reviews the British Museum's new blockbuster show ★★★★★		"Troy: Myth and Reality at the British Museum is an exhibition that rewards the diligent. To go unprepared is to start watching Game of Thrones half way through Season 7; it'll still make some sort of sense but will generally be more baffling than Prince Andrew's decision to do that interview.I know this because I hadn't sufficiently mugged up when I went to see it and duly fell at the first hurdle, which is the show's title.What was myth and what was reality? Was there ever such a man as Homer? Was there ever an epic war with the Greeks? Was there ever a wooden horse? Did Troy even exist?You need to know this stuff.Which I do now thanks to the good offices of Alexandra Villing and Victoria Donnellan, who took pity on me and escorted me around their 294-object exhibition.They swiftly put me right on the basics.Troy did exist.Well, it did, but even that has been contested. Not least by Homer who reported it had been totally wiped out, a view shared by the Roman poet Lucan, who wrote, ""Etiam periere ruinae"" - Even its very ruins were destroyed.That small bone of contention aside, it's useful to know the city was also called Ilion (or Ilium in Latin) - hence The Iliad - is now called Hissarlik, and can be found on the far north west coast of Turkey to the south of the Dardanelles strait near the Aegean Sea.As for the 10-year Trojan war, they're not so sure. Probably an invention - at least in the way it's described by Homer.The same goes for the wooden Trojan horse, and possibly even Homer, the great poet of the past.He might have been a she, or someone else altogether, or a collection of individuals latterly embodied as Homer a single genius because that's how we like our great art packaged.The truth is we don't know, it is all myth.I've stood upon Achilles' tomb,And heard Troy doubted: time will doubt of Rome.Lord Byron, Don Juan, Canto 4, 101And then there is the reality, which consists of the art and artefacts that make up this encyclopaedic exhibition.They cover a period of 5,000 years, with the majority coming from the centuries following the fable of the Trojan War, which is thought to have been set in the Late Bronze Age, around 1200BC.These pots, paintings, carvings, manuscripts, and assorted fragments all have inscriptions and depictions relating to the epic tale. The earliest of which is a small, battered drinking cup (circa 715BC) from Pithekoussai, an old Greek colony in southern Italy. It appears at the beginning of the show and sets a suitably poetic tone, with these three lines of verse scribbled within its geometric decoration:""I am the cup of Nestor, good to drink from; whoever drinks from this cup, immediately desire of fair-garlanded Aphrodite will strike him.""You wouldn't necessarily know it, but that's a joke.The point being that Nestor, a Greek king featured in Homer's Iliad, drank from a golden goblet that only he was strong enough to lift, whereas anyone could swig from this little clay vessel.What was a joke back then is deadly serious now to a contemporary scholar.The inscription reveals that a small ancient community knew of a story featured in the Iliad. What's more, the pot on which those words appear was not made locally, but in Teos, Turkey, which is near to Smyrna and Chios, two settlements put forward as the birthplace of Homer.Hanging on a wall not far from the cup is a wonderful marble relief (circa 1st Century BC - 1st Century AD) that gets to the crux of the story. It shows the meeting between Paris (the son of Priam, King of Troy) and Helen (wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta.)The rendezvous is engineered by meddling gods and is not entirely of Paris's making. He had been asked by Zeus to pick the fairest of three goddesses: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite.It is a scene known as The Judgement of Paris, which is shown in several pictures in the exhibition, the best of which is by Lucas Cranach the Elder, a painting from circa 1530, which has an unforgettably charismatic horse looking on.Paris chooses Aphrodite, who promptly offers to him as his reward, the most beautiful woman in the world, which is Helen. The warmongering gods have done the poor chap up like a kipper.Of course, he falls for Helen and takes her back to Troy.There's a wonderful wall-painting (AD45-79) from Pompeii in the exhibition, showing a servant leading Helen to the ship that will take her to Troy. She doesn't look exactly thrilled by the prospect, but her sombre mood is nothing compared to her husband's.Menelaus is absolutely livid when he discovers that some Trojan bloke has gone off with his missus.He marshals an army of fellow Greeks to bring her home, and thereby begins the decade-long Trojan War.The Iliad only covers 51 days of the drawn-out battle, concentrating on the last year and featuring all our favourite characters and events.We see a lot of Achilles. And the Greeks' famous wooden horse, which is elegantly evoked in a bespoke section that leads to the second part of the show, bringing us into the 19th Century and the archaeological exploits of a German businessman called Heinrich Schliemann.He and Frank Calvert, an Englishman and fellow Troy-head (archaeology was still a largely amateur pursuit in 1870), set out to find the fallen city using Homer's geographical descriptions as their divining rod. The poet had mentioned the Dardanelles, Mount Ida, the islands of Tenedos and Imbros, and local rivers.They identified a mound at Hissarlik as the spot to start digging. Schliemann was determined to prove not only that Troy was buried beneath the surface, but also find incontrovertible evidence of the Trojan War.As you will see, if you visit this excellent exhibition, he did very well on the first objective, but fell woefully short on proving the myth a reality.His years of digging are displayed with a mixture of flair and restraint. The bowls, cups, axes and animal figures are theatrically lit within a shelved structure that represents each layer of the excavation. And so, an object from Troy VII, is shown a metre above one from Troy II. It's a helpful device.The exhibition finishes with a gallery of paintings showing the Western fascination with the mythical tale.A Matisse-inspired collage called The Siren's Song (1977) by the African-American artist Romare Bearden is very good.Eleanor Antin's Judgment of Paris (after Rubens) from 2007 is fun, but does not compare to the Baroque master's painting nearby, The Wrath of Achilles (1630-35).And then there's the William Blake, the Cy Twombly (as you enter the show), and the Elisabeth Frink lithographs.There is so much to enjoy in this show, it doesn't matter that there is the odd dud along the way - I didn't much like the Anthony Caro sculpture with sound effects as you enter the exhibition, or the Shield of Achilles (2019) by Spencer Finch as you leave - but pretty much everything in between them is terrific.Recent reviews by Will Gompertz"
entertainment	Export ban to stop £10m JMW Turner painting leaving UK		"A temporary export bar has been placed on a £10m painting by one of the UK's most celebrated artists, JMW Turner.The masterpiece, The Dark Rigi, the Lake of Lucerne, depicts a scene in the Swiss mountains - but there are fears it could be exported for sale abroad.Arts minister Rebecca Pow said it would be a ""terrible loss to the whole country"" if the painting went overseas.The export ban runs until 1 December, in the hope the money can be raised to buy it and keep it in the UK.The famous work, a watercolour painted in 1842, is the only remaining work from the Rigi series - Turner's three paintings of the Rigi mountain - which is not in a public collection.Ms Pow said: ""Turner is one of Britain's greatest ever artists and The Dark Rigi is a beautiful and emotive work painted at the pinnacle of his career.""This work is of national importance and if it were to go abroad it would be a terrible loss to the country.""I hope that by placing a temporary export bar, we can ensure that funds can be raised to save The Dark Rigi for the nation so it is able to go on public display.""Ms Pow, who has been in her current post since May, made her decision after advice from the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest.The committee's job is to advise the government on exporting cultural property.For example, if an artwork is sold to a foreign buyer, it can suggest delaying the granting of an export licence to allow time for a British buyer to raise funds to buy the work instead and keep it in the UK.The decision on the export licence applications for the watercolour has now been deferred until 1 December.If a serious intention is made to raise the £10m funds to purchase the artwork, the export bar may be extended until 1 June 2020.Turner, who was born in London in 1775, is considered one of the greatest figures in the history of landscape painting."
entertainment	Michael Kiwanuka: 'I am not an imposter'	'Really scared'Marital bliss'Subtle racism'	"""I won't change my name, no  matter what they call me,"" sings Michael Kiwanuka on his latest single, Hero.Over the years, the London-born singer has been called a lot of things. ""Michael Kiwa-nin-nin-nooko, Michael Keena-wooka, Michael Kawaski... Anything other than Michael Kiwanuka,"" he told the BBC when he topped the Sound of 2012 poll seven years ago.""Once, on my dressing room, there were like five 'n's - Kiwanininininanuku!""As a young musician, he was repeatedly told to choose a new name to make him ""more marketable"". Now, with cool self-assuredness, he's called his third album Kiwanuka. All in capitals. Accompanied by a portrait of the singer dressed as a Tudor-era African king.You could interpret that as arrogance or pride, but that's not his intention. The album title is ""a statement to myself"", says Kiwanuka. A reminder that he conquered his crippling self-doubt.""I've always had imposter syndrome,"" says the singer. ""I was always waiting for someone to find me out and go, 'We see that you're not actually that good and it's all going to crumble'.""It didn't matter that his last album, 2016's Love & Hate, went to number one and was nominated for a Brit Award. Nor that Cold Little Heart, the album's stunning, symphonic opening track, was placed over the opening titles of Big Little Lies, earning him international recognition.""It was frustrating because I thought [success] would have a different effect,"" he says, ""but what it did was almost the opposite. I was overwhelmed by the response to the record.""He began to believe the album's producers, Danger Mouse and Inflo, were the real talent - and that his own contributions were inconsequential.""Because they're so good and I look up to them so much, I started to think, 'Maybe I'm actually just average and they're the reason why it's popular,'"" he says.""And because the album did well, it amplified those feelings, in an odd way. I started to really get scared about it.""Kiwanuka's depleting confidence started to affect his work, especially when he started recording Love & Hate's follow-up.""There'd be times working on this album where I'd be really self-conscious about my abilities and what I can bring to the table. I'd think, 'If they hear this, they'll probably say, 'Oh, I'm not working with him again'.""But about a year-and-a-half ago, I got tired of that way of thinking. I just went, 'This isn't helping anyone, least of all me.'""As his confidence returned, it fuelled a burst of creativity: Kiwanuka's self-titled third album is a gorgeous, slow-burning trip into psychedelic soul, that's already won a clutch of four and five-star reviews.""One of the greatest albums of the decade,"" declared The Guardian. ""A compassionate, career-defining masterpiece,"" agreed Q Magazine.Rolling Stone, meanwhile, noted it felt ""like a proper old-fashioned album,"" designed to be heard in one sitting, with each track bleeding into the next through musical interludes and sampled dialogue.Kiwanuka hopes listeners will get ""lost and immersed"" in the music, the way he used to on his favourite albums.""When I was at school, I loved The Score by The Fugees. It had all these skits and songs and musical motifs that would come back. I remember being 12 and feeling I was in another world.""That was one of the ambitions for this record: How can I keep people engaged, especially in a time of playlists, where album listening is a rare thing?""So there's no fade outs or pauses between songs. If you press play when you're cleaning the house, you get sucked in for the whole duration and you won't even know when the song has changed.""The album rewards your undivided attention, especially on headphones, as Kiwanuka colours and shades his songs with laid-back beats, torrid guitars, majestic strings, harps, brass, percussion, convulsive jazz chords and call-and-response gospel hooks.The influences he draws on are impeccable: Gil Scott Heron's wordplay, Prince's vari-speeded vocals, the fuzz-tone guitar of Funkadelic's Eddie Hazel and the heated-up-and-stretched-out grooves of Issac Hayes' Hot Buttered Soul.""I think there's a reference to Hot Buttered Soul in every song I've tried to do over the last five years,"" he confesses. ""I love that album.""At the centre of it all is Kiwanuka's voice, full of warmth and resonance and humanity.He's at his most emotive on Piano Joint, a song about the healing power of love that was inspired by his wife, Charlotte.""I've been a married man for three years and there's nothing else like it. It's just so solid.""It's so therapeutic to know there's two of you on the same team. That kind of love is the thing that gets me through the difficulties.""The 32-year-old says he's become something of a homebird over the last three years, making touring life a perplexing prospect.""On the first album, my flat was just in boxes. I didn't care about being a home at all,"" he says. ""I was like, 'Send me on tour for seven years, I'll be fine!' And although I love it just as much as I did then, it's way harder to leave.""Home life is fun, you know? We'll be like, 'Shall we book this holiday?' or 'Shall we paint the walls?'""The little things that don't seem that big, that everyone can do, become really fun. It just gives you another side of life that anyone can attain, and it's just beautiful. It's difficult to describe, but I definitely recommend it.""The couple recently moved to Southampton, a far cry from Muswell Hill, where Kiwanuka had lived since he was a child, born to Ugandan parents who'd fled Idi Amin's regime.Their leafy suburb of North London was predominantly white, leaving the youngster with a sense of otherness and un-belonging that informed his 2016 single Black Man In A White World.He says he never experienced ""blatant"" racism in the UK - but that doesn't mean it wasn't there.""In America, everything's so much more polarised and amplified, but the things I went through are more way more subtle,"" he says.""It's more like you go to a university and there's there's no black people, there's no black teachers, no black people in places of leadership. Or you go to a record label - nobody. So it's not necessarily, 'I hate you, I'm shooting, I'm killing you in the streets,' but there's something askew there.""It's that sort of ingrained, unconscious racism that he sings about on Hero: The people who told him to change his name were worried his records would be pigeon-holed as ""world music"", but they never considered they were asking him to erase his identity.""A name is a powerful thing,"" he muses. ""You don't get more 'you' than your birth name, your given name.""His refusal to adopt a pseudonym was a small act of defiance, but Hero goes on to reflect on the far greater sacrifices made by civil rights activists; comparing the murder of Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton with recent US police shootings.""I was looking at pictures on my phone of Fred Hampton and I was just moved by how young he was when he got killed,"" says the singer.""And then I started thinking of the musical icons who died young, too. And I had the idea of, like, to become a hero, do you need to be a martyr? Do you have so much good to give that it's too much for the world, and you get shot down - whether you're Bob Marley or John Lennon or Fred Hampton, or whoever it is?""The words came out pretty quick at that point. I finally had something to sing about.""But while the subject matter of Kiwanuka's third LP gets pretty heavy, there's always a shaft of light - evidence of the singer's hope and humanity, rooted in the Christian faith which ""has helped me my whole life"".It's there in the sample of US civil rights activists staging peaceful sit-ins at segregated cafes in the 1950s: ""You cause no violence. You have no angry words, [projecting] the idea that here sits beside me another human being.""And it's there in the uplifting final track, Light, where Kiwanuka sweeps away his anxiety as he sings: ""Shine your light over me / All of my fears are gone"".""I finally accepted that I am a singer, I'm an artist and a songwriter and I love it,"" he smiles. ""That's when I decided to call the album Kiwanuka - because there's no hiding from that.""This is who I am, rain or shine. I am completely myself. I am not an imposter.""Kiwanuka is out now.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

entertainment	Sir Antony Gormley urges gallery to end BP sponsorship	'Extremely proud'	"Sculptor Sir Antony Gormley has joined calls for London's National Portrait Gallery to end its sponsorship with BP.BP has sponsored the gallery's annual Portrait Award for 30 years, but the oil company has faced growing criticism over its environmental stance.Sir Antony said BP was ""using culture to make us all feel this is a company that cares about the future of mankind, but it very clearly doesn't"".The gallery said BP's support for the award means public admission is free.It added that government funding only made up a third of its income, so it has to work with corporate partners.Sir Antony is one of almost 80 artists - including five winners of the Turner Prize - to write the letter demanding an end to BP's sponsorship.In the letter to Nicholas Cullinan, director of the gallery, the artists state that BP's ongoing sponsorship ""is lending credence to the company's misleading assurance that it's doing all it can, and so we, as artists, feel we must speak up"".""We believe that, today, the loss of BP as a source of funding is a cost worth bearing, until the company changes course and enables future generations to make art in a world that resembles our own,"" the letter continues.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Antony said: ""Art is about giving a platform for sustainable futures... [it is] very clear that this is not a part of BPs remit"".""We are in a crisis,"" he said, adding he would like to see the energy giant put half its profits towards renewable energy research,""We are all immersed in a fossil fuel culture, we are all culpable. But there are a few organisations and governments that can do something about it.""The letter calls on the gallery not to renew its contract with BP when it expires in 2022 and, in the immediate future, to remove the BP representative from the award's judging panel.Peter Mather, head of BP in Europe, told the Today programme last week that the company was trying to help both the art world and the environment.He said BP's 70,000 employees did not get up each day ""with the intention of destroying the planet"".He added that BP was ""extremely proud"" of what it did in the arts, as well as what it contributed to the UK economy.""We are focusing very much on reducing our own emissions. We are also improving - i.e. lowering - the carbon footprint of the produce that we supply.""It comes after artist and judge of this year's Portrait Award by BP Gary Hume said it was time to look elsewhere for sponsorship.He said: ""BP could continue to support the National Portrait Gallery without putting their name anywhere, it could be an anonymous gift.""Without the institutions such as BP making a concerted effort... we haven't got a chance."""

entertainment	Taylor Wessing Prize: 'Sensitive' mother pictures win over judges	Second Prize: Neil by Enda BoweThird Prize: The Hubbocks by Garrod Kirkwood	"Two ""sensitive, tough and even humorous"" images taken by the American artist Pat Martin have won the Taylor Wessing portrait prize.The £15,000 prize was awarded to Martin at London's National Portrait Gallery on Tuesday evening.The photographs are of his now dead mother with whom he had a difficult, often painful relationship.""For most of my life, I misunderstood my mother and witnessed how the world misunderstood her,"" he said.Martin's mother struggled with addiction throughout her life, which resulted in the artist finding it hard to build a close mother and child bond with her.""Photographing her became a way of looking into a mirror and finding details never noticed. There were always new ones to discover, and something new to hide.""I began this project at the 11th hour, and needing to reconnect, I chose to focus where I was fearful to look.""When I recognised I was without a document of her existence, the camera became a magnet, pulling in her direction over and over and taking one memory at a time.""The judges all agreed Martin's portraits were ""in turn sensitive, tough and even humorous"", a statement said.""The photographer has captured something of the struggle and pride of his mother which they felt speaks to the fragility of human experience and the power of the photographic portrait to express loss and evoke memory,"" the statement added.Three further portraits from Martin's series will be included in the gallery's exhibition of competition entries opening on 7 November.Tuesday's ceremony also saw two runners-up awarded prizes.National Portrait Gallery to close for three yearsTaylor Wessing Prize: Alice Mann wins with portraits of drum majorettesThe portrait entitled Neil from the series Love's Fire Song by Enda Bowe came in second place, winning the artist £3,000.Bowe, who also came second in 2018's competition, is an Irish photographer based in London.His work aims to tell a story while celebrating the beauty of the seemingly mundane.Bowe's picture Neil is of a young man photographed as part of the photographer's series focusing on the Belfast Conway estate.""l concentrated on the ordinary, the everyday,"" said the artist.""I used a saturated colour palette with only subtle symbolisms, and without reference to the specific locations they were taken.""Free from political and geographical context, the photographs speak of longing, yearning, aspirations and vulnerabilities of young people in Belfast today.""The judges' statement said they ""responded to the simplicity and beauty"" of the portrait. They also found the image ""conveyed something of the confusion, uncertainty and rebellion of youth"".The Hubbucks, a photograph from the series England by Garrod Kirkwood, won the third place prize of £2,000.British artist Kirkwood's picture shows a family setting off on a holiday adventure - a moment full of promise and possibility.Kirkwood is based on the North East coast of England and is inspired by the area and those who live there.He described The Hubbucks, which was taken in Whitley Bay, as ""a cinematic scene from real life"".""This is a magical moment and portrait of a family and group of individuals that we all can relate to,"" he added.The judges said they enjoyed the ""vibrancy and sense of spontaneity"" in the image.They added: ""The photograph which shows a family - carefree and ready for adventure - was one that revelled in a collectively treasured holiday memory.""All submissions to the Taylor Wessing competition are judged anonymously. The winners were chosen from 3,700 entries from 1,611 photographers across 70 countries.Fifty-five portraits by 31 artists will be on show at the exhibition opening this week.Shane Gleghorn from Taylor Wessing said he believed visitors would find the final selection ""challenging, evocative and uplifting"".The exhibition will run from Thursday until 16 February 2020 at London's National Portrait Gallery.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Will Gompertz reviews photographer Diane Arbus at London's Hayward Gallery ★★★★★		"They say you can judge people by the company they keep. Oligarchs hang out with art dealers, yacht brokers and muscle-bound bodyguards. Fading film stars winter in Miami among plastic surgeons and country club members. Undertakers chauffeur the dead. But who - outside the Houses of Parliament - would choose oddballs, misfits, and exhibitionists as their squad?Step forward Diane (pronounced Dee-Anne BTW) Arbus. The American photographer loved an eccentric like a salesman loves a sucker. They were her people: outsiders of all shapes and sizes - short, giant, obese, skinny - who had the courage and character to expose their vulnerability in front of her searching lens.You don't just look at the subjects of Diane Arbus's photographs, you meet them. Her New York street photography was quite different from the images produced by the likes of Walker Evans and Robert Frank, who were also documenting mid-century urban America.She wasn't a click-and-run flâneur surreptitiously snapping away from a camera buried within an overcoat, or one poking out from the passenger window of a passing car.An Arbus image was the product of a collaboration between the seer and the seen: the photographer and the photographed.She would spend hours, days even, building a rapport with the strippers, inkers and razorblade swallowers she portrayed.The more specific she could be, she learnt, the more universal the image.Inspiration came from an unlikely source.It wasn't another photographer, although she knew and admired many, but sweary Geoffrey Chaucer - the 14th Century Middle English writer. She was particularly taken with The Canterbury Tales, his satirical collection of stories in which a motley bunch of pilgrims travel from London to Canterbury amusing themselves by competing for the title of best storyteller.Arbus not only admired the range and depth of characters to whom Chaucer gave literary life, but also the ""tenderness"" with which he treated them. It was a humanity she strove to replicate when photographing the discriminated against, the sort of people from whom most turn away but she looked upon with empathy.""If you scrutinize reality closely enough,"" she said, ""if in some way you really, really get to it, it becomes fantastic.""Freaks, as she called them (a description of the time that has not endured like her pictures), were her muse:""They were one of the first things I photographed. It had a terrific excitement for me. I adored them. They made me feel a mixture of shame and awe. There's a quality of legend about freaks… Most people go through life dreading they will have a traumatic experience. Freaks were born with their trauma. They have already passed their test in life. They are aristocrats.""As was she - a ""department store princess,"" who grew up in New York on the Upper West Side; the daughter of a wealthy retailer with a huge shop on Fifth Avenue. The fur her father sold was real, but she felt like a fake when walking between the aisles - hence, I suppose, the attraction to oddballs brave enough to be themselves.Her parents got into art and wanted their 10-year-old daughter to become a painter. Diane was good but found the process annoying.Eight years later she married Allan Arbus. He gave her that Nikon 35mm camera. It was 1941.They set up as a husband-and-wife team producing fashion photos for glossy magazines: Allan took the pictures, Diane was the stylist. Until she grew bored of the role around 1955 and dug out the Nikon.This is where the Hayward Gallery exhibition starts; with the revelation of Arbus's idiosyncratic aesthetic immediately apparent. Images such as Taxicab Driver at the Wheel with Two Passengers, N.Y.C. 1956, and Lady on a Bus N.Y.C. 1957, demonstrate her innate sensibility for composition, contrast, and content.Every picture she takes is like a single page torn from a novel: a fragment of a story you find yourself reconstructing as you look.The Hayward Gallery focuses on her early 35mm pictures taken before she started using a Rolleiflex square format camera in 1962. They are displayed a bit like ""Wanted"" posters pinned to the trees of New York's Central Park.You walk among them in a forest of vertical white columns, on either side of which is a black and white figure staring right back at you. It is an effective and affecting presentation.These are not sentimental photographs.Nor are they eye candy to entertain and titillate. There is a seriousness about them, a solemnity which can drift toward the surreal and macabre: a moment caught between the vernacular and the uncanny.The picture of an elderly woman lying on a hospital bed who appears more dead than alive is neither a celebration of life nor a lament for its imminent end. It is something else altogether, more a reflection on the thin invisible line that divides the two for us all.Arbus doesn't restrict herself to strange folk in order to depict strangeness.For her it is a fact of life.A woman carrying a child, a boy stepping off a kerb - everyday occurrences when isolated and observed become loaded and peculiar.""Everybody has that thing where they need to look one way but they come out looking another way…You see somebody on the street and essentially what you notice about them is the floor. It's just extraordinary.""You can see the occasional flaw in her photographs. Sometimes they feel too staged, her presence too obvious. Others make you question the relationship between photographer and subject: is one taking advantage of the other? A salesman and a sucker, maybe? But which way around?It is, though, that ambivalence that draws you in.The more you look the more you see.Take the photograph of two kids horsing about on the street, for instance. It appears charming at first, but grows darker the longer you spend with it: who is teasing whom and why?It is just one example of the faintly forbidding atmosphere that pervades the show: an ominousness that comes not just from Arbus's work but also from her life, which she ended abruptly in 1971 by taking her own life, at the age of 48.Here we see the work of a photographer blessed with great intelligence and a wonderful eye, both of which were aligned to and informed by a curious, troubled mind.There are a lot of images in this show but no self-portraits. At least, not in the conventional sense. Looked at from another perspective, however, and you can see the sensitive, striving artist that was Diane Arbus in every single one."

entertainment	Will Gompertz reviews Mantegna's two panels reunited at London's National Gallery ★★★☆☆		"Each year I have to face an awful moment of truth.It happens on the first morning of every summer holiday when I'm somewhere hot and sunny with friends and family. Drinks are flowing, music is playing.Everybody is happy. Except for me.I am as tense as one of Ed Sheeran's guitar strings.In order to go swimming, which I really want to do, I will have to remove my shirt. In public.My upper body is never a pretty sight, but at this point in high summer, its shortcomings are comically accentuated by the ""T-shirt tan"" that reveals light brown extremities incongruously protruding from a pinkish-white torso.It is a crushing image I am normally able to suppress throughout the winter months, but to my horror it reappeared in an unwanted flashback on Thursday afternoon when I was at the National Gallery in London.I was visiting the Trafalgar Square institution to see two parts of a panel painting by the great Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna (c 1431-1506), which hadn't been displayed together for maybe 500 years. United, they depict the story of Christ shortly after his crucifixion.The bottom panel is The Descent of Christ into Limbo (c 1492); the upper piece gives us Part Two, The Resurrection of Christ (c 1492).There has been much excitement about their reunification, which is great, but in all honesty they make for a very odd couple.The top panel has been cleaned to within an inch of its life, with the central figure lying beneath Christ's feet grabbing all the attention in his garishly bright orange top and matching knee-length socks.Meanwhile, the panel below is as sober as a teetotallers' annual convention, with the faded red pigment of Christ's loose-fitting garment the most vivid element of a tonally harmonious painting. It is the stark contrast between the two that conjures up the image of my vacation humiliation.The fact that the upper painting has been given the full conservation treatment while the picture below has not is nobody's fault - they have different owners. But given the story we are being pitched is the two images were always intended to be seen as one, it seems an odd decision to present them when they are in such dramatically altered states.It makes them appear as separate entities by different artists from different times. As, indeed, they may be.The upper panel has long been thought to be the work of a less accomplished artist than Mantegna.Its attribution was seriously questioned in the early 20th Century, since when curators have believed it to be by an apprentice in Mantegna's studio, or possibly by one of the artist's sons, or even a copy made at a later date. That opinion changed earlier this year when Giovanni Valagussa, a curator at Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, which owns The Resurrection of Christ, took the opportunity to spend some time in the store rooms while the gallery was being refurbished.He happened upon the painting and thought it too good to be by a minor artist.He then noticed the tip of a cross at the very bottom of the picture, which seemed to be positioned at the entrance to a tunnel or cave. That got Valagussa thinking. Maybe this unloved picture covered in discoloured varnish might be the part of a larger composition.After a bit of detective work, the curator found the perfect match: Mantegna's uncontested painting, The Descent of Christ into Limbo, which is in private ownership. He immediately spotted the staff in Christ's left hand and saw it was cut off at the top. What if he placed his picture above an image of The Descent, lining up the small Cross at the foot of his image to the pole below?The result was astonishing.Not only was the cross a perfect fit, but once in place, the entire composition connected like a jigsaw to create an overall design that he knew Mantegna had produced many times. Further research revealed that both images were painted using egg tempera on a poplar wood panel with nail holes that lined up, suggesting they were once held together by the same baton.This led to the conclusion that they would have once formed part of an altar panel in the chapel of the Ducal Palace in Mantua, northern Italy, where Mantegna lived for 50 years, having been hired by the ruling Gonzaga family as their court painter.He had been born not far away in Padua, into a modest family (his father was an illiterate carpenter), who would never have imagined their young lad would grow up to become a celebrity artist of noble status, living in a splendid house he himself designed.How the artist managed to climb life's ladder so successfully is evident in the National Gallery exhibition, Mantegna & Bellini, where the two panel paintings were reunited on Thursday.In the first room of the show, which looks at how the two artists and brothers-in-law riffed off one another, there is a portrait of Saint Mark the Evangelist (c 1448).It is a wonderful picture, painted when Mantegna was just 17 or 18 years old, and already demonstrating an extraordinary talent for naturalism and perspective. OK, the thumb on St Mark's right hand appears to be embedded in his jaw, but other than that it is a notable achievement for one so young.Mantegna might not be as famous as the big three: Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael (the artists, not the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), but when you see this show you wonder why that is the case. When on top form, he was every bit as pioneering and skilful as the three Renaissance greats that came shortly after him.If you want a masterclass in the art of foreshortening, look no further than this exhibition, where Mantegna shows he can convince in a way the technically gifted Bellini cannot.All of which makes the introduction of the hyper-cleaned The Resurrection of Christ jar a little. You can see why the curators wanted to show off their discovery, but it feels rushed.Bizarrely, the paintings don't actually look very good together: the frames don't match, the images are too far apart, and the nature of the upper panel's facelift appears crass in comparison to the gracefully aged image below.It is a three-star exhibit in a five-star show."
entertainment	Will Gompertz reviews Elmgreen & Dragset's show at the Whitechapel Gallery ★★★★☆		"Marcel Duchamp was a funny guy.It was he who in 1917 came up with the amusing wheeze to test and tease straight-laced curators by entering a urinal for inclusion in a contemporary art exhibition.Ever since, artists have been hell bent on trying to outwit and outdo the philosophical Frenchman.And for 101 years they have failed.There have been some valiant attempts (Robert Rauschenberg's Combines), some famous attempts (Tracey Emin's My Bed), and countless failed attempts (take your pick from those on show at any major modern art museum).At the better-than-most end of the scale are the Scandinavia double-act Elmgreen & Dragset (Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset), who have been given a mid-career retrospective (the Artworld's version of a minor honour) at the Whitechapel Gallery in east London.They are the guys who put that fey four-metre high bronze sculpture of a young boy in lederhosen riding a rocking horse on Trafalgar Square's Fourth Plinth in 2012 (Powerless Structures, Fig. 101).The idea was to gently mock the machismo of the traditional ""heroes-on-horses"" equestrian statues it faced.But the capital's then mayor, Boris Johnson, didn't see it that way. He mischievously interpreted it as an emblem to represent Britain's gold medal hopes at the forthcoming London Olympics.The artists were not amused.Their serious social commentary had been turned into exactly the sort of jingoistic metaphor they had intended to undermine.Six years later, the boys are back in town with a riposte to the ex-foreign secretary and his party's austerity policies. It comes in the colossal shape of a derelict, life-sized, municipal swimming pool, which fills the Whitechapel's ground-floor gallery.It is very convincing, right down to the cracked tiles, dusty rubble, and occasional autumnal leaf.To add to the sense of drama (Ingar Dragset's background is in theatre not art; Michael Elmgreen was a poet), the gallery assistants are dressed as security guards, replete with gaoler's keys and surrounded by little details: a slug climbs a piece of wood, an ice box sits abandoned in a corner; eeriness pervades all.On the wall by the entrance door there is a panel on which the backstory of The Whitechapel Pool is told.It was built in 1901 and paid for ""by funds made available by the Borough of Tower Hamlets.""It was renovated in 1953, welcomed 292,000 visitors a-year in ""its peak years"", and ""it is believed that artist David Hockney made his first drawings of the surface of a swimming pool's water at this site"".And then…""After being abandoned for nearly thirty years, the building was sold to GenTri (geddit?) Investment in 2016, during Boris Johnson's last year as Mayor of London. In January 2019, renowned architecture firm Corner Leviathan (Duchamp loved to play on words, too) will start a comprehensive renovation of the building for the international Desert Flower Art Hotel & Resort.""And there you have it.A space and a place that was once for the benefit of the general public has been sold off by their bête noir Boris to become a luxury hotel exclusively for the super wealthy.Of course none of it is true, the story is as fabricated as their swimming pool.But that's not the point.The point is the point.And their point is that civic spaces are being lost to private developers. And so they are.But not the Whitechapel Gallery thankfully, which was founded in 1901 to ""bring great art to the people of east London."" It now sees itself as having a ""unique role in the capital's cultural landscape and is pivotal to the continued growth of east London as a leading contemporary quarter"".In fact, the increase in civic spaces and buildings in which the public can see art for free has grown massively in the past twenty years, while libraries and other municipal spaces have withered.You could argue that the likes of the Whitechapel and Tate Modern can precipitate the type of capitalist regeneration that the duo lament; cultural cornerstones that lead to gentrification and rocketing real estate prices.Next week, both public institutions and Elmgreen & Dragset are likely to be schmoozing the very millionaires and billionaires this work criticises (bankers, developers, hedge-find managers etc) at exclusive private dinners arranged across the capital for what has become known as Frieze Week (a week in early October when the world's wealthiest collectors and galleries arrive en-mass in London for the Frieze contemporary art fair).Which is why The Whitechapel Pool feels like the right idea in the wrong place.The art world at this elite level is far too entangled in the world of big business and the super-rich to be a credible voice for social justice.A fact Elmgreen & Dragset acknowledge in a work in the upper galleries called Capitalism Will Collapse From Within (2003).We see the stencilled proclamation presented in the graphic style of art market darling Christopher Wool: black text on white canvas.It is hanging off the wall to one side to reveal a safe behind, suggesting that art and money are one-and-the-same: commodities to be stashed away and out of sight at home for personal gain not aesthetic pleasure.It's not subtle, but then nor is any of their work.One Day (2015), for example, is a monochrome sculpture in which a bare-chested little boy wearing black shorts, white socks, and black shoes looks up innocently at a rifle mounted in a frame on the wall.Any possible future consequences are incomprehensible to him.Gay Marriage (2010) consists of two wall-mounted urinals connected by twisted chrome pipes in a lovers' knot, the symbolism of which doesn't need explaining, other than to say it brings us back to Marcel Duchamp.Who knows what art, if any, he would be making if he were alive today. My guess is it would be darker, funnier, and more original than the work in this show.But I'm not sure it would make you question the nature of reality quite like Elmgreen & Dragset succeed in doing.You don't just look at their work, they entice you into their surreal alternative universe, which exists somewhere between The League of Gentleman's Royston Vasey and The Truman Show.You start to question what you're seeing. Is it a sculpture? Or is it a gallery thermometer? Is it art? What is art? What is real?They make you think, they make you look, they make you doubt; they make you feel. What more could you possibly want from art?"
entertainment	Artemisia Gentileschi: National Gallery buys work by pioneering female artist		"The National Gallery has bought a rare painting by 17th Century Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi for £3.6m.Gentileschi is considered one of the most accomplished painters of her age.""The acquisition of this great painting realises a long-held dream of increasing the National Gallery's collection of paintings by important women artists,"" the gallery said.Of 2,300 works in the London gallery's collections, it now owns a grand total of 21 by women.It last acquired an artwork by a female artist in 1991, when it was presented with five pieces by Paula Rego.Hannah Rothschild, chair of the National Gallery trustees, explained: ""Gentileschi was a pioneer, a master storyteller and one of the most progressive and expressive painters of the period.""[She was] one of a handful of women who was able to shatter the confines of her time, she overcame extreme personal difficulties to succeed in the art of painting.""This picture will help us transform how we collect, exhibit and tell the story of women artists throughout history.""Gentileschi is thought to have painted Self Portrait As Saint Catherine Of Alexandria around 1615.The daughter of painter Orazio Gentileschi, she overcame enormous personal challenges to enjoy success and acclaim in a male-dominated world, and her reputation as a feminist icon has grown in recent decades.At the age of 17, she was raped by painter Agostino Tassi, an acquaintance of her father, which led to an infamous seven-month trial.She counted European royalty and aristocracy among her patrons - including King Philip IV of Spain, the Medici family and the Grand Duke of Tuscany.She was the first woman to become a member of the Accademia del Disegno in Florence and largely rejected the subject matter expected of female artists, preferring to paint heroic women, often in the nude.Self Portrait As Saint Catherine Of Alexandria will undergo conservation treatment before going on display at the gallery in early 2019.There are only two other known easel paintings by Gentileschi in the UK.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	The Sheffield estate where the garage has become an art gallery		"When Joanne Marsden was a child, the low concrete garage block that's surrounded by high-rise flats on her estate was a place to rollerblade on the roof after tea and avoid after dark.Marsden was born in one of the Park Hill flats in 1965 and still lives on the estate that dominates Sheffield's skyline.Children used to play on top of the garage, she recalls. ""We used to climb up - there were two holes in the ceiling.""You could climb up onto the roof. We used to play tiggy on there and we used to rollerblade on top.""It were right scary when it turned dark. If one of the garages were empty and the door were left open, you were right scared of people shoving you in and shutting the door because there were no lights in there.""This week, when she goes back, she'll see its transformation.Instead of dark garages and holes in the roof, it now has white walls, light-filled artists' studios and a small shop by the front door.The garage block has been converted into the city's newest art gallery by S1 Artspace, which has relocated from the city centre.Marsden is looking forward to seeing its new life. ""I like art so I'll probably nip down and have a nosey.""The garage-turned-gallery opens on Friday with an exhibition of photographs taken by Roger Mayne soon after Park Hill opened in 1961 alongside photos of the neighbouring Hyde Park estate taken by Bill Stephenson in 1988, just before the block was knocked down.Park Hill was built to an idealistic blueprint of ""streets in the sky"", but was notorious for drugs and crime by the 1980s.However, English Heritage gave it Grade II-listed status in 1997, and it's now in the middle of a protracted renovation scheme by developer Urban Splash that has made one half of the estate bright and desirable, and has left the other half empty and crumbling, for now.The renovated part is now home to young professionals and creative businesses including Warp Films, the company behind productions like This Is England.The rest of Park Hill is due to be renovated and repopulated in the coming years. When that happens, a brand new art gallery with a reported £21m budget will be built as an extension to one of the existing high-rise blocks, replacing the garage.That's expected to open in around 2024 and will provide four times as much gallery space, with more studios and flats for visiting artists to stay in. The National Trust will also fit one flat out in original 1960s decor.S1 Artspace curator Laura Clarke says the old garage will serve them well until then.""It was earmarked for demolition so it was a great opportunity for us,"" she says. ""It's been an interesting challenge to redevelop a garage block into a gallery space.""The amazing thing is, architecturally it still has a lot of the hallmark qualities of Park Hill - things like the concrete beams and the way it nestles into the landscape as it follows the topography of the hillside.""The renovation of it has been very respectful to the original building - we haven't pushed and pulled it around too much.""Five generations of Joanne Marsden's family have lived on Park Hill - from her great-grandmother to her own children.It was a good place to grow up, she says. ""When we were younger it had an amazing reputation. This were a prime spot.""It felt more of a community growing up, whereas now it feels a bit more middle class. It reminds me more of London to be honest.""The neighbouring block that Bill Stephenson photographed in 1988 was knocked down soon after.""I was prepared to meet people who wanted the place to be blown up and who thought it was the worst place they ever lived,"" Stephenson says.""But far from it - I found a community of people who didn't want to leave the flats, who loved living there, but were extremely disappointed with the council for allowing the building to be run down.""It was a great atmosphere up there really. And despite that brutalist architecture and raw concrete, it was a place that people loved and had made their home.""The renovated Park Hill flats are now highly desirable, helped by the presence of the creative businesses and a trendy cafe, and now the gallery.""I suppose you could use the word gentrification couldn't you?"" Stephenson says.""The fantastic thing about buildings and communities is they change. I asked if there were any flats were for sale and they get snapped up straight away.""I did notice a lot of interior designers have been at the flats, so they are looking for that '60s feel with '60s furniture.""The nostalgia and the hardships of living up there are becoming quite trendy again.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Will Gompertz reviews Monet and Architecture at London's National Gallery ★★★★☆		"This is what you will hear at the National Gallery's blockbuster Monet and Architecture exhibition, which opened to the public this week:""Excuse me.""""Excuse me.""""Excuse me.""""Can I just…""""Sorry.""""Ouch!""It is the sound art-lovers make when gathered en masse in a confined space full of eye-popping pictures by one of the finest painters to have ever picked up a brush.Call it the Monet Mumble: the polite but insistent whispers uttered by well-dressed ladies and gentleman making their way around packed galleries.Much has been made about the amount of money the National Gallery is charging punters for the privilege of seeing its Monet show while having their toes trodden on (I was on the receiving end twice, and the apologetic perpetrator once).If you have the audacity to go for the 'Admission Only' option and ignore the explicit and assumed 'suggested' £2 donation, tickets purchased online for those over 11 years old cost £18 during the week and £20 at the weekend (they are £2 more if bought in the gallery). That works out at around 25p a painting (there are 78 in the show).Value for money, you could argue.Particularly when you take into account the ever-increasing costs incurred by museums when putting on such ambitious, 'once-in-a-lifetime' exhibitions.That said, there must be scope to be a bit more innovative and flexible on pricing when planning a sure-fire box office smash, which will be too pricey for too many (e.g. students, families with teenagers, the currently unemployed, low paid workers).The gallery has clearly thought about the visitor experience.For the first time, there are no wall texts beside the paintings, just a number, which you then refer to in the small booklet that comes with your ticket.The upshot is rooms full of earnest, bespectacled faces peering down at this bijou publication like race-goers studying the formbook at the Grand National.From time-to-time we look up and cross-reference text with picture, before an ""excuse me"" and move on.It is a better system than having mini essays by pictures, which causes large huddles of people to gather to the side of paintings like giant barnacles. But I'd prefer a half-way house that had a sparse wall caption stating the artwork's date and title, and a booklet for the details.As for the show itself, well…It is very good.Although the title is misleading. Monet had no formal interest in architecture.Canaletto painted architecture.You could argue Ed Ruscha paints architecture.But not Monet.Never Monet.His concern was with the immaterial.Monet only ever really painted two things, both of which are as ephemeral as a snap-chat. His subjects were light and air.""Other painters paint a bridge, a house, a boat"" he once said,""I want to paint the air that surrounds the bridge, the house, the boat - the beauty of light in which they exist.""Yes, there are buildings in every one of the paintings on show at the National Gallery.Sometimes - as is the case with his spectacular depictions of the medieval façade of Rouen Cathedral - the same building many times over.But Monet is not exploring its architectural characteristics.For him it is a superficial motif: a compelling surface on which light falls to create an all-enveloping ""atmosphere"".He painted the same façade from the same spot dozens of times in the early 1890s.Not to show the intricate details of every nook and cranny, but to capture how the changing light and weather conditions physically altered the 'impression' of what he saw.""Colour, a single colour, lasts a second, sometimes three or four minutes at most. What can one do, can one paint, in three or four minutes?"" He said to the dealer René Gimpel.Monet was the ultimate Impressionist; an on-the-spot improviser reacting to Nature's every move, however small.Buildings were useful to him in terms of providing a compositional structure, a consistent reference point, and a means of evoking mood. As you can see in Snow Effect at Giverny (1893), which is an utterly wonderful, beautifully rendered psychological depiction of a rural landscape covered in snow.It is not a literal account of what was before the artist, nor is it of what he felt about what he saw (that was Van Gogh's shtick); it is a sensational interpretation of the experience of looking at that particular moment: a manifestation in oil paint on canvas of Monet's senses reporting back live from the scene.His best paintings, of which there are several examples in this show, have an almost electric sense of immediacy.Whether it is Normandy, the Netherlands, the Mediterranean coast, or Venice - he takes you there in an instant.If you can afford the ticket price and don't mind crowded spaces (there's still plenty of room to see the paintings and no sense of being rushed through), I would thoroughly recommend you see this show.You will meet a Monet you know and one that you don't.You'll see how he progressed from Courbet-type realism in his early twenties into a dare-devil picture-maker who changed the way we look at our world.Nobody thought about art in the way he did:""When you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have before you, a tree, a house, a field or whatever. Merely think, here is a little square of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yellow, and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact colour and shape, until it gives your own naïve impression of the scene before you."""
entertainment	Gallery denies censorship after removing Victorian nymphs painting	#MeToo impact'This is killing any debate'	"A gallery has temporarily removed a Victorian painting of naked adolescent girls in a move to ""encourage debate"" about how such images should be displayed in the modern age.Manchester Art Gallery has taken down Hylas and the Nymphs by JW Waterhouse.Curator Clare Gannaway said there were ""tricky issues about gender, race and representation"" in the gallery. ""But we want to talk about that with people.""She denied accusations that the gallery was censoring the 1896 picture.The decision has already sparked a heated reaction, however, with many on social media accusing the gallery of being puritanical and too politically correct.The painting was one of a number of similar pictures in a gallery area titled In Pursuit of Beauty, which Gannaway described as ""very old-fashioned"" because it depicts women as ""either as passive beautiful objects or femmes fatales"".A blog on the gallery website says: ""Let's challenge this Victorian fantasy!""Gannaway told BBC News: ""Views of history, views of art history and views about representation have moved on and the gallery probably hasn't in the way that it should have done.""And it's not about saying these things can't exist in a public gallery - it's about saying, maybe we just need to challenge the way these paintings have been read and enable them to speak in a different way.""The decision was taken by gallery staff with artist Sonia Boyce, and the painting's removal during an event on Friday was filmed to be made into a new piece of video art for Boyce's exhibition at the gallery in March.The decision was influenced by recent movements against the objectification and exploitation of women, Gannaway said.""We've talked a lot about the President's Club and MeToo campaigns and it's a credit to those campaigns that they've had such an impact,"" she said. ""I would like to think however that even if those things hadn't existed in the wider world that we would have been still encouraging this debate and discussion.""Visitors have been invited to write their views about the decision on sticky notes and post them in the vacant space.Comments on the notes ranged from ""Feminism gone mad!"" to ""Create or display art that reflects current ideologies alongside classical pieces. There is room for both.""Clare Gannaway said: ""We want to see this as the start of a process, not an end point. But what we're not doing is censoring.""There were strong reactions on social media. ""Removing art due to political concerns is exactly censorship"", wrote Gary Brooks on Twitter.""I think you can spark a debate without removing the painting,"" said Ben Perkins.Professor Liz Prettejohn, who curated a Waterhouse exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 2009, told BBC News: ""This is a painting that people love and the most ridiculous thing is the claim that somehow it's going to start a debate to take it out of public view.""Taking it off display is killing any kind of debate that you might be able to have about it in relation to some of the really interesting issues that it might raise about sexuality and gender relationships.""The Victorians are always getting criticised because they're supposed to be prudish. But here it would seem it's us who are taking the roles of what we think of as the very moralistic Victorians.""Postcards of the painting have also been taken out of the gallery shop.The furore comes two months after two sisters started a petition asking the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to remove, or at least reimagine the way it presented, a painting by Balthus of a neighbour's daughter in an erotic pose.The sisters said the Met was ""romanticising voyeurism and the objectification of children"".The museum refused to remove it, saying it wanted to encourage ""the continuing evolution of existing culture through informed discussion and respect for creative expression"".Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Will Gompertz reviews Michael Jackson: On The Wall at London's National Portrait Gallery ★★★☆☆		"The first image you see when you walk into the exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery is the last portrait Michael Jackson commissioned of himself before he died in 2009.He didn't live to see the finished picture, but I think he would have liked it.It is by Kehinde Wiley, the American artist who, to much fanfare in February, revealed his official portrait of Barack Obama to the world. It depicted the ex-President sitting in a mahogany chair surrounded by foliage and flowers looking headmasterly.Wiley's Jackson portrait also sees the subject sitting, along with an equally stern expression and a smattering of decorative flowers. But there the similarities between the two paintings end.Obama is presented as a quintessentially modern man, while the pop star is on horseback dressed like a medieval knight on a huge canvas that is a very direct riff on a 17th Century painting by Peter Paul Rubens of Philip II of Spain, as its title makes plain - Equestrian Portrait of King Philip II (Michael Jackson).It's not a patch on the original Rubens in terms of quality, but it is absolutely perfect for this freaky show, which takes a look at Michael Jackson's extra-curricular role as a muse for contemporary artists.Wiley typically makes paintings that place the ""black body"" into art history's almost exclusively white western canon. So, inserting Michael into Rubens' heroic painting of a Spanish monarch fits very nicely.As for Jackson, well, he had an insatiable taste for the baroque, which he sometimes sated with a shopping spree to buy some horrendously kitsch Louis XIV-type modern ornaments, or - as in this case - by developing a keen interest in the work of Rubens.It is the exhibition's most resolved alignment of the individual tastes and concerns of both artist and sitter - a piece of classically inspired pop art that became, during its creation, a fitting and poignant memorial portrait of perhaps the greatest entertainer of our time.According to Wiley, the full body armour the singer is wearing in the painting alludes to Jackson's public image and the way it ""functioned at once as communication and armour.""The fighting in the background refers to the battles he fought throughout his life: with his recently deceased father, with the media, with his own demons.The flowers are the beauty of creativity and music, while overhead, the cherubic figure of Victory holds a laurel crown to place on the head of the King of Pop.It is a fantasy world, like Neverland his 2,700-acre ranch in California, in which he could keep the real world at bay.It is a weird, sad painting, which in no way matches the subject's extraordinary creative and technical accomplishments but somehow sums up his life.It also sums up the exhibition, which is a very strange affair.It is not a chronology of Michael Jackson's life, nor does it seek to tell his story. It is just a gathering together of random contemporary artworks that are united by the simple fact that they depict the late singer in some way, shape or form.Actually, barring a few notable exceptions, they are also united by a lack of quality.Wall after wall is adorned with not very good art, some of which is by very good artists. Maybe they never intended their Jackson homage to be seen in public, maybe they were star-struck. I don't know, but when you walk round you'll see what I mean.There are some notable exceptions.Candice Breitz's 16-channel video, in which we watch a line-up of 16 screens with each one featuring die-hard German fans singing their way through Thriller, track-by-track. Now That's What I Call A Portrait.And then there is Appau Junior Boakye-Yiadom's sculpture made out of 20-plus helium-filled balloons that butt up against the ceiling while the ribbons with which they have been tied lead to a pair of penny loafer shoes held up en pointe; balancing in the moment as Jackson did in his famous ""freeze"" dance move.Nearby is Time Can Be A Villain Or A Friend by Hank Willis Thomas. It is an appropriated image from a 1984 edition of Ebony Magazine, which shows an imagined version of how Michael Jackson might look like in the year 2000. At first, the fact that they got it so hopelessly wrong is funny, and then it isn't.The elephant in the room - or chimp, I should say - is that the curators were unable to loan any one of the three or four versions of Jeff Koons' famous sculpture Michael Jackson and Bubbles. That's a bit like not having Pele in the best ever Brazilian soccer team, or cutting a chapter out of Great Expectations.it leaves a big hole in the show.But despite that necessary omission (wittily acknowledged by the curators with a prominently displayed photograph of the sculpture by Louise Lawler, and a satirical take on it by Paul McCarthy) and a scrapbook feel of the display, it is an affecting exhibition.We bear witness to a sensitive, creative young boy becoming a commodity to be exploited: a Warholian product of popular culture whose soul is used like the fizz in bottle of Coke to add a little sparkle in the lives of thirsty consumers.That's the truth this show tells. Michael Jackson's role was to sit in his gilded cage until he was wanted by someone to sell records, or magazines, or art, or - as is the case here - exhibition tickets."

entertainment	Leonardo da Vinci's abandoned and hidden artwork reveals its secrets		"New research into one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous works has revealed fresh information about an abandoned composition hidden under the painting.Experts have found initial designs for the angel and infant Christ beneath the surface of the Virgin of the Rocks.The designs are significantly different to how they look in the final painting, which hangs in the National Gallery.The hidden designs were revealed using macro X-ray fluorescence maps and infrared and hyperspectral imaging.An earlier discovery in 2005 revealed the Virgin's pose had been changed, but there were only hints of the other figures.According to the National Gallery's head of conservation Larry Keith, the discoveries ""give new insight into how da Vinci was thinking"".The new research reveals the angel and the infant Christ were originally positioned higher up in the drawing, with the former facing out and looking down.It is not known why Leonardo abandoned his original composition.Mr Keith told the BBC that it fitted ""into a wider narrative of how we understand him as an artist who was always changing, adjusting and revising"".Marika Spring, the gallery's head of science, said: ""The first time round [in 2005], the figure of the Virgin was very clear.""This time we can see an angel and a Christ child we couldn't really see before. We could see a few lines but we couldn't see what it was.""""We had an awareness of part of the composition and now we have a great deal more understanding of the whole group arrangement,"" said Keith.Leonardo was commissioned to paint the Virgin of the Rocks to decorate a chapel altarpiece in Milan in 1483.Its full title is The Virgin with the Infant Saint John the Baptist adoring the Christ Child accompanied by an Angel.A different version of the painting hangs in the Louvre in Paris. The two versions were brought together for an exhibition in 2011.The Virgin of the Rocks will be the focus of an ""immersive"" exhibition later this year, which will investigate the painting ""and the inventive mind that created it"".Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece will run from 9 November to 12 January at the National Gallery in central London.Follow us on Facebook and on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Is Saatchi Gallery selfie exhibition just self-promotion?	Selfie bandwagonBrainstorming sessions'Good business is best art'The 'purposeful age'	"I have never taken a selfie. I'm far too ugly.That said, I have ruined other people's, on those occasions when asked by a friend or arts fan to join them in a smartphone photo.I'm happy to say yes - it's not as if I'm ever going to have to look back at the image.I'd be horrified if I did, and mortified if it appeared in some public context like an art exhibition. I don't like causing offence.Fortunately for us, such an occurrence is highly unlikely but it is possible, and increasingly so.Selfie-themed exhibitions are to museums and galleries what dancefloors are to dads: a tempting opportunity to show how young and trendy they are while in reality communicating the exact opposite.They all seem to be at it, from the venerable Mauritshuis in The Hague to the yoof-loving Tate Modern. The Saatchi Gallery is the latest to jump aboard the selfie bandwagon with a show it says ""will be the world's first exhibition exploring the history of the selfie from old masters to the present day, and will celebrate the truly creative potential of a form of expression often derided for its inanity"".I'm not sure if the ""world's first"" claim is valid, but I'm absolutely certain that the long history of the self-portrait has not been ""derided for its inanity"".Some of the greatest works of art ever produced are self-portraits. We know that. It has long been a respected genre used by artists to demonstrate their virtuosity, while having the added advantage of the sitter/model being free.Anyway, to compare a painstakingly painted Rembrandt self-portrait with an opportunist snap taken by Helle Thorning-Schmidt flanked by David Cameron and Barak Obama at Nelson Mandela's funeral is silly.It's like equating the diary entry of a lovelorn teenager with a novel by Alice Munro - they don't stand comparison. Both have their place, both can be art, but they are quite different.When I first heard about the show, it sounded like the sort of idea the gallery's communications department might come up with to attract ""new audiences"". And then I read the press release and discovered it WAS the communications department that came up with the concept.It had help from a PR company called H+K Strategies, part of the globe-spanning WPP Group, which counts Huawei, a Chinese smartphone brand, among its clients. This is not an unconnected fact. Huawei are the sponsors of the Saatchi Gallery show.In fact, according to the press release, they are its co-authors: ""Saatchi Gallery and Huawei, the world's number three smartphone brand, announce they have teamed up to present From Selfie to Self-Expression.""One of the team from H+K Strategies to whom I spoke talked of brainstorming sessions between the parties.She made no mention of breakout groups and brightly coloured pens - but I'd hazard a guess they were present. Selfie to Self-Expression feels like a show that started life writ large in pink letters (with yellow asterisk to the side) on front of a flip-chart.Huawei's involvement explains the comment in the press release about the self-portrait genre being ""derided for its inanity"". I don't think it meant self-portraiture, but selfie-portraiture.This is a show designed to elevate the status of the selfie from what they say can be viewed as an inane activity to an artform. Hence the stated aim to ""celebrate the creative potential of a form of expression…"".Add to this its commitment to ""highlight the emerging role of the smartphone as an artistic medium for self-expression"", and I think we know the corporate tail is wagging the art gallery dog.I'm not saying this to criticise - needs must and all that. It might be a great show, and even if it isn't there is something marvellously Warholian about an art gallery founded by an ad man conceiving an exhibition with the world's largest ad agency network. As Warhol once said: ""Good business is the best art.""No, the reason I mention the corporate sponsor is because I think its collaboration with the Saatchi Gallery is potentially more interesting than the show itself. The whole project would appear to be rooted in the notion of a new ""purposeful age"" in public relations as spelt out by H+K Strategies.They say: ""In the Purposeful Age companies and institutions have the opportunity to join a meaningful conversation around things that matter, take their place in culture and demonstrate their responsibility to society.""At H+K our purpose in this new age is to inspire creative and curious conversations that help brands and the public communicate to build better outcomes for everyone.""Okay, it's a tad hyperbolic, but you've got to hand it to them - the Saatchi show is a good example of them practising what they preach.It also helps makes sense of the whole enterprise, unifying the subject matter and the sponsor, which can be captured by simply adding three words to the current exhibition title: Selfie to Self-Expression - to Self-Promotion.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	National Gallery / Tate divide		"There is a fundamental flaw in an historic agreement between the National Gallery and the Tate. The two institutions settled on the idea of having a dividing line about twenty years ago, and came up with the idea that 1900 would be a suitable date at which to separate their collections and displays. It deal was precipitated by the then-imminent arrival of Tate Modern.It was agreed by Messrs McGregor and Serota that the National Gallery would show international art up until 1900, while Tate Modern would present work produced from that date. Simple.In fact, too simple, 1900 might be meaningful in terms of calendar dates, but it has absolutely no relevance to art history. Art didn't stop on the 31st December 1899 and then restart afresh and anew first thing the next day. No great art movement stopped at the end of the 19th Century, and none of note started in 1900. It is, frankly, a facile date to choose.And now that agreement is at risk. Gabriele Finaldi, who started as director of the National Gallery six months ago, has called it into question, hinting he wants to expand his remit well into the 20th Century.Art historians would happily write and talk at length about the date you could and should divide the collections of the two national institutions, but it'd always be open to challenge and debate. And that's because all art connects. As Cezanne once said of his own avant-garde efforts: ""I am simply adding another link to the chain"". Art is ever evolving, which is a fact the two institutions and their collections need to reflect.Cezanne's link in the chain is a case in point. He was predominantly a late-19th Century artist, although he died - working right up until the end - in 1906. He absolutely has to be in the National Gallery's collection, which is why Tate - as part of the agreement - has loaned its Cezanne to the good burghers of Trafalgar Square.But, you can't seriously tell the story of Cubism - a 20th Century art movement that falls within Tate's remit - without acknowledging the debt it owes to Cezanne's pioneering work. Matisse and Picasso - two modern masters in the Tate's canon - described him as ""the father of us all"".The same applies to Expressionism, which has roots in Van Gogh's 19th Century paintings (National Gallery), but is shown in all its anxious glory in Tate's displays of German and American Expressionism. The 1900 line is blurred, to say the very least.It is a false wall: an open border that the two institutions have happily crossed in the recent past. Tate had its blockbuster Gauguin exhibition, although he is a 19th Century artist; the National Gallery has dabbled in the contemporary.The reasonable way forward is for each institution to tell the stories it wishes to tell within the context of their collections. For that is what really separates the two: they are addressing the same subject in very different ways. The National Gallery has an art historical perspective, the Tate's is staunchly contemporary.There are other differences, too. That National Gallery, for instance, only collects and displays paintings: it is into two-dimensional art. The Tate, on the other hand, has galleries (and warehouses) full of sculptures, installations and sound pieces.That the two institutions cross over is inevitable, and - in my opinion - to be encouraged. There are many ways to look at art, and we, the public, no more want to look at the subject from a single perspective than did Picasso (or Cezanne, for that matter).If the National Gallery thinks displaying a painting by the contemporary artist Peter Doig next to one by El Greco will illuminate both in an interesting way, it should be allowed to do so. Similarly, if the Tate Modern curators are itching to pair Pierro della Francesca with David Hockney, why not let them?In New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met) and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) co-exist with both presenting modern and contemporary art. The get along well enough, but can find themselves competing for pictures at auction or in the form of gifts, which can be awkward. This is the area of activity where some clarity can be helpful.The need for some sort of dividing line is required when it comes to collecting. It is not in the interests of the British public to see two of its major public art institutions competing and bidding up the price of a painting at auction. That'd be daft. If they both want to buy a Picasso circa 1901, they should discuss it beforehand and come to an agreement that one or other institution will try and secure the work for the nation. They could even share the costs and the picture.And if they can't agree? Well, I would then recommend they ask a grown-up to decide on their behalf."

entertainment	David Hockney's home city Bradford gives him a gallery for 80th birthday		"The gallery where David Hockney found inspiration as a child has honoured the artist by opening a dedicated David Hockney Gallery for his 80th birthday.Hockney visited Cartwright Hall in Bradford in the 1940s and '50s.The venue's new permanent Hockney area contains works spanning his career, and unseen photos from his personal albums.It will host a party on Sunday - his birthday - with a Hockney Disco and a Hockneyfication Station, where visitors can don a blonde wig and round glasses.Hockney is widely regarded as Britain's greatest living painter and his exhibitions have drawn record-breaking crowds to the Tate and the Royal Academy in recent years.He learned his craft in Bradford, pushing a pram containing art materials around the city as he painted on the streets.Some of those paintings of street scenes and launderettes and markets, which he did while at Bradford School of Art, are in the Cartwright Hall exhibition, as are some of his earliest sketchbooks.""I used to love going to Cartwright Hall as a kid,"" Hockney said in a statement. ""It was the only place in Bradford I could see real paintings.""Curator Jill Iredale said: ""He's had quite a close connection with Cartwright Hall from when he was a child.""The first times he came were his parents bringing him here. They had a really strong belief that education was important and his father was particularly interested in art.""Other parts of his career are represented, from his subsequent studies at the Royal College of Art in London to a large-scale California pool painting to iPad sketches he made while living back in Yorkshire six years ago.He won't come to his birthday party at the gallery and its grounds on Sunday though - he has moved back to Los Angeles.Ms Iredale, who travelled to meet him twice while planning the exhibition, said: ""He has been incredibly generous in his support in lending us his works. He was very encouraging and supportive of what we were doing.""The photos from his personal albums include shots of him in the US standing by his beloved blue California pools soon after moving there for the first time in the 1960s.There are others of him with his mother and father on a boat in the Lake District in the 1970s, and with his dogs in the '80s.""We were really lucky that he granted us permission to first of all actually look at them and secondly to display them in public because they've never been shown before,"" Iredale said.Other items on display include a copy of the 1989 Bradford phone book, for which he designed the cover.A separate permanent exhibition showcasing the artist's work already exists in Salts Mill in Saltaire, just outside Bradford.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	National Gallery sued over 'stolen' Matisse portrait	'Family heirloom'The National Gallery statement in full:	"The National Gallery in London is being sued by heirs of the subject of a 1908 Matisse portrait.Three grandchildren of Margarete Moll, known as Greta, claim the gallery is unlawfully displaying the painting, and say it was stolen after World War Two.They began proceedings in a federal court in New York on Wednesday, claiming the Portrait of Greta Moll is rightfully theirs.The National Gallery said it will defend itself against the legal action.It added it had received the documents, and that it ""would not, even if the theft were proved, be under any obligation to return the painting to the family"". Its full statement is written below.The grandchildren - British-born Oliver Williams and Margarete Green and Iris Filmer of Germany - have been trying to gain possession of the painting for five years.They want $30m (£23m) in compensation if the work is not returned.The heirs filed their case in New York because they say the National Gallery has commercial interests in the US and has profited from the work through its display and the sale of associated merchandise.""This is a family heirloom of their grandmother, by Matisse, which belonged to her,"" their lawyer David Rowland told Reuters.""It is not acceptable, moral or legal for museums to bury their heads in the sand, and keep stolen paintings in their collections.""Moll, a pupil of Matisse, is believed to have sat for 10 three-hour sessions for the portrait.Her husband Oskar bought the painting from Matisse, the complaint said.Moll lived in Germany during the war and gave the painting to her husband Oskar's art student, who lived in Switzerland, for safe-keeping from looters after the conflict ended, according to the complaint.The student ran off with the painting and the work passed through the hands of US art galleries until it was bought in 1979 by the National Gallery in London, it is claimed.The heirs say the gallery should have been more suspicious of the origins of the painting but its director Gabriele Finaldi has refused to return the oil painting because of ""statutory constraints"".""Portrait of Greta Moll by Matisse was acquired by the National Gallery in 1979. It was purchased from a commercial gallery in London in good faith and the National Gallery has good title.""The descendants of Greta Moll believe that the family were wrongfully deprived of the painting in 1947.""The National Gallery understands that both Greta Moll and her husband were living in Germany during the war and were regarded by the Nazis as degenerate artists. Several years after the war ended, and following the death of her husband (in 1947), Greta Moll left Germany for Wales (1947/48), so she was not fleeing from Nazi persecution. We understand that the family believe that Portrait of Greta Moll was stolen by a family friend or acquaintance to whom she entrusted the painting in 1947.""Whilst further information on the painting's history has recently come to light which indicates a gap in provenance between 1947 and 1949, there is no certainty that the painting was stolen and the alleged theft of the painting in 1947 has not been proven. Even were it to be proved, the National Gallery remains (by virtue of the purchase in 1979) the legal owner of the painting, which it holds for the Nation.""When the National Gallery bought Portrait of Greta Moll in 1979 it made the types of enquiries which all UK museums and galleries regularly made at that time regarding the history of a work when purchasing a painting.""The National Gallery would not, even if the theft were proved, be under any obligation to return the painting to the family - (just as any individual who had purchased the painting in good faith in 1979 would be under no obligation to return it). The National Gallery is in fact prohibited from making transfers of paintings in its collection, so could not in any event transfer the painting to the family.""The National Gallery first became aware of the family's interest when it received a letter from lawyers acting for the family in 2011. Prior to that date, the National Gallery had had contact with a daughter of Greta Moll, but it had never been suggested to the National Gallery that the painting had been stolen from the family. No legal claim had been made for the painting through the courts until this week (w/c 5 September 2016).""The National Gallery will be defending itself against this legal action.""It is also worth noting that in the light of concern that some works of art now in public collections may have been looted or otherwise improperly acquired during the Nazi era (1933-1945), without restitution having been made, the National Gallery, like all the other national museums, has paid particular attention to the whereabouts of its paintings during those years.""In March 1999, with the cooperation of the Gallery, The Art Newspaper published an initial list of paintings in the Gallery with incomplete provenance information for the period 1933-1945. Since then the Gallery's research has continued and an updated list is available on the National Gallery website.""Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Ibrahim Mahama: The artist building a parliament from recycled train seats		"Dozens of worn plastic train seats and dilapidated wooden lockers that were destined for the dump in Ghana have ended up in a Manchester art gallery, in a work by one of Africa's most exciting young artists.When hundreds of hard, scratched second-class train seats were abandoned after their clapped-out carriages were scrapped several years ago, only one man was likely to be interested in them.Ibrahim Mahama has made his name by collecting objects other people would dismiss as junk, but which he thinks can help him tell a story.After salvaging the seats, the artist has repurposed 120 of them - plus several dozen old lockers once used by train workers - to create a four-sided imitation of Ghana's parliament chamber at the Whitworth gallery in Manchester. It's called Parliament of Ghosts.The ghosts, he says, are the opportunities his home country failed to grasp over the years, and the train seats and railway workers' lockers symbolise that story.Ghana's train system was built under British colonial rule and was due to be expanded after the optimism of independence in 1957, with the railway workers instrumental in the independence movement. But the optimism faded, economic growth struggled to take off and a series of military coups hampered progress. The railways were neglected for decades.Parliament of Ghosts represents the ""potential of a country that was yet to manifest itself, but never came to be, in a way"", Mahama says. The seats and other objects carry the memories of everything they have witnessed and been through, he believes. ""They embody all of it.""The same goes for the lockers. ""A lot of these cabinets were used to store workers' clothes and tools and things. So there's a lot of grease from the restoration of trains and the dismantling.""The cabinets almost become these living organisms that witness the entire life cycles of generations upon generations of how a certain system has somehow been maintained - but at the same time the flaws of it. I like to think they are living things that somehow can speak in a language that the workers themselves cannot.""Parliament of Ghosts doesn't just represent the flaws of Ghana's government, but is meant to highlight the failures of parliaments around the world - not least, at a time of Brexit deadlock, the UK's. ""Parliament of Ghosts is a question of what potential lies within the failures of the world,"" Mahama says.The train seats are actually thought to have been manufactured in Manchester or Leeds, adding to the story of their return. This is the Ghanaian artist's first major UK exhibition - commissioned by the Manchester International Festival - and people are invited to go and use his parliament chamber to host their own debates, performances and screenings.He has many more train seats back home, and is planning to create a much larger version of the parliament at the arts centre he opened in his home town of Tamale in March.""When I propose a work, I always make sure I have one maybe three or four times larger in Ghana which we can somehow use to create permanent spaces for the local community to experience,"" he says. ""Because that's the point. I guess I'm quite tired of seeing how we as artists produce works which end up going to Europe and other places, whereas locally our own people don't get to experience these ideas that we're working with.""Mahama also talks about how his institute - the Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art - is working on initiatives to help with agriculture, housing and education. But he is also in demand in Europe and beyond. At the age of 32, he is represented by the prestigious White Cube gallery in London and earlier this year was the youngest of six artists to exhibit in the first Ghanaian pavilion at the Venice Biennale.He has previously made artworks out of hundreds of wooden tool boxes used by shoe shiners, and by covering buildings in jute sacks that had been used to carry cocoa, maize and charcoal. He recently also used the sacks to replace the flags outside the United Nations' headquarters at the Rockerfeller Center in New York. Replacing national flags with decaying food sacks ""reminded us of the global condition in a way"", he says.The Manchester exhibition also includes a replica of the concrete silos that were built in Ghana in the late 1950s to store cocoa beans before they were processed, but which remained empty. There are also battered Ghanaian wooden school bookcases that Mahama obtained after offering to make new furniture for the schools to replace them.""The older the objects, with the decay and the stains, that's what I find a value in,"" the artist says. ""The memory and the pattern is something that speaks to us - rather than when a thing is very new, and it almost has no soul to it.""Parliament of Ghosts is at the Whitworth gallery until 29 September.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Inside Dame Zaha Hadid's 'womb-like' Science Museum gallery		The Science Museum in London has unveiled its new mathematics gallery, which was designed by the late architect Dame Zaha Hadid - the first of her projects to open in the UK since her death in March 2016.Dame Zaha Hadid was a mathematics graduate and a master of the unexpected.Which explains - perhaps - why the first thing you encounter when walking into the Science Museum's new Maths gallery is a 1929 Handley Page bi-plane suspended from the ceiling.This was to be Dame Zaha's design touchstone, the airflow from its wings dictating a dynamic design of sweeping curves and a huge sculptural form that frames the gallery's central space.There is, though, a function beyond the decorative to this particular form. It acts as a barrier to stop visitors using the gallery as a thoroughfare, which had been the case before its £5m upgrade.The space is lit with a serene purple light, giving it a womb-like feel, creating a contemplative aesthetic, which is badly undermined by noises off; namely the arcade-like soundtrack emanating from the interactive displays in the Energy Gallery nearby.Had the architect lived to see her design realised, I suspect she would not have tolerated such audio pollution of her thoughtful, peaceful vibe.The displays are arranged around broad themes: Trade & Travel, War & Peace, Maps & Models, Life & Death, Trade & Travel, Form & Beauty.The idea is to show how maths plays a central and essential role in our everyday life, and is not some abstract activity undertaken by nerdy individuals in back rooms.Stories are brought to the fore illustrating where maths is present in our lives, which is a perfectly understandable curatorial strategy. But it does relegate the hard arithmetic, calculus and geometry that enabled the creation of the objects on display to a very minor role.I think that's OK. This gallery is an introduction to a massive subject, and is aiming to offer as wide an audience as possible a way into what can be perceived as a very dry subject.There are some real hits. The Heath Robinson-looking Moniac machine is a real winner.It was designed by Bill Phillips in 1952 for the London School of Economics to model the British economy. For two decades, this marvellous looking contraption, where water=money, was used to teach some of the world's finest economic minds Keynesian principles. It did have one major shortcoming, though. It didn't account for human behaviour…There's plenty more in the Winton Gallery to enjoy. William Froude's Swan and Raven hulls, for instance, are really compelling. Here we are shown how the engineer's quiet experiments on the River Dart led to the redesign of the world's super-tankers.I could go on. The Turner sketches on perspective are great. As is the PDP-8 minicomputer (1965), which the display label tells us was the first successful computer small enough to fit into offices. It couldn't do much, but by golly, it looked good.So does this new gallery. That's down to Dame Zaha's team.But the imaginative and instructive displays were put together by the Science Museum's David Rooney. He has taken a calculated risk by privileging story-telling over pure maths, which won't please everyone but I think - on balance - is a good decision.You could say: the sum is great and so are the parts.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	David Hockney honoured with gallery in home city of Bradford		"David Hockney's home city of Bradford is to honour the artist by opening a permanent gallery dedicated to his work to mark his 80th birthday.The David Hockney Gallery will be housed in the city's Cartwright Hall.""I used to love going to Cartwright Hall as a kid,"" Hockney said in a statement. ""It was the only place in Bradford I could see real paintings.""The new gallery will show works ranging from early sketches to well-known paintings and his iPad drawings.It will open on 7 July - two days before his 80th birthday.Cartwright Hall claims to own the largest public collection of Hockney's earliest work and is converting one of its existing rooms into the dedicated Hockney gallery.Its exhibits will include drawings and sketches from his days studying in the city, many of which, Cartwright Hall says, have rarely been seen in public and never all at once.The council-run gallery also owns later works including Le Plongeur, his 1978 pool scene.Cartwright Hall curator Jill Iredale said: ""It was important to us that we mark this birthday of one of the world's most significant, influential and engaging artists who just happens to be from Bradford.""This new gallery will be a place where people will be able to see what inspired Hockney while he was here in the city and engage directly with some of his work from then through to now.""A permanent exhibition showcasing the artist's work already exists in Bradford's Salts Mill building.Its 1853 Gallery displays a large number of his paintings and a further 49 pictures from his The Arrival of Spring collection are housed in a separate room.Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937 and studied at Bradford Art School between the ages of 16 and 20.He moved to London to study at the Royal College of Art in 1959 and went on to become one of the leading figures in British art.He has not always had smooth relationship with his hometown - in 2013 he said he had ""almost given up on Bradford"" and that a suggestion that the council could sell some of its art collection to raise funds would make him give up entirely.On Friday, a spokesman for Bradford Council said that proposal was never seriously considered.In a statement, Sarah Ferriby, Bradford Council's executive member for environment, sport and culture, said: ""Cartwright Hall is the natural home for a gallery celebrating David Hockney, a son of Bradford and much loved as an artist all over the world.""It will be so exciting to view his early work gathered together so we can see what initially inspired him and how his work developed over the years.""This permanent gallery will boost Cartwright Hall's status as 'must-go-to' destination for visitors to the district and for all Hockney lovers everywhere.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Singapore opens £250m National Gallery		"Singapore has opened its state-of-the-art National Gallery, home to the world's largest public collection of modern art from South East Asia.The 64,000-sq-m (689,000-sq-ft) attraction has taken a decade to come to fruition and cost about £250m.The gallery is housed in the restored former British colonial-era Supreme Court and City Hall buildings.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who opened the gallery, said he hoped it would become ""the pride of Singapore"".The project is part of the city-state's wish to become a centre of culture and the arts and to overcome its traditional reputation as a money-driven, and somewhat sterile, environment.Inside are more than 8,000 works from the 19th and 20th Centuries in all media - painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography and video.Artists showcased include Fernando Amorsolo and Imelda Cajipe-Anday, of the Philippines, and forerunners of modern art in the region such as Indonesia's Raden Saleh. The gallery also has an area dedicated solely to Singapore art.Future plans include a rolling programme of international exhibitions.In March, it has plans to hold an exhibition on modernism with the Centre Pompidou in Paris. And in October, the gallery hopes to collaborate with London's Tate Britain on a display of work telling the story of the British Empire.On the forthcoming opening weekend, a carnival will include art workshops, interactive installations and food stalls.Admission to the museum's galleries and exhibitions will be free during the opening fortnight, from Tuesday 24 November to 6 December."
entertainment	Maria Balshaw: Manchester gallery boss to be Tate's first female director	Who is Maria Balshaw?By Ian Youngs, BBC News arts and entertainment reporterProminent women in UK arts	"Maria Balshaw, the head of Manchester's acclaimed Whitworth Art Gallery, has been chosen to run the Tate art empire.Dr Balshaw will become the first female director in the Tate's 120-year history and will replace Sir Nicholas Serota, who has been at the helm since 1988.She will take charge of the Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London as well as offshoots in Liverpool and St Ives.Under her stewardship, the Whitworth had an award-winning expansion in 2015. She also runs Manchester Art Gallery.Dr Balshaw said she will focus on developing the organisation's reputation as ""artistically adventurous"".She added: ""I am tremendously excited to be leading Tate in the next chapter of its life. I look forward to developing Tate's reputation as the most artistically adventurous and culturally inclusive gallery in the world.""Balshaw, whose appointment was approved by Prime Minister Theresa May, is the gallery's ninth director and will take up her new post on 1 June.Lord Browne, chairman of the trustees of Tate, said: ""The Trustees and I know that Maria has the vision, drive and stature to lead Tate into its next phase of development. We enthusiastically look forward to working with her as she does so.""An ambitious, charismatic and indefatigable operator who is admired by artists and administrators alike, Dr Balshaw has been one of the key movers in Manchester's cultural renaissance over the past decade.She took over the Whitworth in 2006 then took on the main civic gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, in 2011. They have been good training for Tate - you could say the contemporary Whitworth is the Tate Modern of Manchester, while the more traditional Manchester Art Gallery is the equivalent of Tate Britain.She has been Manchester City Council's cultural leader, is on the Arts Council England board and was made a CBE in 2015. She proved her vision and leadership with the £15m redevelopment of the Whitworth, which was named museum of the year by The Art Fund in 2015.She also helped persuade then Chancellor George Osborne to include a £110m arts venue, The Factory, in his Northern Powerhouse plans.But she is equally at home with the world's leading artists - she has forged strong relationships with the likes of Gerhard Richter, Marina Abramovic and Cornelia Parker.Her Whitworth exhibitions have shown a passion for work from all corners of the globe, from the excellent current Warhol show to the art of her beloved West Africa, and work that brings her rooms to life - stimulating, not static. Which sums her up pretty well.She has big shoes to fill. During his 29 years in charge, Sir Nicholas has built up the Tate to be one of the world's most successful art brands.Tate Modern alone gets 4.5 million visitors per year and has just opened a £260m new extension. Tate St Ives is currently closed for renovation and will reopen in March.When he announced his departure, Sir Nicholas set a challenge to his successor, saying Tate still has ""the potential to reach broad audiences across the UK and abroad, through its own programmes, partnerships and online"".Sir Nicholas will now become chairman of Arts Council England.Maria Balshaw's appointment as director of the Tate sees her join a growing number of women in top jobs in the UK arts establishment.They include Frances Morris, who became Tate Modern's director last year, Jude Kelly, artistic director of London's Southbank Centre, and Tamara Rojo, artistic director as well as principal lead dancer at English National Ballet.Vicky Featherstone and Josie Rourke head up London's Royal Court and Donmar Warehouse theatres respectively, while Cressida Pollock has been the ENO's chief executive officer since 2015.Catherine Mallyon jointly runs the RSC as executive director, alongside artistic director Gregory Doran, while Erica Whyman is the RSC's deputy artistic director.In the world of film, a pair of Amandas - Berry and Nevill - hold the chief executive positions at Bafta and the BFI respectively.As co-organiser of the annual Glastonbury Festival, Emily Eavis arguably occupies one of the most influential posts in the UK music scene.Not half as influential, though, as Karen Bradley MP's current role - that of Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Still Undead: Will Gompertz reviews the Bauhaus show in Nottingham ★★★★★		"Happy birthday Nottingham Contemporary!The Caruso St John-designed art gallery situated near the city's old lace-making district is celebrating its 10th anniversary: a first decade in which it has mounted in excess of 50 exhibitions and welcomed more than two million visitors. Impressive stuff. Especially when you consider its approach to putting on shows.This is an institution which doesn't sugar the art pill.Its exhibitions tend to be as dry as dust, stripped to their bare essentials without any of the populist added extras beloved by wealthier museums and galleries. It wears its academic heart on its hipster sleeve, trusting visitors to share in its spirit of intellectual enquiry (exhibitions are free), with the promise of delicious post-show cake in the cafe (£5.95 for a coffee with a slice of brownie).It's a winning formula.Bauhausian, you might say.At least you might if you had seen the gallery's latest show, Still Undead: Popular Culture in Britain Beyond the Bauhaus.The exhibition marks the centenary of the now defunct German art school, which started life in 1919 in Weimar before relocating to Dessau in 1925. In the 14 years of its existence (Hitler shut it down in 1933) the now legendary institution played a central role in shaping the prevailing modernist aesthetics of the 20th Century.The teaching staff boasted some incredible artists, including Wassily Kandinsky, Anni Albers, Josef Albers, and Paul Klee. The architect and designer Marcel Breuer studied and taught there, during which time he pioneered the use of tubular steel in furniture design, resulting in the iconic Model B3 chair now found in office lobbies the world over.The range of designs, art and ideas emanating from the Bauhaus was incredible.Many were beautiful, such as Joost Schmidt's poster for the 1923 Bauhaus Exhibition, and Marianne Brandt's Coffee and Tea Set (1924).Almost all were worthy of your time and attention. To see them laid out in an exhibition would be terrific.But you won't be finding any of them in the Nottingham Contemporary exhibition. It's not how they roll in this neck of the woods.It'd be too obvious.Instead, the curators have served up a very different but utterly compelling show, which feels a little esoteric at first but reveals itself to be a timely and important provocation.It focuses on the experimental nature of the Bauhaus and how new philosophies about teaching and technology developed on its campuses in the 1920s and '30s affected post-War culture in Britain.The exhibition starts with a large hanging screen showing a film of Kurt Schwerdtfeger's 1922 Reflektorische Farblichtspiele (Reflecting Colour-Light Games): a play of sorts, with a Heath Robinson-like invention acting as the set.The contraption was made by Schwerdtfeger when a student at the Bauhaus for its Lantern Festival. It consisted of a large handmade, cube-shaped, apparatus containing lamps, in front of which performers would move cut-out shapes to create interconnecting geometric shadows on the surface of a screen accompanied by music.The images look a bit like a pop video for Kraftwerk directed by a Russian constructivist on acid (it was first performed at a party hosted by Kandinsky).It's good.And significant, as a reference point for both the development of avant-garde filmmaking and performance art.Behind it hangs another screen also presenting a film of a revered experimental work. It is called Light-Play: Black, White, Grey (1933) by the Hungarian artist and Bauhaus master László Moholy-Nagy.It shows the interplay of shapes created by shining light through a rotating (kinetic) metal sculpture he called Light-Prop Lightspace Modulator.These aren't ""easy"" works of art.In fact, they weren't really conceived as works of art at all.They were artistic investigations into a central idea of the Bauhaus, which founder Walter Gropius referred to as ""an alliance of the arts"": a desire to unite art, design, technology, and life.Moholy-Nagy believed such a synthesis was possible, enlightening even, and was searching for a way of articulating the vision. If such a concept appeared vital at the time, it seems even or pressing now.But which art school or institution is currently investigating such bold and ambitious ideas?Several were for a while. In Germany and America and Britain.After the Bauhaus closed, Moholy-Nagy, Gropius and many other students and masters came to the UK to look for work and share their knowledge. There's a slow but captivating film by Moholy-Nagy studying the modernist architecture of Whipsnade and London zoos.At this point in the exhibition the emphasis shifts from Bauhaus emigres to the influence they had on Britain. Mary Quant (""the Bauhaus ideal is about making modern design accessible""), Terence Conran, and Vidal Sassoon all feature. As does the artist Richard Hamilton who is represented by a handful of works including his excellent painting, Trainsition IIII (1954).Hamilton was one of several advocates of a foundation course called Basic Design, based on the Vorkurs preliminary course at the Bauhaus, which encouraged intuition and experimentation. The results of Basic Design course are presented in the final room of the exhibition, which is dedicated to work connected to Leeds Polytechnic in the 1970s and 80s: a place the artist Patrick Heron proclaimed to be ""the most influential art school in Europe since the Bauhaus.""Frankly, I'm not sure time has borne this out, but it still makes for a rousing finale: a black-walled, double-height gallery displaying - among many objects and films - a wonderfully eccentric Charles Atlas video called Mrs. Peanut Visits New York (1992), and an unforgettable series of photographs featuring performance artist Leigh Bowery by Robyn Beeche called 7th Alternative Miss World…(1986-7).This is to barely scratch the surface of an encyclopaedic show that has resisted presenting the typical Bauhaus collection and focused more on its spirit: its openness to ideas, its willingness to challenge convention; to seek to unite art, technology, life, and science: to re-think the purpose of education, the contents of the curriculum, and the student experience.This was an institution that urgently wanted to make a difference; to positively impact on the lives of those on and beyond its campus.It leaves you thinking that is what we need now: a revolutionary approach to art and education. There's no reason it shouldn't start here in the UK. After all, that's where the seeds of the original Bauhaus were sown.But that's another story…Recent reviews by Will GompertzFollow Will Gompertz on Twitter"
entertainment	The pop star who walked across America	Mum's concern	"US singer Mike Posner is best known for the song I Took A Pill In Ibiza, which spent four weeks at number one in 2016.But after losing his father to cancer two years ago, the star gave up his old habits, disavowing drink and drugs, and embarking on a life-changing journey.On 15 April this year, he started walking in Asbury Park, New Jersey; and didn't stop until he reached the Pacific Ocean, six months later.""I walked to become someone I'm actually proud of,"" he tells the BBC.""Before I left, I suspected I had a little pocket of untapped potential inside me,"" he says. ""I was wrong, there was a huge basin of untapped potential.""The star's journey is documented in the video for his new single, Live Before I Die, a collaboration with British producer Naughty Boy.Posner covered 2,851 miles (4,588km) on his trek, rising at 4am every morning, and sometimes walking 30 miles a day.Along the way, he was bitten by a rattlesnake and had to be air-lifted to hospital in Colorado, where he was told he might lose his leg. Amazingly, he resumed his expedition just three weeks later, in the exact spot where he left off.But the ""hardest day"" came three months into the walk, after floods in Missouri forced him to change his route - meaning a two-day detour in the ""wrong direction"" to reach the border with Kansas.""I kept saying to myself, 'Just get to Kansas,' and that was fine... Until I actually got to Kansas. Because I'd created this false finish line in my head, my brain thought I was done when I wasn't even halfway.""The prospect of getting up and walking again the next day after crossing that imaginary ""finish line"" took a toll on his health.""My body was really starting to fall apart,"" he recalls. ""If I didn't consciously focus on taking the next step, my body would stop. And I was so tired that my default was stop.""But Posner stuck to his mantra - ""keep going"". For the rest of the 186-day trip, he visualised his goals in terms of ""checkpoints"", not finish lines.As he continued, and his beard got bushier, Posner grew stronger and more accustomed to the discomfort. He developed a dislike for cities and suburbs; which made him feel claustrophobic ""after being under the stars and in the desert"" in Nevada and Colorado.But the highlight was his 10-day hike across the Navajo Nation - the American Indian territory that spreads across Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.The Diné people showed Posner a ""kindness and compassion that you won't believe"", bestowing him with a sacred eagle feather, and making him reassess his relationship with the land.As if the challenge wasn't enough on its own, the 31-year-old kept working on music during the journey, releasing a new song every time he crossed a state border.When he reached his final destination, he dropped a mixtape - also called Keep Going - including several interludes where the likes of Diddy and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler left words of encouragement on his voicemail.The final message came from his (extremely) concerned mum who advised, ""You can stop doing this if you want, if it's too hard or you decide it's too much.""I think you're going to be shocked at how difficult it is, but I love you for trying it.""Posner's pilgrimage ended on 18 October, as he plunged into the Pacific Ocean at Venice Beach, California, cheered on by fans and supporters.✅A post shared by Mike Posner (@mikeposner) on Oct 19, 2019 at 10:20am PDTEnd of Instagram post by mikeposnerBut after giving up all of his vices, how did he celebrate?""I went to bed. Woke up at 4am. Hit the boxing gym,"" says the star.""It sounds crazy because my body was so broken and tired from all those miles but I needed to let my body and mind know that even though The Walk is over, we aren't done.""""Now 'The Walk' is over but it's my job to keep exploring what's there.""Posner's epic journey inspired his new song, Live Before I Die - an uplifting, emotional pop track that sums up his personal transformation.""I stopped smoking weed a year ago / Maybe I'm less cool now, I don't know / But I got two more albums done / Instead of sitting there all stoned / Yeah, I stopped smoking weed a year ago,"" sings the star over a nimble guitar hook.""It's the most heartfelt and real song, it affects me and my core,"" says producer Naughty Boy, whose own mother has been affected by health problems in recent years.""After seeing the video, it's almost as if Mike walked for everyone and it feels like now is the time for all of us.""Meanwhile, Posner hasn't stopped challenging himself. In the past week, he's climbed two mountains - Oregon's Mount Hood and Washington's Mount Adams - with a combined height of more than 7,000 metres.So what's next?""I have many ideas but no plans,"" he says with a wink. ""I'm in the process of deciding what to do next.

entertainment	What happens when pop reunions turn toxic?	'No expiration dates'	"Producers, promoters and publishers turned down Melanie Blake's story The Thunder Girls for two decades because it's about four women in their 50s, the writer says. Now the tale of a former girl group is a book and sold-out play.Pop reunions are big business, but one thing fans are even more fascinated to see than their idols back on stage is how they really get on behind the scenes (or not). The response to the hilariously revealing Bros documentary proved that.Melanie Blake saw the truth about pop stars' personal relationships while working on Top of the Pops in the 1990s, as a journalist and then as an agent. She used to manage Bros's Luke Goss, as well as Steps' Claire Richards and Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp.While she was a freelance journalist, a magazine assigned her to write about life on a 1980s reunion tour. ""I went on the tour bus. It was absolutely hell,"" she says.""Everybody hated each other. People wouldn't talk to each other, and then they'd be like, 'Hello Wembley!' and they'd sing their songs, and then they'd all come back and immediately get in different parts of the bus and wouldn't speak to each other.""The Thunder Girls is her deliciously bitchy story of an '80s girl group who get back together to discuss a reunion 30 years after a toxic break-up.""Every band from Fleetwood Mac to Steps and the Rolling Stones have got missing members and have all had these meetings,"" she says. All five Spice Girls met up last year, she points out - but only four ended up going on the reunion trail.""Every band that reforms has to have a reunion dinner to see if old wounds can be healed enough so that the blood stops seeping whilst they're on the stage. That's what nobody ever sees.""Love my girls!!! So many kisses!!! X Exciting x #friendshipneverends #girlpowerA post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham) on Feb 2, 2018 at 8:27am PSTEnd of Instagram post by victoriabeckhamThe Thunder Girls are meant to have been prototype Spice Girls, and certainly have girl power. But their wounds run deep. Resentment and jealousy about romantic betrayals, financial skulduggery and career-ending bad behaviour have built up over decades.Blake, from Stockport, wrote the first version in 1999. She eventually published the Thunder Girls novel in July and used the book advance to finance a stage version starring Coronation Street's Beverley Callard, Nolan sister Coleen, Emmerdale's Sandra Marvin and ex-EastEnders star Carol Harrison.The characters have to decide whether a big pay cheque can overcome the fact that they hate each other's guts. There are some fabulously catty lines. ""Did you have a lift on both of your faces?"" asks the hard-up Roxie, played by Callard, of Harrison's Chrissie, who has overshadowed her former bandmates as a TV talent show judge and tabloid favourite.Nolan plays Anita, who dropped off the radar after a disastrous Eurovision appearance. As one of the Nolans, one of the biggest groups of the late '70s and early '80s, she also brings some insight.""Oh my God, I've known bands over the years that genuinely, apart from when they're on stage, can't stand each other,"" she says. ""They all have separate dressing rooms and separate cars. But when they're on stage, it works.""Despite the fact that Blake managed the Nolans' lucrative 2009 tour, they insist that was one reunion that did not inspire The Thunder Girls. ""We were sisters, so there was no toxic fallout,"" says Nolan.The Thunder Girls stage show, directed by Joyce Branagh (sister of Sir Ken), is on at The Lowry arts centre in Salford for just five nights and broke the record for the fastest ticket sales for a new play in the venue's Quays theatre.It has gone down particularly well with women of the same age as the characters, who can relate to the themes of ageing and long-term friendships.Blake is already talking about taking it to London's West End, and the initial response is vindication after two decades of being told that a story about four middle-aged women would never work.""First it was picked up as a book. And then publishers said 'Well, we'll do it, but we think it should be based on younger women.' And I said no.""Then the rights were optioned by a TV company, she says. ""They came back and said 'We like it, but we think they should be 35.' I said, 'No, they have to be in their 50s because they have to be women. They have to have lived, loved and lost.'""And then last year, when we started looking at the stage show and we started looking at investors and promoters, they were all like 'What, four women? Over 50? Singing? And they actually still think they're it, do they?'""Callard, best known for playing Liz McDonald in Coronation Street, says ageism and sexism are still rife in the entertainment world.""More often than not you look at a film script, or you look at plays or films or television things that have been made, and you would get 10 male actors in it and maybe two women if you're lucky,"" she says.""More often than not, you would see a husband who's maybe 50 with a 30-year-old wife. It happens all the time.""Our business is so sexist and so anti-women. When Melanie told me about this play, and when I read it, I just said 'I've got to do this'. Because it's about real women.""Speaking during a break in rehearsals, Blake says a male-dominated force in the entertainment industry (""Let's call it 'the man'"") has tried to dictate what people want to see.""It shouldn't be the case that there's only one woman in every show, or that there's only one older woman. I've just watched four women over 50 smash it.""It's electric because they've lived lives. Too many people like to write women off with expiration dates. Women don't have expiration dates. Life only makes them more interesting.""The Thunder Girls is at The Lowry in Salford until 28 September. Melanie Blake's novel is published by Pan Macmillan.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Pet Shop Boys bring a pop masterclass to Hyde Park	SetlistBananarama's lunchtime carnageFrancis Rossi had a gruelling training regimeKelsea Ballerini premiered a brand new songClean Bandit have been working in China	"""He smiled!"" shouted a member of the audience in astonishment, as the Pet Shop Boys headlined London's Hyde Park.And he was right: Chris Lowe, the band's inscrutable keyboard player, was sporting a big old grin as he bashed out the bassline to West End Girls.He was apparently taken aback by the crowd's reception to their set, part of a day-long event held by BBC Radio 2.""This feels so good,"" beamed frontman Neil Tennant from the stage. ""It's fantastic to be here"".The synthpop duo, who rewrote the rules of pop in the 80s and 90s, had seemingly placed great importance on this gig, even tweaking their standard setlist to ""put more hits in"", Tennant told Radio 2 beforehand.""It's quite exciting doing an hour-long set with more hits - but I think it's a set you want the audience to feel energised by.""The 40,000-strong crowd returned the generosity by joining in with classics like Suburbia, It's A Sin and Left To My Own Devices.Never natural showmen, the duo provided visual spectacle via a large troupe of dancers, who energised Vocal with a spectacularly kinetic push-pull routine, and provided dashes of colour in their inflatable balloon costumes during the encore.There were a few surprise guests for good measure - Years & Years' Olly Alexander duetting on the band's new single Dreamland, and Beverley Knight stunningly recreating Dusty Springfield's vocals on What Have I Done To Deserve This.""OK, we'll do another old song,"" announced Tenant towards the end of the set. ""But which old song? There are so many to choose from.""He teased the audience with fragments of Opportunities and Rent before the unmistakable synth riff for Go West chimed out - prompting another mass singalong, with some fans even donning the video's unforgettable conical hats.The set ended with a snatch of 2016's The Pop Kids, a song that acts as a potted history of the band: ""We were young but we imagined we were so sophisticated / Telling everyone we knew that rock was overrated.""With rock all but edged out of the charts, and artists like Charli XCX, Billie Eilish, and Years & Years building on the Pet Shop Boys' pop template, it's no surprise Chris Lowe was smiling: The gig felt like a lap of honour and a pop masterclass rolled into one.The band's set came at the end of Radio 2's Festival In A Day, where the bill also included Simply Red, Clean Bandit and Status Quo - who performed with an empty microphone stand on the stage, in honour of guitarist Rick Parfitt, who died in 2016.Playing the support slot, Westlife drew the biggest crowd of the day for a vocally-impressive set of torch ballads, including You Lift Me Up and Flying Without Wings.Soul star Emeli Sande, however, had to pull out of the event, saying: ""I woke up this morning and my voice just wasn't there.""Here are some of the other moments worth noting:At a conservative estimate, more than 2,500 picnics were trampled into the ground as fans jumped around to Bananarama's glossy 80s pop hits: Venus, I Heard A Rumour, Love In The First Degree... The list goes on.Speaking backstage, Sarah and Keren revealed that the last time they'd been in Hyde Park it was as fans, watching Barbra Streisand's comeback show earlier this summer.""Actually, the first song we ever recorded was Evergreen by Barbara Streisand, on a cassette player when we were at school,"" Keren recalled.Sadly, though, this pivotal moment in pop history has been lost in the mists of time.""I've got loads of old cassettes but my brother tended to record over most of them. Bruno Brookes doing the Top 40 and that sort of thing,"" said Keren.So how about recreating the cover for their next album?""A disco version?"" asks the singer. ""I've just tried to imagine it in my head and... maybe not.""Status Quo were one of the day's biggest hits - with hundreds of fans beerily recreating the hands-on-hips swivel dance for Down Down; followed by a rousing singalong to Rockin' All Over The World.Frontman Francis Rossi seemed decades younger than his 70 years as he strutted around the stage - but that sort of athleticism doesn't come easy.""I like to be match fit, so I had to swim double this morning to try to get myself ready,"" he said in his dressing room, as he limbered up his fingers on a spring-loaded grip strengthener.""I ate at 11:30 this morning because I like to leave six hours between a meal and a show; and I do a few crunches, because that helps pop the chest and the diaphragm, for some reason.""Who said rock stars have an easy life?US country star Kelsea Ballerini, who's in the middle of recording her third album, popped across the Atlantic to play her new single, Homecoming Queen, for only the second time.So was she nervous about playing untested material to 40,000 people? Not especially.""I think this is probably an audience that I'll have to introduce myself to, anyway,"" she said modestly before the show.""I'm prepared for none of them to know any of my songs - so it takes the pressure off of the one actual new song when all of them are seemingly new.""Fresh from the success of composing Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello's Senorita, Clean Bandit have been off to China, where they've been writing with two up-and-coming stars Henry Lau, and Tia Ray.Travelling to Shanghai was a bit of an eye-opener for the band.""We were really shocked at the studios we got taken to out there,"" said Jack Patterson. ""They were phenomenal, you don't see new studios being built like that anywhere else in the world. It's a different level of investment in the music industry.""The band did encounter a few difficulties, though, with messaging services like WhatsApp banned in China.""We were like, 'Why isn't anyone replying? Do they hate us?'"" said cellist Grace Chatto.""In the end, we had to use a special app.""Meanwhile, the band revealed that work had started on their third album, which could herald a change of direction.""There are quite a few songs that we're working on finishing now that are more towards a hip-hop tempo and style,"" said Grace.""That's kind of solidifying as a plan over the last couple of weeks.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Iggy Pop: 'I've finally got the voice I was supposed to have'		"""Sweeeet Caroline...""The broken-glass mixed with sand tones of bona fide punk rock legend Iggy Pop are crooning a cover of Neil Diamond to an audience of one.How did this happen?As it turns out, it's the fault of his ex father-in-law...""You know, I finally got the voice that I was supposed to have in some senses. When I was 21, I was in love with a girl from Cleveland and we actually got married for a couple of weeks,"" he explains.""I had just put out the first Stooges album and I met her dad, he was a big shot in business. He said, 'Well, meeting and listening to you talk I guess you probably sing like Neil Diamond right?'""I've since learned a lot of respect for Neil but at that time, you don't tell Iggy Pop that he sounds like Neil Diamond. But on the other hand, a part of me was thinking, 'Damn, if I sang like Neil Diamond, I'd have a lot more money you know'.""The one-time Stooges frontman is in the UK to promote his new album Free, an album he has co-written with musician/composer Leron Thomas and film-maker/composer Sarah Lipstate, best known for her solo electric guitar project Noveller.It's a jazz-heavy introspective musing on subjects like mortality, love and sex and even features Iggy reciting poetry from Dylan Thomas.Iggy recorded the new LP after two separate tours of his previous album, the Josh Homme-produced Post Pop Depression, his best performing solo album to date and one which took him on the road with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Homme and Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders, including several shows at the Royal Albert Hall in London.""I felt a little drained,"" he says of the end of the tour.""As you mature, physically, when you get past 60 if you're still active, it's a good idea to put more of your efforts into mental work and less into physical work.""They might sound like surprising words from Iggy, the shirtless Peter Pan of rock who has outlived most of his musical contemporaries such as David Bowie and Lou Reed.""The PPD record was something where I showed up in the desert and lived with a bunch of guys for weeks and weeks and weeks,"" he says. ""In the studio, all together, sweaty, smelly, dusty, picking a booger, whatever, singing when it was my turn, that sort of thing for six, eight weeks. That's gruelling.""The new album by comparison was largely recorded, says Iggy, ""by email"".""It was not as physically exhausting, it was emotionally a full effort, though,"" he adds.The album opens with Free, a sparse piece of instrumentation in which Iggy intones the phrase ""I want to be free"". Free of what though? The trappings of fame? The constrictions of age? Life itself?He won't be drawn on the specifics for fear of ""explaining it to death or personalising it so that somebody else can't get into it in their own way"".""I can't get too personal without screwing it up for everybody.""Jazz horns and drum beats flow through the new album, from the beautiful sweeping nature of new single Sonali to the horn solos on the album's lighter moments like the tongue-in-cheek James Bond and the gloriously profane Dirty Sanchez.Iggy's collaborator Thomas is an acclaimed Texas-born trumpeter, oft-praised for the way he crosses genres like hip hop, soul and funk. Iggy says his love of jazz goes back to childhood and has influenced his own career, referencing Little Doll from The Stooges' debut album - which, he claims, was an attempt to ""rewrite"" The Creator Has A Master Plan by free jazz legend Pharoah Sanders and singer Leon Thomas.""When I was a little boy, my dad would have a Charlie Burnett record on,"" says Iggy. ""Even Dave Brubeck, when you're 16 years-old and you hear Take Five, that's pretty cool, you know, so I always liked it.""Iggy's meditations on mortality come through on tracks like the album's closing piece The Dawn and the spoken word Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night, a reading of Dylan Thomas's 1951 poem.We Are The People was written by Iggy's friend, the late Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed.The Thomas reading was initially recorded for a British ad firm, but Iggy felt it would fit well into the new record's themes while the latter was only published for the first time last year.We are the people without land / We are the people without tradition...We are the people without sorrow who have moved beyond national pride and indifference to a parody of instinct / We are the people who are desperate beyond emotion because it defies thought / We are the people who conceive our destruction and carry it out lawfully""That totally resonated with me,"" says Iggy. ""Like, 'wham', like 'pow'. It was the first poem in a book of lyrics and when I saw it, I thought, 'My God, this is the country today as I understand it, or at least one legitimate portrayal of the country today. It really spoke to me.""With his slender frame, all-year round golden Miami tan and shoulder length blonde locks, at the age of 72, Pop is one of music's great survivors.It is against the odds following a life of excess, at least before he discovered the benefits of clean living. Many friends and all of his original bandmates have passed away and this year marks 50 years since the release of The Stooges' debut album.Loathed by critics and music fans alike, in the ensuing decades it's been re-evaluated as a milestone in American music, a precursor to punk rock and one of the most influential records of all time.""Once you get into showbusiness, you require minions, so they all have their own ideas about what to do to mark this splendid event,"" says Iggy. ""I had a very talented and powerful minion who wanted to rent Madison Square Garden and get a bunch of bands who'd been influenced by me and hold a big party.""I didn't want to do that because I haven't been at it 50 years alone. It's a more delicate thing. Other people will mention it, and it's true, I was the vocalist and lyricist and wrote some of the music on that album.""Instead, Iggy has put his name to a new book of lyrics spanning his six decades in music. Delving through old photos and being asked to come up with memories for each of those decades put him in a reflective mood, which undoubtedly informed the new album.""There I am looking at pictures of my whole history,"" he explains. ""They're asking me to write one set of notes for each decade and suddenly you're thinking in those terms. A lot of your colleagues and contemporaries have passed away. So there's that. And then there's constant responsibility to do what I can to resemble oneself as one gets older.The earlier decades, he chuckles, ""were easier"".""And then when you get to the 80s, it made me really grumpy. And by the time you get to the 2000s, it was somewhere between ironic and, 'Oh, [bleep] off'. I think I said something like, 'I crawled out of the dark hole of misery into the limelight of love and acceptance'."""
entertainment	K-pop group BTS to take 'extended' break from performing		"K-pop superstars BTS have announced that they will be taking an ""extended"" break from performing following a concert in Seoul on Sunday.Their agency Big Hit Entertainment said the seven members would be undergoing a ""period of rest and relaxation"".It added that the break would ""provide them with a chance to enjoy the ordinary lives of young people in their 20s, albeit briefly"".This is the first time BTS will have taken time off since their 2013 debut.It is not clear how long the break will last but they are scheduled to perform in Saudi Arabia in October as part of their world tour ""Love Yourself: Speak Yourself"".It's possible their break is necessary because South Korean males still have to complete two years of compulsory military service between the ages of 18 and 28.All of the BTS band members fit this age bracket.Exemptions are occasionally granted - Tottenham forward Son Heung-min avoided military service for South Korea last year after helping his country beat Japan 2-1 in the Asian Games football final.A gold medal at the event, along with an Olympic podium finish, is the only automatic way for a South Korean footballer to be excused a call-up.BTS is one of the world's biggest boy bands, and boasts a huge and devoted fanbase.Comprised of members RM, Jungkook, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin and V - the band became the first Korean act to top the UK charts earlier this year. Then in June, they became the first South Korean group to headline Wembley Stadium.Known for their meticulously choreographed dance style and boyish good looks, they were the first K-pop group to reach number one on the US album charts.On Twitter, many BTS fans - who call themselves ARMY - said the boys deserved the hard-earned break.The band has been performing since 2013. In 2017, their album Love Yourself: Her was the first K-Pop album to crack the top 10 US album charts, rising to number seven.It also hit the number one spot on iTunes in more than 70 countries.K-pop was conceived in South Korea in the 1990s as a Western-Asian hybrid and is now a multi-million dollar industry with many bands winning audiences around the globe."
entertainment	Clive James obituary: 'A man of substance'	Terminus	"Broadcaster, critic, poet, TV presenter and prolific author - Clive James cheerfully criss-crossed the boundaries between high and lowbrow.He was as much at home hosting a Shakespeare documentary as he was at fronting a programme showing people suffering indignities on Japanese TV.His sardonic tones graced a host of TV documentaries in which he brought his own acute observations to bear on a wide variety of subjects.A journalist on The Sydney Morning Herald once wrote: ""His gift and lasting contribution has been to recognise that mass appeal does not translate into lack of substance.""He was born Vivian James in Kogarah, south of Sydney, on 7 Oct 1939. He was later allowed to change his name when, according to his autobiography, Vivien Leigh's appearance in Gone With the Wind meant the name would forever be seen as female, no matter what the spelling.His father was captured by the Japanese during World War Two and forced to work as a slave labourer. He managed to survive internment but was killed when the plane returning him to Australia crashed in Taiwan.The young James studied psychology at the University of Sydney, where he also edited the student magazine and directed a number of revues. After graduating, he went to work as a journalist on the Sydney Morning Herald.In 1961 he set off for England, where for three years he led what he described as a ""would-be bohemian existence"" in London, working at a variety of jobs before gaining a place at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where Germaine Greer was among his contemporaries.He later confessed that he read very little of the course material, but did busy himself by writing for various periodicals, including The Listener and the Cambridge Review. He became president of the Cambridge Footlights, and represented Pembroke on University Challenge.In 1972 he was commissioned by the Times Literary Supplement to write an appreciation of the noted writer and critic Edmund Wilson. His piece, published without a byline as was traditional at the TLS at the time, triggered a wave of speculation as to who had actually written it, and cemented James's reputation.He began a 10-year spell as a TV critic on The Observer, delivering a column that his fellow critic, Mark Lawson, once described as so funny it was dangerous to read while holding a hot drink.His strength was to write about the most banal television programmes in a high literary style, and he would often mix a critique of a serious documentary with comments on something more downmarket. His style would be widely copied by subsequent columnists.His job as a TV critic led to him being asked to make guest appearances on various programmes. One notable episode was on the Granada pop music programme So It Goes, when he found himself trying to keep a new band, The Sex Pistols, under control.""One had grown used to pop performers dressing up in silly clothes and pretending to be horrible,"" he wrote in his column. ""But here were performers dressing up in silly clothes who really were horrible.""In 1982, ITV hired him to front a new show called Clive James on Television, which showed a series of amusing and offbeat TV clips from around the world.Excerpts from the Japanese programme, Endurance, became a regular feature. Contestants had to withstand unpleasant experiences such as being lowered into a tank full of insects, or being buried up to their necks in sand.James denied suggestions that he was being racist for highlighting a Japanese programme, explaining that he felt it was better that, if people were going to torment each other, they did it within the confines of a game show.He also fronted a travel programme, which transferred to the BBC in 1989 under the title Clive James's Postcard From.In 1993 the BBC broadcast his eight-part documentary series, Fame In The Twentieth Century, which used archive material to explore the nature of fame through each of the previous eight decades. The programme was also aired by ABC in Australia and PBS in the US.He was a regular voice on BBC Radio 4, and in 2008 he performed two one-man shows at the Edinburgh Comedy Festival.He also worked with songwriter and producer Pete Atkin on six musical albums during the 1970s, which were re-released on CD 20 years later, when the pair made a number of live performances.His television work did not distract him from writing. As well as publishing collections of poetry, he wrote four novels and five volumes of autobiography - the first of which, Unreliable Memoirs, was reprinted more than 60 times. He also published collections of his numerous essays and newspaper articles.In 1997 he penned a poignant piece for the New Yorker titled I Wish I'd Never Met Her, describing his reactions to the death of his friend, Diana, Princess of Wales.He made a number of appearances on the BBC's Question Time and also appeared alongside Paul Merton on the satirical quiz Have I Got News For You.A lifetime of smoking and drinking culminated in a diagnosis of emphysema and kidney failure in 2010, and a year later he announced he had leukaemia.In a 2012 interview, he told BBC radio he was ""near the end"", saying: ""I don't want to cast a gloom, an air of doom, over the programme but I'm a man who is approaching his terminus.""Three years later, in an interview with the Guardian, he spoke of his ""embarrassment"" at still being alive, saying a new drug had kept the end at bay.This February, he had a long and ultimately unsuccessful operation to remove a cancer on his cheek, which left him frail and almost blind.An atheist by conviction, James famously described religion as ""an advertising agency for a product that does not exist.""He was sanguine about his own end, maintaining a short biography on his website, which he hoped would be used as the basis for any appreciation of his life that might be written.Journalists writing an obituary should ""keep in mind that shorter is better, and that a single line is best"", it said.His life was much too full to fulfil that final wish."
entertainment	YouTube users can't stop streaming Latin Pop		"There is no better measure of the world's listening tastes than YouTube.The site reaches more than 1.9 billion people every month, more than any other music steaming service, and most of those users are listening to Latin Pop.Spanish-language songs make up half of YouTube's Top 10 for the year so far, led by Daddy Yankee's Con Calma, with 1.15 billion views.Ariana Grande's 7 Rings is the only entry sung entirely in English, with K-pop and Bollywood completing the chart.Catalonian singer Rosalía, who came fifth in the BBC's Sound of 2019 list, had the highest-viewed video by a female artist, with Con Altura - a reggaeton track that samples dialogue from a Dominican TV show.The song topped YouTube's music chart for 12 weeks after its release in March, at one point presiding over a top 10 that was 80% Spanish.""This is the new order of things in the increasingly diverse, genre-melding, multilingual world of pop,"" wrote New York Times' pop correspondent Joe Coscarelli in an article dissecting Rosalía's breakout single.""Language is no longer a barrier, world rhythms mix and cohere, cross-cultural collaboration is common and hip-hop influence seeps in from all sides.""South Korea is also an increasingly dominant voice in global pop, with girl group Blackpink racking up 468m views for the arresting, colourful video for Kill This Love [the title is the only English line in the song].Their boyband counterpart, BTS, have the eighth most-watched video of the year for their track Boy With Luv.Hindi singer Dhvani Bhanushali has also scored a major hit with the sweetly-sung Vaaste Song - which was the first Indian track to rack up 50 million views in seven days.The 21-year-old singer is signed to T-Series, India's biggest record label, which also runs the world's second-largest YouTube channel.""We definitely see that musicians from places outside the US are really writing the handbook on YouTube,"" the site's global head of music, Lyor Cohen, told the BBC. ""I like to say they have a PhD in YouTube.""These artists not only have the sound that appeals to music lovers around the world, but they know how to make the platform work for them and maximize global reach. That's the beauty of YouTube - genres crossing borders and artists building fanbases, no matter where they are.""Spotify and YouTube are democratising music, added Sebastian Krys - a Grammy award-winner who has worked with Shakira, Luis Fonsi and Gloria Estefan.""Before, music was curated by the record industry gatekeepers, who were generally middle class, middle-aged white men. And now it's curated by the masses,"" the Argentine producer told the BBC last year.""There is more interest now in what other people and cultures are doing.""The highest-charting British artist on YouTube's chart is Sam Smith, whose duet with Normani, Dancing With A Stranger, is the eleventh most-watched music video of the year so far.Freshly-minted pop star Billie Eilish also made the top 20, with 351m views for her single Bad Guy, putting her in 12th place.Songs released before 2019 continue to record big numbers on YouTube, too, with Luis Fonsi's Despacito adding 456m views since January, pushing its all-time total to 6.3bn.The 2017 song is now the most-watched video on the site by a margin of more than 2bn.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Coldplay prove they're not fossils as they play Natural History Museum gig		"Coldplay may have put their touring plans on hold, but a select group of fans were treated to a one-off show among the fossils at London's Natural History Museum on Monday.It was a spectacular setting, with the museum's great hall bathed in pastel lights as the band played beneath Hope, a giant 128-year-old skeleton of a blue whale.""I said, when we launch our album can we play a gig near Wales, and look what happened,"" joked Chris Martin, as he took to the stage.""It's so hard, as a British person, not to come up with Natural History Museum puns for the whole show,"" he added. ""But the last artist who tried that was Dodo and you know what happened to her.""His jokes may have prompted groans but, when it came to the songs, Martin was drowned out by the 1,000-strong audience singing along to hits like Sky Full Of Stars and Viva La Vida.For the most part, though, the set concentrated on Coldplay's latest record, Everyday Life - a playful and probing double album that cautiously ventures away from their lighters-out pop template.They were joined on stage by Afrobeat scion Femi Kuti and his brass section for the limber and funky Arabesque, while Norah Shaqur added a beautiful Arabic verse to Church.And some moments that fall flat on the new record - notably the anti-firearm anthem Guns - gained a little bite on the stage, with Martin spitting invectives at gun rights activists as he thrashed his acoustic guitar.In some respects, Coldplay have always felt like a church worship band, with their earnest goofiness and hand-on-heart positivity. It's an instinct they embraced on Monday night, handing out badges declaring ""love"", while supporting musicians wore T-shirts emblazoned with the Bible verse ""Do everything in love"".They were even joined by a four-piece gospel choir, who embellished the harmonies (while politely declining to show up Martin's vocals) on tracks like BrokEn and Cry Cry Cry.Martin was so enraptured by their presence that he asked them to reprise the final chorus of Fix You a capella, ""so we can hear what our band would sound like if we had really good singers"".""Just imagine,"" he added. ""We'd be playing much bigger venues than this place.""It was a knowing nod to the band's more usual habitat, playing to tens of thousands of fans in open-air stadiums. It's a mode of touring they have decided they can no longer pursue in good conscience - citing the environmental impact of taking a full-production rock concert on the road for 18 months or more.""The hardest thing is the flying side of things,"" Martin told the BBC last week. ""But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single-use plastic, to have it largely solar powered. We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's not so much taking as giving?""In that respect, playing the Natural History Museum felt like a recalibration, with the band exploring whether their music could work in smaller venues, with a minimal production. Proceeds went to the non-profit organisation ClientEarth (regrettably, though, the beer cups on the night were all single-use plastic).Songs like Daddy and Sparks felt more intimate, while the big-tent anthems like Orphans lost none of their impact. And no-one missed the flashing wristbands or pyrotechnics of Coldplay's bigger shows.Well, no-one except the frontman.""Normally we have some fireworks at this point,"" he observed during Sky Full Of Stars. ""But they said this building was too precious.""After 23 years, Coldplay might be rock dinosaurs, but they're not fossils yet.See the set list below (Sky Full Of Stars was a last-minute addition to the encore, just before Guns).Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Carly Rae Jepsen: Pop's queen of over-thinking	Plot TwistTwo hundred songs'Crazy cat lady'	"Two years ago, Carly Rae Jepsen took a break from her pop star life and boarded a plane to Italy.The goal was to take a holiday by herself, away from the hustle of LA, free from managers and entourages and the constant ping of emails.It didn't go quite to plan.""I'm so used to travelling with a whole army of helpers and people around me that I forgot my credit cards,"" the Canadian singer says, giggling self-consciously.""And then I couldn't find the dude from the Airbnb I was staying at. His name was supposed to be Giorgio, and I went around looking for him. Some old man came up to me, who I thought was Giorgio, and he pinched my cheeks and said, 'Ciao, bella' and took off!""I was like, 'This is not a good start.' But it turned itself around pretty quickly.""Jepsen, who shot to fame in 2012 with the smash Call Me Maybe, had just broken off a relationship with photographer David Kalani Larkins. She embraced the freedom and self-reliance of travelling alone.""You have to get comfortable with bringing your book to dinner and that being your date,"" she says. ""You ruin the night if you start thinking everyone's looking at you because you're by yourself.""The trip went so well, in fact, that the star briefly contemplated staying put.One of her Instagrammed holiday snaps even came with the caption: ""She writes something like 50 tunes for her next album, takes a break in Italy and - plot twist - never comes back.""She writes something like 50 tunes for her next album, takes a break in Italy and- plot twist.... never comes back ✌🏻A post shared by Carly Rae Jepsen (@carlyraejepsen) on May 24, 2017 at 7:38am PDTEnd of Instagram post by carlyraejepsenJepsen's fans went bananas.""Please don't threaten me like this,"" wrote one. ""Don't you dare,"" fumed another.To her fans' relief, Jepsen came to her senses and resumed work on her fourth album, Dedicated - but they had a long wait ahead of them.Those 50 songs became 200 as the star abandoned her plan to write a record of ""strictly understated disco"" and started trying out new guises.Two hundred songs is only 13 fewer than The Beatles released in their entire career. And Jepsen claims to have recorded a similar amount for her previous album, E•MO•TION.""I was complaining about this to a journalist in LA,"" admits the star, ""Like, 'God I went insane. I can't believe I did this again.'""But this woman said, 'I think you should see it as a gift that you're so prolific and you don't get writer's block.' And she's right.""It doesn't mean the songs are always good - it just means that I always have ideas. And when you've got 100 songs, it's easier to hear criticism because you're almost grateful for it... Like, 'Good, we need to get rid of 99 of these.'""Jepsen's original concept of understated disco wasn't totally jettisoned, though.You can hear it on Dedicated's opening track, Julien, a simmering reflection on fleeting romance that Jepsen calls the ""heart"" of her album.""It felt different to what I'd done before, and also different to anything I'd heard, which you're always hoping to find,"" she says.Like a lot of the songs on Dedicated, Julien creeps up on you slowly until, one day, you find yourself singing it out loud in a crowded elevator.It's a new avenue for the star, who's still best known for Call Me Maybe - once named by Billboard as having the ""greatest chorus of the 21st Century"".That song rightfully spent four weeks at number one in the UK - but the album it appeared on, Kiss, was rushed and underwhelming, and Jepsen seemed destined to become a one-hit wonder.She defied that label - I Really Like You reached the top 10 three years later. The album E•MO•TION, made with indie producers like Dev Hynes and Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij, won Jepsen a dedicated fanbase and was critically acclaimed, but its other singles missed the charts.In a more cut-throat era, a singer who didn't churn out top 10 singles more consistently might find themselves on their record label's garbage pile.Now, streaming has created an environment where stars like Jepsen, Charli XCX, Marina and Christine and the Queens can thrive without diluting their sound for the mass market.""I love to be aligned with those ladies!"" beams Jepsen. ""It doesn't have to be this extreme, sell-your-soul-and-try-to-recover career. I think people are craving something less strictly defined than what pop used to be.""That said, Jepsen hasn't lost her knack for a gargantuan chorus.Now That I Found You is the album's most exuberant moment, inspired by her new boyfriend James Flannigan, a British songwriter who'd worked with Dua Lipa and Black Eyed Peas before meeting Jepsen at a writing camp in Nicaragua.But the video flips the lyrics on their head - with Jepsen offering her devotion to a rather confused-looking cat.She says her boyfriend is indirectly responsible.""He's very spontaneous in nature,"" she explains. ""One day someone posted that there was a stray cat on Facebook. An hour later the cat was living in my bed.""This was around the same time that I was recording the vocals for Now That I Found You, and it was stuck in my head: 'Waking up next to you every morning.'""""So I was singing at this cat every morning and giggling about the absurdity of it, sounding like I was dedicating an extreme love song to my cat.""Then we were talking about the video and I felt a little nauseous about the ideas that were coming in. It was all so stereotypical, like, 'It'll be a romantic scene on a beautiful mountain and you'll run towards each other in slow motion'.""I was like, 'Nyeh… what about cats?'""She adds: ""All my friends said I'd been rehearsing the part of a crazy cat lady for years, and it's time I just embrace it.""If the video goes viral, it won't be Jepsen's first time.Her songs have an uncanny knack for becoming memes (Run Away With Me played by a seal is peak internet), while fans rally around the star's social media posts, proclaiming her the ""queen"" of every minor detail - ""Queen of black nail polish"", ""Queen of large body of water in the distance"", ""Queen of no armpit hair"", and the inevitable but amazing ""Queen of maybe getting called"".""But if I'm the queen of anything,"" deadpans the star, ""I'm the queen of over-thinking.""The online love-fest culminated in a campaign to give Jepsen a sword. ""I like her and think she should have one,"" reasoned one of her fans.The prophecy was fulfilled when Jepsen was presented with an (inflatable) sabre live on stage at the Lollapalooza festival in 2018.""Oh yeah! A sword!"" she proclaimed, adding a few parries and thrusts to her performance before ""knighting"" her guitarist.""I was like, 'this is getting out of hand,'"" she laughs at the memory.""But I love things that are silly like that. I think that's part of the beauty of what we've been able to create - that people are happy to be celebratory and joyful around us.""There's a kindness to my fans. I don't know how we got so lucky. It blows my mind.""Carly Rae Jepsen's album Dedicated is out now on Interscope.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Glastonbury 2019: Pop divas Christine and the Queens and Janelle Monae dominate last day		"The Cure might have been headlining the Pyramid Stage, but Glastonbury's final day was all about envelope-pushing pop divas.Billie Eilish, Janelle Monae and Christine And The Queens played across the site, bringing with them messages of liberation, empowerment and acceptance.Monae, who headlined the West Holts stage, delivered a potent mix of sex and politics, encouraging the crowd to embrace their sexuality by declaring: ""Say it loud, I'm dirty and proud"".A field away, Christine and the Queens' Heloise Letissier was also preaching tolerance, pronouncing the Other Stage ""a safe space - because if there's no judgment, then anything can happen"".Both artists identify as queer or pansexual - and their placement at the top of the bill felt like an affirmation.""I have to say it's quite emotional for me to be here,"" said Letissier, ""because I didn't grow up used to winning. It feels like I'm winning something here and it scares me a little bit.""She revealed that as a child, unsure of how to fit in, she escaped into theatre, where she could dream her own universe into existence.""So now, if I want to sing for four minutes and I'm a man, then it's true because I believe it.""And that's exactly what I'm going to do,"" she said, launching into iT - a song about how she felt it necessary to adopt masculine characteristics to survive in the music industry.Monae also discussed her inability to fit in as a ""queer black woman growing up in America"".""I almost didn't make it here,"" she said. ""But something told me that we have to spread more love [because] the balance is off.""In darkness, you choose love.""Monae's set was full of colour and joy, the formerly buttoned-up performer shooting water guns into the audience and letting loose with big, goofy dance moves.During the delirious funk work-out QUEEN she even waggled her tongue like a latter-day Gene Simmons.Letissier's set was more theatrical, but no less sensual, as she tussled with dancers and ripped open her billowing red shirt.But it was her vulnerability as she performed The Walker alone, under a single spotlight that really left an impression.Earlier on the same stage, teenage newcomer Billie Eilish opened up with her hit single Bad Guy - a song that turns the tables on sexual politics - her every word reflected back by hordes of delirious fans.The 17-year-old had been bumped up the bill, having originally been booked for the John Peel Stage, before her career took off at the start of the year.""Damn, there's a lot of you,"" she declared, but Eilish was supremely comfortable playing to thousands - even lying flat on her back to sing When I Was Older.She was watched from the side of the stage by fashion designer Stella McCartney (who dressed the star in a jumpsuit themed around The Beatles' Yellow Submarine) and festival organiser Emily Eavis, who, on the basis of this performance, could be eyeing Eilish up as a future headliner.The one person who wasn't satisfied was Eilish herself. ""There've been a lot of technical issues, which is why I look angry,"" she told the audience before she played Bury A Friend. ""I've been angry the whole show. Thank you for not leaving. You could have.""The line-up of strong female performers on Glastonbury's closing day also included Kylie Minogue, Stefflon Don and Miley Cyrus.Cyrus gave a crowd-pleasing set spliced her own hits with a series of well-judged covers, including Dolly Parton's Jolene, Metallica's Nothing Else Matters, and Amy Winehouse's Back To Black - which she performed with Mark Ronson.She also brought out her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus, and rapper Lil Nas X to play the viral hit Old Town Road - one of the overall highlights of the festival.Immediately before her, Kylie drew the biggest crowd of the entire weekend for a joyous, emotional set of pure pop.But none of this is to denigrate The Cure, whose dreamy, transformative indie pop was the perfect antidote to a weekend of hedonism and heatwaves.They drew a massive crowd to the Pyramid Stage and played almost every hit you could ask for, from Pictures Of You, In Between Days and Just Like Heaven.But they really pulled out the stops on the thrilling seven-song encore.""It's difficult to translate what we do,"" frontman Robert Smith told the crowd as he walked out for the final part of the show, then he stopped himself.""Hang on… it isn't that difficult. The next half-hour is Glastonbury.""From there, they rattled through Lullaby, The Caterpillar, The Walk, Friday I'm In Love, Close To Me and Why Can't I Be You, before finishing on a euphoric Boys Don't Cry.""That was good fun,"" said Smith, looking visibly moved. ""Thank you… And see you again.""And with that, Glastonbury was over for 2019.The festival returns next year, when it will mark its 50th anniversary.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Lewis Capaldi: I don't think I'm a pop star	Puppies and spaghettiNot genetically modifiedStressful and boring	"For a man with the biggest sad song of the year, some of Lewis Capaldi's social media posts have been among the funniest.There was the time when the Scots singer-songwriter - who topped the charts for seven weeks with Someone You Loved - filmed himself walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in search of a plunger after having blocked his own hotel toilet.Then the one where he described his Brit Awards Critics' Choice nomination as, ahem, ""one for the Tinder"" profile.And who could forget the 22-year-old posting footage of himself singing opera in the shower in a pair of daft sunglasses, before declaring deadpan into the camera: ""I wish to be taken seriously as an artist.""Now, his forthcoming debut album, Divinely Uninspired to Hellish Extent, may have a similarly droll title, but don't be fooled. Contained within is an emotional rollercoaster of a pop record; piano-driven and packed with power ballads about breakups, heartache and insecurity.How then does one begin to reconcile Lewis, the perennial joker, with Capaldi, the serious chart-topping recording artist?""No-one is in one mood all the time, d'ya know what I mean?"" he says from the exec suite of his west London hotel (which incidentally is also experiencing plumbing issues today).""Sometimes I want to talk about plunging a toilet; other times I have thoughts and feelings.""It just so happens that writing songs about my emotions is much easier to do than writing about going to the toilet.""""One of them is much more listenable,"" he adds, with comic timing.Capaldi is talking to the BBC at the start of a day of press which will later include a magazine interview conducted while throwing axes.He's game for most things it seems, except that is being constantly labelled by the music press as ""the male Adele"" or ""the Scottish Ed Sheeran"" (""I'll stick with just Lewis,"" he says).When it comes to songwriting though, the light-hearted soul - as anyone who saw his Napolean Dynamite/Alan Partridge-inspired pole dancing stripper video for lead single, Grace, will testify - finds he's naturally drawn to the darkness.He's learning to embrace it though.""When you're happy you're thinking about puppies and spaghetti... just enjoying being happy.""You're not nit-picking at why you're happy so it's much more interesting to write about the stuff that makes you sad.""""That's quite bleak,"" he notes to himself, with a wry smile.""I think most people should try it because it's bloody great and it alleviates all this pressure.""You'll be a much happier person if you talk about what makes you sad.""In a pop music world of Instagram picture perfection and righteous Twitter indignation, Capaldi's regular public splurges offer fans a totally unfiltered account of his ordinary off-stage existence,That's how he hopes his music comes across too.""I don't think I'm a pop star necessarily,"" he declares, ""I don't think I have the poise or grace or air about me for that.""I'm a singer - I've definitely done that a lot!""People just like to know where their stuff is coming from in 2019, whether that's food or meat or vegetables - people want to know it's not genetically modified and they want to know that music is coming from someone that talks about going to bathroom as much I do.""Is there anything he wouldn't share with us all?""I had a haemorrhoid the other week and I took a picture of that I probably wouldn't put that on the internet, or any nude pics for that matter.""His ability to remain grounded and sing songs of such sweet sorrow with a straight face will be put to the test with a string of festival dates this summer and a sold out UK tour in November.Such was the demand for it that's he's already upgraded to an arena tour for 2020, where fans, who are fellow sufferers of anxiety, will be able to get support.The only complaint so far with his newly-packed schedule is not being able ""to play Playstation in my pants"" quite as much as he used to.The video for Someone You Loved helped Capaldi to finally meet a long lost famous family relative for the first time, in the form of Doctor Who/The Thick of It star and ""lovely guy"" Peter Capaldi.Well not quite, as the West Lothian singer corrects me: ""He wasn't long lost, I'd just never met him! It wasn't like [holds arms out] 'Peter, I've found you...'""But it's not everyday you can say you've got a genuine world class actor in your music video, especially when the only other serious music video we've done before have been me stripping.""The album sees him shift from his indie guitar pub singer roots, which were largely inspired by another famous Scottish singer of Italian heritage; Paolo Nutini, and Capaldi saves one of his favourite lines for last on final track, Headspace.I never thought a lie could sound so sweet / Until you opened your mouth and said you loved me.""[There are] little nuggets like that to make you as sad as humanly possible,"" he jokes.Another track, Forever, sees him channel the spirit of, well, spirits themselves, to excuse a late night phone call.Out of my mind / I don't remember calling / Had too much tonic wine / Sometimes it does the talking.Then there's Fade, ""a morose love song"" about ""the bittersweet feeling of realising that you've fallen in love,"" because ""now I've got so much more to lose"" he explains.While the BBC Sound of 2018 tip loves playing his songs live (""there's no greater compliment than someone paying money to see you""), the recording of the album itself sounds like it was an equally bittersweet experience.""There's nothing funny about recording an album,"" reveals Capaldi, as if to debunk another showbiz myth. ""It's stressful and boring - I'll tell you that.""Singing the same line 47 times, just to be told 'you know what, I think we're gonna go with the first take; there's just this raw emotion in it' - it drives me up the wall!""So we tried to do that as little as possible.""The interesting thing I found was, you start off loving the song and when you write it there's this excitement in you and then you start arranging it and adding instruments in and you're like 'oh this is incredible' and then you start recording it and you start to hate the song completely!""What was interesting for me was [adopts cod Transatlantic accent ] 'it's a bit of a journey.'""It's a process to get from this amazing feeling you had about the song. You go through rigmarole to get back to that initial feeling.""Capaldi appears to have come out of the emotional album ringer with his sense of humour fully intact.He says he'd never do a comedy show per se - a la Bafta-nominated rapper Big Narstie - because ""I'm only funny in 15 second bursts.""Before heading off to consider his next humorous post, he leaves us with some sound listening suggestions for when sadness next strikes.""I think being melancholic on a Sunday is underrated,"" he proclaims.""If it's raining outside, the light pitter-patter of rain on the window... Just enjoy it, put on some sad music - my album! - and ride it out.""You're gonna have a cracking time.""Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent is out on 17 May.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But what was truly remarkable was how unremarkable the line was.""I like women and men,"" the 25-year-old sang casually on Monopoly, a duet with her friend Victoria Monet.It was a throwaway comment, sandwiched between lyrics about songwriting royalties and her overwhelming workload (""I need a twin"") but it sparked a flurry of speculation about the star's private life.""Is she bi or nah?"" asked one fan on Instagram, to which Monet replied: ""She said what she said.""On Twitter, another fan commented, ""Ariana ain't gotta label herself,"" prompting the pop star to respond: ""I haven't before and still don't feel the need to now"".Grande isn't alone. After decades of closeted artists and coded lyrics, a new generation of gender and sexually-fluid pop stars are challenging stereotypes and celebrating their identity through music.A significant breakthrough came in 2012, when Frank Ocean posted an open letter to Tumblr, describing how he'd fallen for a man when he was 19.""It was my first love, it changed my life,"" he wrote. ""There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice.""Notably, Ocean chose to address his bisexuality at the start of his career (the letter was originally destined for the liner notes of his debut album, Channel Orange) and it did nothing to harm his sales or his reputation.""I think the landscape has changed dramatically for queer artists,"" Olly Alexander from Years & Years told the BBC last year.""In the past, we've all been familiar with pop stars coming out in the middle of their careers, or after they've become huge and that feels like a heavy narrative to queer people.""Now it seems to be really changing that artists can be out from the start of their career; and it's not some sort of sensationalised headline.""In the last few years, artists like Anne-Marie, Troye Sivan, Harry Styles, Christine and the Queens and Demi Lovato have all talked about same-sex attraction or bisexuality in their lyrics.Miley Cyrus has been particularly upfront, telling Paper Magazine: ""I'm down with any adult - anyone over the age of 18 who is down to love me.""And when Janelle Monae defined herself as pansexual in a Rolling Stone profile last year, searches for the term rose by 11,000% on the online dictionary Merriam-Webster.Pop songs are increasingly likely to feature same-sex pronouns and queer perspectives, while Monae earned a Grammy nomination for her song Pynk, a sex-positive celebration of female genitalia and self-love.Joe Nellist from the LGBT Foundation says musicians are simply reflecting their generation's attitude to sexual identity.""There's a growing number of young people aged between 16 and 25, that identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual. The figure currently stands at 4.2% [source: ONS], which is more than twice as high as the general population.""It indicates we're moving towards a society that's more tolerant and accepting, where people feel confident and comfortable and able to come out at a younger age.""Musicians have also been given the licence to express their sexuality by structural shifts in the music industry, says Rachel Brodsky, managing editor at Grammy.com.""In earlier days, popular artists were a little more fenced in, with executives no doubt prioritising what'll move records and make money,"" she explains.""Like, if you talk about a taboo subject on a record, you risk some giant music emporium like Best Buy or Walmart not stocking that record.""But the way music is consumed is totally different now, with streaming and the power of social media marketing. Nowadays, labels come after artists because of their authenticity, which usually translates to social media followers.""So we see artists having a more significant upper hand when it comes to their image and what they say in their lyrics.""It doesn't always go smoothly.Last year, Rita Ora was criticised for the chorus of her song Girls, in which she sang: ""Sometimes I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls/ Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls.""Some listeners were concerned the lyrics perpetuated a stereotype that women only hook up with other women when they're drunk or because it turns men on.Ora apologised, saying she would ""never intentionally cause harm to other LGBTQ+ people"", but the incident showed how the world had moved on since Katy Perry sang she kissed a girl and she liked it - as long as her boyfriend didn't mind it.The idea of bisexuality as a taboo is outdated and damaging, argued US star Halsey, whose songs depict relationships with both women and men.""That narrative is so damaging to bisexuality and its place in society,"" she said, quoting the line ""it felt so wrong, it felt so right"" from Perry's song.""That's something I've had to fight my whole life and something I still fight. I still see people on the internet saying, 'Of course Halsey says she's bisexual. It'll help her sell albums.'""That charge has also been levelled at Ariana Grande, whose apparent declaration of bisexuality was labelled ""queerbaiting"" by people who pointed out that all of her (public) relationships have been with men.But that's a problematic accusation itself - as though having a heterosexual relationship could somehow ""cancel out"" any same-sex attraction.The reality is that more and more people are refusing to define themselves by those binary sexual choices.When YouGov asked people to plot themselves on a ""sexuality scale"", more than a quarter of Britons chose something other than 100% heterosexual.Facebook, which is as reliable a social barometer as any, also offers users more than 70 gender options, including bi-gender, pangender, non-binary and two spirit (although gender, it should be noted, is separate to sexuality).Seeing these trends reflected in popular culture is hugely encouraging says Joe Nellist.""The impact it can have for young people who are coming to terms with their own sexuality is really powerful,"" he says.Even non-LGBT artists like Little Mix are ""becoming real allies to LGBT people,"" he says - noting how the band recently played Secret Love Song under a rainbow flag in Dubai, where gay sex is illegal.""It's a real positive move. It means that even non-LGBT artists are standing up for LGBT young people in particular.""Pop singer King Princess agrees it's crucial to have positive role models.""When I was a kid, I wanted somebody to look up to, whose music I was excited about, who was gay,"" she said in January.Instead, she ended up following androgynous, but predominantly straight, artists like Marc Bolan, David Bowie and Led Zeppelin.""There was this ambiguity from the people who were on stage, like, 'You don't have to be a boy, you don't have to be a girl, you can wear tight-ass pants.""I was just like, 'This seems like my lane. I like this type of showmanship. This is making me feel comfortable about my sexuality. These guys are totally gay.'""Now making music on her own terms, the singer is relaxed at being labelled a ""queer icon in the making"".""I'm down to take that on,"" she says. ""And it's not about my songs being gay. I hope my music's really thoughtful and strong and people just get with it. At the end of the day, that's really what this is about.""That's why Rachel Brodsky has reservations about acts like King Princess, Tegan and Sara and Troye Sivan being branded ""queer pop"".""Queer isn't a genre, it's a sexual preference,"" she says. ""And if we use the word 'queer' to describe someone's sound, we risk marginalising artists who, ideally, deserve to be integrated into the greater pop pool.""It's like using the term 'all-female band.' What does it matter what someone's gender or sexual preference is when it comes to music?""At the end of the day, everyone's an artist. Let's stick to describing sound as a form of classification instead of appearance and sexuality, shall we?""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Sofia Reyes: Meet Mexico's multilingual pop sensation	Monsters and insecurities	"""Trilingual empowerment anthem"" isn't the sort of phrase that gets bandied about at record label marketing meetings; but that's exactly what Sofia Reyes has on her hands with her new single, RIP.A vibrant, infectious slice of Latin pop, the song is a collaboration between the Mexican singer, Brazilian artist Anitta and Albanian-British pop star Rita Ora.Each flits between Spanish, English and Portuguese as they sing about shedding unwanted emotional baggage, before teaming up for the addictive ""bim-bari-bom-bom"" hook (so it's actually quadrilingual, if you count gibberish).Reyes' lyrical style evolved naturally from the way she speaks to her friends at home, where Spanish and English are largely interchangeable.""Growing up in Mexico, we have a lot of American culture,"" she explains.""So even though Spanish is my first language, at school English was very important, and we listened to English music all the time. So I wanted to sing in both,""The 23-year-old admits there's a commercial consideration, too.""I knew that, obviously, English is a language that more people around the world understand,"" she says.""My goal is to touch as many people as possible with my music, and I figured that English would open that door for me.""And it seems to be working: In just two weeks, RIP has racked up 30 million YouTube streams and been added to BBC Radio 1's ""best new pop"" playlist.""I wanted to make a happy song that made you want to dance, but with a deeper message,"" says Reyes of the track's exhortation to say ""RIP to the BS"".""We all have these monsters or insecurities that are holding us back; and I really believe that if you want to change the world, you have to start with yourself.""The singer has even been encouraging fans to write down lists of the personal demons they want to defeat.""I feel if you actually write it on paper, it's better. And if you burn it, it really helps.""Topping Reyes' own list are ""negative comments"" on social media, and the pressure of ""trying to fit in"" in her adopted home of LA.""But there's so many things, even celery or pimples,"" she laughs.""I've updated my list a couple of times, and I'm still going.""Born Úrsula Sofía Reyes Piñeyro, the singer has been immersed in music since her grandmother taught her to play piano at the age of six.She was encouraged by her father, an amateur musician who ""always had his little studio at home"" in Monterrey, and helped her record an album with her best friend when she was just 13.""We were called Café Au Lait and the songs were all beautiful ballads and pop songs - but we never put the album out,"" she recalls.""We sent it to a record label and they said, 'Oh no, you're too young. You need to know who you are as an artist'. And I remember we started crying.""Undeterred, Reyes took a role in the TV musical Mi Linda Anabella; and briefly joined the girl group TAO, before quitting to pursue a solo career.""I decided to move to LA as an independent artist when I was 17,"" she says.""I didn't realise it back then but, if I think about it, I was very little.""My parents were really brave. They didn't know anything about the music industry but they were like, 'OK, we'll be there for you and support you.'""The move was a certainly a gamble: Reyes didn't know anyone in the city except her managers, Charlie and Paloma, who'd come with her from Mexico.""It was tough in the beginning,"" she recalls. ""It's not like I came here to go to school, where you would make a new set of friends. It took me two to three years to feel like LA was home.""But on the bright side I was focusing on acting, dancing and recording sessions. Sessions, sessions, sessions.""At the same time, Reyes started posting cover versions to her YouTube channel, mixing Western hits like One Direction's What Makes You Beautiful with Spanish-language fare such as Reyli's torch song Qué Nos Pasó.""It was a challenge, because people were not used to listening to bilingual songs,"" says Reyes - but her voice and charisma soon captured the attention of bachata star Prince Royce, who signed her to Warner Music under his D'Léon Records imprint.A duet between the pair, Solo Yo, topped Billboard's Latin Pop Songs chart in 2016 (ending a five-year drought of women at number one); and Reyes swiftly became the biggest Mexican artist on Spotify, with 11.9m monthly listeners. Last year, she recorded the country's official World Cup anthem, Vamos por la Estrella.Having conquered the Latin market, she's got the rest of the world in her sights for 2019.RIP comes hot on the heels of the Jason Derulo collaboration 1,2,3 - and both highlight Reyes' multilingual approach to pop.""Honestly, it's harder for me to write in Spanish,"" she says. ""The words have an even deeper meaning for me - so anything could sound cheesy.""But I like the challenge of writing in Spanish and English. Going back and forth, I find it really exciting.""And in this case, with RIP, having Anitta from Brazil and Rita from the UK and me from Mexico, it just felt super-inspiring.""I feel like the world should be like that. We should always welcome all kinds of cultures. I think that's beautiful.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Young pop stars 'get crucified' by media says Portman director		"Young music stars can be ""crucified"" in the media as they burn out from the demands of their career, says the director of a new film about a troubled pop singer.Vox Lux, directed by Brady Corbet, stars Natalie Portman as Celeste, a global celebrity and icon on the verge of a breakdown.Rising British star Raffey Cassidy plays the young Celeste, who is ""discovered"" in 1999 after getting caught up in a high school shooting.Portman plays the older Celeste in scenes that show her mounting a comeback after a scandal that has derailed her career.Corbet, whose previous film, The Childhood of a Leader, starred Robert Pattinson, says Vox Lux is ""about the crossing point of fame and infamy and how they have increasingly become one and the same.""The 30-year-old, who started out as an actor in such films as Thunderbirds and Thirteen, believes the life of a music star is more ""extreme"" than one lived in the film industry.""As a musician, you have to be on the road 200 days of the year for the economics to make sense. It's hard once you are on the wheel to get off it.""When you get run into the ground, and you are going to get run into the ground, there's a lot of folk who seem to enjoy crucifying these often young people. They are suffering and people seem to think it's hilarious.""Stacy Martin, who plays Celeste's sister, cites Amy Winehouse and Britney Spears as examples of pop stars who have publicly gone off the rails.""There was such a high demand to know about them when they were famous [that] when it came to their downfall people also wanted to see it,"" she says. ""Their downfall was part of their fame.""The recent success of A Star Is Born and Bohemian Rhapsody has prompted renewed interest in Hollywood's portrayals of the music industry.Elton John biopic Rocketman, to be released later this month, will also chronicle the highs and the lows of life in the limelight.Speaking at last year's Venice Film Festival, Portman said the pressure is worse for music stars than it is for those in her position.""They have a different eco system around them,"" she told reporters. ""If you're in music you have effectively a work family, and that can become very corrupted. It's a mix of love and commerce.""Films are different. They're project-based, and you're not spending a year on a bus or a private plane [like] a very famous pop star.""Portman said Corbet's script is ""a perfect reflection of the society we're in. It shows the intersection of pop culture and violence and the spectacle we equate between the two.""The actress does not consider Vox Lux to be a ""message film"", but hopes it ""makes people feel things they've recognised and we're facing right now.""At one point in the film, the grown-up Celeste is asked to comment on a terrorist attack that bears a tenuous link to her on-stage performances.She is expected to give a slick sound-bite but finds herself out of her depth - a situation Corbet sees mirrored in real life.""What's crazy is the way the public and even some journos come down on something some poor young person said,"" he sighs. ""They misspoke, or they are not eloquent, or what they said was dumb.""Why do we expect so much of celebrities? They are not our political representatives. If you make music or films you don't ask to be asked those types of questions.""Recently everyone was debating Taylor Swift, and where she stands politically, and I thought it was so strange anyone would care. I find the whole cycle a little bit toxic.""Social media has increased potential pressure on artists, he goes on. ""If you are an artist who chooses not to have a social media presence, it starts to damage your career.""Young people and seasoned veterans are asked to take photos in the make-up chair and wink in a Boomerang - it's insane.""(Boomerang is an Instagram app that combines photos to make short videos that play backwards and forwards in a loop.)""It diminishes the allure of why we go to the movies or go to a pop concert,"" Corbett continues. ""Now we really understand the mechanics of it.""Though we see Celeste throw an epic pop-star tantrum in Vox Lux, Corbet insists the character was not based on a real-life famous person.""Celeste is an amalgamation, both real and fictitious,"" says the director, who enlisted Australian songwriter and producer Sia to write the music Portman's character performs.The film's score was written by the late Scott Walker, who also wrote the score for The Childhood of a Leader.""In the first half of the film I wanted to recognise Celeste's humanities,"" Corbet continues. ""Then they slowly erode so they become exaggerated and absurd.""I wrote that by the end, the character is wearing such large shoulder pads in her costume she can barely fit through the door.""His film, he concludes, ""starts off as a drama and turns into a comedy of excess"" about a woman who is ""as much a victim of her era as a leader of her era.""Vox Lux is in UK cinemas and on demand now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Grammys 2020: Billie Eilish, Lizzo and Ariana Grande lead nominations	Stepping up	"Two years after the head of the Grammys said women need to ""step up"" if they wanted to be recognised, female artists are dominating the 2020 nominations.Five of the eight album of the year nominees are women, Ariana Grande and Lana Del Rey among the front-runners.Meanwhile, Lizzo and Billie Eilish are shortlisted in all of the ceremony's ""big four"" categories: best new artist, best song, best record and best album.Only one artist, Christopher Cross, has won all four awards in a single year.Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi has also been recognised, with Someone You Loved picking up a nomination for song of the year; while English singer Yola picked up a surprise mention in the best new artist category.And Lil Nas X received multiple nominations for his country-rap crossover Old Town Road, which spent a record-breaking 19 weeks at number one in the US earlier this year.The nominees for the main categories are:Album of the yearSong of the yearRecord of the yearBest new artistBritish nominees include Ed Sheeran, whose No. 6 Collaborations Project is up for best pop album; Ella Mai, whose debut record is nominated for best R&B album; and violinist Nicola Bendetti, who is recognised for a new concerto, written especially for her by jazz musician Wynton Marsalis.The Chemical Brothers receive three nominations in the dance categories; while Thom Yorke and James Blake go up against each other for best alternative album.There are also posthumous nominations for The Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan, and murdered rap star Nipsey Hussle.Lizzo was understandably excited to cap off her breakthrough year with so many nominations.She tweeted: ""This has been an incredible year for music and I'm just so thankful to even be part of it. ""We are all winners.""Lil Nas X posted a simple but explosive: ""NO WAY"" (with an expletive in between those two words).The Grammys were mired in controversy in 2018, after only one woman, Alessia Cara, won an award during the televised ceremony.Asked to respond to the lack of female representation, Recording Academy president Neil Portnow said women needed ""to step up because I think they would be welcome.""I don't have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it's upon us - us as an industry - to make the welcome mat very obvious.""His comments sparked outrage, and this year's ceremony rang the changes, with Kacey Musgraves' space-age country album Golden Hour taking home the main prize, presented by a new female host, Alicia Keys.As she picked up the best new artist trophy, British star Dua Lipa drove home the point, saying: ""I guess this year we really stepped up.""To be clear, the 2020 nominees all earned their place on merit. There's no quota system in place. Instead, artists like Billie Eilish and electro-flamenco star Rosalía, have written some of the most forward-thinking, head-turning records of the last 12 months.The Recording Academy's new president, Deborah Dugan, commented on the phenomenon as she announced the shortlist for best pop solo performance in Los Angeles.""Wow, that's a lot of women,"" she quipped. ""Just sayin.'""We'll discover who wins when the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards take place on Sunday, 26 January 2020, hosted again by Alicia Keys.The event takes place a month earlier than normal, after the Oscars moved their ceremony forward, taking the Grammys traditional slot.That means the 2020 honours are based on a shortened, 11-month eligibility period.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Dua Lipa: 'Social media a breeding ground for hate'	'Encourage kindness'	"Pop star Dua Lipa says social media is a breeding ground for ""hate and anxiety"".Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she urged users to ""be nicer to one another"" online, for the greater good.The 24-year-old told host Louise Minchin: ""Some days I don't read into the comments.""Some days maybe I feel little bit more vulnerable and I dive in and I almost go looking for things I don't want to see.""Other popular young stars like Selena Gomez have recently expressed their concern about patterns of behaviour on social media, with the actress describing it as being ""terrible"" for her generation at this year's Cannes Film Festival.Last month, Dua - whose first name means ""love"" in her mother tongue, Albanian - called for better mental health care in the creative industries.Now she's admitted while it's still fun and useful for her to use ""amazing"" platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, she too has to log off as soon as faceless trolls make it a cause of anxiety.""Social media can be such an amazing tool and it can be so fun to share things but at the same time it's almost a breeding ground for hate and anxiety,"" she added.""People feel like they can say things because they're hiding behind a computer screen and for me it's important to use social media in bite sizes - as long as it makes me feel good, and the second it doesn't, I like to take some time away from it.""The One Kiss singer declared it should be everybody's mission online to ""to share positivity and encourage kindness"".""I feel like that's something we should all do, we should encourage kindness and protect our fans and protect ourselves - just be nicer to one another. I feel like we'd all have a much better experience on social media if that was the case.""You can't change everyone's mind on that and some people use it as a form of release, in whatever way that may be - sometimes at the expense of others. But it's baby steps. Hopefully we can try and make it a much safer experience for everyone.""The British-Kosovan singer, who has three Brit Awards under her belt, last week opened the MTV VMAs in Seville, Spain, by performing her latest track Don't Start Now complete with more than 40 dancers.It's the first taste of her forthcoming and ""different"" second album - out next year - which she says is ""still a pop record"", with disco elements in it, but is also deeply personal with a live feel.""It's quite different from the first record and this whole album has a lot more of a theme to it and I'm happy that this is the first introduction to it for everyone.""I guess it's about experiences,"" she went on.""It's really about finding happiness and being confident in that and not allowing anyone to take that away from you.""She also spoke to the BBC show about being ""a feminist in the truest form"", planning her downtime (watching Gogglebox and cooking dinner for her friends) and the first song she ever wrote aged six, which was sung in her first language and dedicated to her mum.""Still to this day, when we're at family get-togethers my parents love to remind me of that song and we all still sing it.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Taylor Swift's old label hits back in row over 'awards ban'	Why is there a feud?What about the AMAs and Netflix documentary?What have Borchetta and Braun said?Star supportStrictly business?	"Taylor Swift's former record label has rebuffed her claims it is blocking her from performing her own hits at the forthcoming American Music Awards.The singer said music executives Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta would not let her perform songs from her past albums, which they own the rights to.She said a Netflix documentary about her life had also been put in jeopardy.Borchetta and Braun's Big Machine Records said Swift's statement was ""based on false information"".Swift made the allegations in a statement posted to Twitter with the caption: ""Don't know what else to do.""""Right now my performance at the AMAs, the Netflix documentary and any other recorded events I am planning to play until November 2020 are a question mark,"" she wrote.But in response, the label denied telling the pop superstar she could not perform at the AMAs or trying to block the Netflix special, and said the ""narrative you have created does not exist"".In June, Swift revealed that the masters of her early music had been sold to Braun by her former record label, run by Borchetta, and alleged that she was not told about it.At the time the singer accused Braun, who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato, of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"".Swift also accused Braun of attempting to ""dismantle"" her ""musical legacy"". While he did not respond to her comments, he was supported by Lovato and Bieber, who claimed Swift was just out ""to get sympathy"".The singer confirmed in August that she planned to re-record music from her first six albums so she could own the rights to the new versions.Swift is set to be named Artist of the Decade at the AMAs later this month and said she had been planning to perform a medley of her hits.But in her statement on Thursday, she said the two men had blocked her from performing her old songs on television, claiming that this would be re-recording her music before she is allowed to next year.They also blocked the use of her older music or performance footage in the upcoming Netflix film, she claimed.Swift alleged that Borchetta told her team she would only be allowed to use the music if she agreed ""not to re-record copycat versions"" next year and stopped talking about the two men.""The message being sent to me is very clear. Basically, be a good little girl and shut up. Or you'll be punished,"" she wrote.She went on to ask her fans to help to pressure Braun and Borchetta into changing their minds and to appeal to the artists they manage for help. She also asked for help from the private equity firm The Carlyle Group, which she said financed the sale.Fans responded instantly, with the hashtags ""IStandWithTaylor"" and ""FreeTaylor"" trending on Twitter.In a statement, the Big Machine Label Group said it had been optimistic about resolving the long-running dispute - until Swift posted her statement on Thursday.""Despite our persistent efforts to find a private and mutually satisfactory solution, Taylor made a unilateral decision last night to enlist her fanbase in a calculated manner that greatly affects the safety of our employees and their families,"" the label said.""Taylor, the narrative you have created does not exist. All we ask is to have a direct and honest conversation. When that happens, you will see there is nothing but respect, kindness and support waiting for you on the other side.""Big Machine also said: ""At no point did we say Taylor could not perform on the AMAs or block her Netflix special. In fact, we do not have the right to keep her from performing live anywhere.""It did not specifically address whether she could perform old songs.In response, the singer's publicist Tree Paine insisted that Borchetta ""flatly denied the request for both American Music Awards and Netflix"". Both sides also claim the other owes them millions of dollars.Borchetta founded Big Machine in 2005, and the company was bought by Braun's Ithaca Holdings in June.Stars including Halsey, Gigi Hadid and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James have leapt to the singer's defence.Fellow pop singer Halsey said: ""These people are protected because they inspire complicity with fear.""Banking on the illusion that people will not stand up for her. That the world will say she is over-reacting, You're barking up the wrong tree.""It is her grace and patience in these moments that make her artist of the decade,"" she added.Supermodel Hadid tweeted: ""Scott and Scooter, you know what the right thing to do is.""While the overwhelming majority of comments on social media were in Swift's favour, some users accused the star of mobilising her fanbase to pressure the two executives and suggested fans should ""take a second to look deeper"" at the situation.After Braun bought most of the US pop star's life's work, thanks to his acquisition of her former record label Big Machine for $300m (£237m) in June, Tim Ingham from Music Business Worldwide told the BBC in July that these kind of contract arrangements were fairly common in the days before music streaming.""Unfortunately for Taylor Swift, she started recording at a time in the history of the industry when it was still heavily reliant on radio, where you needed a record company backing to get you on radio, particularly country radio in Nashville, where Big Machine was a huge player,"" said Ingham.""And also, you needed to rely on physical distribution to get your CDs into stores. So she needed a record company to invest the amount of money that they had to invest to get her career off the ground.""Mark Sutherland, editor of trade publication Music Week, agreed in July with Ingham that Braun's business decisions will most likely be driven by money.""A lot of those songs are going to be a small goldmine in the streaming environment as they are enduring pop hits that are going to be streamed from now until the next 20, 30, 40 years.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Pop music's growing gender gap revealed in the collaboration age	But female pop stars are doing well, aren't they?So what's going on?What does that mean for the women?Why is this happening?What people in the industry say'Women get moulded into something we don't want to be''Hip-hop is 95% male''The gatekeepers must change''Collaborations help reach new fans''An old-fashioned and biased industry'	"Three times as many male as female pop stars appeared on last year's biggest hit singles, BBC research has found.Ninety-one men or all-male groups were credited on the Official Chart Company's top 100 most popular songs of 2018 - compared with 30 female acts.And despite the success of singers like Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande, the gender gap has grown over the past decade.Thirteen of the most popular 100 songs of 2018 were credited only to female acts - down from 35 in 2008.Singer Mabel, who is currently in the top 10, said she wasn't surprised by the gender gap, telling BBC News: ""No, I think we still have a lot of work to do.""Rita Ora and Bebe Rexha's manager Sarah Stennett said: ""The gap that exists is not acceptable. I do not believe the consumer says, 'I want to listen to more men than women'. It's the choice they're given.""Yes and no.Dua Lipa, Kacey Musgraves, Cardi B and Lady Gaga took the limelight and many of the top prizes at the Grammy Awards last weekend.On Friday, Ariana Grande became the first female artist in UK singles chart history to replace herself at number one.And women like Dua, Anne-Marie and Jorja Smith dominate the nominations for the Brit Awards, which will be handed out on Wednesday.There are no fewer women in the UK charts now than there were a decade ago - in 2008, 30 female acts were credited on the best-selling 100 songs of the year. In 2018, the figure was still 30.But the number of men has risen by more than 50% as the number of collaborations has grown over that time - from 59 men in 2008 to 91 in 2018. Which means the gender gap has grown.It's become much more common for hit songs to be collaborations - Pop Star A ""featuring"" Pop Star B.That means the total number of artists credited on songs in the end-of-year top 100 list has risen over the past decade.You might have expected the number of men and women to have risen equally, but no. Only the number of male acts has risen.In 2008, stars like Alexandra Burke, Duffy and Katy Perry were among the 35 female acts to have hit singles on their own.Last year, that number was 13, including Dua, Ariana and Anne-Marie as well as Jess Glynne, Loren Allred and Rita Ora.At the same time, the number of songs credited to both a female and a male act has risen from 10 to 25.So songs by a man AND a woman have replaced many of those that were JUST credited to a single female act a decade ago.Meanwhile, men are also collaborating more with other men - hence the steep rise in the overall number of male acts appearing on the top 100 singles.But women are largely not collaborating with other women - or if they are, those songs aren't as popular. None of the top 100 songs of 2018 were collaborations just between female-only acts. But there's no change there - that was the same in 2008.There's always been a gender imbalance in pop music - just think about the genders of the biggest stars of the past 60 years.Part of the reason collaborations are now more common is because it's a good way for one act to get exposure with the fans of another - especially in the streaming age, when it's harder to break through. Often the other artist will be from a different genre.And these days, the charts are dominated by dance and rap - which are both overwhelmingly male - at the expense of traditional pop, singer-songwriters and girl groups.Dance music often has female vocalists, but the DJs/producers/hitmakers who they appear with - people like Calvin Harris, Marshmello, David Guetta, Zedd, Jax Jones - are almost always men.In rap, Cardi B may have broken the glass ceiling but she is still far outnumbered by the likes of Drake, Post Malone, Macklemore, Kendrick Lamar and French Montana.Singer Mabel, who had a hit last year with Fine Line (featuring Not3s) and is now in the charts on her own with Don't Call Me Up, says she is ""very aware of the fact there's a long way to go"".She explains: ""I think it's about encouraging young female artists, to give them the space to experiment. I think that's the issue.""As women, we get moulded in to something that we don't necessarily want to be, whereas as a boy I think you're encouraged to just sort of figure it out [and] do whatever you want to do. I think it's just about encouraging the younger generations to have fun with it.""Soul superstar John Legend said: ""That's surprising when you have people like Adele, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande - women who I think of as the biggest things in music right now.""But I guess if you count those DJs [eg Calvin Harris and DJ Khaled], it's a little different because the voices people are hearing are women, even though it's the DJ's record.""It's also probably a product of hip-hop being predominantly male, because hip-hop is such an important part of music, and 95% of popular hip-hop artists are men.""Sarah Stennett, who runs First Access Entertainment, says she isn't surprised by the figures, and thinks a lot of it is down to the ""gatekeepers"" - the people who decide what gets promoted on streaming platforms, on the radio and at festivals.They aren't sexist as individuals, but there is a ""systemic"" problem, she believes.""To underestimate the challenge that these women have to make music would be a disservice to them, because they walk into rooms to make records with men. Everything that happens in a boardroom - 'You're crazy, you're on your period' - happens in a creative space, too.""Collaborations are healthy, as long as it's an equal partnership and women aren't always relegated to being the featured artist, she adds.""If you try and redress the balance as an industry - because women are every bit as creative and brilliant - then it will be redressed, but it has to be a conscious effort by everybody.""""It's not really surprising that the number of artists has gone up, but it does seem counterintuitive that that should be so male-dominated,"" says Music Week magazine editor Mark Sutherland.""If you feature more people on your record, the idea is that fans of that person are more likely to play it and get into it and repeat play it, and it crosses you over to different audiences in a way that's quite hard to do in a more streaming-orientated business.""Generally, you don't want to pick an artist with a similar fanbase to yours because you're just reaching the same people, and a lot of featured artists are rappers, so maybe female pop artists are putting rappers on their records to reach a new audience, and vice versa. But maybe it's less prevalent the other way around.""Lara Baker, a music industry diversity consultant, says there has long been a gender imbalance in the charts and behind the scenes, but adds that the figures showing a growing gap are ""really worrying"".""I'd like to see streaming platforms, festivals and radio stations giving more attention to equal representation than they currently do,"" she says.""If you look at any of the major streaming playlists, or a radio station's playlist, or a festival line-up on any given day - chances are in many cases you'll find male artists taking up more slots than female artists.""They might argue that they're reflecting the market and what the consumer or listener wants, but are they? Or are they part of the problem that causes this imbalance? We all have our part to play in building a more equal music business.""She adds: ""There is no lack of appetite and lack of talent when it comes to women writing and making music, so clearly what we do have is an old-fashioned and biased industry which needs to work together to achieve better gender balance.""The BPI, which represents the UK's recorded music industry, said: ""Solo female credits may have been responsible for just 13 of the top 100, but, if you broaden the definition a little, female artists were the lead, or co-credited artists on a further 17 songs, while there were additional songs, including three Clean Bandit tracks and others, where women are featured.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	How Nina Nesbitt fought the pop machine and found herself		"The music industry can be brutally casual sometimes, as Scottish-Swedish songwriter Nina Nesbitt discovered.Championed by Ed Sheeran and signed by Island Records, her smart, straight-talking lyrics and catchy pop hooks earned her a top 20 album and a dedicated group of fans cringingly dubbed ""The Nesbians"".But two years after her debut album Peroxide, the singer found herself floundering, with little communication from her record label and an album that was ultimately shelved.In 2016, she took to Facebook to announce she'd quit.""For the past couple years I've felt a lot pressure to have a hit, to sound like other people, to keep it safe, become someone I'm not comfortable being,"" she wrote.""Being told to date the right person, be seen with the right crowd or do something to be in the tabloids is just really insulting.""Of course I'm ambitious, but I want to have success as ME, not someone I feel pressured into being.""Taking a step back from the limelight, she found success writing for acts like The Shires and Jessie Ware. But before long Cooking Vinyl, the label that's home to The Prodigy and Carl Barat, approached her about making a record of her own.Although the singer said yes, she took her time, wisely figuring that she needed a fresh approach and a new sound before reintroducing herself to the public.""I mean, nobody was really waiting for a Nina Nesbitt record, so I really had to work hard to be taken seriously again,"" she tells the BBC.Three years on and she's released her second album - The Sun Will Come Up, The Seasons Will Change - a pop-infused interrogation of her tumultuous 20s.""Nesbitt offers blunt songwriting in a genre that far too often deals in vague cliches,"" said the Independent's Roisin O'Connor in a four-star review.With the album entering the UK chart at number 21, the singer told the BBC about the stories behind the songs, and how streaming saved her career.Your album had a million streams in a single day and your face is on a billboard in Times Square. I assume you're having a good week?A great week. It's crazy. There's been a lot of streams but people actually going out and buying the vinyl, too, which is really cool.Streaming seems to have been a big part of your comeback.Yeah, it's mad. We're doing an Australian headline tour that's literally off the back of streaming. Radio stations out there are only just starting to pick the music up, so that's all down to streaming.Taylor Swift put one of your songs [The Best You Had] on her new music playlist. Did that boost your profile?Massively. That was so cool, because she was the reason I picked up a guitar when I was 15. It was so surreal and it really meant a lot as an indie artist. It's not like she was told to put it on her playlist because we're on the same label, do you know what I mean? She just genuinely liked the song.The album emerged from a pretty dark period in your life - does the success feel like a vindication?Yeah, definitely. When I started writing it three years ago, I'd just been dropped by a label and I thought my life was over.My career is my whole life, so if I'm not happy with that, it affects everything else. But something I learned is that everyone has a time and a place in the music industry, and it's not always the right time for you. This album almost feels like a debut all over again.What do you wish you'd known first time around?I've learned a lot about being in control of your career - and that being positive and believing in yourself goes a very long way. And creatively, the music needs to sound like it's come from you, not someone else who's choosing the songs for you.You've written a lot of material to get here. I noticed your publisher had registered 249 songs under your name.Oh wow, I didn't know that. That's a lot of songs.Some of the titles are great. There's one called Parking Ticket.Haha! That's one of the first songs I ever wrote. It was about a guy that had overstayed his welcome. He just kept hanging around, and I was like, ""Right, I'm giving you a parking ticket."" It's actually quite savage!Did you enjoy writing for other artists?It was so much fun but part of me still wanted to be singing the songs.You learn a lot about yourself through working with others, though. It gives you a clear idea about what's unique about you.Such as?I'd always come up with melodies in a really high falsetto and people would say, ""Oh, I can't sing this!"" So I thought, ""Ah, well I can sing high, so I should do that.""And I discovered that I was a storyteller, lyrically, when it didn't feel like many other people were, so I decided to focus on that.With that in mind, can I ask about a couple of the lyrics on the album?Sure, go ahead.""Hope you never let those pictures send/He'll only go show them to his friends"" - from Loyal To Me.Revenge porn is definitely a thing. I worry about teenagers on Snapchat. Kids at schools send round these intimate pictures, then people use them as revenge. You've got to be careful out there.""They edit my body so good/They'll never know I faked it"" - from Sacred.Well, there's this culture on Instagram where everyone uses filters and lighting, or people smooth their skin out. It's this weird thing. We all know it's not real and we all complain about it, yet we all do it.The issue is when people start comparing themselves to something that's not reality. A lot of mental health problems come from that - people feeling they're not good enough or they're ugly or whatever.""Am I the only number that you've tried? Or is it just another lonely night?"" - from Is It Really Me You're Missing.I think nowadays, especially in our generation, a lot of people like to keep their options open, so especially with online dating and Instagram, you never quite know if you're the only one. So I guess that song is a representation of that.That's a really vulnerable song in the midst of some sassy pop moments. Did you work hard to keep the album varied?Yes, it started off as a very intimate album, then I started listening back and I was like, ""Hmm, it's a little bit depressing… I need a few of those pop moments.""Part of me thought, ""Oh my God, I don't think people will take it seriously if I do the pop songs."" But eventually I was like, ""Do you know what? At the end of the day, I love pop music and I want people to laugh and dance and have a good time to the album as often as I make them cry.""I was impressed with your ballet skills in the video for Loyal To Me. Are you a trained dancer?No, I was a gymnast - but I absolutely love ballet, so I decided to give it a go! And it sparked this trend for my videos, where I pick something difficult to do and I just go for it. If the label are going to give me a budget, I want it to be an experience that I'll remember. So I did horse-riding in Is It Really Me and I went underwater in Colder. Now I'm planning the next one…Any clues?I've said no to bungee jumping and sky-diving. But the past few have been a bit cold, so I'd like to do the next one somewhere warm.How about waterskiing in Honolulu?That'd be cool. I don't know if I could lip-sync while waterskiing. I had to do that on horseback and it was a nightmare.Finally, I found a picture of you on Instagram throwing a TV into a swimming pool, so are you really just another rock and roll casualty?Clearly. I'm just trying to bring rock and roll back!today is a special day because we just hit 40,000,000 streams on ‘the best you had’. this song has been a catalyst of such amazing things so far and I can’t thank you all enough for supporting me. 💙A post shared by NN 🍃 (@ninanesbitt) on Oct 17, 2018 at 10:49am PDTEnd of Instagram post by ninanesbittNina Nesbitt's album, The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change, is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	J-Hope: BTS fans 'save' squirrels for K-pop star's birthday		"K-pop star J-Hope from BTS has had Scottish red squirrels adopted in his name by fans for his 25th birthday.The South Korean singer's British fans raised over £600 for the endangered species, while fans from around the world raised money for other charities.The BTS army, as the group's fans are called, responded to J-Hope's call for birthday donations instead of gifts.The singer reportedly donated £68,000 to ChildFund Korea for the upkeep of his former high school in Gwangju.The wildlife group Saving Scottish Red Squirrels was approached by a British university student who fundraised enough to adopt 37 red squirrels - a quarter of the total red squirrel adoptions the charity had last year.""J-Hope already knows about the red squirrel adoptions, he came across it in a Korean article,"" Lisa Ireland told the BBC.""J-Hope is often likened to a squirrel because he has cheeks that pop out when he eats,"" the 20-year-old said, after being inspired by other fans who had adopted a koala for BTS member RM for the same reason.""This is the first time there's been an adoption in the name of a celebrity and someone as big as J-Hope,"" said Rory Syme from the Scottish Wildlife Trust.Most people adopted one animal to mark weddings, birthdays and anniversaries, he said. ""It's fantastic that fans want to celebrate J-Hope, but also support things like the Scottish Wildlife Trust.""The endangered red squirrels are the UK's only native squirrel, and their continued survival has been threatened by a growing number of grey squirrels, originally from the US.Korean reports say at least 35 charitable projects by BTS fans have been started to honour J-Hope, whose real name is Jung Ho-seok."
entertainment	Yungblud: A mouthpiece for the underrated youth	Disney careerScruff of the neck	"In the middle of recording his new EP, Yungblud discovered an ability he didn't know he possessed.""I found this place in my voice where I can just scream,"" he says. ""I don't know how I do it, but it just comes from the core of me.""You can hear it on the chorus of his new single, Original Me, as the 22-year-old purges his feelings of self-loathing: ""Some days I wish I was anyone else"".The song is ""about embracing the parts you hate about yourself,"" he explains.""I have those days where I wake up and I've got a knot in my stomach and I look in the mirror and I hate what I see.""But you have to remember, your biggest superpower is to be completely, unconditionally, unapologetically yourself.""And if being unapologetically yourself is a superpower, then Yungblud is an alt-rock Iron Man: Resourceful, idealistic, borderline manic and very, very loud.We catch up with him first thing in the morning, as his tour bus makes the 436-mile journey between Kansas City and Minneapolis, where he's sold out the infamous First Avenue club, that was the focal point of Prince's Purple Rain movie.""I'm looking out the window, freaking out,"" he says. ""America is so big. Every state is like a different country, but it all looks the same. That's the craziest thing.""It's a long, long way from the working class town of Doncaster, where Yungblud was born Dominic Harrison in 1997.He was surrounded by music - his grandfather played with T Rex, while his dad owns a guitar shop - but as he grew up, he realised he didn't fit in.""Six or seven years ago, Donny was a lot more toxically masculine, a lot more industrial, a lot more baggy, and people just didn't understand where my head was at,"" he explains.""For example, I'd want to wear a skirt to school, or paint my nails or dye my hair. My mum would love it, but youth leaders or teachers would make me feel like I was doing something wrong.""It made me feel really small and misunderstood and like I didn't belong in the place where I was from.""He found kindred spirits on YouTube: Musicians like Lady Gaga, Marilyn Manson and the Arctic Monkeys, ""who didn't fit a mould, and built their own world"".""I looked at myself and said, 'I wanna do something like that,' so I moved down to London and started playing music.""As luck would have it, his dad's guitar shop was based in Soho, so Dom got a job there (he had to apply like anyone else) and began taking lessons from store manager, Shane Gilliver.""He'd just hang around, constantly playing guitar,"" remembers Shane. ""So I showed him a few things, gave him a few lessons and he just ran with it.""Very quickly, he was writing songs with the little that he knew. And the more he knew, the more he wrote.""Initially, Dominic was groomed for a career as a cookie cutter pop star. After scoring a role in the Disney TV series The Lodge, the singer spent ""a year fluttering my eyelashes trying to be a b-rate Shawn Mendes"" until his guitar tutor intervened.""He looked at me and said, 'Screw what's going on around you, you write what you want to write, and you sing what you want to sing,'"" recalls Dom.""I just believed in him,"" Shane explains. ""He's lived his life, hasn't he? So he understands the stuff he's writing about more than his record label or whoever.""And so Yungblud was born.Dom's teen idol tresses were traded for an unruly shock of jet-black hair, smudges of eyeliner and figure-hugging dresses (he says he's ""very fluid"" about his sexuality).Reflecting his ADHD, the music became a hyperactive mash-up of emo, rock, hip-hop and ska, while his lyrics became more direct, tackling subjects like sexual assault, corporate greed, depression and anxiety.""I just started talking about the stuff that my friends were talking about,"" reasons the singer, but his honesty and vulnerability were a beacon to like-minded fans.""His music has helped me out several times,"" says Kati Townsend, a 20-year-old nurse's assistant from Nashville, who's hoping to spend her next birthday watching Yungblud play live in his hometown.""I've had pretty severe depression, and just listening to him and knowing I'm not alone, and that other people feel how I feel - it just helps me to get through what I'm feeling and start to feel better.""""He's the voice of our generation,"" agrees Laura Raucci, who created a fan page for Yungblud's Italian fans. ""His song against harassment and sexual violence, Polygraph Eyes, changed my life and helped me get out of a bad time in my life.""For this reason I'm grateful to him. He has a heart of gold and he doesn't create barriers between his fans and him, only love and mutual respect. We are just like a family.""Yungblud's concerts are a communion, often opening with the announcement: ""We aren't alone, because we're all alone together"" before descending into total mayhem.""You're always moving, you're having fun constantly, it's incredible,"" says Kati. ""I've made a lot of friends through Dom.""It's to fans like Laura and Kati that Yungblud has dedicated his new EP, Underrated Youth.""If you look at my generation, the one common denominator is the drive, the passion and the fight for unity,"" he says. ""We are not bratty kids fighting for attention. We are intelligent and understand what we want.""He looks up to environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg and gun control advocate Emma Gonzalez as the leading lights of the youth movement; and he's convinced change is coming.The old guard has ""surrounded itself with so much unjustified hate,"" he says, but ""one day, we will be behind those desks, and we will be in those shoes and that genuinely gives me hope"".But it's not just the youth (underrated or otherwise) that have latched onto Yungblud's raucous agit-pop.A ""turning point"" came when he wrote 11 Minutes with his girlfriend, US singer Halsey, earlier this year, and Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker asked to play on the track.""I was literally like, 'What? I used to have a poster of you in my room - and I'd hide cigarettes behind it,'"" he laughs. ""This is just ridiculous.""A couple of months later, Imagine Dragons' frontman Dan Reynolds called asking to be ""part of what you're doing"" - and ended up going toe-to-toe with Yungblud on Original Me.""We were stood side-by-side, with two mics in the studio, just going completely off,"" the singer recalls. ""And I was looking at him going, 'I saw you at the Leeds Festival five years ago. What on earth is going on?' And that spurred the energy on that track.""But the most surprising moment on the EP is its closing track, Waiting For The Weekend, a sombre, reflective ballad about unrequited love, that was co-written with Shane Gilliver and recorded in a single take (in an LA studio ""with a mic that cost more than my rent,"" he observes).""It really means a lot to me, that song,"" says Yungblud, ""it's just a moment you can get completely lost in.""It's a tender moment that illustrates Yungblud's ambition and musical potential; hinting there's more to him than the ""bratty kid"" he's been portrayed as.""People are still trying to figure me out, so I wanted this EP to grab you by the scruff of the neck and say, 'come 'ere, listen to me,'"" he says.""I wanted people to be like, 'What is this? What is going on? What is he about to do?'""With me, I never want to be predictable. If people know what I'm going to do next, then I'm completely shafted.""Yungblud's Underrated Youth EP will be released on Friday, 18 October.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Miya Folick: The pop star who started a band on Tinder		"People go onto Tinder looking for lots of things - but a musical career isn't normally one of them.But that's exactly what LA songwriter Miya Folick did, tapping up the dating app to find herself a band. And it worked.""You can make a profile on TInder and have it say whatever you want,"" says the singer.""I realised that most people in LA were on Tinder and, of those people, many were probably musicians - so I just made a profile that said 'looking for a band' and put my Instagram handle on it. My bass player Brian reached out to me, and that was that.""That was three years ago, since when Folick and her band have roamed the paths of California folk-rock, spiky punk-pop and self-excavating electronic balladry.In fact, the songs on her debut album, Premonitions, often sound like they could have come from different albums, even different artists.Tying it all together are the 28-year-old's otherworldly vocals, which soar and dive like a jumper in a tumble dryer, only more tuneful.She phoned the BBC from her tour bus to talk about her unique sound; the accuracy of her Wikipedia page; and how one of her songs was inspired by Black Panther star Lupita Nyong'o.I'm interested in why Premonitions has so many moods and textures. Usually, a debut album sticks to one genre to establish the artist in the public's consciousness.I know what you're saying and that's definitely something I was fearful of at first. It's easier to have one sound that people can digest easily - like a calling card or a very specific aesthetic, but that's not what I was interested in making.I was obsessed with the idea of making an album like Bjork's Post which is really eclectic and creates a dynamic and interesting world.That's a high bench mark to set for yourself.Yeah! Just an obscure little album.With streaming, people are increasingly listening to individual tracks and playlists - so maybe diversity isn't the problem it used to be. Your album has something for everyone.Right. It's interesting because people allow for that diversity in certain genres of music but not in others. I'm from the indie world, where people expect you to have a very specific sound. But then I look at artists like Rihanna. Anti was not a homogenous album at all, but nobody bats an eyelid.Your lyrics often take seemingly insignificant moments - eating breakfast, or painting your nails - and use them to reveal deeper emotional truths. You could almost have a second career as an observational comedian.I love that because stand-up comedy is the most terrifying thing in the world to me! I think I'd be horrible at it, so I'm glad to be compared in any way to a comic.But my favourite artists are those who can make something very small and mundane feel really huge and significant. I think there's a lot of pop music about spectacles and partying and having a larger-than-life experience - but I'm more interested in the little things. Like the ""tiny happinesses"" I describe in What We've Made.That song is really romantic - but at other points you're very hard on yourself. On Premonitions, you ask people to challenge you on your ""bad behaviour"". Was that inspired by anything in particular?Um... Yes?! That song was about a specific relationship. I felt like I was taking advantage of somebody's kindness and I didn't like that.When you first listen to the song, you think, ""OK, she's being hard on herself"" but if you keep listening, it's also saying to the other person, ""You shouldn't let people walk all over you"".That's a classic end-of-relationship thing: ""I feel bad for stringing you along but, at the same time, haven't you noticed I've lost interest?""Yeah! It's kind of like, ""Before I go, you should know that you shouldn't let someone treat you like I have.""Deadbody is a very powerful and timely song about sexual abuse and the #MeToo movement. What prompted that lyric?I wrote that when all the Harvey Weinstein information was coming out. Specifically, I had read an article by Lupita Nyong'o, the actor, and there are lyrics in that song that are directly taken from her story. Not word for word - but the idea of pouring coke and vodka and telling her to drink it, and saying, ""Baby, be a nice girl and drink the drink I got you"".It's not something that's been tackled a lot in music, apart from maybe Lady Gaga's 'Til It Happens To You. Why do you think that is?I've heard a lot of revenge or ""screw you"" songs, and for good reason. But I wanted to make something that wasn't really about the other person. A song that makes you feel you're not alone - and less about saying, ""You suck"".And then I found music. I found it later in life… I think if I'd discovered it in high school, I would have wanted to do that, but I just didn't know.In Leave The Party, you have a lyric about ""reading Wikipedia until my eyelids fall down"". Can we take a moment to fact-check your Wikipedia page?OK, yeah!You were raised as a Buddhist and learned to play Taiko drums in church.Yup, that's true.You started your first band on Tinder.Well, I started the band I play with now on Tinder.You studied acting in New York and initially intended to go into the film industry.Yeah, so I went to NYU in New York and my intention was to be an actor. But it turned out that I didn't really like auditioning, which is pretty critical.Does that stage training come in handy when you play live?It definitely does. But I think it affects my lyric-writing more than my performance. Because we used to study the text, I'm always asking myself, ""What does this mean and why am I communicating it this way?"" It forces me to be a little harder on myself: If I can't say why I'm saying something, I won't say it.Premonitions is out now on Terrible Records.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Sir Paul McCartney to headline Glastonbury's 50th anniversary in 2020	'They'll never top this'	"One of the worst-kept secrets in pop has been confirmed: Sir Paul McCartney will headline Glastonbury in 2020.The former Beatle will top the bill on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday 27 June, a week after his 78th birthday.He last played the Somerset event in 2004, and organisers have long been keen to get him back for an encore.Next year will be Glastonbury's golden jubilee and co-organiser Emily Eavis said: ""There really was no-one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary.""Earlier on Monday, the star teased the announcement on Twitter - posting a picture of Philip Glass, Emma Stone and Chuck Berry.Emily Eavis subsequently confirmed the news, saying: ""Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid for the second time next year is an absolute dream come true.""In April, her father, festival founder Michael Eavis, admitted he had the star in his sights, but asked a BBC reporter not to ""make a big thing of it"".In September, Sir Paul told BBC Radio 2 the booking ""was starting to become [a] remote kind of possibility"".He told breakfast host Zoe Ball: ""My kids are saying, 'Dad, we've got to talk about Glastonbury', and I think I know what they mean.""We played there quite a long time ago so maybe it is time to go back. I don't know. I'd have to put a few things in place.""The rock legend's last appearance on the Pyramid Stage came after a day of heavy rain that left fans soaked to the skin.But his arrival was greeted with an almighty cheer, and he responded with a joyous, two-and-a-half hour greatest hits set - opening with Wings classic Jet and racing through 22 Beatles songs, including Helter Skelter, Back In The USSR and Yesterday.""Spare a thought for Michael Eavis. He could live to host a hundred more Glastos and he'd never top this,"" wrote the NME in its review.""And pity us poor punters, oblivious to the fact we are sinking in mud and soaked to the skin, because every gig we go to from now will fall short of this.""Incredibly, after playing more than 3,000 concerts, Glastonbury was the star's first ever festival set. He later recalled looking out over the the flags, banners and bedraggled fans and thinking it looked ""like the Battle of Agincourt"".He closed the show with The End, the final song on The Beatles' Abbey Road album. But it was the all-together-now chorus of Hey Jude that made a lasting impression, echoing around Worthy Farm until the early hours of Sunday morning.""Paul won the day for me,"" said Michael Eavis after the concert. ""He hugged and kissed me afterwards but I should have kissed him.""Sir Paul later told Clash magazine: ""It was a good night for us. It was a blast, and the audience seemed to love it. It was like, 'Yeah man! People have come together!' Very uplifting.""The star is the first headliner to be confirmed for Glastonbury 2020. Diana Ross will play the Sunday afternoon ""legends slot"", while other rumoured headliners include Taylor Swift, Kendrick Lamar, The 1975 and Foals.Fleetwood Mac, who have long been linked with the festival, also prompted speculation that they would be heading to Somerset next year when Mick Fleetwood told fans at Wembley Stadium they still ""had a big field to play"".But speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival last month, Emily Eavis ruled the band out after negotiations apparently stalled over money.""I can't afford them at the moment,"" Michael told fans in June.

entertainment	Rick Astley in Hollyoaks and 9 other pop star cameos		"He might not ever give you up, he might not ever let you down - but he's quite happy to make an appearance in a Channel 4 soap given the opportunity.Rick Astley will pop up in one of next week's episodes of Hollyoaks, the show's producers have confirmed.He's playing himself in the show rather than a fictional character or Dick Spatsley - the alter-ego he previously told BBC News he sometimes uses to check into hotels.His appearance will involve Kim Butterfield bumping into him at a bus stop.It was recently confirmed that actress Daisy Wood-Davis, who plays Kim, will leave the soap after four years in the role, but the details of her departing storyline are yet to be revealed.Could Rick have something to do with her exit? We'll find out soon.Whatever happens, Astley is far from the first pop star to make a cameo appearance in a TV show.Here are nine other great - and not so great - pop star appearances.1. Ed Sheeran in Game of ThronesIsn't it great when you're riding a horse through the woods and stumble upon Ed Sheeran singing a song to a group of soldiers by a campfire.Although when Arya Stark did precisely that in an episode of Game of Thrones last year, viewers and critics weren't quite as enthusiastic.The Independent described his cameo as ""painfully unsubtle"", Forbes said it was a ""mistake"", while CNN said it ""felt like the kind of stunt to which the series needn't resort"".""If nothing else, it was better than Galway Girl,"" said The Guardian, trying to find a positive.It wasn't Ed's first cameo appearance in a TV show - he previously appeared (and sang) in a 2015 episode of Home and Away.2. Cheryl in What to Expect When You're ExpectingCheryl's experience as a judge on a talent show certainly came in handy when she made a cameo appearance as... a judge on a talent show.The currently un-surnamed singer traded in The X Factor for the fictional Celebrity Dance Factor where she judged the performance of Cameron Diaz's character in 2012.3. Rihanna in Bring It On: All or NothingThe Bring It On series of films has brought us many stone cold cinematic classics - such as Bring It On: In It To Win It and Bring It On: Fight to the Finish.But it was 2006 masterpiece Bring It On: All or Nothing, starring Hayden Panettiere and Solange Knowles, that gave us a delightful cameo appearance from Rihanna.Four years before she turned to S&M, a younger and more innocent RiRi was in the film offering a prize to budding cheerleading squads.Her cameo saw her announcing that the winners of a high-school competition would win an appearance in her new music video.4. Boy George in The A-TeamBoy George appeared in a 1986 episode of The A-Team (nothing to do with Ed Sheeran) called Cowboy George.The convoluted plot involved the singer helping the A-Team escape a mob who are after them because they've been framed for killing a sheriff.Highlights of the episode include Boy George kicking down a door and Mr T dancing to Karma Chameleon.5. Ariana Grande in Scream QueensAs a rule, cameos are generally short.Ariana Grande's appearance in comedy-horror show Scream Queens certainly fell into this category, as she was cruelly killed off almost as soon as she had appeared.(Spoiler alert soz.)The singer appeared Side to Side with the likes of Lea Michele and Emma Roberts when she starred in the show's 2015 pilot episode.But her foray into acting was short-lived, as she was murdered by a scarily masked, knife-wielding devil.However, Ariana brilliantly came back to life just long enough to send out a tweet to her followers to let them know she was being murdered.6. Drake in Anchorman 2To be honest, we could do an entire feature on all the cameo appearances in Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.Kanye West, Will Smith, Harrison Ford, Sacha Baron Cohen, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey all crop up in the 2012 film.Many of them appear in the star-studded battle of the news crews at the end of the Will Ferrell movie.But Drake's guest appearance is actually right at the beginning, when his character... err... expresses his approval, shall we say, of Christina Applegate's figure.7. Tony Hadley in BenidormSomething old. Something new. Something borrowed. Something True.As ITV viewers found out in March, no wedding is complete without a former member of Spandau Ballet belting out a rendition of one of 1983's biggest hits.Tony Hadley made a guest appearance in Benidorm as the wedding singer at Joyce and Monty's big day, much to the delight of viewers.Once he had performed a heart-warming rendition of True, he treated guests to a bonus performance of Gold as he sped off on the back of a boat.8. Ian Brown and Jarvis Cocker in the Harry Potter filmsHidden deep inside the 19 hours and 40 minutes of Harry Potter films are cameo appearances from some of UK music's biggest music stars.Stone Roses frontman Ian Brown and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker both appear in the big-screen adaptations of JK Rowling's novels. (Sadly not together.)Brown is briefly seen stirring a cup of tea in The Prisoner of Azkaban, while Cocker portrayed Myron Wagtail, lead singer of The Weird Sisters, in The Goblet of Fire.9. Snoop Dogg in basically everythingIf there was an outstanding contribution to cameos award, Snoop Dogg would win it.He made a wonderful appearance as himself in 2015's Pitch Perfect 2 and has also cropped up in Bruno, Entourage, Bones and 2004's Starsky & Hutch.His undisputed peak, however, is surely still to come.The rapper has repeatedly said he'd love to appear in Coronation Street. He first mentioned it during a trip to Manchester in 2010.We will simply not rest until we've seen him ordering a pint in The Rovers Return.

entertainment	Katrina McHugh: Pop charts... as you've never seen them before	You may also be interested in:	"Take some of music's best known lyrics, combine them with a retro-inspired aesthetic, sprinkle in some humour and finally add a pinch of enigma.The results are the intriguing pieces of art by San Francisco-based graphic designer Katrina McHugh.The 37-year-old takes songs referencing nature from artists as diverse as Otis Redding and Snoop Dogg, and has illustrated them as infographics.""It's incredible how much nature is in music, when you're listening out for it,"" McHugh tells BBC News. ""I think people like tying an emotion or something non-physical to a real, physical property.""I love the idea of how nature is a constant and how, even after 500 years, people can still connect to the same idea.""McHugh came up with the idea of drawing diagrams to accompany song lyrics, when she took up the The 100 Day Project - which challenges people to create a piece of art every day for 100 days - and posted the results on Instagram.She says she's been surprised by the response she's had to her work. She expected the project to conclude after a small local exhibition. However, a book agent approached her and things snowballed.McHugh says she's had people get in touch with her from 40 different countries. ""I thought that the fact it's in English, and that they're quite like riddles would narrow the number of people who would be interested, but it's just been huge.""One of the original motivations for the project was to connect with people - both through music and nature - so it feels great that I've had such a response.""Perhaps this can be put down to some of her art's key ingredients: the familiarity of well-loved songs; the humour that peppers her work; as well as the sense of reward the viewer gets on working out the riddle of which song the diagram refers to.The Daily Telegraph's Alice Vincent says such illustrations have become increasingly popular over the past 15 years.""You know how a song makes you feel, and you may know all the lyrics to a song,"" Vincent says, ""but what she's doing is fulfilling a need people find difficult to do themselves - which is visualising music. And she's done it in a very clean and beautiful way.""McHugh's art picks up on the current trends for utilitarian design and for the use of educational material, which has an innate whimsy about it,"" adds Vincent.""She's not the first to do it, but I can totally see why this would appeal. It's very charming.""McHugh says the pieces that seem to have resonated the most are the more emotionally poignant.""Strange Fruit, by Billie Holliday - there's definitely no humour in that one. And Chasing Waterfalls by TLC is popular. Everyone knows it but when you listen to it, it's actually quite a sad song.""She's Like The Wind is another favourite. ""A few weeks ago I heard from Stacy Widelitz, who composed the Dirty Dancing film score, and who wrote the song with Patrick Swayze. He told me he thought my art was amazing and said he thought Patrick (Swayze) would think it a fitting tribute. That was such a great moment.""When deciding the theme for her 100 days, McHugh says she looked through old notebooks for inspiration: ""I looked at what I'd been doodling and they were full of flowers; and my camera was filled with lots of photos of nature.""I thought about the most inspiring moments of my day and they always seem to come when I'm listening to music - so I decided to focus on creating a visual exploration of natural metaphors in songs.""McHugh's work takes on a distinct style, reminiscent of old science textbooks or journals. Think Venn diagrams, graphs with cryptically-labelled axes, and detailed drawings in greyscale.""Around the same time, I inherited my grandfather's encyclopaedias,"" she explains. ""Looking at the imagery in there, they were all of a specific style from the 1950s, which I really loved and have tried to emulate in my work.""When I designed each piece I took cues from the songs themselves. Some of them came out feeling really poetic, but then others were just silly. (Justin Timberlake's) Rock Your Body is definitely done in a humorous way, but each one was individual and happened in its own way.""""The one I'm most proud of is Strange Fruit. It has a slightly different subject matter."" (The song is about the historical lynching of black people in the southern states of the US).""It felt like I was sharing ideas and felt like I was sharing a bit of myself - particularly with people in my network who are slightly more conservative.""On a more light-hearted note - Tom Petty's Wildflowers is very simple, but is one of my favourites and is one of the ones on my own wall.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Dear Evan Hansen: The musical tackling 'the agonies of youth'	'Everyone is struggling'	"The creators of Broadway hit Dear Evan Hansen tell BBC News why depression, loneliness and ""grief tourism"" are suitable subjects for a West End musical.For something which is often well-intentioned, ""grief tourism"" is a particularly crude term.It was first assigned to those who attend memorial services or visit home towns of people who have died, despite having no personal connection to the deceased.In the age of social media, however, its meaning has expanded.Nowadays, with celebrities in particular, many of us post online tributes when someone dies, expressing sorrow as if the famous figure was a close friend or family member.Often, if a member of the public feels they've grown up with a particular pop star or broadcaster, the personal connection may well feel very real indeed.Dear Evan Hansen, a Tony-winning musical that has just opened in London's West End, takes this idea to its extreme.The show's title character struggles to fit in and make friends at school. So when a classmate, Connor Murphy, takes his own life, Evan pretends the pair had a close friendship.One lie spirals into another, as memorial fundraising campaigns are set up and Hansen becomes popular at school for the false memories he shares of his time with Connor.""One of the things we wanted to get at was just touching on that phenomenon and presenting it, but also trying to poke at it and drill down on it and say 'what is it that makes each of us susceptible to doing that?'"" asks Justin Paul, who wrote the show's music and lyrics with Benj Pasek.""'Why is grief tourism a thing? Why has it become a thing?'""Lead actor Sam Tutty, who is making his West End debut in the show, admits it's a familiar concept to most of us.""Ninety percent of the time, I can identify with grief tourism,"" he says. ""I've been in situations where people have been like 'Oh, it's so sad', even for celebrities. And it's like 'come on', but I'm totally guilty of it as well.""I think that whole message is kind of unspoken and taboo. It is a really interesting topic and I'm pleased it's so prevalent within the piece.""The show's West End debut has received warm reviews from The Times, The Stage and The Telegraph, all of whom awarded it four stars.""It captures the agonies of youth, allows the songs to grow out of the action and boasts a great role, here memorably taken by Sam Tutty, for its lead actor,"" wrote Michael Billington in The Guardian.In his four-star review, however, Billington suggests the optimistic ending is arguably unrealistic.""If I didn't totally surrender to the show, it is because it lacks the courage to admit that high anxiety is not so easily cured,"" he writes.Paul Taylor of The Independent awarded the show five stars but made a similar point, questioning ""the redemptive lack of recrimination in the uplift of the close"".Writing in the Evening Standard, meanwhile, critic Nick Curtis said the ""sympathy the show demands for Evan... feels a stretch"".While the tendency towards happy endings in West End shows is understandable, book writer Steven Levenson says his priority was simply to get people thinking about their own conduct after death.""I think we just hope that it allows people to ask questions about their own behaviour online, and how we all kind of present a certain version of ourselves to the public versus who we really are,"" he says.""I think [grief tourism] is one of the fascinating and troubling things about the internet.""The show raises a range of other issues too, including depression and social anxiety. The themes are unusually dark for what is an otherwise fairly traditional musical.For Pasek, the show takes on a new meaning with its London transfer. ""In the UK in particular, a lot of British audiences and folks that I know that are from here have talked about the stiff upper lip in this culture.""Dear Evan Hansen, he explains, is about ""beginning to really dismantle the stiff upper lip and the idea of emotional accessibility and talking about things that are difficult to talk about, the taboo subjects.""[It's about] talking about therapy, depression, loneliness and not just presenting a version of ourselves that we're okay and we're Teflon, we're invincible.""Everyone is struggling with something, and if we can present and show the vulnerable parts of ourselves, we realise that so many other people are going through similar things, and that we're loveable, even if we feel like we're broken.""The Broadway production saw Pitch Perfect star Ben Platt receive rave reviews in the leading role. Tutty looks set to follow suit, with the Evening Standard describing his performance as ""startlingly raw and convincing"".The standing ovation at the show's opening night on Tuesday suggests it will go down as well in London as it has on Broadway - even if, as director Michael Greif acknowledges, one or two tweaks had to be made to the script.""There are certain issues that don't mean as much to a British company,"" he explains. ""What senior year means to a bunch of 17-year-olds in America is slightly different I think.""The notion of one family offering tuition to another family also needed a bit of translation. We changed a couple of references, there were a few little tweaks, but the issues are the issues.""They really are universal, and it translated beautifully.""Dear Evan Hansen continues at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	K-pop and Latin: Why the time is now for foreign language hits		"At a time of Brexit and divisive world politics, something has happened with the UK chart.While other European countries and America have traditionally been more open to music in languages other than their own, the British charts have been fairly resistant to anything not in English.Until now.Following the 2017 global success of Despacito there seems to have been - with a little help from Justin Bieber - a sea change.Since then Little Mix, Cardi B and DJ Snake are just some of the acts to have charted with music either partially, or entirely, in Spanish.And it's not only Latin stars, but K-pop artists who are jumping in on the act too - with boyband BTS sweeping awards shows, achieving two number one albums on the US Billboard chart, and selling out London's O2 last month.Since then Dua Lipa has collaborated with South Korean supergroup Blackpink, and the Black Eyed Peas have joined forces with K-pop's self-proclaimed ""baddest female"", CL.So why have the British begun to embrace music in foreign languages?""Looking back through history, we generally only see foreign language songs as being one-off novelties like Las Ketchup,"" says James Masterton, author of the website Chart Watch UK.""Nothing really ever started a trend. Yes, Julio Iglesias and La Bamba topped the charts with Spanish language hits but they were always one-offs.""Nena's 1984 hit, 99 Red Balloons, was a hit in the US in German - but had to be translated into English before it was released in the UK: ""Almost as if Britain was considered too insular for it to be a hit in a foreign language,"" remarks Masterton.So what's behind the shift?Sebastian Krys - a five-time Grammy award-winning record producer, who has worked with the likes of Shakira, Luis Fonsi, Gloria Estefan and Ricky Martin - says technology has a large role to play.""I think Spotify and YouTube have a lot to do with what's going on. Before, music was curated by the record industry gatekeepers, who were generally middle class, middle-aged white men. And now it's curated by the masses,"" says the Argentine, now based in LA.Masterton agrees: ""Artists aren't restricted to releasing things to certain territories at certain times. As consumers there is no barrier to consumption.""This one-size-fits-all policy on release dates means we are seeing music released in one language - rather than localised versions for different markets.""But we're still seeing that, generally, to have an international success you have to have some English,"" he adds.Krys says cultural migration has also had an impact: ""You have about 15 million Spanish-speaking people in [the USA]. Everything about the culture starts shifting: it starts with food and then TV and other mediums.""We now have a Latin actress as the highest paid on US TV,"" he says of the Colombian Modern Family star, Sofia Vergara.""It permeates into the culture of what people think they should look like and what they should sound like. And the same thing is happening now for the Asian community with [the film] Crazy Rich Asians.""Krys says there is a real difference between what is happening now compared to the crossover careers of earlier stars: ""In the early 2000s you had Latin artists, who were singing English pop songs - like Ricky Martin. They had a flavour of something Latin about them.""But now artists are doing music that is rooted in the Latin culture - they are not having to make compromises.""There is more interest now in what other people and cultures are doing,"" he says. ""For a long time most pop music has been rooted in blues and R 'n' B, but you get tired of music all sounding the same. I think people that create music, whether it's K-pop or Latin music, are giving audiences something new, but which still sounds familiar.""Is Mi Gente the new Despacito?Despacito breaks global streaming recordKent Jones on his multi-lingual smash hit Don't MindHannah Waitt, co-founder of K-pop news and entertainment website moonRok, says the huge popularity in Latin music is understandable given the large Spanish-speaking diaspora around the world - but calls the rise in Korean music ""a little more mystifying"".She puts its success down to its heavily borrowed Western pop sound, which she says has been ""carefully manufactured and re-exported to the Western hemisphere with more English mixed into the lyrics"".""K-pop has also filled a huge gap in the market for groups,"" says Waitt. ""With Fifth Harmony and One Direction gone, there's no one really stepping in to give us that group dynamic, which I think young people want.""K-pop almost feels like the second coming of the girl group and boy band renaissance that was started by the Spice Girls, N'Sync, and Backstreet Boys.""She says it helps that Korean artists give fans ""gratuitous access"" to their personal lives via social media and reality TV shows.""Whereas many Western celebrities go to great lengths to protect their privacy, Korean celebrities let fans into their homes, their studios, and even their cars to give fans a closer look at their day-to-day lives. This sort of access fosters a more intimate relationship between the fans and the artist, which results in intense fan loyalty.""""Genres are disappearing and language has taken a backseat to the music,"" Waitt adds.Masterton agrees, saying: ""With BTS there is no real concession to English. Younger generations don't care what the language is, it's just the vibe of it and the feel of it that they like.""He also sees it as a way for artists like Beyonce, who features on Mi Gente with J Balvin and Willy William, to freshen up their sound: ""Anything that gives your record a bit of an edge and makes it sound different - as well as making it appeal across different countries is bound to be good.""Perhaps this is the real reason the music industry seems suddenly so eager to embrace bilingual hits.Which record company wouldn't want to conduct a mutually beneficial cultural exchange - introducing, for example, Dua Lipa to the Korean market and giving her immediate cachet by associating her with an already domestically successful artist? And likewise for Blackpink to the UK market.Krys concedes there is an element of this going on, but says it's not the most important aspect in the change we've seen: ""You go back to Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson - there are always people wanting to break into new markets. But I think these young artists want a new sound and want to collaborate.""Waitt calls it a ""cynical"" way to view things, saying: ""I prefer to look at it as an incredible opportunity for the biggest artists in the world to create music that reflects the multi-lingual world that we live in.""BTS management apologise for 'Nazi' photosWhat do non-Koreans love about K-pop?How to be the perfect K-pop fanAnd what of K-pop - is it just a flash in the pan that will come and go?Waitt says: ""Every time I think K-pop is going to plateau or peter out, a new group comes along and takes the genre to a new level. I think K-pop is here to stay - it will always have a core fan base of young people that care enough to buy tickets and stream the songs.""All three say they see this cultural phenomenon as a good thing.Krys says: ""Where some people think artists are appropriating a culture, I think it actually opens up the cultural dialogue.""Living in the US right now, on this very polarised planet, it's very weird to see songs like Mi Gente and Despacito be number one. I don't think it can be a bad thing to have positive cultural models like these.""We're not all rapists and murderers,"" he remarks, referring to President Trump's 2016 election campaign. ""We're musicians and artists and doctors and normal people.""Masterton sees it as beneficial that acts don't have to ""dilute"" their own culture to be successful in another country.""And you know what,"" he adds, ""the number of teens that might know a phrase or two in Korean is also likely to be far higher than previously - which can only be a good thing!""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Stephen Graham: Actor tells Desert Island Discs 'I didn’t know how to cope'		"Actor Stephen Graham has opened up about the time he attempted to take his own life, after suffering a breakdown.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, the star of Line of Duty, The Irishman and This Is England said he ""didn't know how to cope"" at the time.The ordeal came about after he had left home to go to drama school in London.The 46-year-old said a series of traumatic family events that occurred before he moved away from home for the first time contributed to his collapse.In the space of a few years, his beloved grandmother died and his mother gave birth to a stillborn child. ""I'd been through these few traumatic things and never really grieved,"" said the Liverpudlian actor.His mother later became pregnant again and a baby brother arrived the day before Graham, then 20, went to start his new life in the capital.""This beautiful joyous occasion of this little boy coming into my life and mum and pop's life and then me having to leave was kind of a bit difficult,"" he told host Lauren Laverne. ""But when you're 20 you have the world in front of you haven't you, so you try not to focus on that stuff.""He added: ""I had a breakdown with all of these things that had happened traumatically from my late teens that I hadn't really dealt with or I hadn't come to terms with.""The star recalled how he returned home and tried to explain his feelings to his parents, who tried to help him, but in vain.He went on to attempt to hang himself in his room. ""It was very calculated,"" he said.""I heard my nanna's voice - and I know it sounds strange and weird... and she shouted 'Stephen' and I thought I'd gone, because I'd tried to do that. And I just came to, I opened my eyes and the rope had snapped, thankfully.""And then I put a high neck jumper on, one of them zip-up jumpers, and my ma and da came back and then my mum kind of saw it and she went, 'What's that?' And she seen it properly and then the three of us... I really opened up then, everything just came out and I just [said], 'I don't know how to cope.'His best friends Lee and Jamie were ""magnificent"", he said. ""They were really supportive and my mum and dad and slowly built me back, slowly come around to the understanding it was OK. Life was worth living, thankfully.""Graham also spoke about how he first attended a youth theatre group at Liverpool's Everyman theatre as a teenager on the advice of local actor Andrew Schofield, who lived over the road from his grandmother.One of Graham's grandfathers was Jamaican, and he told Laverne that at times in his youth he didn't know where he ""belonged"".""There were times there growing up when I was slightly unsure where I fitted in,"" he said, referencing his white and black cousins. He stressed that his parents encouraged him ""to find my own way within it"".He can now be seen playing mobster Anthony Provenzano in Martin Scorsese's film The Irishman. The director had previously cast him in Gangs of New York and as Al Capone in HBO's Boardwalk Empire.Graham admitted he was ""really nervous"" to meet Robert De Niro, his co-star in The Irishman, because movies like The Godfather, Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter were ""the films that I grew up on"".His dad showed them to him on video straight after he confessed to having a proper interest in acting. ""That weekend we watched those three films, and I think we watched The Godfather twice actually. It was amazing,"" he recalled.""But that was that kind of a moment where he went to me, 'If you're serious, this is how it's done, seriously and brilliantly.' That began my love affair with films.""Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 GMT on Sunday and then online.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Adam Lambert: 'Coming out is an act of defiance'	"Coming out is 'an act of defiance'Taylor Swift's LGBT activism is ""admirable""He won't record new music with QueenAdam's gone indieFeel Something was written at his lowest ebbNew Eyes is all about falling in loveHe made Cher cryQueen won't be touring with AbbaHe's an advocate of electoral reform"	"It's four years since Adam Lambert last released an album - but it wasn't touring with Queen that put the brakes on his solo career.""I was fried and disillusioned,"" says the pop star.He was ""second-guessing"" his music and feeling ""detached in my personal life,"" so he hunkered down and asked himself the tough questions: ""Am I doing this for money? Am I doing this for attention? Am I doing this because I love music?A few things became clear: Making and playing music were still his passions, but the business side of the industry was ""making me sad"".""I was making my happiness dependent on my commercial success,"" he explains. ""It was unhealthy. I had to rethink things.""The result is his new EP, Velvet: Side A - a liberated, funky take on '70s rock that provides the missing link between Queen and the electro-pop of his solo albums.Critics have all called it his ""best work yet,"" and it will be followed next year by Velvet: Side B, featuring the previously-released songs Feel Something and New Eyes.Dressed in a long, sheer poncho and festooned with jewellery (including a gigantic silver ring in the shape of a sphinx), Lambert sat down with the BBC for a wide-ranging chat about sexuality, new music, the future of Queen, and why he's an advocate of electoral reform.Here are the highlights.Lambert had already come out to his family and friends when he took part in the eighth season of American Idol in 2009, but when pictures of him kissing his ex-boyfriend emerged during the show's run, it made headlines in America.Fox News ran a segment on the singer, calling the photos ""embarrassing"", while Entertainment Weekly put Lambert on their cover with the disingenuous strap line: ""The Most Exciting American Idol Contestant in Years (And Not Just Because He Might Be Gay).""""It was stressful and it was confusing,"" says the star. ""I was like, 'What am I supposed to do?'""""In hindsight I realise there is power in coming out. The act of declaring your sexuality publicly, once you're a public figure, is an act of defiance in some ways, and it's also a form of activism.""And he's pleased that queer artists are becoming more and more visible, with the likes of Christine + The Queens, Olly Alexander and, especially, Sam Smith showing that sexuality is no longer the barrier to success it used to be.""Sam is a really interesting example because they have been able to be fully mainstream,"" he says. ""I mean, mums and dads are buying Sam's album. That's a big move, a big step.""Lambert has a cameo in Taylor Swift's colourful video for You Need To Calm Down, dressed in biker gear and giving Ellen DeGeneres a tattoo in the back of a caravan (as you do).Swift intended the video, which was packed with queer and trans celebrities, as a message of solidarity with her LGBT fans - but was later criticised for ""commodifying queerness"" to sell records.""I can see both sides of the controversy,"" says Lambert. ""People are like, 'Oh, she was exploiting the community for her own gain'. But the thing that excuses that is that she called people to action. She got a ton of signatures on a petition for the Equality Act,"" which would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity.""That's real action, so it's not just for personal gain. She's putting her money where her mouth is, and I thought that was really admirable.""""The Queen train is full speed ahead,"" laughs the star. ""I think the movie [Bohemian Rhapsody] has taken things way over the edge.""I mean, we were doing fine before, don't get me wrong, but now it's stratospheric. And we're seeing much younger people in the audience. There were always some young people but now it's all ages. New fans.""The band have just announced tour dates for 2020 - marking Lambert's ninth year as frontman. But he says they've never been tempted to make a new Queen album.""It doesn't make sense to me,"" he says. ""It just doesn't click.""I don't know how else to describe it, but there's never been a real reason to do it.""Not that Lambert has suddenly become The Smiths or anything; but his EP was inspired by artists like Billie Eilish and Lana Del Rey, who ride in the outer lanes of the pop mainstream.""I'd been listening to the Top 40 and going, 'I don't like a lot of this music,' and I was gravitating towards indie stuff that wasn't cookie-cutter pop.""It was more adventurous and moody, and I wanted to do something in that vein: Slightly more indie and slightly less trend-based.""Keeping it truly independent, Lambert left his former home at Warner Bros to release Velvet on the smaller, indie label Empire.""At a major label, it's always a compromise,"" he says. ""There are certain ulterior motives, and most of them are money-related. I wanted to be in a situation where I could be in the driver's seat and say, 'This is what I want to put out.'""""I don't need to feel love / I just wanna feel something,"" sings Lambert on Feel Something, a vulnerable and emotional ballad that became the first single from Velvet. It was quite a departure for the singer, but he says it was crucial.""I didn't want to put out my big crazy pop single first,"" he says. ""I wanted to tell a story about what I've gone through and Feel Something was a way to sum that all up: This is where I was when I was hitting the bottom, and kind of bummed out.""His vocal performance on the song is uncharacteristically raw - something he wouldn't have attempted at the start of his career.""Ten years ago, I would attack things with a lot more energy, theatrics, attitude,"" he says. ""So it's little bit of a change to pull it all back.""Lambert met his new boyfriend, Javi Costa Polo, on Instagram and he helped Lambert rediscover ""all the things I was longing for in Feel Something"".The song New Eyes is all about him, says the star.""The new pair of eyes that came into my life are very hopeful and very positive,"" he smiles.""There's an innocence there that I'm really drawn to. The freshness, the hunger for new experiences: I love that.""Lambert reduced Cher to tears last December when he performed a stunning, stripped-back cover of her biggest hit, Believe, at the Kennedy Center Honours.It was a ""wild"" night, he says, but it almost never happened.""They were expecting me to perform Believe the same way as the record - but I was like, 'No, the Kennedy Center is highbrow and sophisticated, why don't we do it like a ballad?'""At first they weren't sure, but I said, 'Would you please trust me?' and I'm really glad I pushed for it - because I think that's what made it such a moment.""When Lambert performed for Cher, she was in the middle of promoting Dancing Queen, her album of Abba covers. But when we suggest an Abba / Queen double bill, the singer is sceptical.""Queen and Abba? Do they belong on the same bill? Do they?"" he asks incredulously.Here's a counter-argument: Queen and Abba sharing Glastonbury's legend slot would be amazing.""I guess you're right,"" he concedes. ""Going on tour together wouldn't be a good fit. But at a festival? That'd be a great night.""You read it here first.""I'm not a protest songwriter in any way,"" says the star, but his latest single, Superpower, ""does tap into the zeitgeist of people feeling frustrated"" and downtrodden.Lambert wrote the slick, funky pop track three years ago ""but it still feels topical,"" he says, because ""the political situation in America is terrible"".However, he believes Donald Trump's presidency is a ""tipping point"" that's energised a ""progressive"" youth movement.""People go, 'Is he going to get re-elected?' and I just feel like the chances of that are so slim, because he barely got through the first time - and that's before we realised just how bad he was going to be.""""But there's problems,"" he adds. ""It's a corrupt system. The fact that they make it so hard for people of colour, and so many other minority groups, to vote. It's screwed up.""The solution, he suggests, is to overhaul America's electoral system.""At the time the [electoral college] system was created, it needed to be that way, but we're in a different era now. It's dated.""I don't see why they just can't make it a square vote, where everyone in the country votes and the person with the most gets in.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Madonna at 60: The Queen of Pop in seven charts	1) She's had more UK number one albums than any other female artist2) These are the people's favourites3) She's had more singles in the top five than any other female artist4) Her Super Bowl performance was record-breaking5) Spotify doesn't hear Madonna the same way we do6) G major is the most common key7) She's the richest female musician in America	"Madonna turns 60 on Thursday. To celebrate, we're taking a look back at her 35 years in the industry.Since Madonna's eponymous debut album hit the shelves in 1983, she's performed on 10 concert tours and sold more than 300 million records.This has earned her a spot in the Guinness World Records as the best-selling female recording artist of all time.What else can a look at the numbers tell us about the Queen of Pop?Twelve of Madonna's albums have hit the number one spot. Only the Beatles and Elvis Presley can boast more.Greatest hits album The Immaculate Collection spent a 338 weeks in the charts after its release in 1990 - including more than two months at number one.Like A Virgin your favourite Madonna tune? Join the crowd: Spotify data ranks this 1984 classic as her most popular song.In fact, only one song in the top five is not from the 80s: Hung Up from 2005.Madonna's had 46 singles make the top five in the UK charts - only Elvis has had more.The run of top five hits spans three decades, from Like A Virgin in 1984 to Celebration in 2009.Obviously, Google wasn't around to tell us what people were curious about back in the 1980s.But since 2010, global searches for Madonna reached their highest point in March 2012, when she was the Super Bowl's first female headline act since Janet Jackson had her ""wardrobe malfunction"" in 2004.In 2012, Madonna set a record for the highest viewing audience of a Super Bowl halftime show - which lasted until 2015 when it was smashed by Katy Perry and 'Left Shark'.Most streaming services give songs a numeric value to determine if it's a ""happy"" or ""sad"" song, based on its key, tempo and other factors.It only measures how the music sounds - and ignores the lyrical content - but uses this information to auto-recommend new music to us.So looking at how Spotify's computers ""hear"" her work, they would classify it as getting ""sadder"" over time, with slower songs and more minor keys being used.Clearly this is far from the whole story - machines can't (currently) understand the words and ""feel"" songs in the way we do.Some of Madonna's deepest, most emotional work is actually on her early albums, despite those records sounding more ""happy"" overall.True Blue from 1986 ranks among the ""happiest"" sounding, despite songs covering teenage pregnancy, deceit and parental estrangement.And while 2012's MDNA and 2015's Rebel Heart both sound ""gloomier"" to a computer, songs such as Give Me All Your Luvin and Girl Gone Wild are lyrically anything but.So streaming services have a way to go before they can reveal more to us about a song than just its sound.Madonna's studio albums feature songs in 24 different keys - but G major is the most common, with 17 songs employing it.Looks like she really is a Material Girl.Forbes estimated Madonna's net worth at $580m (£454m) last year, making her the richest female artist based in America, comfortably $200m (£157m) ahead of runner-up Celine Dion.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Guilt: Will Gompertz reviews BBC Scotland's crime drama ★★★★★		"There have been some really nasty mouths on TV and cinema screens over the years. Hannibal Lecter's springs to mind. Although, to be fair, the gimp mask didn't do him any favours. Batman's bete noire Bane (as played by Tom Hardy) suffered from the same indignity, poor chap. He probably had a lovely smile behind all that leather and metal. That's what his mother said, at least.Albert Steptoe (remember him?) had a malevolent gurn so loaded it actually made you feel dirty. Not quite as filthy and rotten as Hessian Horseman's ghastly black gnashers in Sleepy Hollow, which made you retch (headlessness improved him no end).For a more life-like mean mouth, pinched and bloodless and filled with nothing but venom, I always thought you need look no further than Begbie's cruel kisser in Danny Boyle's Trainspotting.That was before watching Guilt on BBC Two, an Edinburgh-based four-part drama starring Mark Bonnar as Max McCall, a solicitor perpetually on the verge of losing it.Big time.Maybe the perma-snarl is a Scottish actor speciality, like Irn Bru is in the fizzy drink market. They're both livid, anyway.With good reason in Max's case.There he was, coming back from a jolly wedding having had a bottle of champagne or two, when his younger brother and designated driver goes and runs over an old man causing Max's top lip to take on the properties of a very thin and angry elastic band.Jake (Jamie Sives) is all over the place; he's all panicky and muddled, which is hardly surprising given he is sky-high on weed.Jake wants to do the right thing, Max wants to drive on: these two would disagree about the colour of The Beatles' Yellow Submarine.""You've got no soul,"" says Jake.""You've got too much,"" Max snaps back.They duly enter into a spiral of poor decision-making which serves them very badly indeed but works a treat for the plot. OK, it's not the most original set-up of all time: an odd couple crime caper in which the increasingly desperate attempts by the two anti-heroes to cover up their guilt leads them deeper into the mire.It is often funny, not so much in a Laurel and Hardy ""another fine mess"" way, more like Noel and Liam Gallagher and their constant sniping and carping.Max and Jake loathe each other.They have a long-standing beef, which middle-age has done nothing to quell. In fact, their mutual disregard is just about the only thing they have in common.Max is the bossy older sibling with all the trappings of success: the flash car, the big house, the expensive clothes, and a wife (Sian Brooke) he considers a trophy but who self-identifies as a sentient human being.Jake is the ""kid"" brother who never grew up.While Max was doing the hard, corporate yards climbing the legal profession's ladder, his younger brother was dreaming of being a pop star. When he woke up a decade later to discover he wasn't duetting with Mick Jagger on a charity single but was actually stony broke with no prospects, he was only too happy to accept Max's offer of setting him up with a specialist record store.Max is hard, Jake is soft.Max plays with the big boys, Jake plays records. Max has a lot to lose, Jake couldn't give a damn. Until, that is, he meets the American niece (Ruth Bradley) of the man he ran down.I will say no more.Other than, Guilt is very good.There's a lot of telly about at the moment, but this is a notch or two above most.Neil Forsyth's scripts are precise and darkly witty, his characters believable and entertaining. Robert McKillop's directing is crisp and evocative.The cast brings this tale of the Edinburgh underworld vividly to life, playing up to its more surreal elements like Twin Peaks veterans. There's a welcome appearance from an in-form Bill Paterson (Fleabag), while a steely-eyed Ellie Haddington takes on the role of a curtain-twitching, nosy neighbour with whom you would not leave your kids.Guilt is the polar opposite to the trendy slow-burn box set.It starts with a bang and builds from there, with a plot that twists and turns like the snakes in Medusa's hair.My only whinge is four eps aren't enough for a proper binge, bring on season two.Recent reviews by Will Gompertz"
entertainment	When Justin and Britney met Romeo and Juliet	Major pop hits	"Spoiler alert: At the end of Romeo and Juliet, Romeo and Juliet die.Juliet's taken a sleeping potion and Romeo thinks she's dead, so he drinks a vial of poison. When Juliet awakens and discovers his corpse, she stabs herself in the heart.""O happy dagger, / This is thy sheath,"" she says, before collapsing onto Romeo's lifeless body.But what if she didn't? What if Juliet dropped the dagger and ran off to Paris to rebuild her life?That's the jumping off point for a new West End musical, & Juliet, which depicts the heroine on a post-traumatic journey of self-empowerment, while belting out the hits of Britney Spears, Katy Perry and Justin Timberlake.If this all sounds like the product of a concussed writer's fever dream, that's because it is.Playwright David West Read came up with the idea four years ago, after slamming his head into a cupboard in the kitchen of his rented apartment.He'd recently been asked to pitch a musical based on the songbook of Swedish pop powerhouse Max Martin so, after briefly ignoring his symptoms to watch a 3D screening of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (""the worst thing I could have done""), he retired to bed and started researching.""I didn't actually know who Max Martin was until I Googled him,"" he confesses, ""But in my concussed state, I made this Max Martin playlist which was, like, 150 tracks; and I suddenly realised that he'd written so many of my favourite songs from the past 25 years.""In fact, Martin is the third most-successful songwriter in US chart history, with credits on 22 number one singles. Only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26) have more.He is the man who introduced us to indelible choruses like, ""Oops! I did it again"", or ""I kissed a girl and I liked it"", or ""Hit me baby one more time""; and who helped Taylor Swift mastermind her transition from country music to globe-straddling pop megastardom.As Read delved into the playlist, one thing became clear.""You could make five musicals with the material that was there,"" he says. ""But there's a lot of songs about love, a lot of songs about heartbreak, and a lot of songs about second chances. So I came to this idea of Romeo and Juliet, and a new beginning for Juliet.""The key to unlocking the character was one Britney Jean Spears.""She became a through-line for Juliet,"" says Read, ""because there's these two Britney songs: ...Baby One More Time, which has the line, 'My loneliness is killing me'; and Stronger, which is, 'My loneliness ain't killing me no more', which became this perfect bookend to her story.""But & Juliet isn't just concerned with its titular character... In fact, the musical opens with William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, arguing about the ending of his great tragedy. Hathaway grabs control of the quill, and the couple tussle over the development of the play - cleverly deploying the Backstreet Boys' I Want It That Way as the soundtrack.""Max is the first to admit that the lyrics to that song don't really make sense,"" laughs Read. ""Basically every other line contradicts the line that came before it. So the natural way to make sense of that is it's an argument between two people.""Read - a producer and writer on the hit sitcom Schitt's Creek, whose previous Broadway show was a comedy about the adult film industry - instantly won Martin over with his witty, meta-textual take on Shakespeare.The musician had been wary of ""jukebox musicals"" that become allegories for the music industry (hello, Viva Forever), preferring the universal appeal of something like Mamma Mia!""I wanted it to be a great story because I'm insecure, because I'm a songwriter,"" he told the BBC's The One Show in a rare interview last week. ""So I'm thinking everyone that comes into this room, they're going to have to love it, even if they haven't heard the music.""After hiring Read, the next crucial step was to find a Juliet; and they struck gold when they discovered Miriam-Teak Lee, a young actress who, at the time, was the understudy for all three Schuyler sisters in the London production of Hamilton.""I remember reading the story and just thinking, 'this is incredible, I love it,'"" she says. ""And like David, I didn't know anything about Max Martin, so I was just blown away when I found out who he was.""One of her first tasks was to perfect Juliet's opening number, and she insisted on going through the melody line by line with the show's musical director Dominic Fallacaro (a process known in the musical theatre world as ""note-bashing"").""I remember Dominic being like, 'Really? Do you need a note bash for Britney's ...Baby One More Time?'"" she says, ""But I just wanted to get it right, because it was done in a completely different way. It was much slower and it forced me to really listen to the lyrics, which intrigued me so much.""When I heard it like that, I already wanted to see where Juliet was going to go, where this was going to take her.""As it turns out, even Read didn't know where Juliet would end up. Casting Lee changed the show beyond recognition, as the actress's irresistible spirit and humour began to bleed into her character.""I had this idea that Juliet was going to be this meek, obedient, subservient girl, who learns to become empowered,"" says Read. ""Then Miriam-Teak walked in and she was like, 'There is no version of that that is going to work!'""""In the beginning, we were like, 'Is she this vulnerable character?'"" recalls Lee, ""and then we did the workshops and I was like, 'No, I think she's always had this inner strength,' and it's just about putting her in a situation where she's allowed to let that out.""Read jumps back in: ""If I can speak about her like she's not in the room, Miriam-Teak has this intelligence, confidence and self-assuredness; and because she's such a powerhouse as a vocalist and as a person, that's how we came up with this empowered version of Juliet that feels way more 2019.""It's not as simplistic as going, 'Stand up to the patriarchy!' or 'Women should have a voice!' It's about saying, as a young person and as a young woman, I know who I am and I don't need to apologise for that. And I think that feels like a more dynamic character than where I was four years ago.""In the musical, this is exemplified by the use of Demi Lovato's ballsy pop banger Confident. Originally, it was used to illustrate Juliet discovering her inner confidence. In the finished version of the musical, she's using it to educate the rest of the cast.""She's saying, 'Look, I did stand up to my parents in the original play and I've learned some things that I'm gonna pass on to the rest of you,'"" says Lee.It's not the only element that was transformed during the workshops and previews that built up to the musical's West End official opening this weekend.In particular, Read spent months trying to shoehorn Adele's Send My Love (To Your New Lover) into the score.""We tried it in, like, five different places. That's how much I wanted it in,"" he says. ""But as much as I wanted Adele in the musical, it just didn't serve the story.""But that's the cool thing. If it was a new musical where someone had written all the songs, and you said, 'We're not going to use it,' that song would disappear forever. But Max had already written all the songs, so we were a bit more free to play around with which ones were in or out"".The final tweaks were made during a four-week trial run in Manchester last month, with early reviews praising the show's ""belly laughs"" and Lee's ""truly dazzling"" vocals on Katy Perry's Roar (""That's the most full-on song,"" she admits. ""It's so thrilling to sing but you have to give it everything."")But it was the reaction of the audience that gave the team true confidence.""There was one woman who said she came 28 times,"" says Read.""I mean, there were 32 shows, so I want to know why she didn't come to those four extra nights!""But I feel like that's a good sign, when people want to come back.""& Juliet opens at London's Shaftesbury Theatre on 2 November, with the cast recording to follow on 15 November.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Could Max Martin's musical be the best pop show of all time?	'Not human'	"Move over Mamma Mia! Max Martin is putting together a new musical.OK, the Swedish producer's name might not be instantly recognisable, but his songs are.In total, he's written 22 US number one singles - from Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time and Katy Perry's I Kissed A Girl to Taylor Swift's Shake It Off.A casting notice for the new musical says those songs are the ""inspiration"" for the show, which is set to premiere in the UK next year.The briefing notes explain the musical is in the ""final stages of development"" and is being created by Max Martin, with orchestration and arrangements by Bill Sherman, who previously worked on Lin-Manuel Miranda's pre-Hamilton show In The Heights.The story will be written by David West Read, who is known for the TV series Schitt's Creek, and the Broadway show The Performers, a comedy set at the Adult Film Awards in Las Vegas.Among the hits that could feature in the production are...Best of all, however, we could finally see a musical featuring Five's Slam Dunk (Da Funk).The casting notice calls for ""exceptional pop singers"" in their 20s and 30s who can ""act and dance to a high standard""; as well as dancers skilled in hip-hop, breakdancing and street dance.The musical will enter a workshop phase next year, and will premiere outside London before transferring to the West End.Martin's tally of 22 number ones makes him the third most-successful songwriter in US chart history behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26).Born in the Stockholm suburb of Stenhamra in 1974, he studied French Horn at school and spent time in the (terrible) heavy metal act It's Alive before becoming pop's premier craftsman.Part of his ""secret formula"" is applying the dynamics of metal to pop songs - eschewing repetition in favour of stop-start rhythms and wild contrasts between the verse and chorus.A serial collaborator, he oversees a large team of writers, who are often assigned different parts of a song to work on. The process is devoid of ego - a chorus from one song might be swapped for the bridge of another, with the whole team willingly sharing credit.""I don't think that Max Martin is human,"" Simon Cowell once observed.""I think he was made in Sweden to make hit records, because nobody human can have done what he's done.""The musician was awarded the prestigious Polar Prize in 2016 and, in a rare public appearance, shared some of the secrets of his success.The first was ""steal from the best,"" he said. ""I confess, over the years I've ripped off giants like ABBA, Kiss and the late, amazing Prince.""The second most important secret is love.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Coldplay announce new album in a letter to a fan	'Experimental side'	"Coldplay have quietly announced their first album in four years, by sending a letter to one of their fans.""For the last 100 years or thereabouts, we have been working on a thing called Everyday Life,"" said the band in the typewritten message.It will be a double album, split into two halves, called Sunrise and Sunset, and released on 22 November.The letter was signed by all four members of the band - but the recipient initially thought it was a hoax.""Fake alert!"" said Lena Tayara on Twitter, alongside a picture of the gold-embossed card. ""Got this in the post this morning... Can't see why anybody would send it.""After fans reassured her it looked authentic, she changed her mind, writing: ""If I'd known that card was genuine I would have put on a nicer tablecloth before I took the pics.""But thanks for the card - I'm AMAZED and very touched.""Coldplay are the biggest-selling British band of the 21st Century. According to the Official Charts Company, they have three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the Millennium, led by 2002's A Rush Of Blood To The Head.Their last record, A Head Full Of Dreams, was an uplifting, multicoloured dalliance with pop that saw the band collaborate with Beyonce, Stargate and Swedish pop maverick Tove Lo. It sold more than 2 million copies, and spawned 122-date world tour that grossed $523m (£402m) at the box office.It was followed up by a companion EP, Kaleidoscope, and a side project with Pharrell Williams under the name Los Unidades, but the band have largely been silent since 2017.Rumours of their return were sparked last week, when black-and-white posters appeared in Madrid, showing the band dressed as a 1920s wedding band, sitting next to a man who appeared to be German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, holding a saxophone.The band's website was later updated to show a logo of the sun and moon, reflecting what we now know to be the album title, while a snippet of orchestral music was posted to their Twitter account over the weekend.Little else is known about the record but last year, frequent collaborator Mat Whitecross told the NME it would ""surprise people"", while an unnamed ""insider"" recently told the Daily Star the album would showcase their ""experimental side"".An Italian fan site also posted a proposed tracklist for the first half of the double album, which suggested one of the tracks featured French dance pioneers Daft Punk. However, the information was unverified and potentially fake.In their letter to Lena, the band simply said the record ""is sort of how we feel about things"".Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Kim Wilde says aliens inspired her pop comeback	'Really odd'	"It's hard to imagine Kim Wilde on the front line of a cultural war but, back in 1981, that's exactly where she found herself.The irresistible success of Kids In America, Chequered Love and Cambodia threw the popular music press into disarray.Still in thrall to punk, the NME and Melody Maker couldn't work out what to make of this coiffed pop singer - the offspring of (in their view) the decidedly naff 60s pop star Marty Wilde, who happened to be co-writing all of her singles.Reading those columns now (a Spanish fan site has helpfully archived them), it's fun to watch writers torturing themselves for the simple sin of enjoying pop music""How do you feel about it suddenly being hip to like Kim Wilde?"" fretted style bible The Face.Describing her debut album, the NME's Paul Morley wrote ""God knows why I like it,"" then tied himself in knots trying to explain the appeal of ""the girl next door to the girl next door"" before ungraciously asking her, ""Do you feel you're a business toy?"".""I spent a lot of time justifying myself back then,"" laughs the singer, still looking glamorous as she sips a coffee in a central London hotel.""That NME piece was terribly pretentious but it was saying, in a way, 'OK, I give in. Pop music is here and you're great at doing it, and we're going to put you on the cover'.""So I kind of won that battle.""Having conquered the music snobs and colonised the music press, Wilde went on to score 20 Top 40 hits, shifting 30 million records and supporting David Bowie and Michael Jackson on tour.But things fizzled out in the 1990s as younger, hungrier acts replaced her at the top of the charts.""I'd been in it since I was 20, then I was 36 and everyone, I felt, was doing it a lot better than I was. They had the ambition that I didn't have any more.""When Madonna came along, I didn't feel I could compete, so I said, 'You know what? You're best off being who you are, and that's going to have to be enough'.""Sometimes it was, and a lot of the time it wasn't.""You might also like:In 1996, having lost her record deal, Wilde starred in a West End production of Tommy, where she fell in love with, and subsequently married, her co-star Hal Fowler.Leaving showbusiness behind gave her a tremendous sense of freedom, she says. Then, while raising her kids, Wilde found a second career in horticulture - writing several books on gardening and presenting the BBC series Garden Invaders.""I was always drawn to plants and nature,"" says the star, whose pre-fame job was flower arranging in a garden centre. ""It's very healing, and very therapeutic and inspiring.""Two chance events resurrected her music career.In 2002, Nena (of 99 Red Balloons fame) asked Wilde to duet on her single Anyplace, Anytime, Anywhere, which became a huge hit in Holland, Germany and Austria.Then in 2012, Wilde drunkenly serenaded commuters on her train home from a Magic FM Christmas Party, swaying around the carriage in a pair of comedy antlers.Filmed by her fellow passengers, the clip went viral. Wilde was mortified, but it turned out the public were laughing with, not at, her giggly, warm-hearted performance.As the views for the video rose, so did interest in her music. A year later, she released an album of Christmas covers and now she's following that up with Here Come the Aliens, her first album of original songs since 1995.Full of glam guitars and shimmering disco synths, it's a big, fun pop record. A bit cheesy at times, but far from embarrassing - with Stereo Shot and the Billy Idol-inspired Kandy Krush the standout tracks.But the album gets its title from a lyric in the opening track, 1969 - a Barbarella-style space romp that was inspired by Wilde's close encounter with a UFO in 2009.""It was a mind-blowing experience,"" says the 57-year-old. ""I still get really excited talking about it.""It all happened the day after Michael Jackson died, shortly after the family experienced a medical emergency of their own.""I had actually spent the whole evening at A&E with our son,"" Wilde recalls. ""Swine flu was rife at the time and he'd developed a very high temperature.""After the fever subsided, everyone returned home and Wilde retired to the garden with a glass of wine.""Then I looked up in the sky and saw this huge bright light behind a cloud. Brighter than the moon, but similar to the light from the moon.""I said to my husband and my friend, 'that's really odd,' so we walked down the grass and looked to see if there was any source.""All of a sudden it moved, very quickly, from about 11.00 to 1.00. Then it just did that, back and forth, for several minutes.""Whenever it moved, something shifted in the air - but it was silent. Absolutely silent.""Eventually, the UFO shot off, ""but I've watched lights in the sky ever since"", says Wilde. ""There's not a day goes by I don't think about it.""Wasn't she nervous about telling people all of this?""To tell you the truth, I wasn't,"" she says. ""A few people looked at me and said, 'Friday night? Was wine involved?'.""But the week after, the Welwyn and Hatfield Times carried the story of someone else who had actually taken a photograph of a sphere in the sky… And the witness account tallies exactly with my one. So I said to everyone, 'There you go!'.""Wilde remained calm and peaceful throughout the encounter and, on her album, describes the aliens as benign, singing: ""Maybe they'll save us from the apocalypse.""""Perhaps that's completely naïve,"" she laughs. ""Why wouldn't they be angry with us and fling us off this beautiful earth that we're ruining? I can't deny we haven't been a terrible disappointment.""As a keen sci-fi fan (Arrival and ET are her favourite films), Wilde is fully embracing the theme of her new album - from the sleeve's terrific B-movie artwork, to the stage show for her upcoming tour.""I've got this little wardrobe set up, of fantastic capes and cloaks,"" says the singer, who previously bought her outfits at jumble sales.""We're going to go a bit sci-fi and we're going to a bit glam rock. It'll be sexy and fun and something to put a big smile on people's faces. I'm really excited about it.""It feels like she's regained the ambition that ebbed away in the 90s, I suggest.""I've really got the bit in my teeth,"" she agrees. ""I'm going to be the performer I never thought I could be.""I want to surprise myself. Why not? I'm going to be 60 soon and before you know it, I'll be dancing off this beautiful earth.""I may as well go out all guns blazing.""Here Come The Aliens is out now.

entertainment	How Kali Uchis went from living out of a car to pop stardom		"Kali Uchis went from sleeping rough in the back of her car to working with Gorillaz and Snoop Dogg. The Colombian-American star tells us the story of her hard-won success.At the age of 17, Kali Uchis was thrown out of her parents' house for repeatedly breaking her curfew.For months she lived out of her car, staying with friends when she could and working in a grocery store to make ends meet.Her rebellious streak first started to cause problems two years earlier, when she'd begun skipping class to spend time making experimental short films and working on her music.It makes the lyrics to the opening song on her latest album, Isolation, particularly fitting.""There's no tracking where I'm going,"" she sings on Body Language.It's not just a boast, it's a promise - one that's fulfilled by the wild profusion of ideas she presents over the following 50 minutes.The album glides effortlessly between soul, bossa nova, reggaeton, Cumbia, bedroom pop and elastic funk - all wrapped up in Uchis' sun-baked, jazzy vocals.It's a reflection of her open-minded approach to music, which all began with her father's job.""My dad managed apartment complexes and a lot of people, when they would leave the apartments they would leave their old music behind,"" she explains.""So my dad would bring me home little boxes of CDs sometimes. That's how I found out about Kenna [Zemedkun, Ethiopian-American musician], and there was a group called Cerar who were super-weird, almost demonic.""I'm pretty sure they were putting some type of curse on me, but I would still listen to it.""Kali deliberately sought out the strange and obscure - the more bizarre the better.""I wanted to feel like music was my secret,"" she says. ""I wouldn't want to just turn the radio on and everyone be singing the same song as me.""That musical curiosity fuelled her own songwriting, to the point where she's suspicious of singers who stick with a single style.""To just have one aesthetic or one thing you sing about is a little bit gimmicky,"" she decrees.As you might have noticed, Kali Uchis is not lacking in confidence.She's funny, smart and friendly too - but carries the hard-won determination of a woman who's had to fight for her place in the world.Born Karly-Marina Loaiza in Virginia, she was raised in her parents' native Colombia before violence forced them to flee back to the US in 2000.Home life was often chaotic, with her parents and four older siblings joined by a rotating cast of relatives who'd come from Pereira to find work.Her father would get them jobs as cleaners and construction workers on the properties he managed. When money was tight, he'd rope his daughter in too.""I was caulking and putting up dry-walls,"" she says. ""We all did it, me and my brothers and everyone - construction and auto-mechanic repairs.""I had no problem at all with hard work.""In school she played saxophone and piano, eventually becoming first chair of the jazz band.But it was around this time her rebellious streak started to surface, with her parents eventually throwing her out as a result of her class-skipping and curfew-breaking.She's since reconciled with her family - Kali Uchis is a nickname her father gave her - but the experience taught her to be self-reliant.""It was kind of like, 'You are your own saviour,'"" she says.""People look so much to others for validation, for support, for comfort: 'Do I look okay? Is this too desperate? Am I good enough? Am I good enough?'""If you're good enough for yourself, then you're good enough.""Shortly after moving back into her old bedroom, in August 2012, the teenager summoned up the courage to post some of her music online.""I made 17 songs in one night,"" she recalls. ""I didn't really expect anyone to hear it.""But her lo-fi mixtape, Drunken Babble, caught the attention of people like Snoop Dogg, Gorillaz and and Tyler, the Creator, who invited her to appear on their albums.Her next releases, Ridin' Round and Know What I Want, racked up more than 10 million views on YouTube. But the singer was still outside the mainstream.Typically, it didn't bother her.""Numbers lie,"" she says. ""Some of these people who have hit songs, they're paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to get played on the radio every five minutes - but they can't sell out the venues that I'm selling out.""My fans will stay with me no matter what. They don't care about me just because of a hit song.""Those fans sustained her during the laborious, three-year process of recording her debut album.They're all over her Instagram, leaving comments in their thousands as she posts pages from her notebook and updates on her braces alongside the usual parade of selfies and concert footage.""I like to be able to let my fans into my life,"" she says. ""To connect with them in a personal way and not just have them see the parts you want them to see.""But is that openness compatible with her self-professed desire for privacy? After all, her album is called Isolation, and one of her previous singles carries the refrain: ""I'd rather be a loner.""""I guess it's just finding a balance,"" she says. ""I give my phone to my assistant a lot and she lets me know if there's a text message that I need to answer.""Sometimes, she says, ""I don't even want the phone to touch me. It can become really addictive and really distracting.""Instead she throws herself into her career - not just making music but styling her photo shoots and directing her videos. In other words, she's building her own world.Many of her songs revolve around the desire to have it all, without giving anything away. As she sings on Miami, ""Why would I be Kim?/I could be Kanye.""""It's not a jab at Kim,"" the singer stresses. ""It's more about being a creative person. Although Kim is an entrepreneur, I think it's fair to say she is not creative.""Elsewhere her lyrics dwell on the idea of travel and escape, reflecting a childhood desire to rise above her circumstance.She makes the connection most directly on Teeth In Your Neck - a diatribe against the system that traps immigrants in a cycle of poverty.""My entire childhood I watched everyone around me lose their lives to trying to make money,"" she says of the relatives who worked day and night in the US to support families in Colombia.""So you get to know that your kid is ok and that they're eating, but you don't get to actually be at any of their birthday parties or see them graduate.Her upbringing has given her a perspective on success that many of her contemporaries lack.""I make a lot of sacrifices in my career but I'm really thankful that I'm not doing something that makes me miserable.""Now I'm going to be able to invest in myself, to train myself to be a better performer. I don't think there's any time to be afraid or be safe.""Like she says, there's no tracking where she's going.Isolation is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Ed Sheeran designs Blue Peter badge for BBC Music Day		"Pop superstar Ed Sheeran has said he is ""made up"" to have been asked to design a music-themed Blue Peter badge to mark BBC Music Day on 26 September.He said: ""Music was really important to me growing up and I hope this badge will inspire more kids to get into it.""The multi-coloured new badge features the Blue Peter ship alongside piano keys, a microphone and music notes.Young fans hoping to win the accolade will need to tell Blue Peter how they enjoy making music.They will also need to ask a parent, grandparent or teacher about their musical memories and tell the CBBC programme their top three songs of all time.The badge will be launched live on Thursday in a special edition of Blue Peter that will also feature Sir Paul McCartney.The former Beatle and children's author was presented with a gold Blue Peter badge earlier this year.Sheeran himself received his own gold badge last year as part of the show's 60th birthday celebrations.Now in its fifth year, BBC Music Day will see more than 2,000 events take place across the UK.This year's theme is music and well-being, with special emphasis on the importance of music to people living with dementia.Memory Radio, a new digital tool designed for people with dementia and their carers, will be launched on Thursday.Tie-in programming will include a pop-up performance by Craig David on BBC Breakfast, a performance from Liam Gallagher on The One Show, and an edition of Pointless Celebrities featuring BBC Music Day ambassadors.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Superorganism interview: 'We're a non-stop pop production house'		"If you believe everything you see on TV, you'd assume that bands who live together are having a blast.Whether it's The Monkees teaching Frankenstein's monster to dance or S Club 7 emancipating a pet alligator; the combination of domesticity and pop stardom seems like one big adventure.The reality is much more mundane.""Our house is the worst thing,"" groans Harry Young, one eighth of indie pop collective Superorganism, who share a house in East London.""For sure,"" adds singer Orono Noguchi in a heartbeat. ""It's so small.""""The oven's been broken for six weeks now, in the middle of winter,"" says Young. ""It's been passed around like a hot potato. Everyone is avoiding it.""Broken appliances aside, Superorganism's house is a hive of musical activity that's produced some of the most humorous, catchy and Technicolor music of the last 12 months.The musicians write in their rooms, emailing each other song fragments for improvements and revisions before convening in the kitchen to hear the final result.""Every room has got something going on at all times,"" says Harry. ""It's kind of a non-stop pop production house.""But why not just set up their instruments and play together?""I like doing it over text and the internet because you get to, like, think about it,"" says Orono who, at the age of 17, is younger and more softly-spoken than her 20 and 30-something bandmates.""The internet is just a fundamental of the band: Most of us know each other through the internet, we came together over the internet, and so we work over the internet.""The band developed their unusual working method on their first single, Something For Your MIND - a chopped-up collage of slide guitar, nature sounds, wibbly synths and Orono's deadpan vocals.""Me and some of the guys in the band had tried in vain to record a garage rock album,"" recalls Harry, ""and by the end of that process, we came home and we were just like, 'We don't want to play loud guitars and drums in a room any more'.""So we went back to the drawing board and said, 'What can we do that'll be more fresh and fun?' And all the people who lived in our house became part of the band.""They ""sketched out a few ideas"" and, on a whim, emailed an early version of Something For Your MIND to Orono, one of Harry's Facebook friends who was still at school in the US.""Within an hour of her getting the track, she sent it back and the lyrics and the vocal are what you hear,"" says Harry.""It felt like everything had just fallen into place straight away. Orono fully got the vibe of what we were trying to achieve.""To the band's surprise, the single immediately created a buzz.Within days of being uploaded to Soundcloud last February, it landed in Spotify's influential New Music Friday playlist; and was featured by Frank Ocean and Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig on their radio shows.""When Ezra Koenig played the song, I was like, 'Woah, this is a big moment,'"" recalls Orono.""And then we started getting this crazy response from The Fader and all these big media outlets. I was like, 'Oh Damn. This is for real!'""But at this point, Superorganism had never been in the same room as each other.Orono was ""trying to graduate"" high school; while South Korean backing singer Soul lived in Sydney, and co-vocalists Ruby and Bea were in New Zealand.The fact they had no website or social media presence gave the band an air of mystery; which only increased after Something For Your MIND was yanked off the internet due to an unlicensed sample.""People were speculating, 'Is this the project of a famous person going incognito?'"" says Harry.""They said we were actually The Avalanches or Damon Albarn - which is so flattering because I grew up listening to those artists.""It's like, 'You think we're that good? We feel like we're hacks!'""The success of Something For Your MIND attracted several record labels, including British indie outfit Domino - who signed the band on the strength of ""five or six"" demos.Pretty soon, Orono finished school and packed her bags for London - where she took over the living room of the band's increasingly-cramped house.""One of the first things we did after that was to put together a collaborative playlist"" says Harry.Called ""Sweet Stuff,"" it ran to more than 300 songs, from Lil Yachty to Pavement via Katy Perry and Prince, and acted as a mood board for the band's debut album.""We tried to absorb as much of each other's influences as we could,"" says Harry, ""but our brains lean towards simple, singable melodies and catchy choruses"".""We keep the song writing quite simple and then, with the production, we can shade it and colour it and give it the depth that lends itself to repeat listening.""Certainly, you're unlikely to hear a more inventive record this year. The band's debut album is a squishy mishmash of weird samples (birdsong, cash registers, apples being crunched) bound together by Orono's nonchalant, earwormy vocals.Lyrically, she depicts the angst and ennui of teenage life through the distancing filter of technology: ""There's something so affecting / In the reflections / On my screen"".Her words are abstract but evocative - which is impressive, given that Orono had never attempted a lyric before joining Superorganism (although she had a neat line in Katy Perry fan fiction).""I just always liked English class, I guess,"" she says. ""I don't have a long attention span, so I haven't really been reading books lately - but I like analysing lyrics and I like writing.""The band have had to get used to the limelight pretty quickly. The success of Something For Your MIND and the subsequent singles Nobody Cares and It's All Good earned them a place on the BBC's Sound of 2018, while Rolling Stone magazine called them one of the ""10 artists you need to know"".They've done it all on their own terms - with band member Robert Strange creating all their videos and tour backdrops; while Orono designs all the artwork.The cover of Something For Your MIND even features a hand-drawn map of Tokyo Zoo - where the singer took Harry for a day out after meeting his previous group, The Eversons, at a gig three years ago.So far, it's worked like a charm.""I think we skipped the most intimidating part of being in a band - where you play to 10 or 20 people in an empty room,"" says Harry.""Our first gig was in Hamburg to 500 people. And Orono just fell straight into it""Turning to his bandmate, he suddenly realises how traumatic that might have been.""Did you find that intimidating?"" he asks.""Mmmm,"" ponders the teenager. ""The very, very first song we played, I was quite nervous... but I got into it quite quickly.""But obviously I've had years of training - watching The Wiggles and dancing along.""Superorganism's debut album, also called Superorganism, is released on Friday, 2 March.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	5 pop songs you (probably) didn't know were about God	1) Lenny Kravitz - Are You Gonna Go My Way2) Candi Staton - You Got The Love3) U2 - Until The End Of The World4) The Byrds - Turn! Turn! Turn!5) Prince - Let's Go CrazyFurther listening	"According to a report in The Sun, Justin Bieber is recording a religious concept album.The pop star is said to be on the lookout for songs with a Christian message after reconnecting with his faith through the Pentecostal megachurch Hillsong Church.""There are key themes of love and redemption in the tracks he has created so far,"" a source told the newspaper. ""It will certainly ­surprise some fans.""The inference seems to be that pop songs with a religious theme are automatically awful or, at least, don't fit in the charts. The devil, as they say, has all the best tunes.But there are plenty of examples of mainstream artists turning their faith into great pop songs - from Stormzy's Blinded By Your Grace (""Oh my God, what a God I serve"") to Bob Marley's One Love (""Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right"").So here are five other songs you might not realise had a theological theme.One of the most insistent riffs in rock is married to a lyric about a messianic figure recruiting disciples.""I am the chosen, I am the one,"" sings Kravitz. ""But what I really want to know is/Are you going to go my way?""The song came to Kravitz in a flash of inspiration - he recalls scribbling the lyrics down on a brown paper bag - but it reflects his real-life faith.The star has a tattoo on his back which reads ""My heart belongs to Jesus"", and he once called Christ ""the ultimate rock star"".Disco diva Candi Staton recorded You Got The Love in the 1980s after turning her back on secular music and devoting herself to the church.Bizarrely, the song originally featured in a video about the world's fattest man and his endeavour to lose weight.It only became famous when dance act The Source remixed it in 1991 - bringing lyrics like ""My saviour's love is real"" to raves up and down the country.The song's success prompted Staton to reassess her career.""It was such an inspirational song it allowed me to rethink,"" she told The Guardian. ""People in church used to tell me secular music was the devil's music - but I realised it wasn't.""There's a strong spiritual theme running throughout U2's career - at one point, they even considered ditching the band to devote themselves to the church.So many of their songs are based on biblical teachings that churches have started holding ""U2charists"" - communion services where the band's songs take the place of hymns.Their most powerful song, narratively-speaking, is Until The End Of The World, which is sung from the perspective of Judas Iscariot in the Garden of Gethsemane.The song takes place as he betrays Jesus - delivering a pre-arranged signal that identifies him to the Temple Guards, who arrest him, ultimately leading to the crucifixion.""I kissed your lips and broke your heart,"" sings Bono/Judas. ""You, you were acting like it was the end of the world.""""A time to be born, a time to die/A time to plant, a time to reap/A time to kill, a time to heal/A time to laugh, a time to weep.""The Byrds' 1965 hit is based, almost verbatim, on chapter three of the Book of Ecclesiastes, where King Solomon contemplates the meaning of life, God and eternity.It was ""probably the only time a song was at number one on the charts right out of the Bible,"" guitarist Chris Hillman later told the US Library of Congress. ""I know Pete [Seeger, songwriter] made his half of the publishing. I don't know if King Solomon's heirs ever got a dime.""Hillman wasn't religious at the time of writing the song - in fact, he said the lyrics were almost ""tongue in cheek"" - but he converted to Christianity later in his life.OK, so it opens with Prince sermonising over a church organ - but a lot of people missed Let's Go Crazy's religious message amid the lyrics about sex and ""purple bananas"" (don't ask).The song is a plea to make the most of life without succumbing to the temptations of the devil - enigmatically characterised as ""de-elevator"" who is trying to ""bring us down"".For those on the path of righteousness, the reward is the afterworld: ""A world of never ending happiness [where] you can always see the sun, day or night.""Prince recorded songs that were more explicitly religious (including a jazz-funk Jehovah's Witness concept album called The Rainbow Children) but he never made faith sound this much fun again.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Muna: Saving the world, one breath at a time	'Solidarity in difference''Second adolescence'	"""If you don't mind, I'm just gonna take a breath.""Muna's lead singer, Katie Gavin, is speaking to a packed audience at London's Village Underground to request a time out.It's not because she's got jet-lag (although she has); or because she's exhausted from leaping around the stage (she is). Instead, she's recognised the looming symptoms of an anxiety attack.Her bandmates Naomi McPherson and Josette Maskin rally around and, for the next 60 seconds, they slowly inhale and exhale under the spotlights. The audience joins in, too, transforming the gig into a sort of mass yoga session.""It felt really good,"" Gavin tells the BBC a day later. ""I'm glad we did it - breathing is something that's helped me with my anxiety around singing.""Her vocal insecurities began when Muna toured their first album, About U, two years ago. Gavin developed ""obsessive thinking,"" fixating on unconscious mechanisms like breathing and swallowing as panic took hold.Relaxation techniques helped her tackle the problem - hence the pause in Monday night's show.""It felt like I was having an out-of-body experience, except the issue is I don't want to be out of my body, I want to be there, and breathing is something that helps me re-centre,"" she explains.McPherson, the band's producer and musical polymath, suggests breathing exercises should henceforth become compulsory at all their gigs.""I think it's hard for everyone to stay in the moment at a rock show, especially now with social media and stuff, because you're filming a lot of it. Taking a breath is like taking a moment to be present,"" she says.""I mean, music is cool, but have you tried breathing?""The band dissolve into laughter. They laugh a lot, especially when the conversation threatens to get too earnest. But they're also in stitches as they discuss cult comedy Derry Girls (McPherson does a terrible impersonation of the accent), and Maskin's morbid fear of zombies.""I absolutely hate them,"" she protests. ""I think about when I used to play tag or hide and seek: When the other kids came to get me, I would freeze. So if the zombies came to get me, I'd be rooted to the ground.""""So you're actually thinking about your own reflexes,"" McPherson teases, ""and that's what scares you the most!""That self-deprecating humour is present in the title of their second album, Muna Saves The World - simultaneously embracing their role as a queer-identifying, politically-progressive band, while recognising the inherent absurdity of that.Gavin's lyrics don't serve up recipes for world peace, either. Instead she navigates weighty topics like addiction, alienation, romantic desolation and cycles of abusive behaviour.""It's called Muna Saves The World but it's really about saving yourself,"" she explains.Released last week, the album has received rave reviews across the board.""Muna's music wonders what pop might sound like if it was made by punks, and what relatability could feel like to people who have always felt different,"" wrote NPR's Catherine Whelan. ""It soars and sinks, questions and answers. Like the band who makes it, the music itself seems to find solidarity in difference.""But the album almost never happened.The band were still students at the University of Southern California in 2014 when they made their debut album - 12 tracks of empathetic, sinuous synth-pop that eventually caught the ear of floral trouser enthusiast Harry Styles.The former One Direction star invited Muna to tour Europe with him, amplifying and echoing their messages of tolerance and queer acceptance at every show.""He's using us as a way of saying something without actually saying it,"" McPherson told the BBC at the time, ""which is actually very smart"".When the tour ended in Milan, Styles gave them Gucci shoes, and they hung around in Italy to take cookery classes before heading back to LA to start their second record. And that's when things started to go wrong.Gavin fell into a long post-tour depression, while her bandmates were forced to move back into Maskin's parents' house. The songs weren't coming together, either. A planned concept album about Joseph Campbell's concept of The Hero's Journey, was eventually abandoned.""It was very emotionally challenging,"" remembers McPherson. ""I cried a lot.""""It was hard, really frickin' hard,"" Maskin agrees. ""There were points when we thought, 'Can we do this at all?'""Eventually, the trio realised they'd rushed into the studio too soon. The first album had changed their lives and they'd formed an inseparable bond but, emotionally, they were the same teenage students who'd recorded About U in McPherson's bedroom. It was time to grow up.""It was like a second adolescence kicking in,"" says McPherson. ""In your mid-20s you have to go through the icky growing pains all over again.""""I think we all had to separate from each other, so we could better understand ourselves and our position in the group,"" adds Maskin.Gavin sums it up best: ""It's like, if you've been in a long-term relationship, eventually you realise that other person can't be the solution to all your problems.""You're like, 'I'm in love but I still hate myself - what's up there? I've got to go and fix that'. So you've still gotta stick up for you, and then show up in the studio with love to give.""Six months in, a break-through. Driving through California, Gavin came up with a fantastically deadpan lyric: ""So I heard the bad news/Nobody likes me and I'm gonna die alone in my bedroom/Looking at strangers on my telephone.""It became the opening verse of Number One Fan, a throbbing, Robyn-esque dance track, that's really about battling those destructive inner voices and loving yourself. It is the story of Muna's crisis of confidence distilled into three minutes.The rest of the album is just as raw. Stayaway finds Gavin locked in her bedroom, avoiding anything - friends, music, drink - that might tempt her back into the arms of an ex (""every moment is a fork in the road and every road leads back to you,"" she sighs).On Taken, she's furious with herself for tempting someone into an affair, then furious with them for agreeing to it - because it reminds her of how her father cheated on her mum: ""I hate you 'cause you're just like him.""The idea of the hero's journey hasn't been completely abandoned, either. Gavin opens the album singing: ""I want to grow up/I want to put away my childish things/I think that I'm ready"". By the closing track, she's reached some sort of resolution.Over six minutes of percolating synths, she documents her life so far - flirting with casual sex and communism, smoking cigarettes, cutting off her hair, having suicidal thoughts, forming and nearly losing a band - before looking in the mirror and declaring: ""It's gonna be ok, baby"".""You cut so close to the bone on this record,"" marvels Maskin.Gavin prefers to recall another piece of feedback, from McPherson's mother: ""This album has a lot less pretence"".""I think about that a lot,"" laughs the singer.""I didn't know there was stuff I was leaving off the page on the first record. Like, I don't think I was necessarily aware of the mask I had on.""I think that's part of your journey as an artist, you're just consistently sloughing off layers. And that was the hope, making this record, that I'd be able to be more honest than I was before.""Will it save the world? Probably not. But Muna's willingness to gouge out those deep, unwanted emotions and insist on self-preservation gives hope to anyone who, like them, has felt alone and aimless.""I'm not the kind of person to believe in fate, but I do believe that some things are supposed to exist,"" says Maskin, ""and I've always felt that way about Muna specifically: Everything we've done, we were supposed to do.""One breath at a time.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Remembrance Sunday: Actors to 'wage peace' in 24-hour theatre marathon	Groundhog Day?	"A non-stop 24-hour performance will see actors including Toby Jones and Miranda Richardson speak the words of 100 peace workers for Remembrance Sunday.24 Hours of Peace has been created from interviews with community and charity workers, ex-Armed Forces personnel, religious leaders and former neo-Nazis.It will be staged at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester from 11:02 GMT on Sunday.The 24 professional actors also include Julie Hesmondhalgh and Liz Carr.Hesmondhalgh is known for Broadchurch and Coronation Street, while Carr stars in Silent Witness. Don Warrington (Death In Paradise), Mina Anwar (The Thin Blue Line), Maggie Steed (EastEnders), Adjoa Andoh (Casualty) and Steffan Rhodri (Gavin & Stacey) will also take part, joined by a 24-strong community ensemble.The marathon show has been put together by Neil Bartlett, former artistic director of the Lyric Hammersmith theatre, who has spent three years interviewing people involved in working towards peace.""I asked them all the simple question - what does this day, when we're supposed to be reflecting on war and peace, what does this day mean to you?""And out of those 100 completely different answers, I've created the text of this show.""Bartlett travelled the UK interviewing figures including Nigel Bromage, who joined the far right at 15 and now helps people who want to leave; three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Scilla Elworthy; Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief negotiator in Northern Ireland; and ""honour"" abuse campaigner Jasvinder Sanghera.He spoke to 16 former members of the Armed Forces; ex-IRA member Patrick Magee and Jo Berry, the daughter of one of his victims; an imam in Rochdale and a priest in Salford; an aid worker with experience in Somalia, South Sudan and Syria; and a community safety officer in Blackpool.His 100 interviewees represent the 100 years since the first Armistice Day.""I've come out of it with hope,"" he says. ""If we want to choose peace - by which I mean reconciliation, de-escalation, negotiation - we already have all the tools and all the expertise in this country.""If we want to know how to start solving the problems we face - whether that's catastrophic rises in hate crime figures to foreign policy questions to disarmament questions - we have the thinking, we have the thinkers, we have a century of experience. There is every reason for hope, if only we would ask the right people.""The performance will begin after Sunday's two minutes' silence. It will be free to watch live, with people invited to pop in during their shopping, on the way back from a night out or on their way to work on Monday. It will also be broadcast live on the radio on Resonance FM.Most of the performers will make a few appearances throughout the 24 hours. Hesmondhalgh, for example, is scheduled for two stints on Sunday evening before doing the 05:30 slot and then returning at 10:00.Bartlett has put himself in for 03:30-04:30. ""I felt if I was going to call on both some of my very distinguished friends in the business, I had to be able to say to them, I'm doing the graveyard shift,"" he says.While his 237,000-word script is all about peace, he says he is not trying to shift the focus of Remembrance Day and the two minutes' silence from the commemoration of those who have died in conflicts.He says he wants to ask whether it is ""meant to be like Groundhog Day, that we always return to the same point"". The silence was ""always conceived of as a hinge moment"", he believes.""Some people say that's why it's two minutes - one minute to look back and one minute to look forward.""Life stops. We reflect. Do we then go back to where we were and pretend those two minutes never happened, or do those two minutes change us in some way?

If you like great pop music, the answer's a resounding, fluorescent ""yes"".The Finnish singer seemingly came out of nowhere last year with the club anthem Chasing Highs - which clocked up more than 100 million streams, and earned her a place on the BBC's Sound of 2018.She's also caught the attention of pop's biggest female voices.Charli XCX is helping produce her debut album, while Dua Lipa invited her to join an all-star Live Lounge performance last week, alongside Charli, Zara Larsson and MØ.""I felt like I was in the Spice Girls,"" laughs Alma.""Those girls have so many great stories for me, because I'm a newcomer.""They're the best teachers for me to conquer the world. Maybe... Some day.""The next step in her quest for global domination arrives on Friday with the release of a mixtape, Heavy Rules, and the new single Dance For Me.Before she takes over the planet, here's everything you need to know about the 21-year-old singer.For reasons that Alma can't quite understand, British fans have started throwing underwear on stage when she plays live.""Is that a UK thing? Like a rock and roll thing?"" she asks.Assured that it's not, she seems bewildered.""Well, there's a couple of fans who do that in the UK. They always throw bras on our stage.""Sadly, the singer hasn't been impressed with the sartorial standard of the garments so far.""They've mainly been cheap ones. We want some designer ones. Gucci.""As a teenager, Alma made the final of Finland's version of The X Factor - but it wasn't the best experience.""It was 50/50, you know?"" says the singer. ""People didn't like me there because I was always trying to do things my own way.Still, the singer made one important ally. Rapper Sini Sabotage was one of the judges, and invited Alma to tour with her after the show ended in 2013.""We were touring Finland and doing teenage stuff and it was very much fun. But after three years, I was like, 'OK, now I need to focus on my own thing' and I started writing more.""Would she recommend the talent show route to other aspiring singers?""I'm not the biggest fan of those programmes,"" she says. ""They're not real. But it helped me to get to know Finnish producers and stuff like this.""""I've always been making music,"" says Alma, ""but I've never, like, gone, 'I want to be a star'.""Writing and singing just made me feel better.""In fact, before auditioning for Idol, she'd never considered that a career in pop was feasible.""In Finland you can't dream about those things because it never happens to anyone,"" she says. ""We don't have any big stars in Finland so it seems unreachable.""So now I feel very grateful every day - just overwhelmed. How did I get here?""""These are vintage, cheap clothes,"" says Alma, indicating her black t-shirt and leather jacket. ""I don't know how to buy expensive stuff.""But it's her neon yellow hair that really makes her stand out. The singer says it was her twin sister Anna (who sings in her band) that convinced her to go day-glo.""She did it first,"" she laughs. ""I was like, 'You can't do it, it's going to be horrible!'""And then she walks out from the bathroom and I'm like, 'Damn! I need to do it also'. I thought it was so cool.""The unconventional colouring also inspired a song, Dye My Hair, in which she tells her partner, ""I will dye my hair blonde for you"".""Someone said, 'Hey, we should write a love song'. And I was like [sharp intake of breath] 'scary'.""I didn't want to write any cheesy lyrics - but we were listening to that Bruno Mars song, 'I would catch a grenade for you,' and I started singing, 'I would dye my hair blonde for you'.It's that idea that, when you're in love and you go crazy, and you'd do anything for someone. But dyeing my hair blonde would be a disaster.""""I think a lot of pop music should be called poop music,"" said Sir Elton after playing Alma's Chasing Highs on his Beats 1 show.""But that is a great pop record, and I love it.""The star's endorsement marked a major turning point for the singer.""That's the point where my mum and dad said, 'OK, now we believe in you',"" she says.""If a legend like Elton John says something like that, it's a big thing.""""She's amazing,"" says Alma of the British singer - who co-wrote her new single, Dance For Me, and directed the video for Phases.""It's hard to find people in this industry who you can really trust - but we can talk about anything. It's like a true friendship.""Charli also gave the singer a piece of sisterly advice when Chasing Highs started to take off.""She said, 'What you're doing with your sister is the most important thing',"" Alma recalls. ""'Even now you're going very fast, and very high up there, and you're going to see those stars - always keep your family close'.""At that time, Chasing Highs was blowing up and I was getting invited to all these parties - so I think it was good advice for me to remember.""You get so busy, you could easily go months without talking to your family and friends and, for me, that's not healthy.""Dance For Me, which is a duet with Lean On singer MØ, was written with Charli XCX and Noonie Bao ""in an over-the-top Air B&B in LA"".""We were planning to have a big house party at the same time as we were writing the track,"" she says, ""so we were all definitely in a party mood"".""As soon as it was finished I knew MØ would be an amazing collaborator, we texted her and she was hyped about the idea.""Despite recording her new single in LA, Alma's insisting that the rest of her album will be made at home in Helsinki.""That was a big thing for me,"" she says. ""I said to my managers, 'I'm going to go home', and I wrote for two weeks in my garage, where I have a studio and where I started everything.""I don't want the whole album to be, 'I'm in a plane and I'm at a cool party'. I want it to be about my friends, what I do in Finland, my local bars and memories. Who I love, who I'm angry with and why I'm sad.""All the stories need to be about me and my culture,"" she adds. ""Because it's a weird culture.""Alma's Heavy Rules mixtape is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Sigrid: Norwegian pop star wins BBC Sound of 2018	BBC Sound of 2018 - the top five1) SIGRID2) REX ORANGE COUNTY3) IAMDDB4) KHALID5) PALE WAVES	"Norwegian pop singer Sigrid has won BBC Music's Sound of 2018, which aims to showcase the most exciting new music for the year ahead.Aged just 21, she is one of the youngest ever artists to receive the honour - beaten only by Adele, who was 19 when she topped the 2008 list.""It's a huge honour,"" she told the BBC. ""I don't know how to explain it.""Influenced by Lorde, Robyn and Joni Mitchell, the star has become known for catchy, quirky and literate pop songs.BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac called her ""literally the perfect pop star"" and ""an absolute pleasure to play on the radio"".The Sound of 2018 list was compiled using votes from 173 DJs, critics and festival bookers.For the first time, this year's panel also included former nominees, including Stormzy, Ellie Goulding, Years & Years frontman Olly Alexander and last year's winner, Ray BLK.The top five was a mixture of British and international, and unsigned and signed acts - all of whom were aged 22 or younger.Emotive singer-songwriter Rex Orange County came second, while urban jazz act IAMDDB was third.Taught to play piano at an early age, Sigrid didn't consider writing her own music until she was 16, when her brother demanded she stopped playing Adele covers. She quickly discovered a talent for indelible pop melodies, switching confidently between fragile ballads and feisty pop bangers.Nineteen-year-old Alex O'Connor is a former chorister and Brit School graduate, whose bedroom productions were inspired by a love of classic songwriters like Stevie Wonder. His heartfelt vocals have been sought out by the likes of Tyler, The Creator and Skepta, who invited him on stage at last year's Mercury Prize.Manchester's Diana DeBrito, aka IAMDDB, fuses reflective, soulful vocals with trap beats and jazz melodies. She dropped her first track just over a year ago, on the same day she quit university after just an hour.Aged just 19, Khalid is already a star in the US, where his debut album American Teen has sold more than a million copies. His emotional, relatable songs are a diary of his high school years, full of love, loss, loneliness and longing.Manchester goth-pop band Pale Waves were formed at university by best friends and musical soulmates Heather Baron-Gracie (vocals, guitars) and Ciara Doran (drums). Championed by The 1975, who took them on tour last year, they describe their sound as ""90s-inspired indie-pop feels, drenched in reverb and glitter"".This year's winner was born Sigrid Solbakk Raabe in Alesund, a harbour town fringed by the mountains of western Norway.The singer said she was amazed to be recognised by an international audience.""I've always thought that, since I'm from a small country, it would be more difficult to get my music across. But I guess streaming opened a lot of boundaries.""She's also tweeted her reaction to winning, saying she was ""speechless"".Sound of 2017 winner Ray BLK passed on her advice to this year's winner.""Winning is just so overwhelming,"" she said. ""Everyone's like, 'You're supposed to be the next Adele, the next Sam Smith', and it makes you think, 'Oh no! What do I do?'""""But my advice would be: Just keep doing what you're doing. Build it your way.""The Sound of... list launched in 2003 and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, including 50 Cent, Haim, Frank Ocean, Ellie Goulding and Florence + The Machine.According to the rules, acts on the longlist should not already be well known - so talent show contestants and members of famous bands launching solo careers are excluded.Nominees could not have had a UK top 10 single or album - although guest vocalists remained eligible.This year's longlist was dominated by pop acts, with Sigrid joined by fellow Scandipop artist Alma and dark pop practitioner Billie Eilish.Other nominees included experimental eight-piece Superorganism, whose members hail from the UK, Japan, Australia and New Zealand; and Hackney-born rapper Not3s, who had a viral hit last year with his single Addison Lee (Peng Ting Called Madison).Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Pop legends plan 'final' tours - but does farewell mean farewell?	Farewell tours that weren't farewell toursSir Elton JohnOzzy OsbourneThe WhoBarbra StreisandMotley CrueCherThe EaglesKissWilko Johnson	"""I've made a decision tonight that this is going to be the last show,"" said Elton John, announcing his retirement from touring. That wasn't him announcing his farewell tour a couple of weeks ago - that was in 1977.Farewell doesn't always mean goodbye, as fans who have been to ""farewell"" gigs by rock and pop legends over the years, only to see their idols later hit the road again, will attest.So what should we make of the string of farewell announcements that have been made in the past couple of weeks - Sir Elton, Paul Simon, Ozzy Osbourne, Neil Diamond, Slayer, Lynyrd Skynyrd?This time it does feel different. The above are advancing in years at what now seems like an indecent rate, leaving them with less time and energy to change their minds again.Sir Elton's Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour will last into 2021, taking him to his 74th birthday. He had a health scare last year.Paul Simon is 76 and said the death of his guitarist Vincent N'Guini in December was a ""contributing factor"" in his decision. Ozzy is 69 and has put his body through years of abuse.Sir Elton, Simon and Ozzy have all said they may continue to play live with one-off shows or single-location residencies after their ""final"" tours.Neil Diamond is 77, and his announcement was not of a farewell tour, but of immediate retirement after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.After years when we took for granted that there would always be a next time, even if the star insisted that wasn't the case, it does feel like we should see the legends of popular culture while we have the chance.He was back on the road barely a year after that 1977 announcement at Wembley, and has played at least 75 concerts per year for each of the last 20 years.A cynic (not me) might also suggest announcing a farewell tour is financially canny. When he played the PPL Centre in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in 2016, the top ticket price was $154. If you want to see him one last time at the same venue this September, you'll pay up to $224.50.The Black Sabbath frontman embarked on the No More Tours Tour in 1992 - followed by the Retirement Sucks Tour in 1995.""I got very antsy,"" he said of the the three-year break. ""I had this habit of going to the refrigerator, opening the door, looking at all the stuff inside and closing it, like, dozens of times a day.""The rock behemoths decided to call it a day in 1982. When they announced their next tour seven years later, guitarist Pete Townshend was still reluctant to admit the Who had got back together.""We did our farewell tour,"" he told the 1989 press conference, straight-faced - to the amusement of the assembled press. ""We said goodbye."" They have said hello again numerous times since.Streisand's four nights in LA and New York in 2000 were supposed to be her swansong, and tickets cost up to $2,500. She was on the road again six years later, with one fan who shelled out the last time threatening to sue her.In November, she told Billboard she ""would never do another show"" - before adding: ""I never say never.""The metal band made it legally binding when they signed a contract preventing them from performing under the name Motley Crue after their swansong on New Year's Eve 2015.""We're calling it a cessation of touring document, which is not a phrase that anybody's used before, because there's never been such a thing as far as I know,"" the band's lawyer Doug Mark said.Cher started her Farewell Tour in 2002, telling fans: ""This truly is it."" It truly wasn't.She jokingly dubbed her Dressed To Kill Tour in 2014 her ""farewell, farewell, farewell tour"". To be fair, she hasn't toured since - she's just done a 70-date residency with dates in both Las Vegas and Washington.The band made a joke of the idea of a farewell tour when they embarked on the Farewell I Tour in 2003.Vocalist Glenn Frey said: ""There is a 'sort of' honesty in calling the tour Farewell I, with its implication that Farewell II will follow soon.""The flamboyant rockers decided to ""put Kiss out of its misery"" with a final tour in 2000. But while on the road, they changed their minds.""The Farewell Tour was to get off the stage with our tails between our legs while we still had some self-respect left,"" Gene Simmons said. ""And it became very clear the fans didn't want us to go.""This is one farewell tour that fans were certainly happy to find was not final. The Dr Feelgood guitarist announced his farewell tour in 2013 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.But after pioneering surgery, he's still going strong.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

""Circumstances meant that I did not make it.""As the crowd chanted her name in support, the star blinked back tears and had to compose herself before continuing.""I wished things were different - but life is what it is,"" she said. ""We're all here in this moment.""The set was broadcast on BBC One later that day, and new figures from the BBC reveal it was viewers' most-popular Glastonbury performance to date.The previous record-holder was Ed Sheeran, whose headline slot on BBC Two attracted an average audience of 3.1m in 2017.A year earlier, the programme featuring Adele's Pyramid Stage performance was watched by 2m people, rising to 3.7m during her set.This year's Glastonbury saw a significant shift in viewership, with audiences increasingly choosing to catch up with performances online.The total number of online requests, including YouTube views, iPlayer requests and live streams, reached 37.5m - an increase of 86% from 2017 (Glastonbury took a year off in 2018).However, TV viewership was down - from 23m in 2017 to 21.1m this year; although that figure is still the second-highest on record.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

He was 27 years old.Police told the BBC Korean Service that suicide will be investigated as a possibility.Emergency services were alerted by the singer's sister and he was later pronounced dead at hospital.The AFP news agency said his sister raised the alarm after receiving a number of text messages from her brother, including one saying ""this is my last farewell"".Jonghyun shot to fame when the band was formed by K-Pop hit factory SM Entertainment in 2008.As well as being a singer and an accomplished dancer, he played a large part in the group's songwriting and production, and launched a successful solo career in 2015.He has also made headlines for voicing his opinion on issues like the government's education policy and for speaking out in support of LGBT rights.Shocked fans have been paying tribute on Twitter.SHINee's dance-pop has also been big outside South Korea. The group have recorded a string of Japanese-language albums and sold out the 55,000-seat Tokyo Dome.In the UK, Odeon's website crashed a minute after tickets became available for their appearance at the Korean Film Festival in London in 2011, and they played their first North American tour earlier this year.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Now computers are writing perfectly acceptable pop songs	Musicians' fears'The message was human'	"""Ugh,"" my dad used to grunt when I switched on Radio 1 . ""This music sounds like it was written by a computer"".It's a criticism that's been levelled at synthpop for years. But what if it was true?Taryn Southern, a YouTube star and content creator, has just released a song she wrote with the help of artificial intelligence.Called Break Free, it's a brooding ballad that wouldn't sound out of place on the Hunger Games soundtrack.Southern wrote the lyrics and melody, but the backing track was built by her laptop, after she punched in a number of settings for the song's mood, tempo and instrumentation.""My new collaborator is not human,"" she grins. ""It's an AI algorithm"".As a YouTuber, Southern is used to adapting new technology, and her interest in AI was sparked by an article on The Verge, describing how programmers at Sony had fed the Beatles' back catalogue into a computer and urged it to write a new Lennon-McCartney track.The result may have been hilariously naff, but it prompted the headline: ""This AI-written pop song is almost certainly a dire warning for humanity.""Southern was less sceptical.""I'm a naturally curious person,"" she says. ""So I did some research.""Last January, she started downloading open-source programmes which promised to write songs from scratch.""Most of these algorithms work by ingesting a large amount of data from a certain genre, so the AI can learn the 'rules',"" she explains.""What chord structures are most common, that sort of thing.""Pulling out her laptop, she fires up one of the programmes. We ask it to write a Reggae song, using Scott Joplin's The Entertainer as inspiration.The result is… well, as terrible as the description sounds. But there's a recognisable bounce to the bassline, and a distinct progression from intro to verse to chorus.Southern admits it takes a lot of tinkering to get a decent song out of the software.""It requires a fair amount of human collaboration. You can't just press a button and create magic.""Indeed, she's been collaborating with companies who make the software - including a startup called Amper Music, IBM's Watson, platform and Google's Magenta - helping them improve, and even ""hacking"" the composing tools herself.Less than a year since she started, Southern has an EP of songs ready for release; and plans to have an album - I Am AI - available next year.""There are some awesome new toys coming out that I really wanted to include,"" she says.Earlier this week, Southern performed Break Free live for the first time at the WebSummit in Lisbon, Portugal.It received an enthusiastic welcome from the audience of tech-heads and coders. But what have other musicians made of her experiments with AI?""It's totally split down the middle,"" she says.""Half of them have been very interested in learning about it; while other ones have said, 'Why are we playing around with this stuff. It's going to be take our jobs.'""Unsurprisingly, Southern isn't swayed by that argument. She says AI is ""just a tool"" like a drum machine or synthesizer.""The reality is that humans adapt. It's the tools that become irrelevant.""""It's the heart that makes the music,"" she insists, directing me to a video on her YouTube channel called Voices In My Head.""On that video, the music was created by artificial intelligence. But the message was human - and a deeply personal one at that.""""I think people will find a way to embrace it. It's inevitable.""But she does foresee legal issues over who owns the songs created by AI.""With my song Break Free, I actually gave Amper, who made the AI, some of the back-end royalties. I felt that was appropriate.""They composed the song, it's just there was a heavy amount of arrangement afterwards.""So these questions are coming up and I'm doing my best to figure it out in a way that is favourable to artists.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Madonna: 'I want to reinvent pop tours'		"Twenty-seven years ago, Madonna set the template for modern pop concerts with her Blond Ambition world tour.From its hydraulic stage to Jean-Paul Gaultier's iconic costumes, it raised the bar for stadium-sized spectacle.Now, after seven huge world tours, the star tells the BBC she's ""exploring"" a smaller-scale show in the future.""I've done so many shows - world tours, stadiums, sports arenas, you name it - that I feel like I have to reinvent that now too,"" she explains.""I like doing intimate shows and being able to talk directly to the audience.""This is something I'm exploring right now: the idea of doing a show that doesn't travel the world, but stays in one place and utilises not only humour and the music in a more intimate setting but other people's music, as well, and other entertainment.""Kind of a revolving door of amazing, gifted, unique talent - dancers, musicians, singers, comedians, me, humour. I don't know! Like, I'm trying to come up with all those ideas now.""The concerts will presumably owe much to the vaudeville-style Tears of a Clown show that Madonna performed twice in 2016 - once as a gift to fans in Australia, and again at a fundraiser for her Raising Malawi charity.The low-key gigs featured the pop icon dressed as a clown, riding a tricycle, chatting to the audience and telling jokes when not performing stripped-back renditions of some of her favourite songs.Footage of the Australian concert appears on the star's new DVD, released on Friday, which documents her 2015-16 Rebel Heart Tour.In an exclusive interview with BBC News, she talked about touring life, changing attitudes to sex, and her recent dispute with a courier company...Before we start, there's one thing I need to know: Did your FedEx package ever arrive?Ha ha! Yes, it has. FedEx is blaming customs, customs is blaming FedEx and we'll never know what happened. But I have it now.So, I saw the Rebel Heart tour when you were in London and the DVD does a really good job of capturing what it was like to be in the audience. How do you go about that?I was there every step of the way, every day for months and months. It's really hard to capture the true feeling of the excitement and the passion and the heat and the blood, sweat and tears. I'm pleased with the way it came out.There's a particularly touching sequence during True Blue, where everybody in the audience embraces each other.I know, it's a very sweet, emotional moment in the show. I didn't expect it to be, but when I look back at the DVD it almost brings a tear to my eye because everyone seems so in love.How do you put a show like this together? Where do you get the ideas?Everything's based around my song choice. So first, I go through my catalogue of songs with my band and I start working on things that excite me and inspire me in the moment. Some songs I'm sick of doing and I don't want to do them. Other songs I say, ""No, I did that on the last tour, I don't want to do it again.""So I try to rotate things and I also try to reflect my current mood and what I've been feeling, and what's been inspiring me artistically or filmically, politically, philosophically. I try to put songs together in groups that have thematic connection, and then I try to tell a story. And then I do the visuals. It's quite a process.What are the songs you don't want to do again?Well, I tend to not want to do the songs I did on the tour before. That's what I mean. So if I did Material Girl on the tour before, or Express Yourself on the tour before, then I'll say, ""OK, I did that for 88 shows. I can't do it again.""How do you keep a healthy balance between new songs and your back catalogue?It's just playing in rehearsal. It's really hard for me, especially with my older songs, to do them with the original arrangement. Because 33 years later, after doing it for so long, you just have to reinvent things. Well, I do.And it's fun for me to take an '80s pop song and turn it into a salsa song, or turn it into a samba, or make an uptempo song into a ballad.The overarching theme of the tour was being a rebel. In the intro you say, ""when fascist dictators come for you dressed as righteous men"" you have to rise up and take a stand.If you were doing the tour against the current political backdrop, would that message feel more relevant?Yeah, I created that voiceover for my short film Secret Project,. I feel like it was a foreshadowing of things to come, like a prophecy.You felt something in the air?I did then - and I think people all thought I was being a little bit dramatic and extreme, but I felt like I was witnessing the beginning of it on the tour previous [to Rebel Heart]. And, of course, look what's happening in the world right now. It's pretty crazy.Twenty-seven years ago, the Pope tried to get one of your shows banned. Now you have pole-dancing nuns and nobody bats an eyelid. Is that progress?Is it progress? Well, I guess in some ways you could call that progress. When I released my Sex book, the idea of someone being scantily-clad on the street was an outrage. But look at social media today and it's nothing.People get used to things, but I wouldn't call that progress. What I think of as progress is people becoming more open-minded, and people understanding the difference between art and exploitation.When I was banned by the Pope, I was playing with the ideas of religion and sexuality, which are usually kept completely apart. Sex is considered a sin in the Catholic church. And I was questioning that and challenging that point of view because I don't, obviously, agree with it.So now that no one's batting an eyelash about nuns on the stripper poles, it doesn't mean that the Vatican or the Catholic church is soul-searching or investigating whether they made the right choices. I don't think people are thinking that maybe sexuality and God don't need to be separate. That, to me, would be progress.The DVD also includes the Tears of a Clown show you did in Melbourne. Was that a one-off or a trial run for a different type of Madonna concert?I like doing intimate shows and being able to talk directly to the audience; to play with them and use humour and pathos and truth, and share my life - and also make up stories. I like the freedom of it and I like the intimacy of it, and I would like to explore doing it more in the future.Maybe a residency?Yeah, a residency. If I look back at the Rebel Heart tour, my favourite [part] was really the last section where I got to just sit on the stage and play my ukulele and sing La Vie en Rose and talk to the audience. [It was] just more intimate. More audience participation and connecting to human beings - I feel I'm craving that more and more.Did it feel like there was more room for improvisation in that section?Yeah, I have freedom and I can make mistakes. That's another thing I do in Tears of a Clown - if I start a song off wrong and I make a boo-boo, I just turn around and go ""Stop! Let's start again!""When you're doing a sports arena show, you're linked up to video, you can't stop. Once the train leaves the station, you have to keep going.There's a certain kind of adrenalin rush to that - but there's no room for error. So I like the idea of mistakes and freestyling. Free-falling, really. It's more exciting to me right now.Madonna: Rebel Heart Tour is out now on DVD, CD and Blu-Ray and via digital retailers.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Seven great songs inspired by pop feuds	1) Lynyrd Skynyrd v Neil Young - Sweet Home Alabama2) Destiny's Child v Destiny's Child - Survivor3) Prince v his bodyguard - Old Friends 4 Sale4) Maria McKee v Benmont Tench via Feargal Sharkey - A Good Heart & You Little Thief5) Pete Doherty v Carl Barat - You Can't Stand Me Now6) Mariah Carey v Eminem - Obsessed7) Robbie Williams v Take That - No Regrets	"Taylor Swift has stormed the charts with her comeback single, Look What You Made Me Do, breaking several streaming records in the process.As you'll no doubt be aware, the lyrics concern her long and tedious feud with Kanye West, which began when the rapper rushed on stage during Swift's acceptance speech at the MTV Awards.The song comes hot on the heels of Katy Perry's Swish Swish, allegedly about her own beef with Team Taylor and itself a riposte to Swift's song Bad Blood.None of these songs, it has to be said, are among their authors' best work - which got me wondering whether pop feuds had ever resulted in noteworthy songs.I put the question to Twitter last week, and instantly received dozens of brilliant replies. So here are seven of the best verses with vendettas.In his youth, Neil Young had a very dim view of the American South. He wrote two songs - Southern Man and Alabama - which criticised white citizens for building their wealth on the back of slave labour, asking: ""When will you pay them back?""Lynyrd Skynyrd singer Ronnie Van Zant was incensed. ""We thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two,"" he said, pointing out that many people had opposed racism and segregation.His riposte came in Sweet Home Alabama, where he sang: ""Well, I hope Neil Young will remember / A Southern Man don't need him around.""The song became a huge hit, and even Young loved it.""Alabama richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me in their greatest song,"" he wrote in his 2012 memoir. ""I don't like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue.""When girl group Destiny's Child lost three members in quick succession, commentators compared the band to the rotating cast of US reality show Survivor.That prompted Beyonce into the studio, where she penned a strident anthem to empowerment and resilience.""Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better,"" she castigated her former bandmates. ""You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million.""Survivor won a Grammy, but two of those former bandmates, Letoya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson, sued Destiny's Child over the lyrics, contending they made derisive comments about them, in violation of a previous settlement which prevented either party from making ""any public comment of a disparaging nature concerning one another"".The case was eventually dropped - and Beyonce went on to become Beyonce.Written as a response to the turmoil in his personal life after the mania surrounding Purple Rain, Old Friends 4 Sale was one of the most scathing songs Prince ever composed.It was triggered, in part, by the betrayal of his trusted bodyguard ""Big"" Chick Huntsberry (above left), who sold a fictitious story about Prince to the National Enquirer, allegedly to fund his cocaine habit.Prince also takes aim at two former friends ""who got stuck in the snow"" - another cocaine reference - before concluding: ""Some things are better left unsaid / And some people are better left untrusted.""It's a mournful, sombre song, unlike almost anything else in Prince's back catalogue - but it was either too personal or too painful to be released. Prince sat on it until 1991, at which point he re-recorded the vocals, neutering the most caustic lyrics out of sympathy for Huntsberry, who had died a year earlier.Sadly, that inferior version is the only one that's been officially released, appearing on the 1999 compilation The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale.My original plan was to exclude break-up songs from this list - otherwise the entire thing would be the tracklisting for Fleetwood Mac's Rumours - but Feargal Sharkey's story is too good not to tell (thanks to Penny Andrews for bringing it to my attention).A Good Heart was a number one single for the former Undertones frontman in 1985, but it was written by Maria ""Show Me Heaven"" McKee about the end of her relationship with Benmont Tench, the keyboard player in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.As break-up songs go, it's fairly anodyne - but it prompted a furious response from Tench, who dashed off a red ink reply and sent it to Sharkey.Called You Little Thief, it contains one of the coldest lyrics in pop: ""You little dream / You little nightmare / You little nothing / You little girl"".The poison darts keep coming for a full five minutes, until Tench rounds off his rant with the devastating couplet: ""There's no hard feelings / There's no feelings at all.""Sharkey released You Little Thief as his next single, and placed the tracks side-by-side on his album - effectively becoming the mouthpiece for this lovers' quarrel.Interestingly, Tench recently denied writing You Little Thief about McKee, rewriting this slice of pop history.Perhaps The Libertines' best song, You Can't Stand Me Now was written in a two-star Parisian hotel, just after Pete Doherty was released from prison for burgling guitarist Carl Barat's flat.The lyrics are a thinly veiled account of their love/hate relationship, with references to Doherty's heroin addiction and his ""light fingers"".The first verse finds them apportioning blame. ""You twist and tore our love apart,"" accuses Barat, ""You know you've got it the wrong way round,"" retorts Doherty, reprimanding his bandmate for getting him locked up. By the chorus, they're trading the line ""You can't stand me now"".Although the song is shot through with affection, the relationship couldn't withstand Doherty's addictions, and the Libertines split six months later.""Mariah, what ever happened to us, why did we have to break up?"" rapped Eminem on his 2009 track Bagpipes From Baghdad.Mariah's response? ""You're delusional, boy, you're losing your mind"".The pair had allegedly dated for six months in 2001, with Eminem referencing their dalliance in several of his later songs. Mariah always denied the relationship, telling Maxim she'd ""hung out"" with Eminem ""a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody"".So when he continued to write about Mariah, she snapped.""Why you so obsessed with me?"" she sang in a barely disguised tirade. ""Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows / It's clear that you're upset with me.""Then came the sucker punch: ""Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress.""Robbie's departure from Take That was notoriously rocky. They issued him an ultimatum - ""clean up your act or quit the band"" - and he called their bluff by quitting to become the UK's biggest pop star.But he still harboured a long-standing grudge against Gary Barlow, saying in 2010: ""I wanted to crush him. I wanted to crush the memory of the band - and I didn't let go.""The anger spilled out on No Regrets, the second single from Williams' second solo album, I've Been Expecting You.The backing vocals (performed by Neil Tennant) recount his bandmates' criticisms - from the banal ""we've been told you stay up late"", to the cruel, ""you're too short to carry weight"".""I don't want to hate but that's all you've left me with,"" Robbie seethes, before declaring: ""I guess the love we had is officially dead"".They've patched things up since - even performing the song together on Take That's 2011 Progress tour. When Robbie sings it now, the closing lyric is rewritten to say: ""The love we have is officially alive.""Taylor Swift, take note.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Chvrches: How singer Lauren Mayberry became 'the punk rock Joan of Arc of pop'	Vulnerable	"""Sometimes I look at my lyrics and I think, 'Are you all right?'""Lauren Mayberry is still taken aback by the emotions that poured from her pen as she wrote Chvrches' third album, Love Is Dead.As the title suggests, the record deals with a gut-punching heartbreak - but it gives equal consideration to the hate and divisiveness that have dominated politics since the band last released new material.""We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies,"" Mayberry sings anxiously on the pre-apocalyptic single Miracle. ""Where does all the good go?""The singer's ""frustration and confusion"" at the state of the world was only exacerbated by the band's recent relocation to the US.""It made us go in on ourselves even more, being in that somewhat hostile atmosphere,"" says her bandmate Martin Doherty.""I don't know,"" says Mayberry. ""I think I'd feel pretty pessimistic if I was living in pre-Brexit Britain, too, to be honest.""But it's a typically Glaswegian thing to do, to feel the most misanthropic and macabre when you're in the sunniest place on earth.""The band's decision to live in New York and record in LA surprised many fans because, ever since they emerged in as pop's premier synth band in 2012, Chvrches have refused to play by the music industry rule-book.Mayberry challenged misogyny and abusive trolls long before the #MeToo movement caught fire, while the trio insisted on making their first two albums in the basement of synth player Iain Cook's house in Glasgow.""We were incredibly against any idea of outside collaboration whilst we were forming our identity,"" says Doherty.But with the band established in the charts and on festival line-ups, Cook felt they'd done enough to build ""a protective armour around that core"".The time had come to see what other writers and producers could bring to the band. But it did not go well.""We did one session where we were bouncing ideas around,"" recalls Mayberry. ""A couple of well-known producers came in and kind of sprinkled a chorus on, and then they just left.""I thought they'd just gone round the corner to get a bacon butty, but no, they'd gone. Like. 'Boof! There's your chorus. Goodbye'. That song did not make it any further.""Other collaborators tried to steer the band away from their indie instincts.""They were like, 'Well, it's top 40 time, isn't it? Let's go!' But that was never us, really,"" Doherty says.More productive were sessions with Eurythmics star Dave Stewart.""Talk about going to the source,"" marvels Doherty. ""I don't want to say we've ripped him off, but I'm extremely influenced by him.""Although the songs Stewart produced didn't make the album, his unconventional techniques had a profound impact.""Every evening he does Martini hour,"" says Mayberry. ""And one night, out of nowhere, he just turned around and said, 'You know, I think that you want to be this punk rock Joan of Arc of pop music - so why don't you just stop complaining and do it already?'""I was shocked and mildly offended at first. But I kept thinking about it in the taxi on the way home.""I thought, 'I don't know if I feel like that, but if he can see it in me, I should probably think about it.'""That definitely unlocked something in her lyrically,"" observes Doherty. ""He ignited a fire and helped us find a type of creative ambition that was maybe missing in the past.""With the band on a creative roll, they hooked up with Greg Kurstin - the producer behind Sia's Chandelier and co-writer of Adele's Hello.They instantly felt a connection, not least because his studio was a dingy basement of ""wall-to-wall keyboards"" and a constant ""buzz and hum of electronics"".Mayberry says: ""The special thing about Greg is he's still a musician himself. He always wants to play and experiment. He doesn't come in thinking, 'I'm this guy who made this record and I have this many Grammys.'"" [Five, to be exact].Within a week, the band had recorded four songs. Impressed, they cancelled their other plans and decided to work solely with Kurstin, who captured Mayberry's soaring soprano on the same microphone he'd recently used for Adele, Dave Grohl and Paul McCartney.""Everybody's like, 'Oh, it must be very intimidating to work with Greg on vocals,'"" says the singer. ""But he's not thinking about technical ability, he's looking for personality.""Adele's an insanely amazing singer - but it's those rasps and cracks that give her songs such character. And ultimately, music's all about communication, isn't it?""If you take all the character out of it, and you take all of the humanity out of it, it's much harder to get emotion across.""Love Is Dead is littered with emotions - loss, pain, confusion, anger and hope.On Graves, Mayberry references Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose tiny body was found on a Turkish tourist beach after his family's attempt to reach Europe by sea went tragically wrong.""They're leaving bodies in stairwells and washing up on the shores,"" she sings, before resolving: ""You can look away while they're dancing on our graves/But I will stop at nothing.""Some of the album's more personal songs (notably the stark, grief-stricken Really Gone) made Mayberry nervous about revealing herself in public.""A small part of you is like, 'Do I really want to do that in front of people? Maybe I should score it all out and write something that's a little bit more vague,""' she says.""But as a writer, if you're not actually exploring things and being honest, then what are you doing?""I think, sometimes, being vulnerable is harder than coming out swinging.""Still, the singer's not afraid to come out swinging when it matters. Reflecting on the #MeToo movement, she's sceptical that much has changed.""It's great that people are waking up and having that conversation, but it has to be more than a symbolic gesture,"" she says.""Yes, it's great that you kicked Harvey Weinstein out of the Academy but Roman Polanski's still in there, Woody Allen's still in there, Bill Cosby's still in there.""People wear white roses at the Grammy Awards to show they stand with these things - but then you look at the show, and you look at the content of it, and you look at the people in the room, and you're like, 'Oh, nothing has changed.'""And Mayberry knows the perils of confronting the darker side of the internet. In 2013, she published a searing column for the Guardian about the abuse that female musicians face on the internet - and received even more vitriol as a result.When she subsequently appeared in a video wearing a dress, the singer was branded a ""hypocrite"", a ""slut"" and a ""bitch"".""Looking back on it now, a lot of it was frustrating and it made me really angry and made me feel really lonely,"" she says.""And there were definitely points where... Not where I didn't want to do this any more, but I was like, 'If this is what it's going to be like all the time, I don't really know if I want to be that guy forever.'""Thankfully, Mayberry is made of stern stuff. She's not about to let trolls define her any more than the existential crisis that prompted Chvrches' new album.In fact, what's really occupying her mind right now is the celebratory curry she'll be sharing with her bandmates tonight, as a reward for finishing a tough week of promo. That prompts her to consider the really important questions.""We always get a wee shared black dhal and I'll probably stick to a prawn dish,"" she says.""And sometimes I will hover over a potato and then I'll think, 'Do I really want tatties in my curry?'""I don't know! Maybe I do!""Chvrches' new album, Love Is Dead, will be released on 25 May. They play Radio 1's Biggest Weekend in Swansea the following day.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Taylor Swift's Lover: Star turns a corner with 'upbeat' but 'baggy' album	Four key lines from Lover	"Taylor Swift's seventh album Lover is ""unapologetically bubblegum"", a ""towering work"" that shows her ""at her most liberated"" - but is ""too long"".That's according to the first reviews after the album's release on Friday.The 18-track opus is ""one big pop bubblegum blast"" and is ""her most mature collection as well as her most fun one"", according to Variety.But ""not even Taylor Swift... can muster enough knockout tunes to fill 18 tracks"", wrote The Guardian's critic.While the highly-anticipated album offers evidence that Swift is ""a better songwriter than any of her competitors in the upper echelons of pop"", Alexis Petridis wrote that it's padded out with ""lightweight"" songs.Its ""something-for-everyone approach feels like consolidation, not progress"", he declared, while Rolling Stone's Nick Catucci said it is ""evolutionary rather than revolutionary"".He continued: ""But nevertheless it feels like an epiphany: free and unhurried, governed by no one concept or outlook, it represents Swift at her most liberated, enjoying a bit of the freedom she won for her cohort.""As ever with Taylor Swift, there's a lot in the lyrics to decipher and decode.In the liner notes, Swift wrote that ""the album is a love letter to love itself - all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening, devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it (that's why there are so many songs)"".The Guardian's Petridis wrote: ""Lover's highlights come when Swift ignores the outside world, whether that's politics, public image or the desire to reassert her pop dominance.""It is ""easily her most upbeat and romantically smitten album"", according to Variety's Chris Willman. ""As she narrows in on 30, Swift is looking to prove that love is something she does even better than revenge.""Billboard's Jason Lipshutz said: ""It is a towering work that's worth both close analysis on headphones and scream-alongs on stadium speakers.""As a reflection of what Taylor Swift loves, Lover is whimsical, moving, imperfect, exhilarating. It's a detailed snapshot that will endure.""And it sees her make a return to ""technicolor with an album filled with big-hearted love songs and diary-honest lyrics"", according to Time magazine's Dana Schwartz.USA Today's Maeve McDermott said it sounded like Swift was ""clearly having more fun on Lover than we've seen in ages"".But with its 18 tracks, she said ""a more cynical listener"" may rank it alongside ""the heap of supersized rap and pop releases released over the past few years, stuffed with filler, that have dominated streaming and inflated artists' sales numbers"".In The Independent, critic Alexandra Pollard judged it to be ""a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound"".But she too took issue with the length. ""At around track 14, Lover starts to feel baggy,"" she wrote. ""There is a brilliant album among the 18 songs, if only it had been pruned a little.""On Thursday, the singer said she intends to record new versions of her hit songs after her back catalogue was bought by pop manager Scooter Braun.After the album's release, Braun took to Twitter in an attempt to smooth over relations with the superstar.And Lover was an immediate hit with Swift fans.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	The KLF: Pop's saboteurs return after 23 years	1. Abba vs The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu2. The chart manual3. The great Brit Awards massacre4. The £1m bonfire	"On 23 August 1994, The KLF - one of Britain's most incendiary bands, in more ways than one - burned £1m on a remote Scottish island.They then vowed to put their careers on hold for 23 years.That time is now up.So at 23 seconds past midnight on Wednesday they made their comeback at a book launch in Liverpool.The duo were greeted by 500 fans as they arrived at the News From Nowhere book shop in an ice cream van that played their hit What Time Is Love? and O Sole Mio.That marked the start of a three-day festival of talks, performance and live art, which will continue on Wednesday with a debate on the topic ""Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?""However, fans have been told that The KLF's Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond will not be performing any music.Their new novel 2023, described as ""a utopian costume drama set in the near future written in the recent past"", is due to be performed in full in the city on Thursday.The event will finish on Friday with a ""Graduation Ball"" headlined by a hitherto unknown artist named Badger Kull, who is billed as having just one three-minute song, titled Toxteth Day of the Dead.The KLF - who also went by names including The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The K Foundation and The Timelords - had hits like 3AM Eternal, Last Train to Trancentral and What Time Is Love? in the late 1980s and early '90s.As well as their electrifying pop-trance hits, Cauty and Drummond became known for sabotaging their own success and subverting the music business in a serious of infamous stunts.Here are four of them:The duo were ordered to destroy all copies of their 1987 debut album after a complaint from Abba, who objected to the unauthorised sampling of Dancing Queen.Cauty and Drummond travelled to Sweden to try to track Abba down in person. But they failed, so they presented the gold disc they had brought with them to a Swedish prostitute instead.As you do.They burned some of the LPs in a field before throwing the rest overboard from the ferry on the way home.The album was eventually released with large stretches of silence where the samples had been.After getting to number one as The Timelords with Doctor Who theme rip-off Doctorin' the Tardis (fronted by Gary Glitter), they published a book called The Manual (How To Have A Number One The Easy Way) with instructions about how to top the charts.Austrian Eurotrash band Edelweiss followed their advice and sold five million records.When The KLF won best British group at the 1992 Brit Awards, they made their disdain for the music industry clear by performing 3AM Eternal with death metal group Extreme Noise Terror.The appearance ended with Drummond firing blanks from a machine gun into the stunned audience before an announcer said: ""The KLF have left the music business.""Not satisfied with that, they dumped a dead sheep on the steps of the after-show party with a note reading ""I died for you"", and deleted their back catalogue.After their resignation from the music industry, they rejected everything that had gone before in the most extreme way in 1994 - taking the £1m they had left in royalties to the island of Jura and burning bundles of £50 notes.That led to howls of protests from those who said it should have gone to a worthy cause.Despite saying they wouldn't talk about it, they actually have. ""There's plenty of people who want to give money to charity,"" Cauty told Irish TV. ""We want to do something that we found more interesting with the money.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Noel Gallagher on 'cosmic pop', Liam and The Scissor Queen		"As the title of his incoming third solo album, Who Built The Moon?, suggests, all is not as it once appeared on planet Noel.After nearly 25 years rattling out earth-friendly, chart-topping hits, suddenly the atmosphere has changed. The Noel-axis has tilted and the recording studio controls have been set for the heart of the sun.A ""spirit of adventure"" (as the former Oasis guitarist puts it) imbued from inside the lair of Belfast producer David Holmes, races right through his first truly risky record and walks slowly down the hall of his Sour Mash Records office too.Even the album's press release is a right gas.""Noel's musical evolution has gone from upright but hairy ape-man to sonically advanced, electronic, space jazz future-man with little shiny silver booties on,"" it reads.""Who built the moon? Noel Gallagher did, and everyone else can just reach for it.""Perhaps the most surprising thing about the accompanying biography of ""Noel Edward Montague Gallagher...the boy from Burnley"", signed ""Sir Rupert Bashford-Tillermouth, 29 August 2019"" (all fictional, obviously), is that it arrives via email and not on the back of a technicoloured unicorn.""I love that press release!"" laughs Noel, taking his seat in a deserted swanky Covent Garden, London restaurant.What on earth is going on here? Is this the same bloke who wrote Wonderwall?""I'd describe it as cosmic pop"" he declares, proudly.""It's not really that far out, it's just...it's different. It's just like me in more colourful clothes.""Not like the clothes I'm wearing today, obviously,"" jokes the 50-year-old, dressed head to toe in Johnny Cash black.More like this...He goes on: ""My last record [2015's Chasing Yesterday] - I wrote it, produced it and took it around the world. Did all the artwork.""After doing that and being on the road with it for two years you have real definite sense of who you are as a musician and as a person and it was time to just put a full stop at that and say, 'OK well that's it now.'""What on earth I've got left to prove by doing that? I don't know.""Then, by chance, I met David and he opened up a spirit of adventure in me and we went on a trip. It came out like this.""Father of three Noel marked his 50th birthday this summer with a Narcos-themed, celebrity-packed shindig, in between ""smashing it"" on tour with U2 and re-opening the Manchester Arena - in the wake of the attack that resulted in Don't Look Back In Anger becoming an ""anthem for defiance"".Now, like a musical Benjamin Button, the man who once said hip-hop had no place at Glastonbury seems more open to exploration and experimentation than ever before - give or take the odd cameo with The Chemical Brothers and a handful of psychedelic Oasis and solo tracks.As well as writing in the studio for the first time, sampling tin whistles and singing in his highest register to date, the new record also sees Noel include (shock horror) girls in his band.The latest incarnation of his High Flying Birds includes ""a French bird in a cape"" Charlotte Marionneau, aka Le Volume Courbe. But you might know her better as ""The Scissor Queen"".The TV performance, which saw her standing behind Noel, using scissors as a percussion instrument, cut so sharply across social media that his estranged brother Liam mockingly called out for somebody to play a potato peeler at one of his gigs.Naturally, somebody obliged.New psych Noel, however, will not be moved.""Charlotte is..."" he declares, staring off into space for both thought and effect.""She's heroic. And she means it, and she brings to the band... cutting edge percussion.""""I was in Manchester the other night,"" he grins, ""I'm going out with my friends and we're in a car going up towards King Street and the car stops at the traffic lights.""I was in the front seat and the car got surrounded by a load of geezers going [chants] 'SCISSORS! SCISSORS!'""So I don't care about the reaction. She's in the band and that's the end of it.""Charlotte, however, doesn't just play the scissors.She also grabs a mega-phone to alert the listener (en Francais) to the fact that it's NOT a Beautiful World, in the middle of Noel's dreamy/satirical new single of the same name.Or at least Noel thinks she does...""I don't speak French"" he says, with a Gallic shrug. ""The French gigs are gonna be amazing... and a couple in Canada. Apart from that everyone else will be baffled!""Aside from the French psych-pop vibes of lead single Holy Mountain, Noel's Moon is built using elements of electro, soul, rock 'n' roll and disco, plus imaginary film scores.The whole structure stands on the foundations of the largely instrumental Kanye West/Chemical Brothers-inspired opener Fort Knox, which features ticking clocks and another French-speaking newcomer; Audrey Gbaguidi, who performs a spine-tingling improvised wordless chant. Like an afro-beat version of Clare Torry's vocals on Pink Floyd's Great Gig In The Sky.The Blondie-influenced She Taught Me To Fly provides another highlight but anyone holding out for a melancholic minor chord acoustic ballad, copyrighted by Noel in the mid 90s, will have to wait until bonus track Dead In The Water.Now with a live UK tour on the way next year, how exactly will Noel and his new gang - which includes former Oasis members Gem Archer and Chris Sharrock - give crowds the highly-produced Moon on a stick?""You're never going to get it to sound exactly like the record"" he says. ""You're just trying to get a representation of it on the night,""""But we're very good at what we do. I can already tell they're gonna come across great live.""The only thing exciting Noel more than playing these 'cosmic' songs live is the ""cosmic football"" being played by his high flying football team Manchester City.Fellow City fan Johnny Marr of Smiths fame plays guitar and harmonica on If Love is the Law, while Paul Weller jams along (pun intended) on the organ on the aforementioned Holy Mountain.Another big Blue, Liam, scored a number one album himself earlier this season, though his match-winning effort is a good old-fashioned volley of rock 'n' roll.""Is it?"" snaps Noel, unsettled at the first mere mention of the L word.""I guess I'm here doing my thing... I guess he's out there [points out window] also doing my thing, and you know - never the twain shall meet.""And he's promoting my record... And I'm promoting my record, and I thank him for that. And you know, what can I say?""Noel told Radio 4's Front Row that he'll ""never walk the stage with Oasis again"", due to the behaviour of his brother and others on social media.Gallagher Snr's new direction will divide the fans and critics, who possess the power to send his album sales into orbit or not. Some will wanna be a spaceman with him more than others.However in shooting for the moon, even if he misses, Noel is certain to land among the stars.""There's not a great deal that I strive for - except greatness, d'ya know what I mean?"" he ponders.""And not many of us get there. But the water's good when you get there. It's nice and warm.""I take each day as it comes and live in the moment.""But my story is only in the middle bit yet. Maybe when I get to the end I might walk around my shed in a smoking jacket dictating to my butler: 'Tell them about the time I invented the Scissor Queen!'""Who Built the Moon? is out on 24 November.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

""Well, my wife has... I don't really like it.""I don't trust anyone who has a tidy studio, do you know what I mean? Sometimes you go in and you feel like you're messing the place up just by being there.""This is definitively not the case in Astley Towers™, a generously proportioned family home in the leafy suburbs of Surrey.The singer immediately makes us feel at home, throwing open the front door as we pull up on the driveway and welcoming us inside.Barefoot and be-quiffed, he beckons us into the kitchen for a freshly-brewed cuppa, demonstrating skills that must have made him invaluable Stock Aitken and Waterman's tea boy back in the 80s. We are even presented with a choice of mugs to complement the various blends on offer.Caffeine administered, Astley shows us into the studio, which leads immediately off the kitchen at the back of his house (the vocal booth even doubles up as a wine cellar).It's as cosy and familiar as any parent's home office, centred around a computer balanced on an Ikea workstation, the assembly instructions still tucked under the keyboard, and his spare glasses resting next to the monitor.Except this home office also happens to have a baby grand piano and a dismantled drum kit shoved in the corner. Oh, and it's here that Astley wrote, sang and recorded his comeback album, 50: A soulful, revealing collection of pop songs that put him back at the top of the charts, 23 years after he quit the music industry.""I honestly didn't envisage it that way,"" he says. ""When I made 50 I was doing it for me. I thought I'd release it in a very home-grown way, like where you just put it on the internet somehow.""I wasn't necessarily anticipating going to a record label and trying to get it on the radio. I didn't think that was possible, if I'm honest. I'd given up that a long time ago.""50 went on to sell more than 300,000 copies, knocking music icon Paul Simon off number one, and easing Astley out of retirement. Not bad for someone who'd spent the preceding decade as the source of an internet prank - ""rickrolling"" - where users would be tricked into clicking a link for his 1987 pop smash Never Gonna Give You Up.Like his dancing in the video, the song was awkward and gauche, but it charted all around the world.Within seven months of its release, Astley was a millionaire, but you always got the sense the material was under-selling his voice.""I'm not so sure Stock, Aitken and Waterman were focused on finding people who were going to be legendary vocalists,"" he says, semi-diplomatically.""As the singer, you came in, you sang the song, you went. And I was okay with that - they were creating their sound, and we were going to be put into that.""""Pop music is very different now,"" he adds. ""If you look at Billie Eilish, she's as much a part of her records as anybody, and I think that was harder in the 80s. You were a bit more a product of the machinery.""Despite what you might think, he's not ashamed of those songs. Hits like Together Forever and Whenever You Need Somebody are ""ingrained in my DNA,"" says Astley, and he's never gonna give up playing them live.""I'm probably hyper aware of not betraying the audience,"" he admits. ""The people that come to my gigs, as a whole, have got families and lives and all the rest of it, and they're giving up something to come out for the night. You just can't take that for granted.""So he won't be doing a Bob Dylan and reworking Cry For Help into a croaky folk dirge?""Well, artists have every right to do whatever they want to do, and he's the epitome of that,"" says the singer.""But I've heard so many people who are massive fans of Bob Dylan, who've gone to a gig and don't even know what songs he's doing 'til half way through verse two.""I always feel obliged to please my audience, if I'm honest. Maybe that means I'm not a 'true artist', and I'm all right with that.""It's a typically modest response. Astley is cautious of ego and hyperbole and showbiz shenanigans, although he recently told Q Magazine ""there were a few curtains pulled down and a few oranges thrown at a wall,"" at the height of his fame.As he shows us round the studio, he's humble about his musical abilities (""I make simple records"") and says he still finds it ""weird to meet people you admire"".And while his house is full of expensive artwork and extravagantly feathered light shades, the only award he's ever put on display was for the Lion King soundtrack - on which he was persuaded to sing backing vocals after being discovered ""hanging out"" at the studio with a friend.""That's pretty much the only platinum record I've ever had on the wall,"" he says. ""It was in our daughter's bedroom because, obviously, she was a massive fan of that movie... as we all were.""Still, you can't hide your light under a bushel forever, so the singer is celebrating his resurgence with a Greatest Hits album that, for the first time, combines both phases of his career. Even so, he's not going to do the hard sell.""If I'm being brutally honest, doing a 'Best Of' in this day and age is a bit weird, because every piece of music that's ever been recorded is already out there somewhere on a playlist,"" he says.To make the package more attractive, he's added a new song, Every One Of Us, alongside a second disc that presents pared back, acoustic versions of his biggest hits.""I was very aware of not wanting to take the sparkle out of them, because they're very sparkly records,"" he says.So the melodies remained intact, even when the arrangements became ""lower and darker"", as on the pianoforte rework of Never Gonna Give You Up.He thinks of the new recordings as ""alternate universe versions"" of the originals - which makes us wonder what sort of album an alternate universe Rick Astley would make?""I think it would be a rock record, if I'm honest,"" says the singer - who regularly covers AC/DC's Highway To Hell in his live show; and who's become an occasional guest vocalist at Foo Fighters' gigs.So could he ever envisage a full collaboration with Dave Grohl and company?""They're a pretty amazing, ferocious live band and I think anybody in the world would want to make a record with them,"" he laughs.""But I think it's nice that we get together sometimes and it's like 'Boom!' and then it just drifts off...""It's been lots of fun, but I don't want to ever get into a situation where I take that for granted, do you know what I mean?""Instead, he's content just to pootle around at the back of his house, making simple, heartfelt records that just so happen to sell in the hundreds of thousands.""I guess I feel really comfortable here, in my own little way,"" he says, gesturing around the room.""I've got all my toys here and the things I understand. And if I turn the lights down low enough, and I've got enough time, I can make a record.""Rick Astley's hits collection, The Best Of Me, is out this Friday.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Sound of 2018 winner Sigrid: 'Making pop is like a treasure hunt'	BBC Sound of 2018: The top five	"""Writing a good pop tune is difficult,"" says Sigrid, the Norwegian pop star who's just won the BBC's Sound of 2018.""It's a challenge, but it's a good one - and when you find that one brilliant hook, it's the best feeling.""The 21-year-old only started writing music four years ago, when her brother - who's also a musician - invited her to play a show with him, on the condition she stopped playing Adele covers.""I guess he figured out I had something in me, and I just needed that little push,"" she told the BBC earlier this year.It certainly worked.The then-teenager's first song, Sun, was playlisted on Norway's national radio station and, after a brief break to finish school, her next set of demos sparked a record label bidding war.1. Sigrid2. Rex Orange County3. IAMDDB4. Khalid5. Pale WavesIsland Records got the gig after pursuing the singer around Bergen; and launched Sigrid's international career with last year's exuberant and kooky and charismatic Don't Kill My Vibe EP.The title track is her calling card. Inspired by a disastrous recording session in London where older, male producers patronised and demoralised her, it's a defiantly upbeat anthem to her own strength.It's given her the opportunity to play around the world; bowling over audiences with her charismatically uninhibited performances (she is, to put it mildly, from the Lorde school of dancing).Immediately after being told she'd won the Sound of 2018, Sigrid sat down with BBC News to discuss circuses, socks and the elusive quest for a perfect pop song.Congratulations on winning the Sound of 2018! How does it feel?I'm really honoured. I just want to swear a lot, but I know I can't do that on the BBC so I'm trying to hold it in!Previous winners include Adele, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding. What does it mean to be in their company?Adele's one of my favourite artists! It's huge and I don't think I'm going to understand how big it is until I walk out of this room.Find out more about the Sound of 2018Is it true that the first time you sang in public was at a sort of home-made circus?Haha! Yes! That was at my grandparents' cabin, which is situated in a bay 20 minutes from our house in Alesund. The children arranged a circus and we took money for people to come, which we spent on an inflatable dragon we could play on in the sea.What did you sing?A Norwegian song called Steinrøysa Neri Bakken by Alf Prøysen - it's like a traditional, old-school song.Was that the moment you decided to be a singer?That took quite a while, I think. I was a very shy kid. Very shy. But I started doing theatre when I was six years old and that really changed something. My more playful side came out of me.Then, when I was in junior high I started doing covers - Ellie Goulding, Adele, Coldplay, Keane - and I would change the rhythm or the melody to make it my own. That's when I discovered I like to make stuff, not just copy it.Then your first original song got picked up by the Norwegian equivalent of BBC Introducing.That was a big moment for me. It was the first time someone told me I made cool stuff outside of my school.But the thing was, I was very torn about what I wanted to do. I had a record contract, but I took a small break from releasing music because I wanted to finish school. At that point, I wanted to become a lawyer. I wanted to become a politics teacher. I had a lot of ideas about what I wanted to do!Didn't you end up studying politics?For two months! It was a three-year degree, but I only had the introduction. I'm very glad I quit.But I want to study some day. Maybe after my third album I'll just go to Uni. That would be really cool.Can you tell me about the recording session that inspired Don't Kill My Vibe? What did they do to you?Just some mean comments. I'm not sure if I want to go that deep into it.Anyway, the song isn't about me being a diva going, ""Oh, you don't respect me."" It's just like, ""Just be polite and nice. That's all I'm asking for.""You write principally on the piano. Why that instrument in particular?You can get so many moods out of it. The whole spectrum of emotions.[Getting up to play] This is my favourite chord - an F Major 7. It's so bittersweet.The piano really comes to the fore on Dynamite - which I've heard people compare to Adele's Someone Like You. What was going through your mind when you recorded that?I was trying to be as sad as possible. Like, on the brink of crying. We did it in one take.A lot of your other songs take negative emotions and turn them into something empowering.That's intentional, definitely.Did you set that goal when you went into the studio?Not necessarily when I go into the studio. Maybe an hour into the session we settle our goal for the day.But I always have a bigger vision, yes. And my vision is to make interesting pop music that has a nerve to it, that is catchy, that has a sense of humour.Is there something about Scandinavian pop that makes it stand out to British ears?Definitely my accent! My accent is weird. When I listen to some of the words I'm pronouncing in Don't Kill My Vibe, I think I could have been better! Even today, I feel like my English is terrible. I haven't been speaking English over Christmas.But I think the Scandi ""thing"" is very intricate melodies. English is our second language, and that creates a barrier where you have to concentrate on the melody. Because of that, I guess there's a history of making good vocal hooks - and that makes good pop music.There's a great moment on your latest single, Strangers, where you suddenly go ""whoop!"" in the middle of the chorus. How did that come about?I don't know! I just think it's a funny sound.I like to be dramatic in my music because that's when it gets to your heart. You want to have that nerve to it. But I also love to mix in humorous stuff like the ""whoop"" because it loosens it up and makes it interesting.Are you always looking for that magic ingredient?Oh yes! In every song. That's my favourite quest. I love getting into a single line and spending an hour on it. It's fascinating. It's like a treasure hunt.What's been the highlight of being a pop star so far?The coolest thing we've had on our rider has been woollen socks. That happened once in Norway and I've never been as happy!There's a merchandising opportunity for you: Sigrid socks!We actually have socks! For the EP, the creative team at Island came up with the idea of having a Don't Kill My Vibe t-shirt, and then a Plot Twist scarf, Fake Friends socks and a Dynamite polo sweater. And they're all real garments.How will you keep that going? Will single number 40 be the Sigrid meat dress?Ha! That would be really cool.Finally, how close are you to finishing your album?The thing is, I want to be a bit secretive about it, if that's alright? It's important to me that when I release it, I'm going to release it because it's finished. Not because it's expected to be out. But I'm aiming for 2018. It's very exciting!Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

entertainment	Sigrid: Approaching pop from left-of-centre	'Awkward'	"Last week, in the middle of a concert, Sigrid suddenly started Cossack dancing.""It came out of nowhere,"" laughs the singer, who's been called pop's hottest new prospect. ""I just felt like doing it. I always like to scare people a bit.""The singer is not, it has to be said, a malevolent presence in the flesh.Aged just 20, she's fresh-faced and fizzing with energy as she prepares for the first of three gigs at Brighton's Great Escape Festival.Both her parents have flown in from Norway to watch. Her mum fusses that Sigrid hasn't washed her hair, even though she's about to be filmed by the BBC.Something tells us Sigrid won't care: On stage she's unfettered, her arms flailing and face contorting as she performs her debut single, Don't Kill My Vibe.She doesn't break out the Cossack moves, but it's a thrilling, freeing performance.""I hate it when things are planned,"" she says. ""The thing I love about being on stage is I can do whatever I want.""There's one song in our set called Savage In Our Blood and it's a ballad, it's a sad song, but at some point I'm not singing, I just growl. And I love how people are going 'what the heck is going on?' I just love that.""I love shifting between being super cute and aggressive. It's funny.""Don't Kill My Vibe is her calling card; a powerful declaration of independence written after a disastrous recording session with older musicians, who talked over her, patronised her and made ""mean comments"".Sigrid bit her tongue, but the frustration poured out while writing with her friend Martin Sjolie.""You shut me down, you like the control / You speak to me like I'm a child,"" she observes coolly, while building towards a killer chorus.""You think you're so important to me, don't you?"" she trills over a soaring synth line. ""Well, I wanted you to know / You don't belong here"".While the lyrics were inspired by a bad day at work, they are malleable enough to apply to anyone who's ever been diminished or spoken down to. Perhaps that's why it's struck such a chord with fans, racking up 21 million plays on Spotify in the last two months.Not by coincidence, it was also the song that earned her a deal with Island Records, who decided to sign Sigrid after just one listen.""There are certain acts you decide you have to have and Sigrid was one of them,"" president Darcus Beese recently told MBW, describing how he sent a team to Bergen to tail the singer, ensuring no-one else got her signature.She's followed up Don't Kill My Vibe with an EP that's crammed full of vibrant, forward-thinking pop.Plot Twist is a deliciously catchy kiss-off to an ex-boyfriend, it's lyrics apparently composed by reciting Twitter memes (""shots fired!"").""I remember when I started writing lyrics, I was very grand,"" she explains. ""I tried to use a lot of symbols, because I thought that's how songwriting should be - with imagery and metaphor.""I figured after a while, maybe I should just write it as I would say in real life. So 'Do you need me to spell it out loud? You screwed it up. Plot Twist: Moved on and now you want me.""""That's the kind of thing my friends would say to me. This is how I talk.""The EP's final track, Dynamite, is entirely different. Not so much an acoustic ballad as tear-drenched companion piece to Adele's Someone Like You, it is a startlingly intimate song which was, incredibly, recorded in a single take.In the video, the camera focuses unflinchingly on Sigrid's face, reflecting every fracture in her broken heart.""It's a very honest song,"" she says. ""It's almost awkward singing it, because it's so intimate.""For me, the song is about having difficulties of having a private life when you're working so much,"" she says.There's a pause. She reconsiders, then laughs. ""I'm dating my microphone. That's the only romance I have time for.""Sigrid Solbakk Raabe was born and raised in the small town of Alesund, Norway, fringed by the sea and the mountains.""I was a very shy kid growing up,"" she recalls. ""I was definitely quirky. Me and my sister played a lot together. She's my best friend - and we would put on fashion shows.""I started doing theatre when I was six years old. I played the king in 1,001 Nights and something just clicked in my head. I remember thinking, 'Ooh, I like being on stage' and I didn't look back.""After learning the piano, she would bash out cover versions by Keane, Coldplay and Adele in her bedroom, but changing the melody or the chords ""just to make it more my own"".""That's when I discovered I like to make stuff, not just copy it.""But ""I didn't think music was something for me,"" she says. ""I wanted to be a teacher or a lawyer, so school was a higher priority.""In the end it was her brother, musician Tellef Raabe, who unlocked her potential.""He was playing a show in our hometown and he wanted me to join him on stage,"" she recalls, ""but he didn't want me to do an Adele cover. He said I had to write my own song.""I guess he figured out I had something in me, and I just needed that little push.""She premiered her first composition, Sun, two weeks later. It was later picked up by P3 Untouched, Norway's equivalent of BBC Introducing, and her subsequent singles Two Fish and Know You Forever, were playlisted on national radio.Amidst the growing acclaim, Sigrid took a break from the public eye and went back to high school to finish her exams. She was all set to apply for a law degree when her parents intervened.""They were really super-supportive,"" she says. ""They were the ones who told me, 'I think you should try this. I think you'll regret your whole life if you don't try music.'""Back in Brighton, mum and dad are in the front row at the Marwood Bar and Coffeehouse, cheering enthusiastically as the wooden floor sags under the weight of fans who've crammed in to see their daughter.After this, she flies off to the US, where she'll make her TV debut on James Corden's chat show. She's also been chosen to appear in a high-profile campaign for a company she can only refer to as ""the client"" (it later transpires to be Apple Music).In other words, Sigrid is on a one-way course to pop stardom, and she's taking it in her stride.Within her team, the ever-expanding list of commitments has been dubbed the ""2 Blessed 2 B Stressed Tour""; and the star is determined to keep her feet on the ground.She's even got an song about it. Called Raw, it goes: ""I could never fake it / No apologies for being me / I just want to be raw.""""This whole thing is very me. It's Sigrid,"" she declares. ""I'm Sigrid on stage and I'm Sigrid now.""I figured out it's just easier to be me all the time.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Billie Eilish: Is she pop's best new hope?	More interviews with pop newcomers	"Billie Eilish may only be 15 years old, but she's already a formidable talent (and a real-life pirate, but more on that later).A member of the Los Angeles Children's Chorus, she wrote her first song - about falling into a black hole - when she was four.But it was her dance instructor who unlocked her talent for smart, dark pop songs when he asked her to submit a song for class.Along with her older brother Finneas, Billie came up with Ocean Eyes - an astonishingly assured ballad which compared falling in love to falling off a cliff under ""napalm skies"".She posted it on Soundcloud so her teacher could hear it, went to bed, and woke up to a flurry of emails about her burgeoning music career.Since then, she's been on a steep upswing, signed by Interscope Records and releasing one head-turning track after another. The highlight (so far) is Bellyache, in which she sings from the point of view of a conflicted psychopath.""Where's my mind?"" she trills as an acoustic guitar trades blows with a gut-punch drum loop. ""Maybe it's in the gutter, where I left my lover.""It's the pop equivalent of a Tarantino movie - finding comic absurdity in the midst of eye-popping gore. The lyrics might keep it off the radio, but Billie isn't too worried.""I don't need many people to care,"" says the singer. ""Even if other people don't like it, I like it.""As she gears up to release her first EP, Eilish sat down for a frank chat with the BBC about her lyrical fantasies, getting to grips with the music industry and her very unusual middle name.Hello Billie Eilish… Have I pronounced that right?Yes! It's eye-lish, like eyelash with a lish.Your family name is O'Connell, though, so is that a stage name?It is my middle name. So I'm Bille Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell.Pirate! That's an amazing name.Pretty weird, right? Pirate was going to be my middle name but then my uncle had a problem with it because pirates are bad. Then Baird is my mother's name.Sigrid: Approaching pop from left-of-centreDua Lipa on relationships and Chris MartinHalsey on rising above depressionTove Styrke: 'Writing pop is like solving a puzzle'It's been a year since Ocean Eyes went onto Soundcloud. It was written for a dance class, right?Oh yeah! My dance teacher knew that I sing, so he asked us to make a song and I thought that was the coolest thing ever.My brother had written Ocean Eyes and we recorded it, basing all of the production around contemporary and lyrical dance. I think of most songs that way - if you can't dance to a song, it's not a song.Anyway, we put it on Soundcloud, literally to send the link to my teacher and then it just grew from there.It's been played more than nine million times now. When did you notice it was taking off?It was really confusing. I didn't understand what was going on. I literally thought it was like my popular friend had reposted it. 'Wow, it's getting so many listens!'What happened next?A lot of meetings!What are those meetings like? Do you go in super-confident, like, ""I've got the goods, what are you going to offer me?"" or is it totally nerve-wracking?I was 13 when this started, so I didn't know anything about anything. I'd go into meetings and they'd say, ""So Billie, what do you think?"" and I'd just be like, ""Am I supposed to know? Because I don't,"".But eventually I got the hang of it. And now the meetings I have are a bit more like, ""OK, Billie, what exactly do you want?' and then I explain every single detail of every single thing that I'm thinking; and people do it!It's insane. You have stuff floating around in your mind and you tell somebody and they go, ""Oh yeah, we can make that happen"". It's like, ""What? WHY?"".So it's like Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility.I am exactly like Spider-Man. I promise.I get the impression from your lyrics, especially, that you have a very clear idea of the things you want to talk about. How do you approach writing?Lyrics are so important but they're really underrated. So many lyrics right now are just the same thing - ""Oh, I love you but I'm sad because you don't love me and... blah"". You can say that in a more interesting way.Me and my brother write a lot of fiction. Like in Bellyache, obviously. I don't kill people.That's a relief.Right? But you can put yourself in a character or a situation you would not normally be in. You don't have to be in love to write a love song. You don't have to kill somebody to write a song about killing somebody. It's like jumping into another world.So do you consider it like acting? Or do you really want to murder someone, but haven't got round to it yet?Yikes! Maybe...But both of my parents are actors, and I was in plays when I was younger. Then I went to an audition and I came back going, ""I hate this. I'm not doing this ever again.""What happened at that audition?Some lame stuff, dude.But it's just fun to get to tell a story [in a song]. If you just write about things you've been through, you might get to a point where you go, ""I don't feel like this any more, so it's not worth pursuing"".No. No. It's especially worth it.What's the lyric you're proudest of?Well, I wrote Bellyache with my brother, and he wrote Ocean Eyes, and we have a ton of other songs on the EP that I'm really excited about.Do you find you write better with him than anyone else?We've had sessions with artists and writers and producers and not that those sessions were bad, but when we write, just us together, it's so much more raw, I guess. And straight from the heart.Tell me how Bellyache came to be...I wasn't like, ""Let's write a song about killing someone!"". We were sitting in my garage rehearsing for a show with my brother's friends. Finneas started riffing on the guitar, and one of them started playing on the piano, and I sang the first line - ""Sitting all alone, with a mouthful of gum in the driveway"".Then my brother sang, ""My friends aren't far, in the back of the car"" and I was like ""Lay their bodies,"" like I had killed them. And he just said, ""Woah, that's so cool!"".It just grew from there. He came into my room a couple of days later and he was like, 'dude, I wrote the chorus for this'. And he sang it all, and the last line was, ""And now I got a bellyache"" and I was like, ""That is genius"".It's such a childish line. No grown up says, ""I have a bellyache, I gotta go"". But it's kind of part of the song, because it's about someone whose really young and knows they're a psychopath. They're like, ""Maybe I shouldn't steal this money and kill these people... but I'm going to anyway"".It's a very cinematic lyric. You can see the film opening on you in the car, then the camera cuts to the bodies in the boot.Some people don't really realise what I'm saying until they've listened to it a couple of times. My friends would be like, ""Dude I was listening to Bellyache the other day, actually listening to it, and what the hell were you writing about?"".And then you say, ""I'm glad you've heard it. Now never cross me again"".Exactly. Don't wrong me.Your new song is called Copycat. What's that about?You'll understand when you hear it, but it's about people who feel justified in copying everything you do. It's not about someone particular, I just wrote it.I had two sisters growing up - and that sort of thing seemed to happen quite frequently in their peer groups. Is it a girl thing?It probably is, and it's tortuous. Especially if it's somebody close to you. It's like, ""Be your own self - don't try to be me!"".You've just played your first headline show in the UK. Do you get nervous?Not really. I don't get nerves, I just get excited.Does your dance training help with confidence and stage presence?Yeah. I mean, I was really a dancer. Then I got injured, so I haven't really danced since Ocean Eyes came out.Oh no, what happened?I strained my growth plate. My bone separated from my muscle in my hip. It was really bad.It's so weird, because it can't happen to you if you're over 16 - but I was in a class with a bunch of seniors, because I was at that level. We were doing hip-hop and it just popped. So I haven't really danced since then, which was like a year-and-a-half ago, which has been horrible.There is a dance video for Ocean Eyes, though, so are you on the mend?I was injured for the dance video, actually. I had sprained my ankle in December,and I had also strained my groin and I have shoulder problems.That's a sign to concentrate on the music.I guess it is, but I'm trying to get back into dance slowly.I love movement. I love moshing. I always heads right for the front and dig in there and mosh really hard with all the guys. None of the girls want to mosh, so I'm like the only girl getting punched in the face.Billie Eilish releases her new song, Copycat, today.

entertainment	The pop stars who have conquered the fashion world	1. Victoria Beckham2. Kanye West3. Gwen Stefani4. Rihanna5. Tinie Tempah	"Pop stars have always been clothes horses for fashion designers - but more and more of them are turning to designing themselves.So far this year, Skepta has released his debut fashion range and Zayn Malik's Versace Versus collection was unveiled.They join a list of musicians-turned-designers that already includes names like Victoria Beckham, Kanye West and Rihanna.But how easy is it for a pop star to become a successful designer in a world where, traditionally, you had to cut your teeth in the trade before your designs would hit the catwalk?Say goodbye to the artist formerly known as Posh Spice, and instead say hello to top British fashion designer Victoria Beckham.The former Spice Girl launched her first fashion range back in 2008, and it's fair to say there was a bit of sniggering and some raised eyebrows.But her first collection - a modest one containing just 10 dresses - went down a storm with critics.Nicole Phelps wrote in Vogue: ""The woman formerly known as Posh Spice has launched a dress collection, and, believe it or not, it's one of the hottest things going in New York this week.""And since then, Mrs Beckham has gone from strength to strength.""With Victoria Beckham, everyone wanted to hate her and put her down and she learnt from the beginning how to do everything from scratch - now, she might not be able to pattern-cut but does that really matter?"" says Glamour's fashion director Natalie Hartley.""Beckham is getting respect because right at the beginning, she really put her neck on the line. I remember the early days when she would do her shows in New York, she would talk you through the collections herself and she became very friendly with the editors. It was a very clever move.""People felt like they got to know her and she would remember you every season… she was actually very personable and I think that won them over.""VB has won several prestigious awards including two best brand accolades at the British Fashion Awards in 2011 and 2014.As well as her own collections, she's collaborated with US high street brand Target, which includes clothes in larger sizes and is affordable for the majority of us who can't afford designer prices.She once said: ""I want a woman to look and feel like the best version of herself.""Kanye is just one of a number of US music stars to have made the foray into fashion - honourable mentions also go to Jay Z and Pharrell.Kim Kardashian's husband first dipped his toe into the fashion world back in 2009 with a Nike collaboration - step forward the Air Yeezys - before further shoe lines followed with designer labels including Luis Vuitton.To prove he was taking fashion seriously, West completed an internship with Fendi the same year.An original pair of 2009 Air Yeezys is currently on offer on eBay for an eye-watering $1,349.99 (£1,055).In 2011, the rapper debuted DW Kanye West, his women's fashion label, at Paris Fashion Week.But it's fair to say it didn't go down too well with the fashion pack.The Daily Telegraph's Lisa Armstrong summed it up as a ""stupendously vacuous enterprise"".And the New York Times' Suzy Menkes wrote: ""His collection of sexpot low-bodice dresses and skintight pants, decked out with heaps of ginger fur, did not inspire the fashion crowd to tell him to give up his day job.""Ouch.On the plus side, Style.com did blog that it was ""a work in progress"".Ever the optimist, Kanye got back in the saddle quickly and his second line, launched in 2012, was largely well received.He has since gone on to produce five seasons of his Yeezy clothing line plus a trainer collaboration with Adidas.""I am actually a fan of Kanye's Yeezy collections,"" Natalie Hartley says. ""I love sportswear and think he has done a great job making simple, modern sportswear. He has also grafted to learn the ropes, he is passionate about fashion, and who can knock that?""The No Doubt singer first stepped into the fashion foray with the launch of her label L.A.M.B in 2004. The name is an acronym of her debut solo album Love.Angel.Music.Baby.She has frequently shown her collections during New York Fashion Week and has attracted largely positive reviews.On the label's Facebook page, L.A.M.B is described as ""a playful juxtaposition between classic Hollywood movie star glamour and more modern and casual street influences. L.A.M.B. is always a mixture of vintage inspiration mashed up with modern and futuristic elements"".It's certainly been a commercial success for the singer, raking in millions of dollars a year, which has allowed her to expand her fashion empire to include labels Harajuku Lovers (inspired by Japanese street style) and Design With Purpose (her eco-friendly line designed with Seven for all Mankind founder Michael Glasser).While Natalie Hartley says she's ""personally not hugely in to [Gwen's] style"", she credits her for sticking to her own instincts and ""her fan base are up for dressing just like her"".Stefani took a break from New York Fashion Week a while ago, explaining that ""the only reason I haven't [been] lately is because it falls when my kids go back to school and I was like, 'Oh, I guess I will go to NYFW and miss my kid's first day of kindergarten.' No.""But never fear fashion fans, Gwen has been back showing off her wares on the runway again. Hoorah for childcare!RiRi has proved to be a designer's dream over the last few years, gracing red carpets in the likes of Stella McCartney, Chanel, Prada and Giambattista Valli.But she's not just a clothes horse - she has been designing clothing for several years now across various different brands.Her fashion credits include underwear, denim and T-shirts for Armani Jeans and Emporio Armani Underwear plus a high street collection for River Island.Natalie explains that there's an authenticity about Rihanna's fashion credentials: ""Rihanna does stuff that's true to her. She wouldn't put anything together she would never wear herself.""Being named creative director of Puma in 2014, which entails overseeing the direction of the womenswear collection, was a big moment for the star.She's gone on to have huge success with her Puma trainer line, including her creeper-style trainers and furry sliders.Other recent collaborations include an all-denim collection with shoe god Manolo Blahnik (including thigh-high boots) and a range of sunglasses for Dior.Not content with clothes and shoes, RiRi also has several perfumes to her name - including Kiss and Crush - and a jewellery line with Chopard.The south London rapper first cut his fashion teeth not long after he scored his first number one with his debut single Pass Out back in 2010.His label Disturbing London is very much based on his own style - street mixed with high fashion.Consistently listed as one of Britain's best-dressed men, Tinie launched his What We Wear line earlier this year.Natalie says: ""Tinie Tempah's whole stance is sustainability and recycling materials. He obviously has a passion about that and that's what he wants to put out.""Speaking about his decision to go into fashion, the man himself told Reuters: ""To be honest I got a little bit bored of people just saying I was really stylish just for wearing other people's clothes,""""After a while I feel like people start to put more of the emphasis on the clothes than the actual person...I started to feel like I was a bit of a walking mannequin.""He's also said he'd be up for designing a women's collection at some point.""Regardless of what you're wearing, confidence is key. You can pretty much wear anything as long as you're confident enough to wear it. Fashion and style are two different things - you can wear the same things,"" he once told GQ.Wise words indeed.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Ric Ocasek, lead singer of The Cars, dies aged 75		"Ric Ocasek, lead singer of 1980s US band The Cars, has died aged 75.He was pronounced dead at home in Manhattan after family called to report he was unresponsive, New York Police Department said. The cause of death remains unconfirmed.The Cars helped kick-start the new wave movement.The band was formed in Boston in the mid-1970s by Ocasek and band-mate Benjamin Orr after they met at high school.Merging guitar rock with synthesizer-based pop, their early hits included Just What I Needed, My Best Friend's Girl and Good Times Roll.Their 1984 ballad Drive was used as background music for footage of the Ethiopian famine, and its re-release as a single after Live Aid helped raise money for the cause.After the band broke up in the late 1980s, Ocasek embarked on a solo career as well as working as a producer for artists including Weezer, Bad Religion and No Doubt.Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer.The remaining members of The Cars re-formed in 2011 to release a final album and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.In 1987, Ocasek told The New York Times: ""I'm happy that the pop songs have a bit of a twist. When I'm writing, I never know how it's going to come out.""He said he read a lot of poetry, which inspired his ""twisted"" song-writing.Tributes have been paid by many in the music industry including Bryan Adams, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, and The Killers frontman Brandon Flowers.Ocasek is survived by his wife, the model Paulina Porizkova, and six sons."
entertainment	Raised on Janet Jackson: How the pop star shaped one fan's life	What Have You Done For Me Lately?First meeting	"Janet Jackson plays the last date of her State of the World tour in Atlanta this Sunday.Staged less than a year after the birth to her first child, its a powerful return - condemning domestic terrorism, white supremacy and police brutality with a sense of urgency and alarm.The political nature of the production is supported by the musical choices, which highlight socially-conscious album tracks like The Knowledge and What About alongside Jackson's 28 top 10 hits.It's earned the star some of the best reviews of her career, and rekindled many fans' enthusiasm. Among them is Christine Cardona, who reflects here on her relationship with the singer.I recently found myself with a lapful of beignets, giddy with a childish excitement, in the backseat of a rental car. A few hours earlier, I'd flown from my home in New York to New Orleans, collected a friend in each airport, and started the two-hour drive to Lafayette for the opening night of Janet Jackson's State of the World Tour.As our ""Ultimate Janet"" playlist pumped through the speakers, I had flashbacks to the many drives, and the countless buses, trains and planes I'd boarded for a glimpse of Janet Jackson. I tried to remember how it all began.It was the mid-90s and I was not quite a teenager. MTV was thriving and Janet's video for Again was in heavy rotation. It made me feel things I wouldn't understand for years to come. It was soft. So soft. So sensual, so strong, so… feminine.I felt something when Gary Dourdan (Janet's love interest in the video) gently circled his hand around her washboard abs. My heart sank a little when her voice broke with longing, and her doe-eyes begged to be held. Somewhere deep in the recesses of my impressionable, adolescent brain I filed this away as ""Woman.""Not long after, Janet released her first greatest hits album, Design of a Decade. I saved my allowance money to purchase it. To my disappointment, Again was not on the track listing. Instead, there was a whole catalogue of songs I was only half-aware of. I began to work my way backwards through the albums that led to this compilation.The bold sexuality of 1993's Janet is apparent at first glance. The album cover, famously, shows the star topless, her breasts covered by her then-partner's hands. My friend and I used to sit and read the lyrics until we had them committed to memory. I knew early on the actual words she sang in If, but I also remember the specific moment when I realised, with shock, exactly they meant.But it wasn't just sex. On You Want This her confidence is relentless. It remains an enormously underrated song of female empowerment.Then there was the social consciousness of 1989's Rhythm Nation. My discovery of this album coincided with my introduction to the African-American History curriculum, or as much of it as a suburban public school in a largely white community teaches. I wrote school papers on social and racial injustices, quoting Janet's lyrics. I can now only imagine the eye rolls that must have accompanied the grading of them, but everyone at least seemed to appreciate my passion.And there was Janet's breakthrough album, Control, with its message of emancipation and independence. It's easy to understand how a teenager would latch onto that one.By the time 1997's Velvet Rope album rolled around, I was acting in real time. I purchased it at midnight on its release date, 20 years ago this past October. The cover features Janet's bright red curls bowed down in... what? Reflection? Meditation? Gratitude?I listened to it alone, on headphones, in the privacy of my own bedroom, which at the time was a small shrine to Janet - posters plastered on the walls, the floors carpeted in piles of magazines.With themes of self-awareness, loneliness, and sexual exploration, the album mirrored feelings I wasn't even aware I was having. At 15, I was just figuring out who I was. I was navigating the ups and downs of my teenage years, exploring my emotions, learning my own body, finding my way.When the Velvet Rope Tour hit Detroit, Michigan in the summer of 1998, it would be my first concert. Looking back now, I realize this trip was one of my first true experiences with diversity - the kind that my suburban New Jersey upbringing hadn't really offered. The people, both in my group and the general audience, were of varying backgrounds, ages, races and sexual orientations.My mother, who had to accompany me because I was a minor, was really taken by the number of gay men in attendance. I remember her asking what it was about this iconic, overtly sexual singer, that were they into? It was a genuine inquiry, but at the time I had neither an answer nor the need to make sense of it.It would be well over a decade before I'd be able to wrap my mind around the relationships between female pop stars and gay men. Before I'd hear countless stories about how watching their male dancers made people realize they were gay, and made others know it was going to be OK to come out; or about how music gave teens who were uncomfortable in their homes, in their schools, and in their own skin solace.It would take even longer before I realised the complex relationships between gay men and women in general. The very types of relationships that would inform my 20s, and sustain me in the single years of my 30s.On the third night of our Detroit trip, we were taken backstage to meet Janet. For some unknown reason, the image burned into my brain is of plastic bowls filled with brightly-coloured candies. She came out, sweet as the confections, smiling big, in denim overalls and a sunshine-yellow top.I was flustered and emotional. I got a quick hug and the chance to say, ""thank you,"" over and over again, as she nodded in a way that implied she knew what I was thanking her for and, at the same time, had no idea. I cried on the plane ride back. I had come so physically close to her, but I'd not been able to articulate the things I most wanted to say.When Janet released her next two albums (2001's All For You and 2004's Damita Jo) I was attending Boston University with one of the Janet fans I'd met in Detroit. We were taking sketchy $20 bus rides between Boston and New York City every few weeks for an endless blur of album signings, talk show appearances and performances. We'd sleep outside in lines on city sidewalks, near parks, under brightly-lit marquees and the fans' camaraderie on those nights stays with me. We took care of each other.I was taking my first women's studies classes during ""Nipplegate"" - that infamous Super Bowl moment when Justin Timberlake ripped open Janet's bustier and exposed her nipple to the world. We were specifically asked not to mention it in our work. The instructors had tired of it, or felt it was too ripe for plagiarism. I remember feeling it was a very specific sort of slight. The country was suddenly in the grips of Janet and her (literally) star-studded nipple, and I couldn't discuss it.I don't even know if I understand in present day all the implications of that nip slip - of what it says about how women's bodies are regarded (or disregarded); about society's fears of women as sexual beings, particularly black women; and about the way culture selectively chooses when to be prudish and when the sexualisation of women is marketable and acceptable.After college, I won a fan club contest to meet Janet again, and was flown with my friend to Las Vegas. After some professional obligations, she retired to a private balcony with us, a few assistants, and several friends.We stood together at the edge of a railing, and I scanned her face (OK, I was blatantly staring), watching her derive satisfaction from looking at the crowd below, dancing to her music. We took a tequila shot, and talked briefly. She was kind, generous with her time.This time, I found more words than ""thank you"". The club was loud, and she leaned in close, almost cheek to cheek, so I could hear her famously quiet speaking voice. She encouraged me to pursue a career in television. She referenced her favourite parts of my competition entry, and I couldn't believe she had read it.It was a life highlight, but I still couldn't shake the feeling there was something I needed her to know, something I still hadn't been able to communicate.Shortly after Vegas, I moved to New York City to try out that whole working-in-television thing. As my life picked up, I did fewer fan-related things. There were fewer of them to do - Janet disappeared and reappeared, weaving in and out of my life as her focus shifted away from music.In 2015, I was in my early 30s, searching for a way to ease newfound anxieties, when Janet's Unbreakable album was released. Her first record in seven years, it reminded me so much of The Velvet Rope - confident, yet vulnerable; reflective, but uninterested in other people's opinions.Aged 49, she had changed personally, vocally, and musically, but she was also, unmistakably the same Janet I fell in love with. For me, the most endearing part of the project was that it represented growth, not reinvention - the kind of growth and self-actualization we all strive for.I caught the Unbreakable Tour in Chicago and planned to see it again in New York, but Janet had some health issues followed by her pregnancy and the tour flickered out.When it was announced she would resume live performances so soon after giving birth (and getting divorced), I was surprised. I didn't imagine her coming back so quickly. At the urging of friends, I decided to take a last-minute chance on the opening night in Lafayette, Louisiana.The State Of The World tour mixes old songs that have never been played live, with others that have lain dormant for almost 30 years, alongside new material. It's all-encompassing, and it highlights a lengthy and exhaustive career. This woman owns the stage for the full duration. Her dancing is mesmerizing - the particular mixture of old and new choreography is masterful. She's out there ""milly rocking"" in a way that puts kids to shame. My bias is mine, but the reviewers seem to be with me.But something is different on this tour. I think people, including me, didn't expect to see her out here like this again. They've been dressing as different versions of Janet, wearing fun and thoughtful custom shirts. I've even invested in a gold key earring and some ""State of the World"" lip colour. Wearing them makes me so damn happy, I feel like a kid.I think we're all doing a bit of self-soothing under the security blanket of nostalgia, but we're also really thrilled that whatever this thing is, it isn't entirely in the past. The magic is still happening and that brings a distinct sort of satisfaction. The joy of having these songs and experiences to grow with is what I'd been trying to express to Janet all along.So many of us have stories about the ways Janet made us feel heard or accepted, or how she's left her mark on us. At 51, she may be embarking on her first journey through motherhood, but she already has generations of people who feel, at least a little bit, raised on Janet.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Meet Muna: The 'queer pop' band who caught Harry Styles's eye		"Since September, pop band Muna have been setting the scene at Harry Styles's solo gigs.The trio, who identify themselves as a ""queer band"", were hand-picked by the singer after he fell in love with their debut album, About U, for its messages of inclusivity and acceptance (oh, and also the amazing, arms-aloft choruses).It's fair to say the band were stunned.""It was funny,"" says guitarist Josette Maskin. ""I'd never really thought about Harry Styles too much - but the week he asked us to go on tour, we'd been listening to Sign Of The Times and spoken about him a lot.""His vibe was in the oeuvre of our lives and then this happened.""""The 'oeuvre of our lives??!'"" cackles her bandmate, Naomi McPherson ""Josette!""When we speak, Muna are on a day off from Styles' tour, preparing for their own, Hallowe'en-themed, headline show at London's Heaven Nightclub.They're sparkling company, painting each others' nails black and decanting mini Mars bars into a plastic bag which, later that night, will be flung into the audience during a cover of Michael Jackson's Thriller.""I love being an opening act,"" enthuses singer Katie Gavin, ""but playing for our fans makes me feel like I'm getting recharged to carry our message to people who haven't heard us.""The last two months have been an eye-opener for the band, who quickly came to appreciate the passion of Styles's fans.""I had no idea how visceral this experience is for some of them,"" says Katie. ""They pass out, out of being overwhelmed by being in the same room as him.""""I don't think we realised until we started that every night is a night thousands of people have been waiting for,"" adds Naomi.""It's so cool for us to be part of that.""Muna formed at the University of Southern California in 2013, bonding over their shared love of '80s funk-pop - Janet Jackson, Chaka Khan, Talking Heads, Prince.Coincidentally, their tutor at USC turned out to be Patrice Rushen - who had her own 80s hit with Forget-Me-Nots, and who inspired Prince to write I Wanna Be Your Lover.""She's our mentor,"" says Josette. ""She has the funk.""""She is the funk,"" corrects Katie.Rushen gave Muna a hand as they self-produced their first album - adding a bell part to the shimmering break-up song Winterbreak, for instance. But the group take a more political stance than the artists who inspired them.Recent single Crying On The Bathroom Floor deals with the psychological impact of abusive relationships, and how ""survivors form strong attachments to their abusers"".And their electrifying signature song, I Know A Place, is ""about the rich LGBTQ history of turning bars and ballrooms into safe havens"".Although it was written before the nightclub shootings in Orlando last year, it has taken on added resonance since.""It's interesting, because the song deals so much with imagination and hope - but there's a downside to that, which is not seeing these things coming, not being prepared when they happen,"" says Katie.""But then, thank God we had a song for it, do you know what I mean?""""Everything that's happened is so terrifying, but at least people have found some kind of solace in something we made,"" adds Josette.Performing on Jimmy Kimmel's US TV show this January, I Know A Place mutated again when Gavin added new lyrics addressing Donald Trump's travel ban.""Even if our skin or Gods look different, I believe all human life is significant,"" she sang, as her bandmates muted their instruments.""I throw my arms open wide in resistance. He's not my leader even if he's my president.""It's since become a permanent fixture in the song and, surprisingly, the band haven't seen a backlash in their Twitter mentions.""It was actually more positive than the crazy hate,"" says Katie.""The only reaction that I had, other than being impressed and proud of Katie, was I saw someone had made it into a gif,"" Naomi laughs.""I was like, 'We're a gif now! We've made it!'""If you're thinking Muna's message is stronger than you'd normally expect at a Harry Styles gig, you'd be right.But the band think they were chosen for a purpose.""He's using us as a way of saying something without actually saying it, which is actually very smart,"" says Naomi.""We are so happy to be a queer band and invite our audience to explore queerness, and I think he's kind of the same,"" adds Katie.""Having us on the tour was like an invitation.""Meanwhile, the former One Direction singer has echoed Muna's politics in his own set.On the opening night in San Francisco, a fan threw a rainbow-coloured Pride flag onstage, which Styles has had wrapped around his microphone stand ever since.Playing in London last Sunday, the star told the audience: ""Please feel free to be whatever it is you want to be in this room,"" and encouraged everyone to ""find someone you don't know and embrace them"".Styles's fans have embraced Muna in a way they never expected. Their Twitter followers have doubled, and audiences have actually been paying attention to their songs.""They're very open listeners,"" says Naomi. ""There's a lack of entitlement that I've seen, at least, as opposed to crowds in other places. """"It feels like the first time we're on tour. Everything's very intriguing and interesting,"" adds Katie.""And there's so much bread in Europe!"" laughs Josette.""I've eaten more pastries this week than I have in the last two years combined.""When the European leg of the tour ends next week, Muna will head back to LA to work on their second album.""We want to make 'an album,'"" says Josette. ""Even though no-one gives a stuff about albums any more.""""Yeah, I don't know how much of a pipe dream it is to expect people to listen to an album any more,"" says Katie.""I think we're romantics in that sense. Because we want to be somebody's favourite band. And, so far, people have been quite obliging.""Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

TBC2. Rex Orange County3. IAMDDB4. Khalid5. Pale WavesThat came to fruition on last year's Apricot Princess, a breezy, laid-back album of love songs that glides smoothly between pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz and R&B.""It's so effortless,"" says Annie Mac, who has championed the 19-year-old on her BBC Radio 1 show. ""Every song sounds like a classic.""She's not his only fan: US rapper Tyler, The Creator put O'Connor on his latest album, Flower Boy; Frank Ocean hired him for his touring band; and he backed Skepta at last year's Mercury Prize.""I've been able to do a lot of cool things,"" he tells the BBC. ""That's always the dream, for any artist.""How does it feel to be on the Sound of 2018?It's cool. I'm really honoured to have been chosen. The BBC has shown me a lot of love in the past - so it's great. I'm excited.Do you remember the first time you got played on the radio?For sure! The first person on the BBC that played me was Huw Stephens. I was sat around my laptop with my girlfriend and my family and it was super-exciting. It felt weird and it sounded weirder but it was great.Find out more about the Sound of 2018What was it like growing up in Haslemere?I always played music, I was in a choir when I was super young. I took piano lessons and I wanted to play drums when I was six. Luckily enough, my parents let me have a drum kit in my room - which is kind of crazy.Presumably the countryside's a good place to practice drums because the neighbours aren't too close.It was exceedingly loud now I look back on it - but the neighbours were fine. My mum always said, ""I'm so glad you got better because the first couple of years with you bashing away up there was difficult!""School was good, too. I had a teacher that really got me into music. And I went to study music for sixth form in London.This is at the Brits School?That's right. I don't really mind people know I went there but I don't feel it defined me or anything.What prompted you to leave the drums behind and become a frontman?Midway through college, I was discovering a lot of artists who played the guitar. Prior to that, I was still studying Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder songs [and] I didn't think guitar was an instrument I was interested in in any way.But when I started actually listening to those songs - the chords and the melodies and the lyrics - I realised I'd rather be doing that because, at that school, the people who played drums were amazing.I mean, I'm totally competent and I've played drums on all my music, but there were people there who were born to play, and I was just not that. I knew I had talents in other fields so I just utilised them.On Paradise, you sing: ""Who needs an academic career when you're the one with all the ideas?"" Did you grow disillusioned with school?Sort of … I'm a typical artist: I didn't do particularly well with science and maths. School did stress me out, like it does for a lot of young people. I didn't like having to do work that I didn't care about.Your second album, Apricot Princess, is very upbeat compared to the first. What changed?Just before the album was written, I found myself in a relationship and I'm super-positive about it and I wanted to flip what I had previously done. I made the first album when I was angry and upset - and now I'm nowhere near that.Is that your girlfriend singing on Sycamore?Yeah, her name is Thea.So she gets a starring role in her own story.Of course! But it can be anyone's story - I think that's why people like it. People are always messaging me talking about their own experiences with a girl or a boy.Apricot Princess makes a big leap in terms of arrangements and instrumentation. Was it all recorded live?It was predominantly produced by myself and a recording engineer called Ben Baptie. He helped me get the sounds I wanted from the [computer] files I had, which all sounded like fake instruments. But the real expense was having an eight-piece string section. That was massively overwhelming.You've already followed up that album with a standalone single, Loving Is Easy. Are you quite a prolific writer?I try and write as much as I can. But I don't have a song a day or anything like that. I just do it as best I can. I mean, I'm not very good at anything else.How did you end up on Tyler, The Creator's album?His friend found me on YouTube and showed him the video - and then he emailed me personally. It was pretty out of the blue.Did you believe it was him?Not really. It wasn't like I had people hitting me up all the time, so I was just kind of confused.So what did you do?I said, ""I know this probably isn't really you, but if you want to prove it you can just call me right now!""Instead of doing that, he messaged me on Twitter so I could tell it was his verified account. We started talking about songs we both liked - Stevie Wonder and Amy Winehouse - and it ended up with him having a song he wanted me to do, and I did it!Was it one of those situations where he emailed over an instrumental for you to add vocals in your bedroom?That did happen, but only so he knew it was worth having me come all the way out to LA to do it in the studio with him.When he first sent it, he was like, ""Don't get your hopes up too much, because I still don't know who I want to get on it.""Then you ended up on two songs!It worked out pretty well. I love the album, regardless of my songs. It's his best album, for sure.What does next year hold? Album number three?I'm going to tour this album as much as I can, and the next one is going to be worked on for the whole of the year.It's weird to have an amount of pressure to deliver, now that I've delivered once or twice. So it'll come when it does. That's pretty much all I can say.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Everything Everything on how they've turned a 'nightmare' into pop music		"""There's a tide and it's coming in now,"" sings Jonathan Higgs on Night Of The Long Knives, the latest single from Everything Everything.The title refers to Hitler's bloody purge of the Nazi party in 1934, drawing a parallel to the rise of the right-wing politics in the last two years.Only Higgs isn't convinced that fascism will sweep everything in its path.""They're saying it's a wave but it feels like a dribbling mouth,"" he sneers in the single, questioning whether the alt-right are a powerful force, or just a bunch of idiots.""And the answer is both,"" says the singer, sitting down to discuss the album with BBC News at the Brixton Academy.""It depends how we react to it. If everyone [panics and] says, 'Oh God!' the next thing you know, they're the prime minister.""But if you go, 'Ha, ha, ha, you're idiots,' well... they'll probably still become prime minister. But you have to keep your head about it.""It's surprising to hear Higgs make a plea for perspective. After all, this is a man whose last album, Get To Heaven, was a ""wretched and anxious"" response to Islamic State militants, beheadings, mass shootings and political corruption.""I was in a dark place,"" he told the BBC on its release. ""I was essentially trying to inhabit the minds of the [extremists] and that's a really horrible thing to face.""Everything Everything's new album dials back on the paranoia and dread - partly because Higgs thinks the world has caught up with him.""I'm not less in that headspace, but I think everyone else is in it more,"" he says.""But the album's a bit more abstract, a bit more personal. Away from politics and all that stuff, it's about the human relationships we all have.""The album is called A Fever Dream, a reference to the ""surreal, nightmarish things happening, day after day"" - especially the absurdity of modern politics.It's there in Big Game, a pomposity-pricking parable about Donald Trump (""Even little children see through you""), and it's there in Run the Numbers, a song that explores Michael Gove's comment that ""people in this country have had enough of experts"".""Is it the first song to be inspired by Michael Gove? Yes, and it should be the only one. Let's leave it at that.""Higgs is smart enough to be aware that he comes from a position of privilege, and his liberal views are out of step with the prevailing political climate.There's a song on the album called Ivory Tower, where people threaten to ""come and crush me in the Waitrose aisle"". On the title track, he sings: ""I hate the neighbours, they hate me too / The fear and the fury make me feel good.""""It's admitting that I sort of enjoy arguing,"" he explains. ""I think we all do on some level. It's certainly popular.""""With anonymity you can go much further than you ever could in real life,"" Higgs continues.""People become very extreme very quickly. It feels good to give yourself over to that emotion.""This leads to a discussion of the fake news stories that spread in the wake of this month's mass shooting in Las Vegas.""I just can't begin to find a way into that mindset,"" says Higgs. ""But the whole idea about what's true has been thrown up in the air: Who do we trust? Why do we trust our journalists? Is it just because we're used to it?""""There are codes of practices in place, right?"" interjects his bandmate, Jeremy Pritchard. ""But does the Daily Mail care? Does Fox News care? I don't think so.""Higgs says keeping up with the news ""feels like a bad dream - sometimes it's scary and frightening and sometimes it's electrifying and exciting"".He adds: ""That's why there's a reference to being asleep or dreaming or waking up in every single song. There's a feeling of 'is it real, or is it not?'""If this all sounds pretty heavy, it's worth noting that Everything Everything have always dressed up their angst in a cathartic explosion of melodic pop.That's how they sneak songs like Cough Cough (about greed for oil), My Kz Ur Bf (airstrikes) and Night Of The Long Knives onto daytime radio.In concert, this results in fans bellowing out the lyrics to No Reptiles - a song about feeling passive and useless and alienated from society.There's something bizarre, I observe, about hearing 3,000 people chanting: ""It's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair.""""You're telling me,"" laughs Higgs.""We're always surprised by what people's favourites are,"" adds Pritchard. ""And we're still towards the beginning of that process on this album.""We've written them, we've recorded them and now we're seeing what works in the live arena - where the energy is, how to play it.""But the ""fat child in a pushchair"" remains the bassist's favourite part of the set, every night.""I don't have to play anything at that point in the song,"" he says, ""So I always take my earphones out and listen to the crowd. It's incredible.""A Fever Dream is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Turner winner Rachel Whiteread has a pop at 'plop art'		"Artist Rachel Whiteread has criticised what she calls ""plop art"" as an exhibition of her work opens in London.""I'm not a great fan of what I call 'plop art', where you plop a piece of work down where it doesn't bear any relationship to anything else.""The Turner Prize's first female winner, known for sculptures that often take the form of casts, said public sculpture should suit its surroundings.A retrospective of her work opens this week at Tate Britain.Whiteread's previous commissions include her Fourth Plinth sculpture in Trafalgar Square - a sculpture resembling an upside-down plinth.She also created the Holocaust memorial in Vienna and an installation of 14,000 white polythene boxes for Tate Modern's Turbine Hall.""Art has got extremely popular, and for many reasons that's great,"" she said. ""But I think a lot of public sculpture is ill thought-out and put in places that it shouldn't necessarily be.""It becomes something then that's invisible. People don't even notice it. Art is there for a reason and should be respected and looked at, and not just a sideshow.""Whiteread found fame for her first public commission in the East End of London in 1993, when she cast the interior of a house.Her new sculpture - a cast of a Norfolk chicken shed - has now gone on display outside Tate Britain.The retrospective includes many of her other casts, including hot water bottles, doors, a roof and a staircase.Whiteread said she felt ""slightly exasperated"" by questions about whether the likes of a shed can be called art.""I made House in 1993 so I've been coming across this for a long time,"" said the 54-year-old.""I think if you keep plugging away and make good enough work, people will hopefully see there's some poetry in a shed.""The Rachel Whiteread retrospective opens on Tuesday and runs until 21 January at Tate Britain.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Boy who swore at Five Star on kids' TV apologises		"In the 1980s, long before the internet made swearing at pop stars a mass participation sport, Eliot Fletcher achieved playground notoriety for a foul-mouthed phone call on kids TV.Having sneaked past the switchboard operators at BBC One's Saturday morning show Going Live, he was allowed to ask sibling pop band Five Star a question.Only his question turned out to be: ""Why are you so [expletive] crap?""Now, just 30 years later, Fletcher has seemingly apologised for his outburst.The apparent reconciliation began when a Twitter account dedicated to Top of the Pops trivia posted a video of the incident, timed to coincide with Five Star's appearance on a BBC Four repeat of TOTP.Doris Pearson, Five Star's choreographer and sometime lead singer, spotted the tweet and replied: ""I wanna meet Eliot!! Twitter, do your thing.""Shortly afterwards, an account apparently belonging to Fletcher replied by saying: ""Hi Doris. Thank you and sorry.""It's great to hear you're still performing,"" the author added.""No apology necessary,"" replied Pearson - although, in a separate tweet, she admitted the band had been upset by his tirade at the time.""Was taken aback by it,"" she told one fan. ""We were really young and worked so hard for years. Of course nobody wants to hear someone say their work is awful.""Now I look at it completely differently and find the whole thing hilarious!""Pearson later invited her former nemesis to join her on an ""[expletive] crap night out"".He declined, telling one fan: ""Doris would probably throw her drink over me and rightfully so.""The owner of the account also turned down several requests to speak to the media.""An interview with Doris would be much more constructive,"" he reasoned. ""She's still creative and actually bringing something to this world.""Speaking to the BBC, Pearson said she was ""in complete shock"".""To be reunited with Eliot and receive an apology from him was completely unexpected.""At least it's defused any animosity between him and the fabulous Five Star fans, as a lot of them were still upset about it.""The last thing I'd want is for anyone to get into a fight over it.""Five Star were one of the biggest British pop bands of the mid-80s, selling more than 15 million records worldwide, with hits like System Addict, Rain Or Shine and The Slightest Touch.Formed by five siblings - Doris, Denise, Lorraine, Delroy and Stedman Pearson - they were dubbed Romford's answer to the Jacksons, and won best British group at the 1987 Brit Awards.Their fateful appearance on Going Live came as they promoted the single With Every Heartbeat. Fletcher was quickly cut off, as the band giggled with shock.Host Sarah Greene quickly moved on, cueing up the next caller by asking: ""Have you got a sensible question?""The clip has frequently appeared in lists of the top television moments of the 80s, and musicians' most calamitous TV appearances.""I'm surprised people still remembered it,"" Pearson told the BBC.Although the clip became notorious, it didn't help the band's chart fortunes. With Every Heartbeat stalled at number 49.After relocating to America, Five Star disbanded in 1995, but have frequently reunited to perform at 80s nostalgia shows.Denise Pearson, who sang lead vocals on their biggest hits, went on to star in Thriller Live and auditioned for The Voice UK in 2012.They are about to release a three-disc retrospective to mark the 35th anniversary of their debut album, Luxury of Life.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Anne-Marie: Chart topping pop star (and karate champion)		"There aren't many pop star interviews where you can open with the question: ""Do you still practise Shotokan?""But Anne-Marie, aside from being extremely hot musical property right now, is a triple world champion in the style of Japanese karate.""I still love it so much and it's such a massive part of who I am,"" the singer tells the BBC ahead of her appearance at BST Hyde Park on Sunday.But, she adds: ""I don't have time to even sleep at the moment, so not much time to practise, but another thing is my teacher is in Essex, so it's about whenever I can get back home as well.""It's easy to understand why the 26-year-old doesn't have much spare time at the moment. She's been a little busy touring, recording and topping the Christmas chart with Clean Bandit.The singer's love of Shotokan and her music career have even crossed paths along the way - she showed off her moves in the 2015 video for her single Karate, and still regularly sings its praises.""Even just as a part of growing up I think it really helped me in my character and the way I was and dealt with situations, it's such a big part of discipline, I think it was the first thing I truly dedicated myself to.""And it taught me a lot about sticking with something and really trying hard and working for it, which is a great lesson for what I'm doing now, because it is so much hard work, and it's actually taught me how to love doing that.""Anne-Marie will share a stage with Martin Garrix, Tove Lo and Naughty Boy on Sunday afternoon as one of the support acts for Justin Bieber's Hyde Park show.""I think [Bieber's] really cool, to be an artist from that young an age you've got to have something special, and his new music is great,"" she says.Anne-Marie may not have reached Bieber-esque levels of fame yet - but she's certainly heading that way.Since topping the charts for nine weeks in December as the vocalist on Clean Bandit's Rockabye, she has continued build up her own repertoire as a solo artist.In February, her single Ciao Adios - a song still impossible to escape or get out of your head months later - reached number nine. It was her first single as a soloist to break into the top 10.So, when can fans expect the album?""I'm such an impatient person, I've wanted to get the album out since last year,"" Anne-Marie says.""But luckily I didn't because I've been able to write so many more songs with great producers that I hadn't met before.""""I chose my next single this week which is exciting, and right now I'm just thinking of the flow of the singles and all of them connecting with each other, and when the time is right then we'll release the beast.""Asked if there are any further artists she wants to collaborate with, she quickly replies: ""Eminem. He's a big one.""Also Kendrick Lamar, Anderson Paak, I obviously love rappers. And Alanis Morissette I think she's one of my biggest inspirations. And Pink. I think it'd be really cool to collaborate with another female singer.""She also hasn't ruled out attempting a return to the festive charts, but adds jokingly: ""I think the next song I try and get to Christmas number one will just be me on my own!""Away from the microphone, Anne-Marie has been steadily building a social media following, and using her platform to promote positive messages about body image to her hundreds of thousands of followers.""I always try and put out posts on social media about feeling good inside, and there's so much pressure for people to look a certain way and have a certain hairstyle or a certain lipstick.""I just feel not many people hear that you should feel good inside and feel happy within your soul, instead of needing to look a certain way, so I always try and talk to people about that.""There's little doubt the singer has an exciting time ahead as she gears up for the release of the album - an prospect she's fully embracing.""I think what's surprised me about the music industry is that you never know what's going to happen. I've had to teach myself that, because I love to know everything, I'm quite a control freak when it comes to stuff like that,"" she says.""But you never know what's going to happen so I'm always surprised, and I've come to realise that that's actually a great thing.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	George Michael: Master craftsman of pop		"If you wanted to know how to succeed in pop, George Michael's career would give you a pretty good template.Wham! may have been considered a joke by critics who couldn't see beyond the schoolgirls clutching Smash Hits posters to their chests, but the band were a commercial phenomenon.Their throwaway lyrics (""Club Tropicana, drinks are free"") were full of communal, hedonistic escapism at a time when unemployment nudged three million. More importantly, the tunes had more hooks than a butchers.Listen to Freedom: those cascading ""I don't want your, I don't want your"" vocals in the coda; or the doo-wop backing vocals after the second chorus.George Michael, who died on Christmas Day aged 53, had ravenously devoured pop history as a child, and you can tell from the bounding, puppy-like energy of those early records how much he enjoyed getting the chance to put his own spin on it.The band were managed by Simon Napier-Bell, who introduced Jimmy Page to the Yardbirds and co-wrote the lyrics to Dusty Springfield's You Don't Have To Say You Love Me.""I saw something in Wham! that no-one else seemed to see,"" he told the NME, ""which is the Hollywood thing of the two buddies, the two cowboys.""You know, during the film, one falls in love, the other goes to a brothel, but at the end they always ride off together.""Of course, Michael was never really this carefree, happy-go-lucky character - but he and band sidekick Andrew Ridgeley definitely played up to it in their quest for success.""I created a man - in the image of a great friend - that the world could love if they chose to,"" he once said, ""someone who could realise my dreams and make me a star.""I called him George Michael, and for almost a decade, he worked his arse off for me, and did as he was told. He was very good at his job, perhaps a little too good.""Indeed, Wham! made George Michael a millionaire by the age of 21 - at the same time most of his contemporaries from Bushey in Hertfordshire were graduating from university.Beneath the surface, however, the duo were much more serious-minded than the shuttlecocks-down-shorts image suggested: They played miners benefit events with Paul Weller in the 1980s and split with Napier-Bell's management company when they discovered a dubious South African connection.And even though they appeared on the original 1984 Band Aid single, Michael and Ridgeley went one further than many of the other participants - donating the royalties from Last Christmas to the charity as well.The band split once Michael had the confidence he could carry a solo career without his old school friend and, although fans were devastated, the singer had an ace up his sleeve: Faith.Released in 1987, the album opens with a church organ playing the melody to Freedom - a funeral for a friend - before launching into a genre-spanning, attention-grabbing slew of hit singles.The title track rides on an infectious Bo Diddley groove, before the lights dim on a dreamily romantic Father Figure, after which Michael let his libido rip on the Radio 1-baiting I Want Your Sex.In those three songs, the star spat his bubblegum past out of the car window, and set the benchmark for any boy band member looking to establish a solo career (a teenage Robbie Williams, listening to the album in his bedroom in Stoke-on-Trent was definitely taking notes).Faith put him on a par with other 80s superstars like Michael Jackson and Madonna. In the US, it appealed equally to both black and white audiences, selling 20 million copies, and became the first album by a white act to top Billboard's R&B chart.George Michael's life in picturesSix songs that defined George Michael's lifeObituary: George MichaelMichael was rightfully proud of the record's musical diversity. ""If you can listen to this album and not like anything on it, then you do not like pop music,"" he told Rolling Stone magazine.He went on to mount a defence of pop, in spite of his critics.""If you listen to a Supremes record or a Beatles record, which were made in the days when pop was accepted as an art of sorts, how can you not realise that the elation of a good pop record is an art form? Somewhere along the way, pop lost all its respect. And I think I kind of stubbornly stick up for all of that.""Still, those brickbats took their toll - 1990's Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1 was an attempt to be taken seriously as a musician. In Freedom 90, he even expressed regret at his earlier escapades - ""When you shake your ass, they notice fast / Some mistakes were built to last.""In an attempt to shift the focus onto his music, the singer even refused to appear in his own videos: A move that only garnered him more (negative) press in the tabloids.But his commercial instincts and pop craftsmanship were still in evidence, from the Beatles-esque harmonies of Heal The Pain to the mournful Praying For Time.He was a trailblazer in other ways, too. Years before Prince scrawled ""slave"" on his face, Michael took Sony Records to court, trying to extricate himself from his contract and regain control of his career.""There is no such thing as resignation for an artist in the music industry,"" he said, after losing the case. ""Effectively, you sign a piece of paper at the beginning of your career and you are expected to live with that decision, good or bad, for the rest of your professional life.""He was also one of the first artists to realise the internet's potential - setting up Aegean Records in 1997 specifically to sell songs online.""I really don't need the public's money,"" he explained. ""I'd like to have something on the internet with charitable donation optional, where anyone can download my music for free.""Ultimately, however, the company failed to make much headway.In later years, it seemed as though Michael's commercial instincts had abandoned him.Certainly, the grief he suffered after the death of his partner, Anselmo Feleppa, and his mother, in the 1990s, derailed him personally and artistically for much of the decade.Unexpectedly, his arrest on charges of public indecency in 1998 and his subsequent outing reinvigorated him. Outside, which poked fun at his arrest, was only kept off the number one slot by Cher's mega-hit Believe; while Flawless (Go To The City) is a discofied late-career highlight.Just weeks before his death, the star had arranged to record a new album with in-demand British producer Naughty Boy.If the sessions, which were due to take place next year, had come to pass, it is not unreasonable to suggest that George Michael would have enjoyed a new renaissance.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Greg James and A.Dot to host new pop show on BBC One	'Home for new acts'	"Greg James and A.Dot have been announced as the hosts of a new, primetime music show on BBC One.Sounds Like Friday Night will be the first regular, mainstream music programme on the BBC since Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006.Broadcast live from Television Centre, it promises to feature ""the hottest bands and artists in the world"", alongside interviews and sketches.Brit Award-winners Royal Blood have written the show's theme tune.""We always imagined doing something like this one day,"" said the band.""It's great that a new show celebrating live music is back at the BBC and creating a home for new bands to build a bigger audience. We're excited to be a part of it.""The show will launch in October.James, who got his break in student radio, has hosted Radio 1's drivetime show since 2012, and reveals the Official Charts every Friday.A.Dot is the stage name of Ashley Charles, a rapper who has performed with Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliot.Also known as Amplify Dot or Dotty, she currently presents the 1Xtra Breakfast show, where she has become known for her Prank Calls feature.The two hosts will be joined by a different guest star every week, who will take part in sketches, as well as performing live.The format seems similar to Adele at the BBC - which featured a viral sketch in which Adele auditioned to play her own lookalike.""We have been missing a primetime music show from our TV screens for far too long so it's fair to say being part of Sounds Like Friday Night is something I'm really, really excited about,"" said James in a statement.""One thing that's fantastic about the show is being able to provide new and emerging acts a home alongside the megastars, introducing them to a new audience.""The new show is being produced by Fulwell 73, the company behind James Corden's US chat show and Carpool Karaoke sketches.It has been in development since 2014, as the corporation searched for a music show format that worked.""Pop music has no divine right to be on BBC One,"" BBC Music boss Bob Shennan told Music Week earlier this year.""The reality is that, if you stick a succession of performances on one after the other, and there's nothing special about it, it's not necessarily going to attract the audience.""""We want to open [artists] up so you see them for who they are and have fun with them,"" said Gabe Turner of Fulwell 73. ""With the sketches, it's not just presenting a song, but experiencing their world.""""I'm thrilled to be part of Sounds Like Friday Night,"" added A.Dot. ""Each week I'll be meeting fellow music fans from around the UK, getting the lowdown from the viewers on social media and bringing the best music to you at home. I can't wait!""Sounds Like Friday Night has been given an initial run of six episodes - neatly echoing Top of the Pops, which was commissioned for half a dozen episodes in 1964.That programme ended up running for 42 years, registering its highest audience in 1979, when more than 19 million people tuned in to see Dr Hook's When You're in Love with a Beautiful Woman topping the chart.But by 2002, it had lost millions of viewers to 24-hour music channels like MTV. The show was eventually shunted to BBC Two before being cancelled.Music has continued to play a key role on BBC Four, with archive espiodes of TOTP appearing alongside music documentaries and the new Live Lounge show, which compiles the best live acts on BBC Radio 1.On BBC Two, Later... With Jools Holland is celebrating its 25th anniversary, while coverage of Glastonbury, T in the Park and the Reading and Leeds festivals are televised throughout the summer.The music industry has received the new show enthusiastically.""The BBC is a fantastic supporter of British music across its radio output, and we have been encouraging senior BBC executives over the last few years to step up and do more to showcase Britain's amazing music culture to the nation on television too,"" said Geoff Taylor, head of the BPI, which represents the UK's recorded music industry.""We are thrilled at this new opportunity for some of this country's unique talent to reach a mainstream TV audience. We wish the series every success in the hope that it will become a long-term fixture on our screens.

entertainment	Zara Larsson: The pop star with sleep paralysis	She suffers from sleep paralysisShe's shaken off her talent show pastShe doesn't listen to other bands at festivalsPeople think she sounds like RihannaDon't expect her to hold back on social mediaHer dad could have you killed (probably)She won't sing lyrics that disrespect womenExercise is not her friendHer goal is to keep improving	"In Sweden, she's been a star since she was 10 - but Zara Larsson has her eyes set on global domination.Aged just 19, the star has racked up seven hits in the last 14 months, including the tropical pop smash Lush Life, which spent more than a year on the charts.Along the way, she's collaborated with Tinie Tempah and sung the official anthem of Euro 2016, but the highlight of her year was supporting Beyonce at Wembley Stadium.""It was the best show on a tour I've ever seen. Wembley's such an incredible stadium. It's definitely one of the stadiums I want to stand on and have my own tour, one day.""Although she's already scored a number one single and album in her home country, Zara is starting from scratch in the UK - and releases her debut album, So Good, this week.Outgoing and dynamic, she talked the BBC through her career to date. Here's everything you need to know (and a few things you probably didn't) about Sweden's latest pop sensation.Writing on her Swedish-language website two years ago, the 19-year-old revealed she frequently has episodes of sleep paralysis.""Oh my God, it's scary!"" she tells the BBC. ""Basically, you wake up and you literally cannot move. Your brain is active, but your body is not yet awake.""It's weird. It lasts half a minute maybe - but it kind of feels like you're trapped there for half an hour.""I get it a lot when I'm stressed out, or when I have a lot of things going on.""But Zara says there's an upside, too. Often, as she falls asleep, she's overcome by a sense of tremendous wellbeing (to paraphrase a certain Blur song).""It's like a wave comes over me. Energy is just vibrating through your body and it's awesome.""In 2008, Zara entered Talang Sverige - Sweden's version of Britain's Got Talent - mainly because there was no age restriction, unlike X Factor or Swedish Idol.Singing a heavily-accented, but vocally powerful, version of Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On, she won the contest, and its 500,000 krona (£42,600) prize.""I sounded like a little guinea pig!"" she laughs. But, incredibly, the contest led to nothing.""Nobody really wanted to sign me, which I was devastated about,"" she says. ""I was like, 'oh my gosh, my career's over and it hasn't even started yet!'""I didn't really want to do anything with Nickelodeon or Disney, so I just went back to school.""The break may have saved her. Rather than becoming a novelty act, washed up before she was a teenager, Zara re-emerged as a bona fide pop artist on her 15th birthday, with an EP that turned people's heads.""When I released the first song, a lot of the people didn't even recognise me,"" she says. ""And the people that did were like, 'Oh my gosh, it's her!'""So in Sweden, the talent show is like super-irrelevant. And that's great because usually it's very hard to wipe off that kind of Got Talent stain.""It just stays on you - but it didn't for me.""...As we discovered when we played a game of ""So Good or So Bad?"" with Zara (watch above)When Zara released Lush Life in January last year, a lot of people thought it was Rihanna's comeback single.""I don't know where it comes from but even my mom is like, 'You sound like Rihanna,'"" says the singer.""I was very confused because I'd never really listened to her until pretty recently. It's not a bad comparison to have but I'm never going to be Rihanna, and I'm not trying to be.From the moment Zara fired up her Instagram, pulled a condom over her leg and called out guys who ""think they're too big to wear protection"", it was clear Zara wouldn't be sticking to the record company script.Since then, she's voiced her support for Kesha - who is suing famed record producer Dr Luke for alleged sexual assault - and engaged in a war of words with R&B star Chris Brown, calling him ""a sexist, homophobic, transphobic trash"".""That's who I am,"" says the star. ""I don't really have a 'vision' of who I want people to see me as.""I just post whatever I feel like.""Larsson was born in Stockholm at the tail end of the 1990s, moving to the suburbs when her younger sister Hanna was born.She was always singing - showing off to her parents' dinner-party guests; and serenading ""ladies on the subway, when I was like three"".But she didn't come from a musical family. Far from it.""My dad was a military man, working in Navy intelligence,"" she says, ""so I know he can keep secrets, definitely.""While the exact nature of his job remains classified, Larsson swears he was the model parent.""He's great and he's funny. You can ask him whatever and he always has the answer. Even if he doesn't, he will never admit it. So we had a lot of debates and discussions. That's the reason why I'm interested in everything.""Now he's actually studying again - he wants to be a professor in war science.""Potential boyfriends beware.Zara's breakout hit in the UK was Never Forget You - a duet with British producer MNEK that was written in just two hours.""We work really well together,"" she marvels. ""It's just no question marks. I feel very relaxed and honest and open with him. ""They collaborated again on Ain't My Fault, a sassy, sexy club track that became Zara's fifth top 20 hit, late last year.""We wrote it in five minutes,"" says Zara, ""Originally, it was about me stealing someone else's man. I was saying, 'It ain't my fault that you're not cute enough for him.'""But after submitting the song to her record label, the singer had second thoughts.""I was just like, 'Wait, hold up, I can't sing this'. It just didn't feel right. It felt like I'd broken the girl code, and I didn't want to do that.""As a child, Zara attended the Royal Swedish Ballet School.""I was very flexible,"" she says. ""It really taught me a lot about discipline and how to use my body. But these days I'm about as flexible as a… erm, a safe!""In fact, she's so out of shape that a brief session with her personal trainer ended in disaster.""I ran 200 metres and my trainer said, 'That was a great job, you ran pretty fast'.""I said, 'I know!' so he told me to do it a second time. And when I came back, I threw up.""""I'm on my way to becoming a true performer,"" the star wrote shortly after singing Lush Life on The Voice UK last year. So, does she not consider herself a fully-qualified pop phenomenon yet?""You're never finished,"" she says.""My inspiration for performing is Beyonce.

entertainment	Coldplay beat Robbie Williams to UK number one album	It's beginning to sound a lot like Christmas	Coldplay have fended off competition from Robbie Williams to score their eighth consecutive UK number one album.Their new LP, Everyday Life, beat the former Take That singer's new festive collection The Christmas Present.Coldplay scored 81,000 chart sales this week, while Williams sold 67,000.That gives the band the third fastest-selling album of the year, behind Ed Sheeran's No. 6 Collaborations Project and Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent.All eight of Coldplay's albums - from their 2000 debut Parachutes to now - have topped the album charts.Last week, the UK four-piece told the BBC's Colin Paterson they have put their plans to tour the record on hold, due to concerns over the environmental impact of big concerts.Instead of spending months on the road, they played two gigs in Jordan, which were broadcast for free to a global audience on YouTube.Rod Stewart's orchestral new album, You're In My Heart, rounds off an all-new top three.On the singles chart, Dance Monkey by Australian singer Tones and I spends a ninth week at the top, meaning she now boasts the longest-running number one track of 2019, overtaking Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber's I Don't Care.End of Youtube post by Tones And ITones and I also has the third longest-running number one track ever by a female artist in the UK - just behind Rihanna's Umbrella and Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, which are both on 10 weeks.Robbie Williams does claim a curious new chart feat by achieving the fastest-selling cassette release in almost two decades, shifting nearly 10,000 copies on tape in the last seven days.The last album to sell more cassettes in a single week was Now 52 - featuring such tracks as Just a Little by Liberty X and George Michael's Freeek! back in 2002.The 45-year-old's seasonally-themed record features guest appearances from the aforementioned Stewart, Jamie Cullum, Helene Fischer, Bryan Adams and boxer Tyson Fury.Williams remains one of the bookies' favourites to snag this year's UK Christmas number one single, up against the likes of Lewis Capaldi, Stormzy, Little Mix, James Blunt and whoever wins The X Factor.Michael Ball and Alfie Boe - who are back together for a third album - are an outside bet for this year's Christmas number one.And momentum is gathering online to get Mariah Carey or Wham! to the top of the Christmas musical tree for the first time. This year marks 25 years of Carey's classic All I Want For Christmas Is You.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
entertainment	George the Poet: I turned down MBE over 'evil' of British Empire	'Intergenerational disruption'	"George the Poet, the spoken word artist and award-winning podcast creator, has said he turned down an MBE because of the ""pure evil"" of the British Empire.He made the revelation in the final episode of his BBC Sounds series Have You Heard George's Podcast?, in which he discusses the legacy of colonialism.A recipient of an MBE becomes a Member of the Order of the British Empire.But George the Poet said the ""colonial trauma inflicted on the children of Africa"" meant he was unable to accept.He told listeners he initially said yes when a friend asked him whether he would accept. The friend then nominated him - but when the honour was formally offered, he felt ""a burning sensation in my chest"".He said: ""I'd like to apologise to the friend who recommended me on my assurance that I'd accept, I didn't know I would feel this way.""I see myself as student, admirer and friend of Britain, however the colonial trauma inflicted on the children of Africa, entrenched across our geo-political and macro-economic realities, prevents me from accepting the title Member of the British Empire.""He continued that while ""the gesture is deeply appreciated, the wording is not"".He added: ""It will remain unacceptable to me until Britain takes institutional measures to address the intergenerational disruption brought to millions as a result of her colonial exploits.""I have no issue with other black people who have embraced this title, I encourage variety of thought across our society and within my community.""I encourage future generations to seek the relevant information to make an informed decision.

entertainment	Olafur Eliasson: Will Gompertz reviews the Danish-Icelandic artist's show at Tate Modern ★★★☆☆	Laura Hackett, BBC Radio 4 Today's student journalist critic of the year	"This week's review is different. It is, as they say in the land of promotions, a two-for-one.We are looking at Olafur Eliasson's new exhibition at Tate Modern from two perspectives: mine, and further down this page, Laura Hackett's (winner of the Radio 4 Today programme's student critic of the year award). We see things a bit differently…There are few crystal balls as opaque as the one into which museum folk stare to see how many punters might turn up to a forthcoming exhibition. Words like ""blockbuster"" or ""niche""' get bandied about by curators, marketeers, and Dave from finance (whose opinion is never sought and ignored when proffered).In my time working at the Tate I sat in countless such meetings. Sometimes we got it about right. Sometimes we erred (too high for Dalí & Film, which was a turkey; too low for Edward Hopper).But there was one occasion in 2003 when we truly excelled ourselves.Our guesstimate for an installation in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall by an unknown Nordic artist was so spectacularly wrong that we were left with no other choice but to blame Dave.We thought around 100,000 people would come to see Olafur Eliasson's The Weather Project during its six-month run. Of course, we hoped for a few more because it had been very expensive creating the giant sun effect in such a big space (lots of mirrors on the ceiling).But we had to be realistic.In the end over two million visitors came to see and experience what would become the most famous piece of immersive art in the world.It was epic in every sense: an instant masterpiece that was the making of both Tate Modern and Olafur Eliasson.Sixteen years later he returns to Tate Modern with a career retrospective that doesn't include a re-installation of his giant, misty ""Sun"", to the huge and obvious disappointment of a couple of London cabbies to whom I was talking.However, it does have some other notable pieces of his signature immersive art.The best of which by some distance is the aptly named Your Blind Passenger (2010), which is the Danish term for a stowaway. It consists of a long walkway of bright, white fog that makes seeing much beyond your outstretched arm impossible. If you're a skier or a hiker, you'd call it a white-out: if you live in Beijing now or were in London in the '50s it is reminiscent of dense smog: a peasouper.Except, the environment Eliasson has created is sweeter (literally, the mist is sugar-based) and gentler.You will be disorientated and restricted but the discombobulated feeling is more of purity and wonderment than fear or repulsion. Keep walking and the optical effects start happening.But you must be alone.If you see someone else the impact is severely diminished.It is typical of Eliasson's thoughtful, quietly provocative art, which when at its best stimulates your senses and your mind.That's the case with Your Uncertain Shadow (2010), another stand-out work in an otherwise slightly disappointing show.It is exploring his primary artistic concerns of light and colour, environment and perception. You walk into a white-walled gallery that doesn't look much until you stand in front of five floor-mounted coloured spotlights and look on the back wall. There you will see, and be enchanted by, your silhouette writ large in five overlapping pastel shades.Eliasson is at his best when there's an element of playfulness in his work, which is evident again in Beauty (1993), a black-box room with misty water falling from the ceiling through beams of light.He is less convincing when being overly earnest, as with the scaffold waterfall situated outside the building.There's no doubt he is a very good artist with important things to say.But this show somehow fails to capture his spirit. It feels disjointed and thin, which is incredible given how prolific Eliasson has been over the years.Maybe Dave has decided to flex his muscles and imposed some budget restrictions?Eliasson's exhibition doesn't have an obvious entrance. There are doors, yes, but the viewer's experience begins long before that. Outside, you can't avoid his waterfall. With its scaffolding laid bare, the huge sculpture is a testament to the human power to get inside nature and remake it in our own image, but also nature's power to get inside us. Stand beside it and close your eyes, and the busy urban landscape is replaced by an elemental non-human scene.The waterfall stands beside a Tate cafe, and if you're peckish you can enjoy a set menu created in conjunction with the chefs at Studio Olafur Eliasson - vegetarian offerings designed to be shared and eaten slowly. The philosophy behind this exhibition has entered you before you have really entered it.If you take the lift, you might wonder whether the museum's lights are faulty, but you are in a rebirth of Eliasson's 1997 Room for one Colour - mono-frequency lamps reduce everything to yellow and black, and the uncanny atmosphere continues in the blindingly bright foyer.Eliasson's art is not contained to the exhibition space; it spills outside, refusing the idea of a frame.Inside the exhibition proper, some of the Scandinavian artist's best known pieces from the past 20 years find new meaning.The giant moss wall, which will dry out, be watered, and re-grow over the course of the exhibition, has a new sense of urgency in the context of climate crisis. Its overwhelming size is concurrent with its vulnerability, and a sense of misplaced-ness in this pristine environment.But often it's the viewer who feels out of place. Water trickles outside the windows, to simulate rain, serving as a reminder of the falsity of our constructed indoor worlds. Buildings are recalibrated as not only forces of protection, but also imprisonment, separating us from the natural world.One room is empty, with bright white walls, until you walk in and your silhouette appears in five colours. This piece is titled Your Uncertain Shadow - you might create the art, but your silhouette is split up. You lose structural integrity. Another features a rotating irregular blotch of light which manages to be at once cosmic and embryonic, unbearably close and unimaginably distant.If the posters are anything to go by, Your Uncertain Shadow is the leading image of the exhibition, but for me the stand-out piece was Beauty, a darkened room with a spotlight shining through falling mist. As you tip-toe around (this is a space which implicitly demands silence), you might catch a glimpse of a rainbow, and watch the mist change pattern and direction.Eliasson says Beauty demonstrates our capacity to see different things but still be together. It does this, but even more powerfully, it manages to create a space which is both inside and outside, not simply in-between. It forms the climax of an exhibition whose resounding message is the mutual implication of mankind and our environment, an implication which Eliasson believes should be celebrated, but also recognised as a responsibility to protect the world we live in.★★★★☆Recent reviews by Will GompertzFollow Will Gompertz on Twitter"

entertainment	Lee Krasner: Will Gompertz reviews the 20th Century's unsung artist	Recent reviews by Will Gompertz	"Lee Krasner was in Paris when she received the call.It was sometime around midday on Sunday 12 August 1956. The American artist had never been to the French capital before, although she'd been inspired by others who had, namely Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh.She was not impressed by the Louvre, the scale of which she found overwhelming and the art ""unbelievably bad"". The news she was about to receive would be much, much worse.There had been an accident back home, she was told. Her husband, who had stayed at their East Hampton house on Long Island, New York state, while she went on her European adventure, had crashed his convertible car at 10pm the night before.There were two female passengers in the overturned vehicle. One had been killed, the other, Ruth Kligman, was OK.And then this: the driver, the man she had married 11 years earlier, the painter she had supported through all his artistic difficulties and battles with alcoholism, the one person on Earth with whom she truly connected, had not survived.Jackson Pollock was dead.When they first met, in the early 1940s, Krasner was considered the more accomplished artist. But ever since Mural (1943), Pollock's huge, ground-breaking, abstract painting, it had been her husband's work that garnered all the attention. The shadow his fame had cast over her own career as a significant player in post-war American Expressionism looked as if it would only grow longer with his death.And so it did. Jackson Pollock became a mythical figure: immortalised in Hans Namuth's photographs, romanticised as a troubled genius, and fought over by billionaires and institutions desperate for a signature piece. (It's amazing what dying will do for an artist's career.)Meanwhile, Lee Krasner went about her business as an artist, while also taking on the additional burden of looking after her deceased husband's estate. Legal tussles, legacy issues and authentication meant this was no easy taskTrue, she was exhibited, but there tended to be a Jackson shaped elephant in the room. Either her work was seen in the context of his, or he wasn't mentioned at all. Neither approach was satisfactory. She remained in his shadow even after her death in 1984.That was 35 years ago. Now, at last, there is a confident, intelligent exhibition, presenting Lee Krasner in her rightful position as one of the most important painters of the 20th Century.There is no need for Jackson denial or comparison. His presence in her life is evident. It can be seen in material form in her collage Bald Eagle (1955), which contains paint splattered fragments of a Pollock picture. It can be felt, too…There is a small, dark room in this exhibition, in which hangs a series of four large paintings, inspired by Picasso's famous Les Demoiselles Avignon (1907). The first is ominously called Prophecy (1956). Krasner painted it in the summer of 1956 before her trip to Europe, when her husband's drinking was as bad as the state of their marriage. It is a bulbous, fleshy, awkward image: both anxious and hopeful, menacing and heavy. She said it ""disturbed me enormously"".A few weeks later, Pollock was dead. Krasner returned and immediately continued with the series, saying: ""Painting is not separate from life. It is one. Do I want to live? My answer is yes - and I paint.""The three subsequent works - Birth (1956), Embrace (1956), and Three in Two (1956) - are deeper, angrier, magnificent paintings. If you want to know what raw pain and loss feel like, spend a few minutes in this room. They are technically accomplished, complicated pictures, delivering an emotional charge that you won't quickly forget.Three in Two is like a Tarantino movie but without the humour. It is full of blood, gore and anger; a reflection on Pollock's fatal car crash perhaps, and the fact that there was a third person in their marriage - his lover, the sole survivor of the accident, Ruth Kligman.This room is the pivotal point of the exhibition. It is the apogee of Krasner's investigation into Cubist techniques and ideas, which started with her Nude Study from Life (1938), produced while she was a student of the German modernist Hans Hofmann. One glance at the wall on which this group of early drawings are exhibited and you will know why Hofmann said she was one of his finest students.She quickly moved into abstraction, producing a series of ""Little Images"" in the mid-1940s, including the excellent, Miro-like Abstract No. 2 (1946-48) and the blood red Untitled (c. 1948-49).There are misses among the hits, as you would expect from an artist who refused to settle on a single style, announcing rather grandly: ""I am not to be trusted around my old work for any length of time.""Her mid-1950s collages are a mixed bag. Burning Candles (1955) fails to settle as a composition and is strangely irritating to look at, while Blue Level (1955) is admirable for its bravado and risk-taking, but didn't do it for me. Unlike Bird Talk (1955) and the aforementioned Bald Eagle, both of which would be very welcome on one of my walls.As would any one of her giant abstract expressionist paintings from the mid-'60s. Unfortunately I don't live in a mansion or own a museum, or anywhere with the sort of wall space they'd need. But London's Barbican Art Gallery does, and they fill its central galleries, which, for once I am pleased to say, are pepped up with a little natural light.Here we see Krasner on an operatic scale, painting huge canvasses with looping strokes and a conductor's sense of rhythm. There is not a dud among them: painting after painting sings out from the walls in harmonious tones of red (Another Storm), orange (Courtship), green (Siren), or pink (Combat).Krasner said she liked jazz. You can not only see that in these paintings, you can hear it. Imagine seeing them alongside Kandinsky's series of Compositions - you'd need earmuffs!They are a wonderful way to end a wonderful show. Lee Krasner was full of colour and ideas and life, as is this exhibition. Do go and see it if you can.Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter"
entertainment	Cold War Steve: How the British artist designed new Time cover	'Synonymous with Brexit-era Britain'	"UK artist Cold War Steve has revealed he had to fight for the inclusion of Phil Mitchell, Cilla Black and Bungle in his artwork for Time magazine.The satirist rose to fame last year with online collages which mixed the chaos of UK politics with pop culture.His latest creation illustrates Time's international cover story: ""How Britain Went Bonkers, The Brexit Fiasco.""It features the Queen, PM Theresa May and Roger Daltrey on a double-decker London bus crashing into the Thames.MP Boris Johnson is also pictured waving a rather weathered Union Jack flag atop the sinking vehicle, in front of the Houses of Parliament.Cold War Steve, whose real name is Christopher Spencer, told BBC News he was shopping in his local Asda in Birmingham when the ""incredible"" email offer came through last week.""I was in the condiment section and saw it was from Time magazine in New York and I was like, 'bloody hell! This is it... break the States!'"" he says.""As with Brexit, America and the Trump administration is such a rich seam for my kind of work and we were thinking how on earth would we take this British brand of satire and humour to America?""The artist, who usually makes his montages in a day on his phone, sat solidly for a week on the computer making three bespoke ""typically British"" images for the US magazine.His work was eventually used for both the cover and the main feature, which was titled ""How Brexit broke Britain and revealed a country at war with itself"".It involved a lot of emails being exchanged, ""tinkering"" with the designs and haggling over which characters a largely US audience would understand, he explains.""I've not worked to such a specific brief before,"" explains Spencer, ""my work is usually pretty free-flowing - but for this one I had to bear in mind the primary audience is not British and they're not going to know who Sam Allardyce is or some minor actors on Coronation Street.""I think in one of the early drafts I put a sleeping Alan Brazil on the back of the bus and they circled it and said 'who is this?'""However, some of his own personal favourites, including ""everyman"" EastEnders character Phil Mitchell - played by actor Steve McFadden - and the late singer and TV presenter Cilla Black, who appear in all of his pieces, were not up for negotiation.You have to look closely at the cover to find them though.Mitchell can be seen on the lower deck of the bus, pictured behind Angela Merkel, while Black's tiny head can be just about spotted behind the Duke of Edinburgh.Spencer adds: ""Steve's not well known at all in America but they knew he had to be in there, the battle was how prominent he would be in the scene and he's gone from being fairly central to down on the bottom, but he's in there, which is the main thing.""I think I had to stamp some Cold War Steve on there, otherwise they could've done it themselves.""Unlike Mitchell and Black, Bungle from the 80s kids' TV programme Rainbow does not feature in the cover art, but does appear in one of his pieces seen inside the magazine.""There was a circle around Bungle and we had an email about whether or not Bungle is a person or an animal.""I said 'does it matter?' It's someone in a giant bear costume selling tea!""So yeah, there was a line drawn for Bungle, Cilla and Steve!""I'm conscious of not selling out as I have such a great audience on Twitter who've grown with me from the early days, so I've got to have them in my mind.""Earlier in the year, the artist told the BBC his work ""started as a coping mechanism,"" but that the overriding factor was that he wanted ""it to be funny and amusing more than anything"".Time Magazine has historically carried a range of provocative images on its cover, including US President Donald Trump, boxing champion Mohammed Ali being shot with arrows and practically naked images of John Lennon and Janet Jackson.Others have included the exclusive story of Ellen DeGeneres coming out as gay, Kanye West made up to look like Jesus Christ with a crown of thorns, and Adolf Hitler.The magazine described Spencer's work as being ""synonymous with the frenzied zeitgeist of Brexit-era Britain"".The country remains divided over Brexit. Labour narrowly beat the Brexit Party to hold their seat in the Peterborough by-election on Thursday, but Nigel Farage's new organisation came out on top in the European elections last month, taking 32% of the vote.The UK was originally meant to leave the European Union on 29 March this year but that was then pushed back to 12 April and eventually 31 October after the PM failed to get MPs to approve her deal.Speaking outside Downing Street last month, Mrs May - who officially steps down as leader on Friday - she said that it was ""matter of deep regret"" that she had failed to deliver Brexit.Before making his own artistic Brexit breakthrough as Cold War Steve, Spencer struggled for years and admits he actually used to mock up Time Magazine ""person of the year"" covers.While evidently not a fan of the result of the EU referendum, the cult figure admits that this turbulent period of British history has been ""one of the best"" for him on a professional level.It's provided him with ""the opportunity to satirise the crazy times we're in"".Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	'Fake' Botticelli painting is from artist's studio, English Heritage says		"Experts cleaning a supposed imitation of a Botticelli painting have discovered it was actually created in the Renaissance master's own studio.The work had been thought to be a later copy of the Madonna of the Pomegranate, painted by Sandro Botticelli in 1487.But English Heritage conservators changed their minds after scraping thick yellow varnish off the painting.Extensive tests showed it did in fact originate from Botticelli's 15th Century workshop in Florence.English Heritage said it had consulted experts at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Gallery to confirm the painting's origins.Rachel Turnbull, English Heritage's senior collections conservator, said: ""Stylistically it was too similar to be an imitation, it was of the right period, it was technically correct and it was painted on poplar, a material commonly used at the time.""After removing the yellowing varnish, X-ray and infrared examination revealed under-drawing, including changes to the final composition uncommon in straight imitations.""The painting had been assumed to be a later copy by an unknown artist because it varied in detail to the larger original, which is on display at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.""Botticelli, like other contemporary Florentine painters, had an active studio which issued versions and adaptations, presumably at lower prices, of works that were popular,"" according to Professor Paul Joannides, emeritus professor of art history at the University of Cambridge.""It is only relatively recently, with more highly developed methods of technical examination, that the status of such pictures can be - at least to an extent - determined.""The picture at English Heritage's Ranger's House in Greenwich, London, is now thought to be the closest version of Botticelli's 1487 masterpiece, which shows a melancholy Virgin Mary holding a baby Christ and a pomegranate, flanked by angels.It was bought by diamond magnate Julius Wernher in 1897 and kept with his art collection at the Georgian villa in Greenwich.Madonna of the Pomegranate will be on display at Ranger's House from 1 April.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Dua Lipa UK's most-streamed female artist		"Dua Lipa is the most-streamed female artist in the UK so far this year, according to figures from both Spotify and Apple Music.Her song One Kiss, with Calvin Harris, was the second most-streamed track on both sites, after Drake's God's Plan.Lipa's self-titled album was the third most-streamed record in the UK, and the fourth globally, on Spotify.The star, who won best female at this year's Brits, has just been announced as Vogue's January cover star.She is expected to pick up her first Grammy nominations when the 2019 shortlist is unveiled on Friday.Apple and Spotify are the two biggest streaming services, with more than 139 million subscribers between them.Their ""best of 2018"" charts show the dominance of hip-hop, with Drake, Post Malone and late rapper XXXTentacion all clocking up multiple entries.Drake was, unsurprisingly, the year's most-streamed artist after his fifth album, Scorpion, shattered streaming records in June.He clocked up 8.2 billion streams on Spotify alone - Apple does not release comparable data - while the single God's Plan was the most-played song in the UK and worldwide.In My Feelings, which sparked a hugely popular viral dance challenge, was in both Apple and Spotify's Top 10 as well.The Canadian star couldn't compete with The Greatest Showman, whose soundtrack was the most-streamed album on Apple Music.By contrast, the cast recording failed to make Spotify's Top 10 - although the breakout hit This Is Me by Keala, was the most-streamed song amongst listeners aged 35-44.Ed Sheeran, who was the biggest artist on streaming services last year, dropped to fifth place in 2018 - no mean feat, considering he didn't release any new material.Ariana Grande was the most popular female artist overall, with 49 million streams on Spotify alone.Latin music continued to grow rapidly, with J Balvin, Bad Bunny and Ozuna all breaking into the charts.Meanwhile, Spotify also produced a list of the fastest-growing music genres as part of its end-of-year round-up, which has been published with four weeks still to go.So gird your loins for the onset of Brega Funk, EMO Rap and something called Deep Talent Show in 2019.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Turner Prize 2018: iPhone artist Charlotte Prodger wins	Why she won - BBC arts editor Will GompertzPolitical concerns loom large	"A highly personal film shot by artist Charlotte Prodger on her iPhone, which recalls her experiences of coming out as gay in rural Scotland, has won her the prestigious £25,000 Turner Prize.The Glasgow-based artist, known for exploring queer identity, won the annual art award for two of her videos.One of those, titled Bridgit, was filmed entirely on her phone and features her reading from her diaries.Prodger said she was ""quite overwhelmed"" and ""very touched"" to win.""The stories that I'm telling, although they're mine and they're personal, are stories that a lot of people - I guess queer people - have experienced,"" she told BBC News.The award caps a good year for the 44-year-old, who has also been chosen to represent Scotland at the 2019 Venice Biennale.The judges said they ""admired the painterly quality of Bridgit and the attention it paid to art history"".Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the jury, said the winning artwork ""seems to make a lot of points for a younger generation"".He said: ""It deals with gender as unfixed, as something fluid, as something not always conforming to society's norms.""Charlotte Prodger's film Bridgit captures many of the themes of contemporary life. In her thoughtful, poetic meditation, she explores identity, gender, nationhood and how our subjective views can change.All of which is encapsulated in one film, shot rough and ready in fragments on an iPhone.It would have been impossible to make when the Turner Prize was first awarded in 1984.But it's now within the grasp of anybody with a smartphone and a story to tell.Bridgit is named after the Neolithic deity, while the other video in Prodger's winning exhibition is titled Stoneymollan Trail and traces a history of recent video formats and the artist's personal history.For the first time in the prize's history, all four artists were nominated for films, and the shortlist was also regarded as the most political ever.That political theme continued at the award ceremony itself, where Tate director Maria Balshaw used her speech to bemoan the pressures on students and schools that have led to a ""steady decline in the number of students who are enrolling for arts subjects"".She told the audience: ""It is not good enough - not good enough for young people, and not good enough for the future that we should wish for, for this country and the world"".The number of students taking GCSEs in subjects covering arts, design, media and performance have declined by around a quarter over the past five years.In her acceptance speech, Prodger also spoke in support of arts education and funding.""I wouldn't be in this room were it not for the public funding that I received from Scotland for free higher education, and then later in the form of artist bursaries and grants to support not only the production of work but also living costs,"" she said.Balshaw also talked about the recent arrest of artists in Cuba including Tania Bruguera, who created Tate Modern's current Turbine Hall commission.She said they were ""detained by Cuban authorities while defending their right to creative freedom"".The crowd cheered as she added: ""Our thoughts are with Tania and her fellow artists in Cuba"".The artist, who was arrested on Monday, shared the speech on her Facebook page on a post titled The World is Watching.The prize's other nominees included Forensic Architecture, a collective of architects, film-makers, software developers, journalists, lawyers and scientists whose investigations and reconstructions have provided decisive evidence in cases in countries including Germany, Greece, Israel and Guatemala.Then there was Luke Willis Thompson, who is inspired by stop-and-search policies and killings. His films include one made with Diamond Reynolds, who used Facebook to broadcast the aftermath of the fatal shooting of her partner, Philando Castile, by a police officer in 2016.The shortlist was completed by Naeem Mohaiemen, whose films use turbulent periods in world history to examine the legacies of colonialism, national identity, left-wing politics and migration.Prodger was presented with her prize by author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a ceremony at the Tate Britain gallery in London.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Hockney painting breaks auction record for living artist	Analysis	"A celebrated painting by British artist David Hockney has been sold at Christie's in New York for just over $90m (£70m) - an auction record for a work by a living artist.Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) had been forecast to fetch $80m (£62m).It sold following a 10-minute battle between two bidders via telephone, after the price passed $70m (£54m).The sale eclipsed the previous record held by US artist Jeff Koons.His stainless steel Balloon Dog (Orange) sold for $58m (£45m) in 2013.The packed sales room in New York broke into applause when the hammer fell, with the buyer's premium and commission taking the final price to $90.3m.Christie's did not name the successful bidder.The Hockney work was painted in 1972 and is one of the Yorkshire artist's most recognisable works.The composition of the two figures began as two separate photographs on the artist's studio floor and was completed in time for an exhibition at New York's André Emmerich Gallery in 1972.Christie's described it as ""one of the great masterpieces of the modern era"".Earlier this year, another of the 81-year-old's paintings sold for $28.5m (£22.2m) - a personal auction record for the artist.Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) was previously owned by record executive David Geffen, who sold it to British billionaire Joe Lewis in 1995 for an undisclosed sum.By arts editor Will GompertzThere is good reason for all the fuss over Hockney's huge canvas Portrait of an Artist. Painted in 1972, it unites the themes and ideas he was exploring in the late 60s and 70s with his famous ""swimming pool"" pictures and ""double portraits"".The two individual series are widely considered to be his best work.So the opportunity to buy a picture that combines both in a single wholly coherent and powerful image - by one of the world's most respected contemporary painters - is an opportunity that doesn't come along very often.That means the market-driven rules of supply and demand come into play, pushing the price up to the giddy heights of $90 million.Art dealer Stephen Howes said Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) was ""truly one of the most iconic paintings of the 20th Century"".The sale, he continued, ""galvanizes the piece's rightful place as a true masterpiece and further cements Hockney's place in the highest echelons of art history.""The painting is so well known it was even parodied in the cartoon series Bojack Horseman, as one eagle-eyed Twitter user noticed.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Review: Artemisia Gentileschi - forgotten portrait of artist who endured rape trial ★★★★★		"Great literature can be a good way of gaining an insight into art.For instance, Rodin's monumental sculpture The Gates of Hell (1880-90) is a complex work that becomes more comprehensible when you realise the artist's source material was Dante's Divine Comedy.Similarly, it helps to know Ophelia (1851), a painting by Millais, was inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet.The same applies to the art world, an opaque place that is occasionally illuminated by a gifted writer such as Tom Wolfe.But it takes a wordsmith of quite exceptional talent to produce a book to help us understand the truly baffling vagaries of today's art market.Fortunately there is such a writer.His name is Roger Hargreaves, and the book in question is his 1972 miniature masterpiece Mr Topsy-Turvy.No literary character better sums up the bizarre, seemingly cockeyed monetary value placed on art nowadays.In the book, Mr Topsy-Turvy goes to an art gallery and turns all the pictures upside down. One can only assume he walked happily past the auction houses having noted the sale prices were already the wrong way round.The amount of money being paid for modern and contemporary art in comparison to the sums fetched by the Old Masters will come to be seen as nonsensical as Pulp's Common People being kept off the number one chart spot by Robson and Jerome in 1995.Take Christopher Wool, for example. He is a good contemporary artist, But is he $30m good, which is around the figure someone paid at Sotheby's for his text piece UNTITLED, RIOT in 2015?Maybe.But if so, what does that make a painting by Artemisia Gentileschi worth, given that she was the greatest female artist of the Baroque period?Twice as much?Ten times more?Rather less, it turns out. The National Gallery in London paid £3.5m for her Self Portrait as Saint Catherine (c 1615-20).Admittedly, it wasn't in tip-top condition. There was a small tear in the canvas, the image was covered with a layer of yellowed varnish, and there were some obvious paint losses.Still, feels like a bargain when you think the gallery could have bought a 1978 Andy Warhol Oxidation Painting for roughly the same amount: a ""painting"" the artist made by asking a friend to urinate on a canvas.Instead it went for the Gentileschi, then passed it on to its conservation department to clean and restore before hanging it in the Central Hall alongside a group of other Baroque paintings, where it looks very good indeed. The picture has, as they like to say in auction houses, wall power.It also has a striking back story.Artemisia Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593. Her father, Orazio Gentileschi, was an artist heavily influenced by Caravaggio's dramatic ""chiaroscuro"" lighting technique, where the painter accentuates the contrast between light and dark to model forms and create a sense of theatricality.Soon, Artemisia was making her way as an artist in the roughhouse that was 17th Century Rome. She produced her first known work - Susanna and the Elders - when she was about 16.A year later, she was raped by an acquaintance of her father's called Agostino Tassi, the result of which was a trial that saw Tassi convicted, but only after Artemisia had endured torture to prove she was telling the truth. She left for Florence shortly afterwards.It was while in Florence she painted the National Gallery picture, in which she presents herself as the Christian martyr Saint Catherine, another woman who had endured torture at the hands of men.She faces us in a three-quarter pose with an inscrutable expression on her face. Her left hand rests on a broken wooden wheel (Catherine Wheel) inset with metal spikes, an implement that was intended to torture and kill her. Her right hand, which holds the martyr's palm, is held to her chest.A single light source makes her white sleeve appear to jump out of the picture.Your eye is then drawn towards the silky red sleeve of her dress and upwards towards her beady left eye, which is giving absolutely nothing away.The golden arch of the palm is echoed by her halo at the top of the picture, and her shawl at the bottom of the frame.It is a well-balanced, tonally sensuous painting, which is only slightly compromised by the proximity of the palm to the sitter's face (the same motif is better placed in another version she painted of the same subject, which is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence).For a painting that is almost 400 years old, it feels incredibly modern.Imagine if the sitter was a contemporary figure like Cindy Sherman, an artist who has also made a career out of depicting herself as other people?We would read it as a fresh and subversive image.Which it was and is.Artemisia Gentileschi was a woman operating in a man's world, making weighty pictures that celebrated and represented women. Her near identical pose in Self Portrait as a Lute Player, and the gruesome depiction of Judith Beheading Holofernes, both show a familiar image from a female point of view.It is a difference in attitude that can be seen by looking at Caravaggio's painting of The Lute Player and of Judith's murderous act.Same story, different perspective.Which brings us back to Mr. Topsy-Turvy."

The recording sessions were shown on a BBC One documentary.A BBC statement said: ""This is extremely disappointing, we know many of the contributors are also saddened by the news. It's important to remember what this album is about - helping the lives of disadvantaged children in need.""The public have been buying the album in huge volumes and that should be recognised. They should think again.""A spokesperson for the Official Charts Company apologised for not identifying it as a compilation sooner. A statement said: ""We understand and sympathise with Children In Need's concerns that their album will no longer feature in the UK's artist albums chart.""The album is on course to take the number one spot on the compilation albums chart and be the biggest-selling album of the week - which is a huge achievement, while raising money for such a deserving cause.""Got It Covered was described to us pre-release as an artist album, but on release it was clear that it was a various artists compilation, as it is widely credited as across retail and music services. We are sorry this fact was not picked up sooner, and we are huge supporters of all the incredible and important work Children in Need do and would urge everyone to continue to go out and buy the album.""Chart rules say the only compilations allowed in the main artist album chart must be by a single artist or orchestra, or soundtracks where all recordings are performed by the cast.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Sweeping changes coming to the Brit Awards		"The Brit Awards have announced a major revamp for 2020, with fewer awards and an end to fan votes.Organisers promise ""more music"" as a result, with artists being given full creative control of their performances.Prizes like best British video and best international group have been cut, while the outstanding contribution award has been retired for 2020.Despite press reports earlier this year, gendered awards for best male and best female will remain.The changes come after several years of falling ratings. This year's ceremony, which saw performances from Pink, Dua Lipa and George Ezra, was watched by 4.1m people, down 400,000 from 2018.The decision to scrap some of the awards makes for a more streamlined show, but fans of BTS are already angry about the loss of best international group.The full list of categories is as follows (all British unless noted otherwise].The biggest change, however, will be in the performances.The Brits say they will ""hand the stage to the artists booked to perform on the night without imposing any creative limitations"".The idea is to create more viral moments - like Kanye West's performance of All Night on a stage crammed with British rap talent, or Adele's simple but effective rendition of Someone Like You.Of course, the most surefire way to go viral is to fall off stage like Madonna in 2015, or one of Katy Perry's dancers (visually impaired by having a house for a head) two years later.But giving artists creative control could give ITV's censors a major headache.Earlier this year, Brits organisers stopped The 1975 from performing Love It If We Made It after they won best British group, due to lyrics about drug abuse.""There were a number of complications,"" said the band's manager Jamie Oborne, ""which included us not wanting to have the words changed and ITV not wanting Matthew shouting [swear words].""Under the new system, the performance would presumably be allowed to go ahead.Winners on the night will receive the classic Lady Britannia Brit statuette, which returns after nearly a decade's rest. Recent years had seen a bespoke ""remix"" of the design, by artists such as Damien Hirst and Anish Kapoor.And fan votes have been scrapped altogether - meaning an end to boy and girl-bands dominating categories like best single.This year, all awards will be decided by a 1,200-strong ""official voting academy"", made up of experts from all areas of the music industry.That's not necessarily a positive move, however, as fan votes were often the only way for phenomenally successful acts like One Direction, Girls Aloud and Little Mix to gain recognition.Brits chairman David Joseph explained the changes, saying: ""We will be putting creativity, British culture and exceptional performances at the heart of the show to make Brits night a world class celebration.""The awards should be a global platform for the artists of the year to create moments that live beyond the night itself. We are looking at everything to put on the best possible show.""The Brits launched in 1977 to mark the Queen's silver jubilee, but didn't return until 1982 - which means 2020 will be the 40th ceremony.Organisers say the event, at London's O2 arena next February, will mark the anniversary by paying ""tribute to to many unforgettable Brits moments that are now part of a rich and much loved heritage.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Will Gompertz reviews David Hockney's record-breaking Portrait of an Artist ★★★★★		"I once asked David Hockney how memorable images are created. ""I don't know,"" he said, ""but I've made some.""And so he has.Not least his 1972 painting, Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which broke the auction record this week for a work by a living artist when it sold for $90m (£70m).The reason it fetched the very high price is fairly easy to comprehend. Portrait of an Artist is widely considered to be one of Hockney's most accomplished paintings, uniting the two career-defining subjects that preoccupied him in the late 60s and 70s: swimming pools and double portraits.It's a two-for-one.Plus, it's unique.And it apparently has excellent provenance. Added to which, at least two people were very keen to own it (you'd need a big wall - it's a 7ft-by-10ft canvas).And that means the market-driven rules of supply and demand come into play, pushing the price up to such giddy heights. All of which tells us something about the nature of the art market but very little about the art.So, back to that original question, what makes it a memorable image?Structure is one factor. It has a geometric formality - squares, rectangles and triangles - that provides a coherent and solid framework in which the more complex effects Hockney wants to capture can be clearly expressed.He was particularly interested in evoking in the viewer the sense of looking through a thin film of disturbed surface water, which is one of the reasons why it was so important to have the figure swimming below.It works.But it wasn't easy.Hockney abandoned his first attempt after months of experimenting with different compositional angles, and various technical approaches to applying his acrylic paint.The water is not the only elemental motif the artist is attempting to convey pictorially. Air and light and temperature are all essential factors in our reading of this contemporary pastoral scene. It is hot and still and clear: An idyllic day for swimming in an idyllic landscape (based on photographs he took in the South of France).And so our senses are aroused and receptive, while our desire for order is satisfied by the simplicity of geometric shapes.It's a good start, but it is not what makes Portrait of an Artist a memorable image.Part of its magic lies in the feeling of space Hockney has created. It sounds like a fairly simple thing to achieve, but it is fiendishly difficult. Ultimately, it requires the artist to paint thin air.The master of this particular craft was the 15th Century Italian artist Piero della Francesca (1415 - 1492), to whom Hockney owes a large debt. Look at the great Renaissance man's masterpiece The Flagellation of Christ (c.1450s), and you will see where the 81-year-old Yorkshireman found inspiration for his own painting.There is that same feeling of space in Piero della Francesca's artwork, the same reliance on an architectural structure (emphasised in both cases with tiled paving), and the same compositional device of having two distinct, non-referring areas in which figures appear.Both paintings knowingly assert the single vanishing point: the Italian does so with buildings, Hockney uses two Cypress trees and an allusion to Mount Fuji in the background.That the similarities are so striking only goes to show that the man who became a famous face in the 60s with his gold lamé jacket, bleached blond hair and round glasses is not simply a pop artist, but a serious-minded contemporary painter who is producing pictures that refer back to centuries of image-making, from Fra Angelico to Paul Cezanne and beyond.Take a good look at those hills in the background of Portrait of an Artist and you will see the Pointillism of Georges Seurat.And note the cropping of the swimming pool to create dynamism, which is reminiscent of Degas, and the bright colours of his high-key palette nod to Matisse.It is this combination of influences filtered through his temperament and experiences that lend Hockney's painting an air of permanence: it appears at once modern and classical. All of which contributes to making it a memorable image.But there is one factor above all others that gives the painting its wall-power.And that is its psychological charge.Like Edward Hopper's Nighthawks or a Lynette Yiadom-Boakye imagined figure, Portrait of an Artist has an uncanny atmosphere that draws you in.Who are these two men?Why are they so detached?Is it Narcissus peering down at his reflection?Or are they lovers?Were they lovers?Will they become lovers?What is on their minds?There is an unspoken and unresolved tension between the two figures. They exist in separate worlds. One is vertical and on dry land, the other horizontal and submerged. We can see the face of the standing figure but the man in white swimming trunks is a total mystery.Even when you know the backstory to the painting the psychological impact remains. It came about when Hockney noticed two random photographs side-by-side on his studio floor (one of a man swimming taken in 1966, the other of a boy looking down) and saw immediately that the combination would make for a compelling composition (the man standing by the pool was eventually modelled on his ex-boyfriend Peter Schlesinger from whom he had recently split).Although the painting is a partly staged collage of multiple sources, it has an inherent authenticity.It rings true.There is something in the mood it captures that is universal and relatable and as old as time. Man alone in Arcadia with only his thoughts and memories for company.It is a beautifully balanced composition that pleases the eye, with a subject - reflection - that gives our minds food for thought.It plays with our hearts and our heads.And that is what makes it such a memorable image."
entertainment	Artist sells 'Swiss passports' in UK ahead of Brexit		"Visitors to the Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery in London are normally intent on buying art. But for 24 hours this weekend it's open for the issue of Swiss passports - at a bargain price. The issuing authority isn't the Swiss government but American artist Tom Sachs.Tom Sachs has previously set up his temporary installation Swiss Passport Office in Brooklyn and San Francisco.On offer (in a batch of 3000) are apparently convincing facsimiles of a Swiss passport, which Sachs describes as ""one of the most desirable travel documents ever"".People who turn up at the gallery in Mayfair first have to lodge 20 euros with the receptionist and have their photograph taken before filling in an application form. No sterling currency will be accepted. Eventually applicants are ushered into an office to be quizzed by one of four officials seated at desks.Some of the information required is standard. But questions such as ""Have you ever supported evil?"", ""How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?"" and ""How many of its Instagram followers has the BBC bought?"" go beyond the usual.Sachs, who's 52 and from New York, says he doesn't believe in the concept of borders. ""But like money it's an illusion we all live and die by. So a passport is a symbol of that - and of course the right passport can be hugely beneficial to the holder.""I would claim that the passports we're issuing in London are the real thing - it's just not authorised by the Swiss government but by my studio. It might not work to get you through Heathrow Airport but it might still work other places. My 14 year-old nephew used it to get his first tattoo.""Though initially convincing, the wording inside the passport might tip off even the least attentive immigration officer. One image is labelled ""280 truckloads of Nazi gold laundered through Switzerland - estimated $7 billion net worth"".But there are other passports in demand around the world. So did Sachs consider manufacturing US passports?""For parts of my family it was always the Swiss passport that got you out of Nazi Germany. It's the Swiss passport that allows you to avoid taxes all over the world.""It's the passport that represents the most elite culture in the world that's also the most polyglot culture. It's the golden ticket so that was why it was the right document for our art installation.""In part, Sachs is in London for the annual Frieze Art Fair. ""But also because you're six months from Brexit I thought there'd be a real pertinence and even poignancy.""Or look at what's going on in the US with the Mexican wall or look at Syria. There are refugee issues around the world. But at the moment there's nowhere better than London to be talking about matters of immigration and national identity.""The passport Sachs carries is the dark blue of America, not the red of Switzerland. So is he considering changing that? He thinks for a moment. ""Not at this time.""The Swiss Passport Office is open for business at the Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery in central London only until 6pm Saturday 6 October. It's then open for viewing but will not issue travel documents. Even for people with euros.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"An artist in India is challenging sexist drawings of women in comic books by parodying them using male heroes in poses typically associated with women.She-Hulk has superhuman strength and speed and is one of the most formidable hand-to-hand combatants in the Marvel world.Like Hulk, not only does she have physical power, she's also completely green.Yet, on a 1991 comic book cover, she is shown in a seductive pose, wearing a G-string bikini, with her curves sharply accentuated.Indian artist Shreya Arora was shocked when she saw the image.""For Hulk, the visual representation focuses on his strength. For She-Hulk, all we see is an emphasis on sexuality,"" says Arora, who grew up reading comic books.The 21-year-old graphic designer decided she wanted to flip the narrative.Her artwork draws inspiration from comic book covers but parodies the male superheroes using body language typically associated with women.The result - covers with familiar characters, such as Superman and Batman, in strikingly unusual poses and outfits.A scantily-clad Spiderman is pictured in only a thong, a coy Hulk covers himself with a newspaper, while an Iron Man with prominent buttocks crawls on a ledge.""The way female heroines are drawn would never be applied to men,"" Arora tells BBC 100 Women.Marvel, DC and other publishers in the comic world have been accused of sexism before.But Arora, who is in her third year at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, says she only noticed the issue while she was studying in France.""Maybe seeing comics with text in a language I wasn't familiar with, made me focus more on the visuals,"" she says.Part of the problem is that ""comic books are very often drawn by men, for men to enjoy"", she argues.""The current depiction of superheroines exists because of this vicious cycle. Companies decide on a specific target market and then use that demographic as a reason to continue the same problematic process of content creation.""I wish comic book publishers would see that there is definitely a market for more inclusive comics.""Her project has been criticised for not acknowledging that comics show not only female characters with unrealistic body shapes and poses, but male ones too.Arora maintains the comics are misogynistic, particularly on the front covers.""Body standards for men, with huge biceps and rock-hard abs, exist to make them look strong and powerful, which superheroes are known for,"" she says.""The body standards for women are tweaked to make them look sexy.""People deem the body types of real-life athletic, strong women, like Serena Williams, 'too masculine'.""If creators wanted to make superheroines look strong, they have plenty of real life inspiration to choose from.""Arora is working on other projects that look at sexist representations of the female body and gender imbalance in media.She is behind a bogus magazine ad showing a woman with zipped-up lips, unable to speak out against domestic abuse.Her image of a magazine cover has the headline, ""Why getting sexually assaulted is your fault"" - a prompt to start a conversation about victim-blaming.""While there are a lot of young, passionate artists currently working on social issues and starting important conversations, even these conversations have a privilege bar - people with access to the internet, fluent in English, and to an extent, visually literate,"" says Arora.""But there are people in India and other countries, who do not fit these criteria. I want to bridge the gap between all this good intent, and the lack of impact at a grass-roots level"".Produced by Valeria Perasso, social affairs correspondent for BBC Languages.BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

Prosecutors said ""a rival rap artist was the intended target"".However, he has not been charged in relation to that shooting.Real name Bill K Kapri, the hip-hop star faced a maximum of 10 years in prison, and prosecutors had pushed for a sentence of eight years. The court heard he was alleged to have beaten up a prison guard while awaiting sentencing.US District Judge Federico Moreno acknowledged that Black had made anonymous donations to charity in the past.Black's lawyer Bradford Cohen told BBC News: ""After the court was apprised of all the facts and circumstances of this case and the good charitable work that Bill has done over the years, the court rejected the government's request of 96 months and sentenced Bill to 46 months.""The MC has had a number of legal charges and spells in prison in recent years, and is known for his violent lyrics.His debut studio album Painting Pictures went to number three in the US in 2017.The follow-up went to number two, and a third album, Dying to Live, reached number one last December.

I loved her to bits and will miss her enormously.""Ayres' first solo show was staged in 1957, and she took part in a number of influential exhibitions in the 1950s and '60s.She went on to have solo shows at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 1983, the Tate Gallery in 1995, and the Royal Academy of Arts in 1997.She had been elected to the Royal Academy in 1987, and 15 of her works are now in the Tate collection.Last year, she had major solo exhibitions at the National Museum Wales in Cardiff and at CAFA Art Museum in Beijing.She never painted portraits or landscapes. ""Shapes. Spaces. It's the way I see the world,"" she once said.""To me, art - colour in art - is wonderfully indulging. I don't see why you shouldn't be filling yourself up, making yourself happy. Enjoying yourself. Feasting on beauty.""I want an art that's going to make me feel heady, in a high-flown way.

entertainment	Black Midi: 'We'd rather be terrible than middle-of-the-road'	'It's kind of silly really'School of (experimental) rock	"From the Brit School to the Mercury Prize, Black Midi are defying all musical convention.For even the most hyped of new acts, having your song played on national radio is a huge deal. Such slots are viewed as premium cultural real estate.So for Black Midi to be given carte blanche to ""fill 10 minutes with whatever they fancy"" ahead of the drivetime news felt like a strangely watershed moment.The experimental young guitar slingers were afforded the luxury by 6 Music DJ Steve Lamacq in June, around the release of their Mercury-nominated and divisive debut album Schlagenheim.The 43-minute LP is made up of tracks born out of similarly lengthy impromptu jam sessions, where they would ride the waves of repetition until they could see something resembling the musical shore.While the prospect of improvising to millions of listeners would give your average new indie band heart palpitations, frontman Geordie Greep says they are more comfortable wigging out on air than being plagued by the protocol of playing three-minute pop songs.""It's quite silly how people break up music a lot of the time with 'it has to be this long for whatever,'"" he tells the BBC.""Because when you listen to an album, even though a lot of the songs are separated, you just hear it as one song, you know?""When you think of an album you like, you might think of it song by song - but it is just one thing.""So the whole politics of it are kind of silly really.""""Stuff like [their 6 Music appearance] is quite fun to do,"" Greep goes on. ""And the pressure of having it live on the radio is quite cool, I think.""When we made the album, what we tried to do is have it as a separate thing to how the songs are live, so that it's not a game of trying to replicate it.""Just the two things both have their own pros and cons, and people can like the album and like the live show without having to compare.""Black Midi's wildly eclectic debut has been described by critics as everything from thrilling to frustrating.Greep says they don't mind being the Marmite band of the moment, loved and loathed in equal measure.""That's never a bad sign,"" he laughs. ""At least that kind of implies passion or whatever. There's nothing worse than something mediocre.""Even if something's terrible, at least there's something to talk about there.""The Mercury Prize panel clearly fall into the former camp, having named them on the 12-strong list for Thursday's prestigious annual album award.They're known for tipping their collective cap to one jazz act (Seed Ensemble this year), but Black Midi's often uncategorisable sound and Greep's off-kilter vocals make them another left-field selection.Another tradition is for each nominee to perform a track in front of their peers and the Greater London four-piece are unlikely to find the event's organisers as accommodating as Lamacq.Near DT MI, their record's only sub three-minute track, or the more ""radio-friendly"" Ducter seem like potential candidates to be played on the night.Others, like Western, breach the eight-minute mark and, in the case of lead single Bmbmbm, descend into a kind of repetitive madness that would even test fans of The Fall.The 19-year-old cites Marvin Gaye and Frank Zappa as his two main musical influences but the band, who met at The Brit School, call to mind classic Krautrock from the likes of Neu! and Can when they are at their motorik best.Their old school may have helped launch the careers of such pop stars as Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. Yet its latest graduate singer suggests there was always room for more ""adventurous"" abstract sounds on the syllabus.""Obviously those people will be the ones known as coming from the Brit school because they are making middle-of-the-road music,"" claims Greep. ""So they are inevitably going to be the names that are said.""But there's a lot of people, producers and stuff, who you would never expect to have gone that also did go to the school, so it's like quite a false stereotype of it.""They really do push you to listen to all sorts of stuff and try out all different forms of music and it's never steering you into a mainstream kind of direction - it's whatever you want to do.""Schlagenheim is out now.

entertainment	Hail Satan?: The Satanists battling for religious freedom		"Everything you know about Satanism is wrong.At least that's what a new documentary about the Satanic Temple could be about to prove.Despite the similarity of the name, the Temple is different to The Church of Satan, established in 1966 by chat show circuit celebrity Anton LaVey in San Francisco, California.Human sacrifice? Wrong. Blood drinking? Wrong. Black Mass? Well, sort of right.The Temple was founded in 2013 with a mission statement ""to encourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense and justice, and be directed by the human conscience to undertake noble pursuits guided by the individual will"".Hail Satan? directed by US film-maker Penny Lane, follows the Temple's attempts to curtail what they see as the encroachment of Christianity on US life through its growing political influence.That creeping theocracy results in a monument to the Ten Commandments being offered pride of place at the Oklahoma State Capitol building in Oklahoma City.The Temple's response is to ask for a space for their own statue of the Satanic deity Baphomet in a bid to restore some kind of cosmic religious balance, all the while preaching a doctrine in support of social justice and human rights.""We want people to evaluate the United States being a Christian nation,"" the Temple's spokesman Lucien Greaves says in the film's trailer. ""It's not"".""I had heard about the Satanic Temple when they were doing their campaign in Oklahoma,"" says Lane.""I thought it was a very funny joke from afar, that they were sort of pretending to be Satanists, but I discovered they had at that point 50,000 members.""The more I looked into it, the more rich and confusing and provocative and interesting it became.""The film follows the eloquent, intelligent Greaves as he and his fellow Satanists encourage people to give blood, collect socks for the homeless, clean public beaches (using small pitchforks - a cute touch) and hold Satanic after-school clubs for children who are taught about the Temple's tenets which include:And although there is a certain theatrical, horror movie side to their Black Mass rituals in which they do invoke Satan, they freely admit none of them actually believe in Satan as an actual spiritual entity, leaning instead on the accurate translation of the Hebrew word Satan, which means ""adversary"".""I didn't find it that complicated or that hard to get that they had organised their religion around abstract and essentially fictional concepts,"" says Lane.""It is not a gimmick, you know, but it is a kind of acknowledgment that religion is fundamentally about things that are deeply believed, but not provable.""I came to understand that you don't need to literally believe in something to believe that it's important. I think human rights are fundamental, and I would die to protect human rights for other people. But I don't think human rights are some literal thing that exists in the world.""It doesn't work like that, like all the things that we believe, actually, as human beings are the most important thing, love and rights and freedom and justice, equality. These kinds of things are fair like made up things, they're just ideas.""While the documentary's energies largely focus on the Temple's attempts to have their beautifully sculpted bronze statue of Baphomet (with a torso modelled on Iggy Pop no less) erected on federal grounds, it also touches on the ""Satanic Panic"" wave of moral panic which swept across America during the 80s and 90s - driven by music, video games - even bizarrely, the Dungeons & Dragons board game.Far-right Christian organisations and authorities saw examples of Satanism everywhere.End of Youtube post by Dogwoof""It was this 10 to 15-year period, where there was a basic idea that there was a kind of organised, underground, secret conspiracy of Satanists that were kind of running around, doing evil things like murder and torturing animals and raping children and doing it in the name of Satan,"" explains Lane.""Many people had their lives ruined and in the most extreme example, went to prison for a very long time.""If you do any research into it, you would quickly see that there were no Satanists, there was no secret underground. As Lucien says in the film, he learned the real evil was in the witch hunt itself. And it's something that we have to remember as a society that we are capable of doing.""And there's been no attempt publicly, to come to terms with that period. It's like it just happened. And then it ended, and no one talks about it anymore. And I think the Satanic Temple really does want people to remember and to know more about what happened during that period.""Greaves (not his real name, he goes by several aliases to protect his family) himself receives life threats during the group's campaign and wears a bullet-proof vest to his statue's unveiling.""It was very clear that he was very concerned about protecting the identity of his family,"" says Lane. ""I don't think that is some kind of nefarious mystery. There's so many people that are perfectly happy to terrorise your family for fun.""I was very worried and am very worried for the safety of the people who appear in my film. They certainly, by agreeing to be in my film, expose themselves to far more risk in the world. And I am very aware of that and very concerned about that.""Whilst she is not a card carrying member of the Temple herself, it is clear Lane's sympathies lie with them and their aims.""I would say that my whole life I've been exceptionally confused by religious people,"" she adds. ""I just always thought... I know how bad it sounds, so I'm going to say it now. I really honestly thought that religion was basically some kind of like mental illness that needs to be treated better. I didn't understand it. I always just fundamentally kind of came out of the womb an atheist.""Hail Satan? is in cinemas & on demand from 23 August."
entertainment	Turner Prize 2019 shortlist is announced		"The four artists competing for this year's Turner Prize have been announced with investigative art, works blurring fact and fiction and explorations of oppression dominating the shortlist.The nominees are Lawrence Abu Hamdan, who is British but based in Beirut, London-based Helen Cammock and Tai Shani and Colombian Oscar Murillo.Their works will go on show at the Turner Contemporary in Margate from 28 September until January 2020.The winner is announced on 3 December.Arts editor Will Gompertz has been looking at the artists and their work.Beirut-based Lawrence Abu Hamdan is an artist more interested in the ear than the eye. He thinks of himself as an ""audio investigator"" who makes films, installations, and gives performative lectures based on earwitness (not eyewitness) accounts from oppressed individuals, or, in another project, from racially-profiled individuals who are being judged on the basis of how they pronounce certain words or syllables.Helen Cammock is also interested in sound and history. She too makes films and gives spoken word performances.But her area of investigation is past events and their histories; not a single, definitive written account but a variety of views and texts, which can be perceived differently when spoken by other people.Fellow London-based artist Tai Shani shares Cammock's interest in the written word and associated assumptions, depending on the gender and perceived status of the author.She also organises performances, makes films, and creates installations.The difference with Shani is she's not that interested in multiple viewpoints of history, more in creating alternative, almost gothic worlds that blur fact and fiction, or truth and myth, with the intention of disrupting a real world dominated by, and centred around, a white, western, male point of view.Oscar Murillo is a Colombian-British artist and the most established name on the shortlist.He became an instant art world hit when he first emerged on the scene six years ago. His work made huge sums for a relatively unknown 20-something artist.Things cooled for a bit - but now he's back, with his semi-abstract paintings on unstretched canvasses hanging limply like curtains in a bedsit with too few hooks.They are, in a way, more like objects in an installation than pictures to put on a wall. He, like his fellow nominees, is exploring the politics of identity, oppression, and marginalised people.The winner will be announced on 3 December 2019 at an award ceremony broadcast live on the BBC.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The entire collection was valued at around $350m.Edward Hopper was famed for his depictions of modern American life. He died in 1967. Chop Suey, which Mr Ebsworth bought for just $180,000 in 1973, portrays two women in conversation at a Chinese restaurant.The painter's previously highest selling work was East Wind Over Weehawken, which sold for $40.4m in 2013."
entertainment	Scott Walker, influential rock enigma, dies aged 76	Orchestral pop'Mahogany voice'	"Scott Walker, one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in rock history, has died at the age of 76.The US star found fame as a teen idol in The Walker Brothers, scoring hits with The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore and Make It Easy On Yourself.But his sonorous baritone hinted at something deeper - and his darker, experimental solo albums tackled the complexities of love, sex and death.Walker's death was confirmed by his current record label, 4AD.In a statement, they called the singer ""one of the most revered innovators at the sharp end of creative music"".Radiohead's Thom Yorke was among those paying tribute, describing Walker as ""a huge influence on Radiohead and myself, showing me how I could use my voice and words"".Born Noel Scott Engel in Ohio, 1943, Walker initially pursued a career as an actor, before hooking up with John Maus and Gary Leeds to form the misleadingly-named Walker Brothers.After a false start in the US, they relocated to England, where they caused a huge sensation, scoring number one hits with Make It Easy On Yourself and The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore.For a while, the band were as big as the Beatles, greeted by screaming fans everywhere they went.""It was fantastic for the first couple of albums or so but it really wears you down,"" Walker told the BBC's Culture Show in 2006,""Touring in those days was very primitive. It was really a lot of hard work. And you couldn't find anything good to eat. The hours were unbelievable.""At the height of their fame in 1967, when Walker was still considered a heart-throb and a potential superstar, he called time on the band and ran away to a monastery on the Isle of Wight. Not, as rumour had it, because of a nervous breakdown, but to study Gregorian chant.He remained disillusioned with the industry until his girlfriend introduced him to the music of Jacques Brel, whose literate, passionate torch songs inspired him to embark on a solo career.Walker's first four solo albums, Scott to Scott 4, juxtaposed lush, orchestral pop with dark existentialism; and his lyrics were frequently scattered with characters from society's margins - prostitutes, transvestites, suicidal thinkers and even Joseph Stalin.""He took music to a place that it hasn't actually ever been since,"" said musician Brian Eno who, like Jarvis Cocker and David Bowie, cites Walker as a key influence.Amid falling sales, Walker staged a brief, largely unsuccessful reunion with the Brothers in the mid-70s; then used a lucrative deal with Virgin Records to pursue some of his most abstract musical ideas on 1984's Climate of Hunter.The record divided fans and critics - it was reputedly Virgin's lowest-selling album of all time - and Walker bowed out of music and the public eye for almost a decade.""A friend of mine says I'm not a recluse, I'm just low-key,"" said the singer about his extended absence.""Generally if I've got nothing to say, it's pointless to be around.""When Walker returned in the mid-90s, it was with Tilt, a collection of fraught, uncompromising tone poems that marked a new creative chapter.""Imagine Andy Williams reinventing himself as Stockhausen,"" wrote The Guardian's Simon Hattenstone in a profile of the singer.Walker went on to collaborate with Pulp, producing the 2001 album We Love Life, and recently completed the score to Natalie Portman's film Vox Lux.In 2017, the BBC paid tribute to the star with a Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall.Musician Richard Hawley told the BBC in 2017 that Walker was ""one of the greatest singers of all time"".""You think he's singing something quite simple,"" he said. ""You think you can sing along in the bath. But when you actually sit down and analyse what he's doing, it's unbelievable.""Upon hearing of the star's death, poet Ian McMillan likened Walker's voice to ""a cathedral lit by a sunset.""Midge Ure of Ultravox described him as ""the man with the mahogany voice""; while singer Marc Almond said he was ""absolutely saddened [and] shocked"" by the news.""He gave me so much inspiration, so much I owe to him and modelled on him even down to my early hair cut and dark glasses,"" he added.Walker is survived by his daughter, Lee, his granddaughter Emmi-Lee, and his partner Beverly.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Spitting image: Can drool be art?		"Justine Varga's portrait of her grandmother has caused controversy after winning the Olive Cotton Award - Australia's top portrait prize worth A$20,000 (£12,000). The portrait, called Maternal Line, contains no face - and the artist used her grandmother's pen scrawls and streaks of her saliva to create the work. But is it art?Jackson Pollock made scrawly abstract drip paintings; 70 years later Justine Varga has made a scrawly abstract dribble painting. That's progress for you.People complained about his work back in the 1940s, and people are complaining about hers now. So it goes.Personally, I couldn't care less if she uses spit or sawdust to make her pictures (Warhol made images using urine), just as long as they are good.It's a little unfair of me to judge a large photographic portrait from afar, on a small computer screen splattered (non-artistically) in cooking fat, but I can see it is not rubbish.There's a touch of Twombly about granny's scribbles, and the way in which the green-grey rectangle appears to hover over the mauve background has a Rothko-like feel.Can I detect a pair of cartoonish eyes in the top right-hand corner, or am I seeing things?Whatever, I can't unsee them now - or the gnarly fingers just to their side, nor the translucent, ghostly figure looming below. Granny is beginning to give me the heebie-jeebies.I'm being too literal.Varga's idea here was to create an inner portrait, so it doesn't matter what granny actually looks like, this is about what she is like.I'm guessing from the combination of colours, texts, and overall composition that she is an unstuffy, unconventional lady, possibly prone irreverence, and - on occasion - spiritual.I think the image has an ethereal quality. We are definitely not in ""my five year-old could've done that"" territory here.This is a picture made by someone who knows what she is doing, with the gumption to take a different view of a ubiquitous genre.I like it.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Do digital echo chambers exist?	BBC Crossing Divides	"A common, and ostensibly common sense, assumption about the era we are living through is that social media is a primary cause of polarisation.I have often endorsed this idea, whether explicitly or implicitly, during my time at the BBC. Twitter has generally struck me as the industrialisation of confirmation bias. Facebook, a softer version of the same. And other platforms, such as Instagram, similar.But this claim - that our digital media habits are an exercise in the lazy endorsement of our prejudices - is itself lazy and full of prejudice.Asked to do a report on the link, if there is one, between social media and polarisation, or social fragmentation, as part of the BBC's Crossing Divides season, I surveyed the academic literature. You can watch our report from the Six o'clock News bulletin with some brilliant young people who met on a Facebook group called The Cabinet.Most of the academic work in this area points to the complexity of that link, and resists a clear causal connection. Indeed, for the most part, it comes down against the idea that the online world is full of echo chambers.The abstract for this commonly cited article in the journal Public Opinion Quarterly, by Seth Freeman, Sharad Goel and Justin M Rao, puts it succinctly:""Social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals"", the authors write. ""However, somewhat counter-intuitively, these same channels also are associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum"".They go on: ""The vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favourite, typically mainstream, news outlets, tempering the consequences - both positive and negative - of recent technological changes.""Last week, I went up to Oxford to visit Dr Grant Blank. His most recent work has examined, as he puts it, ""the myth of the echo chamber.""In an important paper, published with Elizabeth Dubois in the journal Information, Communication and Society, Dr Blank concluded ""social media and [the] internet [are] not [a] cause of political polarisation.""Their findings are striking. In an interview, Dr Blank gave me a nuanced account of our digital behaviour. He told me, ""one of the characteristics of the internet is that it has created a very large, complex media environment that includes not just social media but also print media, television, radio, and online media of various types, including online copies of print media - as well as specialised online media.""And if you look at that entire multi-media environment what you find is people are not in echo chambers, that people are not locked into groups of like-minded people all thinking the same thing and all talking the same way.""I asked him specifically about that alleged link between social media and political polarisation.""You can find a relationship between social media and political polarisation if you look only at social media,"" he said. ""If you look, in other words, at Twitter or you look only at Facebook. But in a complex, multi-media environment - which is the way people live now because of the internet - you don't find that, you find people consuming a lot of media.""You find people interacting with others who have varying points of view, changing their minds, encountering contradictory information, checking information that they find in social media. It turns out, if you look at media generally and you ask people what media do you trust, and then you rank the media in terms of trust, social media is at the very bottom of trustworthiness in terms of news.""At this point he returned to a familiar argument: ""In Britain it turns out the top [i.e. most trusted] is television. Probably due to the BBC… but television, print media, online media of various kinds are all higher than social media in terms of trust.""A season of stories about bringing people together in a fragmented world.Academics in this field do, however, accept that there is an element of prejudice reinforcement on some social media channels. They just add that you're more likely to encounter different worldviews than in an era where you mainly read The Daily Mirror, say, or watched mainly CNN.Social media has an effect on the ignorance or knowledge of a citizenry that is, it turns out, nuanced and complicated. It certainly gives prominence and oxygen to fringe views that would once have struggled to get a hearing. It ostensibly democratises opinion, by equalising the format in which the US President and some conspiratorial nutter opine: both have 280 characters on Twitter.And for those who want to indulge niche interests, whether political or otherwise, it creates digital wormholes in which you can lose yourself.Why should the idea of echo chambers, or the associated theory be so seductive and popular? Partly because Eli Pariser, author of The Filter Bubble, is an engaging speaker. Also, because there are times when we all feel like our social media feeds slant in one particular direction. And, ironically, because the idea of echo chambers and filter bubbles has bounced around social media, gaining traction there.Maybe some platforms, such as Twitter - which is the preferred receptacle for verbose journalists and politicians - are more prone to uniformity of outlook for some users. Which might explain the final reason echo chambers have become part of the prevailing orthodoxy: people like me have parroted the idea without surveying the academic literature.Journalism and academia: that's one divide that should be crossed more often.If you're interested in issues such as these, you can follow me on Twitter or Facebook; and subscribe to The Media Show podcast from Radio 4."
entertainment	Monet's £28m masterpiece blocked from leaving UK by government		"A ""spellbinding"" Monet painting has been blocked from leaving the UK by the government in an attempt to find a buyer who can keep it in the country.The 1908 work Le Palais Ducal had been in the same family for almost 100 years until it was sold for £27.5m to a foreign buyer at auction in February.But the government can temporarily stop important artworks going overseas.British galleries now have three months to try to raise the funds to match the auction price, plus £706,800 VAT.Monet painted the Doge's palace in Venice and its reflection from a boat moored on the Grand Canal in autumn 1908.The painting was acquired by Berlin-based textile manufacturer Erich Goeritz in 1925. He moved to the UK in the 1930s and the painting stayed in the family until they decided to sell it in February.At the time, Helena Newman, chairman of Sotheby's Europe, said: ""This spellbinding painting is a true masterpiece and among the very greatest Monet painted during his first and only encounter with Venice.""Neither Sothebys nor the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport would say who bought it or which country it could be exported to.Export of the artwork was blocked because it is a beautiful painting from an important period in the career of such an important artist, according to the reviewing committee.Monet's post-1900 travelling works are rare in UK public collections, they said.Committee member Aidan Weston-Lewis added: ""This exceptional painting brilliantly demonstrates the pivotal status of Monet's later art between impressionist representation and modernist abstraction.""Arts Minister Rebecca Pow said: ""This is a rare and beautiful example of Monet's Venetian studies and I hope that the funds can be raised to keep this treasure in the UK.""It comes a week after the government placed an export bar on a £10m painting by JMW Turner.Follow us on Facebook and on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Review: America's Cool Modernism at the Ashmolean ★★★★☆		"A quick glance at the form-book of blockbuster exhibitions will tell you we like paintings with people in them. Rembrandt's portraits for example, or Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, or - currently - Picasso's depictions of his young lover at Tate Modern. They all get us going.True, we don't mind the odd landscape, but usually only when it reminds us of Nature's great power and beauty and our place in it. And yes, we'll happily tip up to a show of abstract art as long as it's packed with Matisse or Rothko-like emotion.Mostly, though, we like to look at ourselves.Which makes the Ashmolean Museum's decision to mount a major exhibition of inter-war American paintings - on the basis that they are aggressively unpopulated and as emotionally charged as a paving slab - appear quite bold.It's called America's Cool Modernism, but that's a misnomer.The paintings you'll see by artists, many of whom you've probably not heard of - Ralston Crawford, Louis Lozowick, Samuel Margolies - are not cool.They're chillier than the Beast from the East.We see isolated grain silos and deserted cityscapes, uninhabited interiors and bleak factories.People? There are none. Humanity's imprint is there but we are missing.A surreal, macabre atmosphere hangs over this exhibition like the Great Depression. Think Giorgio de Chirico without the warmth and the wit.Fun, it is not. Which is not to say it isn't good. It is, on the whole.The first room is thoroughly enjoyable. It plays a sort of nice cop before you meet the miserable cop in the subsequent rooms.The first painting you see is of a joyful, colourful, Leger-inspired still-life by Edward Steichen called Le Tournesol (The Sunflower - 1920). Tonally, it is a world away from most of the other works in the show, but it does represent some of the main themes.The first was the breakaway the American painters wanted to make from the largely Paris-based European avant-garde after the First World War. They were trying to create a distinct visual language to reflect America's coming of age as a super-power, in the same way the Constructivists had done for the newly communist Russia.It wasn't easy. We see painting after painting owing everything to those all-pervasive early 20th Century European …isms: Cubism, Futurism, Fauvism and Orphism.There's one by EE Cummings (yes, that one), which is his attempt to take on Delaunay and Kupka at their own game. Suffice it to say, becoming a poet was the right career choice for him.But there are others where you start to see an independent voice break out.A small abstract painting from 1919 by Georgia O'Keeffe, called Black Abstraction, combines European concerns for perspective with a uniquely American sensitivity to a high-rise urban life.Next to it is a still-life by Helen Torr, called Purple and Green Leaves (1927). It's not the best painting in the world but she was clearly a painter who knew how to make an impactful image. I liked its allusion to a stained-glass window.She was one of several artists in the show whose work I didn't know at all - I was delighted to see it for the first time. Particularly Houses on a Barge (1929), a predominately dark brown painting made in an abstracted naive style.It is terrific: dark but wry, a Noah's Ark of homes, which foreshadows Louise Bourgeois's surrealist 1940-50s Manhattan images.The main gallery is packed with pictures of urban emptiness, many of which have been lent by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the most famous being the colourful, Picasso-inspired I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (1928) by Charles Demuth.What a fine artist he was, as you will see from this well-known work that makes visible William Carlos Williams' poem The Great Figure. There are two other paintings by him nearby, both of which are worth spending some time looking at.The same does not apply to all the work in the show. An odd piece called Painting No 50 (1914-15) by Marsden Hartley in which he references a tepee, is one I wouldn't have included.But for every miss there are plenty of hits.Two small, simple pictures by Jacob Lawrence from his early 1940s Migration Series gives an all-too-brief African American perspective on this extraordinary period of American History.Their titles tell you all you need to know: The Migration Series, panel No 25 (""They left their homes. Soon some communities were left almost empty"") and The Migration Series, panel No 31 (""The migrants found improved housing when they arrived north"").There are pictures in this show you will remember forever. One of which is Charles Sheeler's vertiginous Americana (1931) in which you see a deserted sitting room with everything left just-so. It's eerie and disorientating, with its extreme perspective and clashing rug patterns combining to make a visual assault on your senses.By the time you arrive at the three paintings by Edward Hopper, with which the show ends, your mind has been re-set, making these works by one of the most famous American artists of the period jar a little.They feel overly fussy, more moody and emotional than what has gone before - added to which two of them contain human beings!And that, if anything, gives you a sense of this impressive, intelligent show. After all, it really takes something to make an Edward Hopper painting feel overly populated."
entertainment	How Jeremy Deller is brightening the school day		"Wakefield's Hepworth Gallery has revived a pioneering scheme from the 1940s to introduce children to the best in contemporary art. It has commissioned several contemporary artists to produce prints of their work especially for local schools.The original School Prints were a product of their time: launched in the wake of a terrible world war by people who believed that wider appreciation of art and culture might help stave off another such disaster.Original lithographs, they appeared between 1946 and 1949, and the artists commissioned included big names like LS Lowry, Henry Moore, Picasso and Matisse.All were asked simply to contribute ""something suitable for children"", and most reflected a very 1940s idea of what that might mean. Subjects include a circus, a merry-go-round, ships, horses, a marching band and bucolic rural scenes: images of a safe, colourful world.Interestingly, several of the later commissions were from European abstract artists and proved less popular, not necessarily with the children but with the adults responsible for buying the prints, and the initiative petered out.Today, the original School Prints are collectors' items. The Hepworth's updated version of the scheme involves works by six artists, although more commissions are planned, each in a limited edition of 500.The prints will be sold by the gallery, but six copies of each are being donated free to local schools. High quality poster versions are also being produced for other schools to buy.They're meant as a classroom resource and as an alternative to the kind of school trips to local art galleries that many schools no longer have the time for.""This came out of conversations with local teachers who are frustrated about the lack of art provision they're able to give their children currently,"" says Nicola Freeman, the Hepworth's director of engagement and learning.""I think it's really important that galleries step in and do what they can to support this. Our real ambition is for this to become a national initiative.""The new prints are targeted at primary school children, but older pupils at Wakefield's Cathedral Academy have already been introduced to the images: they'll act as ""art ambassadors"", helping the younger children to appreciate the works.So what did these 13 and 14-year olds make of it all?Several of the girls liked Helen Marten's untitled lithograph: it showed a couple hugging, one girl suggested, with ""an evil pope"" behind them; it looked like a playground, suggested another, which a king and queen had commandeered for their own child.Haroon Mirza's Photons and Friends was popular with many of the boys who saw in it solar panels and a constellation of stars and liked its sci-fi vibe.The teenagers puzzled over Anthea Hamilton's Daydreamer's Wavy Boot.Was it a ""shoe building"", black ink, a smoking chimney or, as Hamilton herself says, a kind of self-portrait from her school days, the black representing her braided hair, the brick boot the wall of her Victorian school, the blue sky the clouds scudding by as she gazed out of the window in maths classes?Martin Creed's Work no 2874, with its broccoli shapes, prompted thoughts about colour, trees and nuclear mushroom clouds. Rose Wylie's King John, Frog, looked like a dancing cactus, one boy suggested.They were perhaps happiest with Deller's The Problem with Humans, painted by Stuart Sam Hughes, the most representational of all the prints: the octopus ""is planning to fight humans,"" one girl said, concluding: ""He's searching for the humans' weak points to attack them.""One of the boys suggested the octopus is plotting revenge for what we've done to sea life, ""throwing rubbish into the ocean"".Deller says he's astonished that no-one has thought of reviving the school prints idea in the decades since the original scheme ended.""It's not a challenge to make art for children because children are probably the most receptive people to contemporary art,"" he says.""They have no preconceptions, no intellectual animosity towards art; they just receive it in a very primal, clear way. For a child it must be very interesting looking at modern and contemporary art because they see themselves within it, they see things they could maybe do.""Artists make a big mess and muck about and do abstract art and work with colour and form, and that's what children do.""The original scheme, he points out, was born of the same 1940s ethos as the NHS and social housing: a belief in the possibility of a better world.Today's scheme has more to do with the state of art education in schools. Fewer children are taking arts subjects at GCSE, and there's less time for art in the classroom.""A lot of schools are under pressure because there's a focus on English and Maths qualifications,"" says Laura Nicholson, assistant vice-principal at Cathedral Academy, which is also a performing arts college.""Art as well as subjects like dance and drama and music can be put into the 'other' group. It's understandable that schools at the moment aren't necessarily focussing on those subjects.""But we really believe the arts aren't just an add-on: they're something that can really enhance our students' experiences and help them succeed in all their subject areas.""For now, copies of all the six newly-commissioned prints and several of those from the 1940s are on display at the Hepworth until the start of June."
entertainment	Howard Hodgkin: What's in a self-portrait?		"Sometimes with art, it is instructive to gauge public opinion. It can help blow away the cobwebs of pretension that get spun in your mind's eye if you hang around the art world too much.It's a particularly useful exercise with modern art, and almost essential when it comes to the abstract stuff. Hence, I arrived on Piccadilly this morning armed with a photo of one of the last paintings Howard Hodgkin produced before he died two weeks ago.Portrait of the Artist Listening to Music (2011-16) is a self-portrait, made while Hodgkin listened to Jerome Kern's The Last Time I Saw Paris and the zither music Anton Karas composed and performed for 1949 film The Third Man.(Neither appeared on his Desert Island Discs line-up, which just goes to show what terrible frauds castaways are.)By now you will have seen the picture and arrived at your own first impressions. Those on the mean streets of Mayfair earlier today were not favourable.""Rubbish,"" said a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit, who looked like Jacob Rees-Mogg but wasn't.""What is it?"" asked a lady in Lycra.""Terrible!"" said a Polish mother of two indignantly.The most positive remark was made by an elderly woman outside Hatchards, who said it reminded her of Cynthia.""Cynthia?""""My great-granddaughter,"" she said.Whatever one's opinion, I think it's fair to say we're not in Rembrandt or Picasso territory when it comes to the sub-genre of late self-portraits.(I suspect Cynthia might think Picasso's Self-Portrait Facing Death was more within her range.)I do like it, though. It's easier to grasp when you know that Hodgkin's shtick was to paint abstracted memories, not literal subjects.Portrait of the Artist Listening to Music is his attempt to describe how he remembers himself, which is a meta kind of thing to try and pull off when you consider it is a lifetime of being Howard Hodgkin he's tried to capture.Do I see a person in the painting? No. Nor do I hear music. But I do see emotion. And integrity.Ever since the invention of photography, artists have been trying to carve out ownership of an area of representation that is beyond the mechanical lens.By and large they have ceded the self-portrait, accepting that the camera is always going to be the winner. But Hodgkin was a more tenacious artist, not one to give ground on matters he thought important, such as painting.So he took painting in a new direction, not completely abstract, nor wholly figurative, but somewhere in between. And he ended up in a place the camera can and will never go. He went inside the mind and painted consciousness.Howard Hodgkin: Absent Friends runs from 23 March to 18 June at the National Portrait Gallery in London."
entertainment	Figures reveal art auction gender imbalance	The top-selling female artists:1. Yayoi Kusama2. Louise Bourgeois3. Joan Mitchell4. Agnes Martin5. Dame Barbara Hepworth'Got to be realistic''Signs of change'Five artists under 50 who are rising up the auction rankings:	"Of the top 100 artists whose works fetched the highest amounts at auction in 2017, just 13 were women, an analysis of sales data shows.The top female artist was Japan's Yayoi Kusama, whose works sold for $65.6m (£48.9m) - putting her 13th overall, according to figures from MutualArt.The 13 women in the top 100 accounted for sales of $263m (£175m) - 7.4% of the overall total of $3.5bn (£2.6bn).The Art Newspaper's Anna Brady said she was ""depressingly unsurprised"".Leonardo da Vinci was top of the 2017 auction rankings, thanks to the $450m (£337m) sale of the Salvator Mundi painting last November.He was followed by Jean Michel Basquiat - whose works fetched $338m (£253m) in 2017 - then Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly and Roy Lichtenstein.At the age of 89, Kusama is the only living woman in the top 50.After her, the top-selling women were Louise Bourgeois, Joan Mitchell and Agnes Martin - who, like Kusama, made their names in 1950s New York.2017 total auction sales = $65.6m (£49.2m)The colourful Kusama (born 1929) is famed for paintings and sculptural installations that build seemingly endless patterns of polka dots. The Japanese artist was an influence on Pop Art in the 1950s and 60s and, in monetary terms, is far ahead of any other female artist.2017 auction sales = $36.8m (£27.6m)The French-American artist (1911-2010) created suggestive sculptures that reimagined the human figure, body parts and organs. She's also known for her huge spiders, which have appeared around the world and are her biggest-selling works.2017 auction sales = $30.5m (£22.9m)From the abstract expressionism scene, Mitchell (1925-92) spun webs of bold brushstrokes on pale backgrounds, often inspired by nature. One of her paintings sold for $16.6m (£12.4m) earlier this month, smashing her auction record.2017 auction sales = $26.3m (£19.7m)Martin (1912-2004) was another of the key female abstract artists in New York in the 1950s, but her canvases - always square - were more minimalist and usually featured subtle pencil lines and blocks of pale colours.2017 auction sales = $15.9m (£11.9m)Dame Barbara (1903-75) was a British sculptor whose signature works were large, rounded blocks that evoke the shapes of nature and the human form - with holes in the middle.The other British women in the overall top 100 were Bridget Riley and Cecily Brown.The imbalance between men and women stems from a ""systemic gender bias"" in the factors that go into deciding an artist's value - which has existed for many years - according to Kate Todd, data analyst at MutualArt, an online art information service.For decades, key museums and galleries have focused on exhibiting and collecting work by male artists, and have normally been run by men. Dealers and private collectors have also been predominantly male.Anna Brady, who is The Art Newspaper's deputy art market editor, says: ""You've had centuries of male collectors, male art historians and male critics, generally.""I'm not saying they're incapable of appreciating female artists, but I think it brings with it a certain bias. Female artists have often gone under the radar.""Things like having children has affected female artists over the years - and they just haven't been appreciated or have been taken less seriously over the centuries and the decades of the 20th Century.""In December, a study suggested that people do not rate a work of art as highly if they believe it is by a woman. That shows ""a general bias"", Brady says.Oliver Barker, senior international specialist of contemporary art at Sotheby's, says there has been ""institutional oversight"" in the art world in the past, but that a ""revolutionary change"" is under way.In the UK, the directors of Tate, the Serpentine and the Whitechapel galleries are all women, four of the last six Turner Prize winners have been women, and Barker says there are now more female art collectors and patrons.""Historically the art world probably has been guilty of oversight,"" Barker says. ""I think it's fair to say that in the '50s or the '60s, it was just harder for female artists to break through in a male dominated market.""If you look at museum collections, the history of post-war collecting at the Tate of the Metropolitan or the Pompidou is probably largely male. Whether it's institutions or art schools or auction houses, we're trying to redress that balance.""But while he stresses that gender isn't considered when an auction house puts a price on an artwork, there are complex factors at play when deciding on something's value, and prices have ""got to be based on reality"".""We can only reflect the market for a particular artist,"" he says. ""[The price] has got to be based on what is the precedent for that particular art, what is the breakout appeal or opportunity that's here?""We're in the business of also satisfying our vendors and purchasers so it's not just a question of trying to redress any balance of prejudice that historically has been institutionalised.""Gender inequality clearly isn't just a problem in auction houses - just 11% of the highest-grossing movies in the US last year were directed by women, while women make up just 15% of corporate boards around the globe.In the art world, Anna Brady believes the gender balance is better in the primary market - the commercial galleries where art is initially sold - but that the pace of change of waiting for that to filter through to auctions is going to be ""painfully slow"".Galleries and dealers are making an effort to push artists who were overlooked in the past and those who are now emerging, according to Kate Todd.""There's some really great momentum behind contemporary female artists at the moment,"" she says. ""I think it's going to take some time for them to reach their upper level - to break into that core group of consistently top achieving artists, simply because the volume of work isn't there yet.""But there are some really exciting signs of female artists who are changing the landscape and who give some hope that there's going to be some disruption in that top group sooner rather than later.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Biggest Weekend: Titanic survivors' voices are woven into four new songs		"The voices of people who built - and survived - the Titanic have been woven together in a new suite of songs by the band Public Service Broadcasting.The poignant songs were premiered on Friday in the shadow of the shipyard where the hull was constructed.One song also incorporated the Morse code distress signal sent by the ship's captain after it struck an iceberg.The band said it was ""hopefully"" a ""fresh look at what is admittedly a very well-covered subject"".More than 1,500 people died when the ""unsinkable"" ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.Yet in Belfast, the Titanic is also remembered as a triumph of engineering - and one which created tens of thousands of jobs when the city was, in the words of one historian, ""at the pinnacle of its industrial glory"".Public Service Broadcasting said they had attempted to convey that side of the story as much as the catastrophic loss of life.The trio have carved a niche as a band who breathe new life into soundbites from key moments in history. Previous projects have investigated the conquering of Mount Everest and the collapse of the Welsh mining industry.They were commissioned to write about the Titanic for the BBC's Biggest Weekend festival - which is taking place around the UK this weekend.""We've been asked a few things similar to this but very rarely do they come off,"" the band's frontman J Wilgoose told BBC 6 Music's Elizabeth Alker.The band's set, on Belfast's Titanic Slipways, also featured footage of the Titanic and its sister ship, The Olympic, which were constructed metres away from the stage in the Harland & Wolff shipyard.""To play it in such a unique setting, as well, was incredible,"" said Wilgoose, who pored through hours of archive footage an interviews to piece together the music.One clip featured the voice of a man whose father helped build the Titanic.""When I was a wee boy growing up in Belfast, my father was working in the shipyard and he kept telling me about this great ship he was helping to build,"" he reminisces.He recalls the sheer scale of the vessel - which, when it launched on 31 May 1911, was the largest ship in the world.""One Sunday he took me down to the shipyard and he told me to look up... It seemed to reach the sky, it was so high. There seemed to be no end of it, it was so long.""Wilgoose said most of the audio had been drawn from archives at the BBC and the British Film Institute - but he was surprised by how little material there was available.""You kind of forget [that] in 1912, radio wasn't around and people weren't really recording.""There's not much contemporary [material] and most of it is obviously about the sinking.""But there is some great footage of The Olympic being built on these very docks, so we used some of that and moved on to the bit listeners will be a bit more familiar with... the distress call.""We made a song out of the Morse code sequence, which was CQD [""All stations, distress""].""We tried to make it quite abstract - because how do you recreate that kind of disaster at sea when there's no contemporary footage of it?""The Biggest Weekend will also see performances from Ed Sheeran, Rita Ora, Taylor Swift, Nigel Kennedy, Evelyn Glennie, Beck and Liam and Noel Gallagher - with venues in Belfast, Perth, Swansea and Coventry.You can find out how to watch and listen on the official Biggest Weekend site.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Rose McGowan: 'Weinstein tried to contact me'	'Thing to be eaten'	"Actress Rose McGowan has told the BBC Harvey Weinstein has tried to contact her since she went public with her allegations that he raped her.She said she had received ""texts, things like that"", adding: ""I've got no idea how he got my number.""Ms McGowan also said the alleged assault by Mr Weinstein had been ""worse than I wrote about"".She is one of several women to accuse Mr Weinstein of rape. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.When asked whether she had been approached directly by the Hollywood producer, she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Texts, things like that - I've got no idea how he got my number, but he also had former [Israeli intelligence agency] Mossad agents involved in my life so getting my personal phone number wasn't that hard.""When asked how recently there had been contact, she replied: ""A month ago - somebody that worked with him, represented him, I don't know, on his behalf - I shook, it was like a bullet once again.""It was basically just kind of this person is reaching out. And I don't even understand what the point was. I can't understand to what end. The cat's out of the bag.""Asked what the purpose of the message had been, she said it had been suggesting that Mr Weinstein had wanted to get in touch or to talk to her.She said: ""It could have been some random person, but that would be a long shot.""Ms McGowan also said the response had been ""nothing short of cataclysmic"" since she had become one of the most prominent figures in the #MeToo movement after sharing her allegations.""In some ways I feel it's an honour to almost be a receptacle for so many people's pain and voices, people who want to identify and reach out and say, 'Me too,'"" she said.""I had hoped that by showing people that if you can cut off the head of power, that you can achieve an awful lot.""Ms McGowan claims she was raped by Mr Weinstein in a hotel room during a business meeting at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.She told Victoria Derbyshire: ""The reality of what happened in that hotel room is even worse than I wrote about [in her book]. I just thought, 'This is enough to really get my point across.'""There's a strange thing that happens with becoming a survivor, that you feel like you are almost trapped in this weird relationship with this person that you can't get away from.""It shocks me that I was touched by this person, and so many, I was just a thing to be eaten.""She added the alleged incident ""did a lot of damage, it still does"" as his name and face was everywhere.""There's something really strange about having this abstract envy over a victim who doesn't need to see her perpetrator again,"" she said.Mr Weinstein's representatives have been contacted for a response to Ms McGowan's claims he has tried to contact her.In relation to her rape allegations, they said: ""Mr Weinstein has vigorously denied Ms McGowan's claims and an investigation of those claims and of Ms McGowan suggests in our judgment, that she has taken a consensual act of intimacy between her and Mr Weinstein and falsely attempted to turn it into an act of sexual assault.""On claims that Ms McGowan had been spied on by an intelligence agency made up of former Mossad spies called Black Cube, the company said it applied high moral standards to its work and operated in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel."
entertainment	Robyn: 'I didn't want to be a role model'	'My salvation'	"In the eight years since Robyn last released an album, pop grew around the void she left.No self-respecting pop album is now complete without a ""sadbanger"" - a song you can cry and dance to at the same time - in the vein of Robyn's Call Your Girlfriend or With Every Heartbeat.Artists like Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan and (especially) Carly Rae Jepsen have built careers out of her fusion of tenderness and club beats.Katy Perry called her ""the epitome of effortless cool"" and when Lorde performed on Saturday Night Live last year, she put a framed photograph of Robyn on her piano, explaining that Dancing On My Own had inspired the tone of her second album, Melodrama.""It's happy and sad, fiery and independent but vulnerable and small, joyous even when a heart is breaking,"" she wrote on Tumblr. ""It's just perfect.""All this attention, however, gave Robyn the heebie-jeebies.""I was reluctant to be a role model,"" she says carefully. ""I really didn't feel comfortable in that position for a long time.""Her concern was that being venerated could limit her horizons.""It becomes weird. You're expected to do things because you're role model. But it has to be that you're doing things because you want to. That's how you become an example in the first place.""Robyn has fiercely protected her independence ever since her mid-20s, when she extricated herself from a punitive US recording contract.She'd been a teen star in the late 1990s, scoring a global hit with the song Show Me Love. But her label refused to release her second album in the US - partly because she insisted on including two songs about abortion.""My record company thought I was crazy,"" she told the BBC in 2007. ""They were like: 'Why don't you just do what Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears are doing?'""I understand that but I wanted to do my own thing. I make really commercial music but I still want to be able to explore a more radical way of expression. So it took time for me to find a place.""She took back control in 2004, buying back the rights to her demos and setting up her own label, Konichiwa Records, in Sweden.People told her she'd lose money, she says, ""but it was really my salvation"".For the next six years, she worked non-stop - writing, touring, remixing, promoting and recording; culminating with 2010's ambitious Body Talk project, a three-volume anthology of laser-blaster pop, recorded and released in the space of just six months.Then Robyn disappeared... well almost.There were a clutch of EPs with Royksopp, Mr Tophat and her side project La Bagatelle Magique; but nothing captured the adrenaline rush of a Robyn solo record.Her vanishing act was prompted by a period of painful personal change. She split from her long-term partner, video director Max Vitali (they later reunited), and lost her musical mentor Christian Falk to pancreatic cancer.At the same time, she started an intense course of psychoanalysis to help navigate the impact of childhood fame and her parents' divorce.""I was slowly getting myself back into a space where I could make music again,"" she reflects.From the outset, she knew a new album had to sound and feel different.""It's so easy to fall into old patterns and behaviours and things you feel safe in,"" she told me in 2015 as work on the record began.""But I don't feel safe any more in being safe. There's always a time for change. I don't know exactly where that's going to lead me.""After the upheavals in her personal life, she knew ""the emotional tone I wanted to reach"" would be ""soft and vulnerable and open"" but says it took time to locate it.""I knew what I wanted to do, but I didn't know how to do it - so I really had to go back to school. I went clubbing a lot. I changed how I was writing. I learned new software. I was listening to a lot of disco.""You can hear her evolution in progress by seeking out the different incarnations of album's title track Honey (""there's enough for a full album of different versions"" Robyn says).A demo she played on Radio 1 earlier this month is delicate and abstract; while a later attempt, which appeared on Lena Dunham's TV show Girls, recalls the squelchy basslines and sequenced synths of Body Talk.But the final (and best) version is sensual and dreamlike, thrumming hypnotically as Robyn promises: ""You're not gonna get what you need / But baby, I have what you want / Come get your honey"".In some ways, those lyrics were a message to her fans - because Honey, the album, doesn't delivers the immediate pop fix they demanded.Liberated from the constraints of verse-chorus song structures, Robyn's new music is stretched out and imperfect; reflecting the singer's years-long process of grief and self-excavation.What does it means to be human, she asks? To live through loss? To preserve yourself without shutting down?Amplifying Robyn's emotional instability, the music constantly shifts and mutates. A bass line will appear in a different time signature to the rest of the song, slipping in and out of sync, casting the singer adrift.""Those uneven periods of rhythm felt good in my body,"" she says. ""They're more potent. They give you a more trance experience than others. And that's what I wanted to dance to.""It's impossible to overstate the importance that dancing holds for Robyn. At home she practices samba, finding it so moving that ""it makes me cry"". In the steamy haze of a nightclub, dancing becomes a spiritual, restorative act.""The after hours, when people have been going for ever and ever and ever - there's a kind of dancing that happens then that's not so self-aware, that's really about losing yourself to the music,"" she says.Fittingly, her album pivots around a dancefloor epiphany. After mourning Falk on Missing U and reconciling with Vitali on Baby Forgive Me, she finds resolve in the hypnotic beats of Send To Robin Immediately, declaring: ""If you got somebody to love, give that love today / Know you got nothing to lose, there's no time to waste.""From there, the mood lightens as Robyn gets giddy on the 90s throwback Between The Lines and kicks back on the ultra-chilled Beach2k20.And the album ends with something totally unexpected: A Robyn song with happy chords, happy lyrics and a happy melody.""Never gonna be broken hearted / Ever again,"" she sings on Ever Again. ""I'm only gonna sing about love / Ever again.""So is that her current state of mind?""I think I'm in a good place,"" she says hesitantly. ""I don't know what happy means, but maybe happy?""More positive. I feel good about things and, musically, I'm able to go in all kinds of directions now because I feel like I've gotten rid of a lot of filters.""In fact, she's even come to terms with being a role model.""I definitely embrace it now. It's very touching when people say they've been inspired by stuff I've done.""And I understand the point of it: It's really important to have female role models - or any kind of role model you can recognise yourself in.""Honey is out now.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	US artist Ellsworth Kelly dies aged 92		"Influential abstract artist Ellsworth Kelly has died at the age of 92.According to dealer and gallery owner Matthew Marks, he died of natural causes at home in New York.Known for vibrant works with geometric shapes and bright colours, the artist had retrospectives at New York's Guggenheim and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art over his career.In 2013, he was presented with the National Medal of Arts by US President Barack Obama.Kelly was born in Newburgh, New York, in 1923 and served in the US military during World War Two before studying art at Boston's School of the Museum of Fine Arts. He went on to travel and study in Paris.On his return to New York, he held his first solo show in 1956.Influenced by artists such as Picasso and Matisse, Kelly's work was dubbed by art historian Jules Langsner as ""hard-edge painting"".His pieces included paintings, sculpture and tattoos.Analysis by Will Gompertz, arts editorEllsworth Kelly was a giant of post-war American painting. He belonged to the pioneering New York-based Abstract Expressionist school that counted Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still among its number.What made his work stand out (in every respect) was his commitment to working with colour at its greatest intensity, not mixed and applied wet-on-wet as was the preference for many of his peers.By doing this he became the American artist who arguably bridged the gap between European modernism as practiced by Matisse and Picasso - and Manhattan's bullish expressionism.He saw the world in fragments of vibrant hues and had the skill and intellect to make sense of the complexities of life in the simplest of shapes and brightest of colours.He told W magazine in a 2012 interview: ""I know how not to go too far or how not to go too small. I'm doing a sculpture now, a rather big one - and it's ­really waiting and waiting.""I sometimes don't try to invent something. I wait for some kind of a direction - and it happens. I get an angle, for instance, and it just appears, and I say, 'Oh my God - that's it!'""Kelly also carried out public commissions around the world, including a memorial for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.In 2000, alongside architect Richard Rogers and composer Stephen Sondheim, he was presented with a Praemium Imperiale award, one of the world's biggest art prizes.Kelly is survived by his partner, photographer Jack Shear."
entertainment	Mercury Prize 2018: Nominees reveal the last thing they changed on their albums	Noel GallagherNadine ShahNovelistLily AllenFlorence and the MachineJorja SmithWolf AliceEverything Everything	"Making a great album is like making a great sandwich: The trick is knowing when to stop.If inspiration is the bread and butter, it's the choice of fillings that decide whether the record becomes a sumptuous feast or a disappointment.Just look at Kanye West's The Life Of Pablo. The star obsessed over the record for months after its release in 2016, making prominent changes to at least 12 of its 20 tracks, often to their detriment.On the flipside, U2 famously felt rushed to complete 1997's Pop album, delivering a ""compromise project"" on the eve of their world tour. They later re-recorded several of the tracks for a greatest hits album, labelling those the definitive versions.This year's nominees for the Mercury Prize, it's safe to say, have delivered some of the most tasty musical sandwiches of the past 12 months.So, ahead of Thursday's prize-giving ceremony, we asked them to name the last thing they added, tweaked, fixed or removed from their albums.You can follow the Mercury Prize ceremony live on BBC Four, BBC 6 Music and BBC Music News Live on Thursday from 19:00 BST.""About 48 hours before the artwork needed to be finished and delivered, we got notice that we couldn't get clearance for a shot we wanted to use on the cover,"" says Gallagher of his album, Who Built The Moon?""It meant we had to re-shoot the cover and deliver it that day! Where would we find a model? Luckily she was sat at my kitchen table.""The girl you see on the cover is actually my wife... Who, miraculously, wasn't busy gassing on the phone that day and agreed to do it as long as she could style herself and keep the clothes after.""She is still available for album shoots.""Nadine Shah's acclaimed third album, Holiday Destination, charts the current ""rise in nationalism and decline in empathy"".It's a subject she's experienced first-hand, as a second-generation immigrant (her father moved to the UK from Pakistan and her mother is English with Norwegian heritage) and one of the most visible Muslim women in music.The last thing she recorded for her album was a chant at a pro-immigration demonstration, which closes the title track.""I recorded it on my phone and sent it over to [producer] Ben Hillier just in time to have thousands of people chanting, 'Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,'"" she says.""I'm so glad that that's on there. I wanted to be very direct and I wanted people to be very aware of the context of the album.""Once they've heard that chant, other lyrics will make sense, even if they're slightly more abstract.""But Shah, who is the bookie's favourite to win the Mercury Prize, admits the very, very last tweak she made to the album was ""turning all the vocals up"".Track seven on Novelist's debut album is a 55-second groove called Happiness In The Summer, over which the Lewisham-born MC delivers two thoughts - that he's ""happy in the cold and the summer"" and that ""no weapon formed against me will ever prosper"".""It's not even a song, it's a skit,"" he says. ""I was going to put the beat on there as an instrumental; but then I thought, 'I've already put two instrumentals on the album, this is pushing it.'""So he jumped on the mic to flesh it out a little, just hours before the album was finalised.""Those lyrics just came off the top of my head,"" he grins.""The last thing we changed was the drums on Come On Then, which is the opening track,"" says Allen of the vituperative curtain-raiser to her fourth album, No Shame.""It went through about six producers that song. It's very chaotic and quite kind of weird.""Until late in the day, Florence Welch intended to call her fourth album ""The End Of Love,"" after one of the album's most searingly personal tracks - but she ultimately chose the more optimistic title High As Hope.The change of heart reflected the singer's newly mature attitude to relationships.""I'd changed my idea of what love was,"" she told BBC 6 Music's Steve Lamacq. ""I thought love was this desperate longing, painful feeling. Then I realised love didn't have to be chaotic. It could be a peaceful feeling.""There could be a way of being in love that wasn't all highs and lows and drama.""""The last thing I finished or changed was Lifeboats,"" says the singer, referring to a freestyle rap that (briefly) ups the pace towards the end of her soulful debut, Lost & Found.The song accuses ""greedy wasteful men"" of ignoring those in need.""Why are all the richest staying afloat?"" she raps. ""Seeing all my brothers drowning, even though they nicked the boat / Mothership ain't helping anyone.""""I wasn't going to put it out,"" she says. ""I was a bit nervous as it's a bit different to what I usually do. I just thought - I don't know if people will like this... but they did. So that's good!""""It was probably something to do with Don't Delete The Kisses,"" says singer Ellie Rowsell, ""because that one seemed to take the longest"".""We had quite a lot of versions of it. We didn't know quite how clubby we wanted to make it. There are a million synths in there.""Speaking to the Song Exploder podcast, Rowsell also revealed the song - a dreamy diary of infatuation that's the stand-out track on the band's second album, Visions Of A Life - had a last-minute lyrical rewrite that altered its ending.""I changed the last chorus to be an optimistic one, from 'What if it's not meant to be?' to 'Me and you were meant to be,'"" she said.""It wouldn't have been nice to end it on a sad question. Then it wouldn't have been a love song.""Singer Jonathan Higgs struggled for days to get the perfect vocal on the swooping, acrobatic Good Shot, Good Soldier - but there was another song on the quartet's fourth album, A Fever Dream, that bugged them until the final days of recording.""There was a big question mark over Night Of The Long Knives,"" says guitarist Alex Robertshaw, adding there were ""five or six versions"" that just didn't work.It wasn't until they cooked up what he calls ""the siren chorus"" - a divebombing, buzzsaw synth line that lacerates the chorus - that they finally felt satisfied.""As soon as we finished that we were like, 'This is the opening track.'""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Reputation: Will Gompertz reviews Taylor Swift's new album ★★★☆☆		"After months of build-up and publicity, Taylor Swift's sixth studio album finally arrived on Friday. Will Gompertz was Ready For It.We know Taylor Swift is shamelessly light-fingered when it comes to appropriating her musical influences. It's one of her gifts, to take the best of the rest and make it her own.She's at it again on Reputation, so much so you could turn the listening of it into a parlour game this Christmas, playing spot the riff or reference.The sharp-eared might think they can discern a Madonna inflection, a Lorde chord, or a Lily Allen phrase. Maybe even a Yazoo beat, a Billy Joel build, or Eminem's syntax. Right Said Fred is in there for sure, as is - possibly - a nod to Laurie Anderson's O Superman.There are literary references too. Charles Dickens, F Scott Fitzgerald and - perhaps unknowingly - Kurt Vonnegut, all make fleeting appearances.Swift and her producers Shellback, Max Martin and Jack Antonoff have blended them all together like masterchefs, serving up an album of perfectly formed, clinically produced, contemporary pop songs.Catchy hooks, sing-a-long choruses, and an electro-synth driven dynamism underpin an album, which unusually and impressively, is greater than the sum of its parts.All the songs are good - if simple. Some are great, such as Gorgeous.But taken as a piece, as a cycle of songs that tell an overarching story of a singer-songwriter growing up, getting wise, and taking control of her life, it bears comparison to Adele's 21 as a coming of age album by an artist giving full vent to her talents.It's still all about boys, of course. But there's a refreshing bite to her lyrics. ""I don't regret it one bit because he had it coming,"" she sings in her revenge song I Did Something Bad.And, ""I don't like your little games... no, I don't like you,"" in the multi-persona Look What You Made Me Do, in which she announces the ""old Taylor is dead"".That's not true. The old Taylor is alive and kicking.She might drink a bit more, and swear occasionally, but a vulnerability remains, which is poignantly evident in Delicate, where she describes that tricky (delicate) time at the beginning of a new love affair where you don't want to blow it by seeming to be overly keen. ""Is it cool that I said that? / Is it chill that you're in my head?""Swift prides herself on her writing. She has said in the past that she sees herself as a lyricist first and singer second. And she is handy with a pen, but Bob Dylan she is not.The clichés that crop up here and there jar, such as: ""Why do you have to rain on my parade?"" in the otherwise joyously caustic This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things.And the opening line of I Did Something Bad, which is: ""I never trust a narcissist but they love me,"" is delivered without any noticeable sense of irony.So, there's room to develop a sense of humour in Swift's new provocatively arch incarnation.But her voice is strong and textured, although too often concealed behind a veil of production. When it's let loose, most noticeably in the stripped back New Year's Day - the album's final track - you hear a singer who can communicate feeling and thought with touching depth and sincerity.Reputation, like Taylor Swift, is a product of its time. It's an overtly commercial, well-targeted, highly professional piece of pop art.And in that context, like one of those big shiny abstract sculptures that adorn cities around the world, it fits perfectly into our globalised landscape.Read more:Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	How a disabled fan became the star of Lucy Rose's new video	Pure happiness	"Fans have played a huge role in Lucy Rose's career.After she parted ways with her record label in 2016, supporters in Latin America organised an intimate, two-month tour, which helped her rediscover her passion for music.The trip became a documentary - and one fan's response to that film changed Lucy's outlook on life.It began when Zoe Schofield, who has Asperger's syndrome and chronic fatigue, which leads to chronic pain, saw Lucy's show in Bristol last July.""I was showing the documentary,"" the singer explains, ""and after the show I had an email in my inbox, just before I went to bed, from a guy called Dave who turns out to be Zoe's dad. And actually the documentary had made her feel quite upset.""He was like, 'I was so surprised by it - but she has disabilities, chronic pain, and this video made her think about all the things she wanted to do in her life and that she feels like she can't.'""The email left a huge impression on 29-year-old Rose.Lucy had never considered her overwhelmingly positive experiences in Ecuador, Peru and Brazil could have a negative impact on someone else.""It was just so intense,"" she recalls. ""In my naivety I hadn't thought that could be a difficult watch for people in different situations.""When she returned to Bristol last November, Zoe was back in the audience. After a chat at the merchandise stall, Lucy resolved to do something.""I said, 'Let's make a music video. I know the documentary made you feel this way - and I'd love to make a music video with you that makes you feel the complete opposite.'""Zoe reacted with a ""mix of disbelief, excitement, and mild terror"".""It's not something I would ever have expected her to say,"" she tells the BBC via email, ""and my ASD [Autistic Spectrum Disorder] and anxiety makes everything outside of my comfort zone daunting.""Then I thought about how excited I would be if I saw someone with my disabilities in a music video: Someone like me, with all those struggles, out there being visible and living life anyway.""The idea of being able to make that happen, to embrace my disabilities and go do something amazing anyway - it was still terrifying, but it was really exciting too.""Lucy put the entire project in Zoe's hands. The teenager listened to Lucy's song Strangest of Ways and, inspired by the lyric ""Let me live in the wild tonight"", booked a trip to the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.They flew out earlier this year and spent a day shooting the video in the bitter cold of Ulster's northern coast.""I have so many great memories of shooting the video,"" says Zoe. ""But my favourite was near the end of the shoot.""After we'd been down to the causeway (and I'd had a rest) we decided to go up to the headland that overlooked it.""There was this perfect moment where the sun burst out from behind the clouds and a rainbow formed on the horizon over the sea.""Even thinking of it now when I'm at home and exhausted and aching - it fills me with this overwhelming sense of awe and pure joy that I felt then, that feeling of connection to the world, to the wildness in my soul, of being alive.""Sharing that moment with this little group of really great people, and knowing I was a part of something - moments like that are what make life worth living.""The video, which premieres on Thursday, is ""quite abstract,"" says Lucy, ""because it's telling one part of this huge story of how we ended up here.""I wanted the scenery and Zoe's words to do the talking.""It's an affecting and emotional watch, especially when you know the back story. But for Lucy, just making the video was reward enough.""I was just so relieved and happy that Zoe had a great time - because it was a huge ask for someone in her situation to put her body through what we put her body through. And the repercussions of the whole trip was going to mean a week in bed, pretty much.""It was just like a combination of euphoria that it happened, and pure happiness that she'd enjoyed it.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

I have no other skills. [But] it's always been agony,"" he explained to the New Statesman.The abstract painter and printmaker, who died in hospital in London on Thursday, was ""a central figure in contemporary art for over half a century"", Tate galleries said.Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota said he was ""one of the great artists and colourists of his generation"".Sir Howard won the Turner Prize in 1985 and represented the UK at the Venice Biennale the previous year.He was knighted in 1992.By BBC arts editor Will GompertzSir Howard Hodgkin was an important artist whose use of colour and memory gave his largely abstract works great potency.He didn't leave you looking, as some do, for the art in his art - it was there, on the canvas, to see and be seen: immediate and memorable.For me, he took the essence of Matisse and Degas, mixed it with European abstraction and Indian light to conjure up, through his own unique talents, beautiful, sensitive images.His work is held by major galleries and museums around the world, including the British Museum, Tate and MoMA in New York, and two exhibitions of his work are opening in the UK in the coming months.Sir Nicholas said: ""His sensuous, intense paintings were infused with his love and understanding of late 19th-Century French painting, especially Degas, Vuillard and Bonnard, and by his feeling for the heat and colours of India, which he visited on many occasions.""His characteristic subject, the memory of a meeting or a conversation with a friend, resulted in paintings that radiate the emotions of life: love, anger, vanity, beauty and companionship.""Sir Nicholas added that over the past 30 years, the artist's international standing has grown, with key exhibitions in Europe and the US.The Royal College of Art described Sir Howard as ""one of the painters of our generation - who gave us emotion in the form of colour.""Paul Moorhouse, 20th Century curator at the National Portrait Gallery, said: ""Howard is probably one of the truly great British artists of the last 60 years - a really distinctive voice, someone with his own artistic identity, someone who has really extended our understanding of the way artists represent the world.""His death comes days before the National Portrait Gallery opens the first exhibition of portraits by the artist. Howard Hodgkin: Absent Friends features more than 50 works, dating from 1949 to the present. His portraits include those of fellow artists David Hockney, Patrick Caulfield and RB Kitaj.Works he produced on his latest visit to India are to go on display at The Hepworth Wakefield in Howard Hodgkin: Painting India, which opens in June.Simon Wallis, director of the gallery, said the Hepworth was ""deeply saddened"" by news of his death, adding: ""He was one of the most important artists of our time.""We are enormously grateful for Howard's generosity with his time and his enthusiasm. We are proud to be realising an exhibition about the influence of India on his work, a place that he was so passionate about, and from which he drew such inspiration throughout his life.""At the time the exhibition was announced, Sir Howard said he was ""excited"" by the idea of it, adding of his work: ""I fell in love with Indian art when I was at school, thanks to the enterprising art master, Wilfrid Blunt.""I longed to visit India, but only managed to do so in my early 20s. It proved a revelation. It changed my way of thinking and, probably, the way I paint.""Sir Howard also designed one of 12 posters for the London 2012 Games. His poster, called Swimming, featured a figure swimming through the water.Gordon Howard Eliot Hodgkin was born on 6 August in Hammersmith, London, in 1932.In 1940 he was evacuated with mother and older sister, Ann, to the US where they lived on Long Island. He first decided he wanted to become an artist aged just five, and was inspired by seeing the works Stuart Davis, Matisse and Picasso at Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art.When he returned to the UK he ran away from school to become an artist.In 1952, he had his first show in a public gallery at the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath.He later studied at the Camberwell School of Art and then Bath Academy of Art, where he went on to teach, and was a trustee of the Tate and National Gallery.Speaking to Desert Island Discs in 1994 he said he had had a hard road to recognition in the UK, describing it as ""enemy territory"" for painters.Sir Howard had told the BBC in a 2012 interview that he was looking towards the end of his life, adding: ""Death is always hovering in the distance. I want to get out as much as I can.""And last year, he told the Daily Telegraph being a painter was a ""lonely occupation"", adding: ""I don't consider myself successful.

entertainment	US African-American art exhibition Soul of a Nation opens at Tate Modern		"The art world's response to the birth of Black Power is being highlighted at a major new exhibition at the Tate Modern.Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power explores what it meant to be black - and to be a black artist - in the USA from 1963 to 1983 as cultural identity was shifting and reforming.Some of the pieces on show at the London gallery take direct inspiration from some of the key black figures of the day, as in Andy Warhol's Muhammad Ali.Barkley Hendricks, who died earlier this year, told the Tate: ""I'm just trying to do the best painting of the individuals who have piqued my curiosity and made me want to paint them.""His work Icon for My Man Superman (Superman Never Saved any Black People) was inspired by political activist Bobby Seale's statement that ""Superman never saved any black people"".Curator Mark Godfrey told the BBC: ""We've done shows about American art for decades - it was a question of why hadn't we done one on African-American art?""And there was every reason to do it as these are great artists making important work. We felt it was important to tell the story of this 20-year period when they were asking questions about the black aesthetic and what it means.""It's a cohesive set of questions and a varied set of answers.""Wadsworth Jarrell - whose work Revolutionary is above - formed AfriCobra (the African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) with fellow artists Jeff Donaldson, Jae Jarrell, Barbara Jones-Hogu, Nelson Stevens and Gerald Williams in the late 1960s.They were the only group to devise a manifesto for black art at this time.Frank Bowling, born in British Guyana before moving from London to New York, was a key player in the Black Art movement, arguing that it could be abstract and did not need to be overtly political.One of his other works, Middle Passage, is travelling outside of the US for the first time - and Bowling himself has not seen it since it was exhibited in 1971.On that note, Godfrey said that many of the works - of which there are more than 150, by more than 60 artists - are being shown in the UK for the first time.Some they wanted proved impossible to locate, including Phillip Lindsay Mason's The Death Makers. But its importance is being marked at the exhibition all the same.Godfrey explained: ""Even the artist doesn't know where it is. So we wanted to acknowledge its absence with a blank space.""As well as such iconic artworks as Warhol's portrait of Ali, the exhibition also looks at how art was reflected on the streets of America.The Black Panther Party's culture minister Emory Douglas said that ""the ghetto itself is the gallery"" and was behind posters like the one above.Betye Saar is one of the female artists whose work looks at the black feminism movement and its impact on the two decades, increasing the visibility of black women.Emma Amos once said in an interview that, in her opinion, ""artists are extremely influenced by whatever is going on at the time they're coming into their powerful vision"".As the Tate said itself in its description of the show, it is a ""timely opportunity to see how American cultural identity was reshaped at a time of social unrest and political struggle"".Soul of a Nation is at the Tate Modern from 12 July to 22 OctoberFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Richter painting breaks record for living artist		"A 1968 oil painting by German artist Gerhard Richter has set a new record in New York for the highest auction price achieved by a work by a living artist.Richter's photo-painting Domplatz, Mailand (Cathedral Square, Milan) sold for $37.1 million (£24.4 million) at Tuesday's sale.Tobias Meyer of Sotheby's called the price ""a major accomplishment"".Richter, 81, also held the previous record for the top price fetched at auction by a living artist.His abstract painting, Abstraktes Bild, sold for £21.3m in 2012.Sotheby's described Domplatz, Mailand, which depicts a cityscape painted in a style that suggests a blurred photograph, as a ""masterpiece of 20th Century art"" and the ""epitome"" of the artist's 1960s photo-painting canon.The price achieved was more than 10 times as much as the then-record $3.5m (£2.3m) it commanded at Sotheby's in London 15 years ago.Don Bryant, founder of Napa Valley's Bryant Family Vineyard and the painting's new owner, said the work ""just knocks me over"".Onement VI, a 1953 work by abstract expressionist painter Barnett Newman's Onement VI, set a new record for the US artist after selling for $43.8m (£28.7m).A Francis Bacon work that had been estimated to sell for as much as $40m (£26.2m) failed to attract a buyer."
entertainment	Why I've changed my mind about Henry Moore		"You really can have too much of a good thing.Champagne tastes like sheet metal after the third glass. Sunbathing gives you cancer. And the ubiquity of Henry Moore sculptures in English market towns in the 1970s put me off his work for a quarter of a century.Back then, in Harold Wilson's Britain, Moore's monumental stone figures and giant abstract casts had the same worthy municipal feel as the local town hall.Any conurbation large enough to support a Boots, a cinema and a public convenience seemed compelled to plonk an enormous Moore sculpture on a prize piece of public real estate.His misshapen family groups and huge pierced boulders of bronze were like those fashionable avocado bathrooms - not nearly as groovy as the older generation thought. More Abigail's Party than the Sex Pistols.I wasn't alone in wanting no more Moore.In 1967, he offered the Tate Gallery ""20 or 30 major pieces"". Fellow artists were less keen, saying it was wrong to devote so much space to a single living artist (Moore had insisted his gift be on permanent display, which would have taken up a sizable chunk of the Tate's sculpture galleries).The Tate declined - and the artist gave the work to a grateful Art Gallery of Ontario instead.That was then.Forty years later, I have aged, and so have Moore's sculptures. They have fared much better than me - they look terrific now.Maybe it's their sense of calm permanence in our superficial, super-fast world, or my romanticising of Moore's post-war vision of modernity.Either way, it was a pleasure to spend yesterday at his old home in Perry Green, Hertfordshire, which is now The Henry Moore Foundation.He was a sincere and dedicated artist who knew he wanted to be a sculptor aged 11, had his first commissions in his teens, and went on to excel at the Leeds School of Art.There he met and befriended another aspiring young sculptor called Barbara Hepworth, who, like Moore, was inspired by the Yorkshire landscape of their birth.He read widely, immersed himself in art and drew on influences far and wide, from primitive African artefacts to Parisian Cubism.His intellectual and technical wherewithal enabled him to successfully incorporate all these ingredients into harmonious, pleasing forms that feel both ancient and modern.It's what gives his work such broad appeal and why it can be seen in hundreds of cities around the world - there is something in it for everyone.His drawings of sheep and apple trees have an intensity and energy that feels kinetic. You'll see plenty of the real thing if you sit at his old oak desk in the little shed with a picture window that looks out onto the fields of sheep that frequently wander over to look at you.There are some good drawings from his student days, which you can see in an exhibition opening this Saturday at the Foundation called Becoming Henry Moore.There are plenty of sculptures, too, in the exhibition and dotted about the 70 acres of landscape, which the canny Moore used as a showroom for potential clients.They look good. Much better than they did in those tired old market towns.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	What's the hidden message behind Beyonce's pregnancy photo?		"Since Beyonce announced she and husband Jay Z are expecting twins, social media has been abuzz with theories about the deeper meaning behind the record-breaking Instagram photo.Why is she wearing a veil? Why is she kneeling? Why so many flowers?Armchair art critics have been keen to offer up their own explanations.""So perhaps Beyonce's having a girl & a boy, hence the pink bra & blue panties?"" suggested @nicbamford on Twitter.""She's SURROUNDED by beautiful flowers. This is her connection with life and earth. She's energised by nature"" said @TheHelenOfTrill‏""Pretty blatant Virgin Mary and pagan fertility imagery going on in Beyonce's pregnancy announcement"" added @MildlyAmused.Others were more confused than enlightened by the picture's composition.Lisa McCray tweeted: ""Friend. Do you legit not have stretch marks? How?""Katie Leigh cut to the chase: ""I cannot be the only one who thinks Beyonce's maternity pictures are extremely weird.""Meanwhile, the traditional press served up a more intellectual analysis of the photo.The Guardian chose to interpret it on a purely artistic level, pointing out its resemblance to ""late 15th century Flemish portraiture, when it was popular to depict a subject from a three-quarter angle, often in front of a landscape, and with hands clasped in front"".The background flowers, it said, are derived from ""rococo influences"" as is the photo's ""overall celebration of love and pleasure"".Vanity Fair described the photo as ""high-concept"", mirroring famous historical paintings of ""women of cultural importance,"" including Queen Elizabeth I.Australian online pop hub Junkee hired art historian Kate Roberts to appraise the photo, comparing it to works by the great masters of the past, including Raphael, Botticelli, Reubens and Warhol.Meanwhile, the tabloids searched for proof that Beyonce is a member of the Illuminati - the shadowy secret society believed by conspiracy theorists to be the mastermind behind global events.""Beyonce is supposedly positioned in a pyramid shape - a key symbol for the Illuminati,"" said The Sun.""Theories say the presence of a pyramid or triangle represents the top down command structure of the world.""Elle magazine suggested Beyonce's lack of clothing was a response to rumours from 2011 when she was pregnant with now five-year-old daughter Blue Ivy.It was alleged after an appearance on an Australian talk show that Beyonce's bump was fake. By stripping down to fully exposing her bump in 2017, there can be no doubt that this pregnancy is the real deal.Whatever the deeper meaning behind Beyonce's pregnancy announcement, it has got the world talking.Had she simply posted a shot of an ultrasound or two blue lines on a home pregnancy test kit, it perhaps wouldn't have become today's top headline.So much of the news in 2017 has revolved around political turmoil and shifting global dynamics.Beyonce's abstract and slightly surreal photo has provided some welcome relief, with social media users from across the spectrum briefly uniting under one sentiment - congratulations!

entertainment	Robert Rauschenberg: Art pioneer and inspiration	'Long road to travel''His own artist''Nothing he wouldn't try'	"Robert Rauschenberg produced some of the most distinctive American art of the second half of the 20th Century. Yet he was the most restless of artists - moving from traditional painting to print-making and sculpture. He was one of the first people to explore the relationship between art and technology. Tate Modern is staging the first major retrospective since Rauschenberg died in 2008.Years before Damien Hirst first successfully split the cow, Rauschenberg used a full-sized angora goat in his 1955 work Monogram. The goat had once graced a textile company in New York which specialised in mohair. Yet Rauschenberg spotted its artistic possibilities.Six decades on, the goat greets visitors to the Tate's new show, still apparently oblivious to the car tyre which has somehow wedged around its middle.Also in 1955 the artist created Bed, a characteristic Rauschenberg ""combine"". Taking a pillow, a sheet and a quilt he merged them with a traditional oil-painting.Years later Tracey Emin would go a stage further with My Bed, throwing in her mattress - but not until 1998.Walking around Tate Modern's retrospective of the work of Rauschenberg (1925 - 2008) these are not the only cases where you think: ""He got there first.""Rauschenberg was Texan and was born into a family with a deep Christian faith. At 18 he was drafted into the US Navy and served as a medical orderly.Post-war he went to Paris to study art but disliked it. ""Right place, wrong time,"" he observed. He returned to America. He was gay but nonetheless was married to a woman for three years from 1950.David White is senior curator at the Rauschenberg Foundation. He's in London for the new show, which next May will travel to New York.""In 1965 when I first met Bob you immediately saw he was outgoing and open and convivial. He was always very serious about work but light-hearted in his engagement with other people.""At the same time he was concerned about the human condition and wanted to help right wrongs. But unlike some artists he was full of enthusiasm rather than gloom.""White adds: ""In 1964 he had won at the Venice Biennale - so he was aware he was esteemed. He was entering the mid-part of his career and finally making money.""But he still had a long road to travel and so much to explore.""White points out a huge and extraordinary piece from 1966 called Mud Muse.A metal and glass tank, roughly three metres by four, is filled with soft bentonite clay which bubbles and pops as compressed air passes through. White says it's a good example of how Rauschenberg liked to work.""Bob genuinely loved collaboration. It might be with another artist or with people in the theatre or with a choreographer like Merce Cunningham - but with Mud Muse he collaborated with a bunch of engineers to produce something unique. It's serious art - but also it's a comic, delightful, playful object.""White can see why some pieces in the show get Rauschenberg labelled as part of pop art - pieces such as Triathlon or the well-known Retroactive II, which uses an image of President John F Kennedy and, like many Rauschenberg images, came from a magazine or newspaper.""But the label's really not accurate. Bob came after abstract expressionism, which had dominated American art after World War Two and he provides a partial link from there to pop art. He was his own artist.""The curator of the exhibition for the Tate is Achim Borchardt-Hume.""In many ways the turning-point for Robert was after Paris at Black Mountain College (near Asheville in North Carolina). Black Mountain was a true laboratory - students were encouraged to work across many different disciplines. I suspect the parties were as important as classes - but there was also a very strong sense of discipline and of working out what you were good at,"" says Borchardt-Hume.""In terms of race or gender or sexuality or religion it was a wonderful mix of everything. And that's extraordinary given that at the time the area beyond the college was highly segregated.""When Rauschenberg moved to a studio in Fulton Street in Lower Manhattan he had little money.""What he shared with the abstract expressionists was their ambition and heroic scale. So though he was younger than them, there's certainly a link,"" Borchardt-Hume says.""But he was never happy working in a single medium - there was almost nothing he wouldn't try.""When he was young he had been very shy and always felt he was a disappointment to his father. His sexuality must have been difficult, given his family background.""It seems his first relief from shyness was to go dancing. Marriage came early and it failed. But it produced a son, Christopher - now a photographer - and he remained friends with his wife Susan Weil.""Robert Rauschenberg was rather a political artist. Don't forget that he became a well-known name in the Sixties, with America changing around him. So his work often contains - quite literally - images from news magazines. They might be of Martin Luther King or an Army helicopter but they're redolent of the America he knew.""He adds: ""He thought that to be an artist was to play a role in the world. That and his early shyness may be why he was unusually keen on collaborating: he didn't believe being an artist meant leading a life of isolation.""Borchardt-Hume says there are huge riches on display in the exhibition. But he's happy if the image of the Goat in the Tyre dominates how some visitors react.""It's one of those extraordinary moments where you think, 'how on earth did an artist arrive at this idea?'. Now, with everything that has happened in art since, we think it's quite all right. But I think at the time it must have seemed truly shocking.""The Robert Rauschenberg exhibition runs at Tate Modern until 2 April and then at MoMA in New York from 21 May 2017.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Public asked to help find lost artworks		"Historic England - formerly English Heritage - is calling on people to help track down missing works of public art.The organisation has launched the campaign 10 years to the day since a bronze Henry Moore figure was stolen from the grounds of his former estate.It revealed that a growing number of post-war works have been destroyed, sold, lost or stolen from public places including schools and parks.Historic England has compiled a list of such works for the public to view.Missing works include one of the three figures that make up Lynn Chadwick's The Watchers, taken from Roehampton University in London, and Barbara Hepworth's Two Forms (Divided Circle), which was stolen from Dulwich Park in south London in 2011.Chief executive of Historic England, Duncan Wilson, said: ""Part of England's national collection of public artworks is disappearing before our eyes. Historic England's research is only the tip of the iceberg as it's almost impossible to trace what has happened to every piece of public art since 1945.""We're making efforts to protect the best examples of post-war public art that still exist, and make sure that it continues to enhance the public realm.""But we also want to raise awareness of just how vulnerable these works can be and we want the public to help us track down lost pieces.""Henry Moore's Reclining Figure that was stolen from Hertfordshire in 2005 was worth £3m but police believe it was probably melted down and sold for scrap metal for £1,500.Others have been vandalised, including an abstract steel sculpture by Barry Flanagan in Cambridge.Historic England believes public art is under threat because of the price of scrap metal, local authority funding gaps, pressure from redevelopment and vandalism.In 2012, Wakefield Council removed its Henry Moore sculpture from public display and put it in secure storage because of a spate of thefts."
entertainment	Jean Michel Jarre: Writing collaborations broke 'solitary process'	Avoiding the internet'Malevich meets Tron''Retro-futuristic'	"French legend Jean Michel Jarre worked with guest acts on his latest albums because musicians have become ""isolated in our home studios"".The 67-year-old, in the UK to headline Cheshire's Bluedot festival, recently released the second part of his collaborative project, Electronica.It saw him composing with the likes of director John Carpenter, rock group Primal Scream and techno DJ Jeff Mills.He said face-to-face writing revealed their ""secrets"" and helped him learn.He added that working with collaborators made him realise ""we all start with the same state of mind"".""We all begin hesitating, not being sure of which direction we will go, slowly building the track.""Suddenly, an idea comes and we're all excited like children, wanting to exploit it right away.""I really discovered that it's a timeless process.""The Electronica albums featured a wide variety of acts, from the more established like the Pet Shop Boys, Gary Numan, Pete Townshend, Cyndi Lauper, Air and Moby, to the less well-known such as Julia Holter, Boys Noize and Siriusmo.Jarre said he wanted to work with artists that ""have been and are a source of inspiration to me and were linked, directly or indirectly, to electronic music"".Electronica took five years, with each song beginning with a demo inspired by ""my ideas about what they represented to me"" which the composer took to the acts personally.He said the tracks could have been completed quicker if he had used the now-normal way of collaborating - sending tracks and ideas back and forth electronically.""I wanted to meet and work with people in their studios or mine, sharing the creative process physically and not just sending files through the internet.""It was not to find new inspiration but instead because of a feeling that, especially in electronic music, we are isolated in our home studios.""Making music these days is a quite solitary process and I thought it would be interesting to share this face-to-face.""I've been really moved that all these great artists opened their doors and shared secrets, weak points and specific ways of approaching composition.""It was a treat to work with Pete Townshend, Gary Numan, Moby, Air, Pet Shop Boys, but also with the younger acts, such as Gesaffelstein or Rone, who is a very talented French newcomer.""I wouldn't say I enjoyed one more than anyone else, because when they said yes, they all gave so much to the process.""The one downside was that all that time recording made Jarre yearn for one of his great passions - playing live.The musician is something of a concert legend, having played huge shows across the world, including one at the Pyramids of Giza to welcome in the new millennium and the joint-largest gig ever, to a crowd of 3.5 million people in Moscow in 1997.""After the five years I spent recording Electronica, I said 'wow, I really would like to be on stage and touring again'.""I was excited, from a visual point of view, to create something different from what I've done before.""Electronic music, being mostly instrumental, means you're not in a narrative situation with lyrics and a singer telling a story.""I like the idea that when I'm on stage, I'm creating the soundtrack of a movie the audience can create in their imagination.""The visuals are not a series of videos, but more a graphic link to the core of the tracks.""I thought about [Russian abstract artist Kazimir] Malevich meeting [1982 sci-fi film] Tron - abstract graphics with digital means.""That was the idea I had when I was preparing.""The UK's first glimpse of those visuals will be at Bluedot at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, under the gaze of the Lovell radio telescope.The festival takes its name from the Pale Blue Dot photograph, an image of Earth taken by the Voyager 1 space probe as it left the solar system at the request of astronomer Carl Sagan.Jarre said the venue is ideal, as his music - from the saxophone solo an astronaut on the ill-fated Challenger shuttle was due to play in orbit for his 1986 album Rendez-Vous, to a live link to the Mir space station during a 1997 concert - has ""always been linked with space"".""It's a great excitement to play Jodrell Bank - this gigantic radio telescope making us think about Sagan and his great movie Contact.""This kind of radio telescope environment is technology, space and spirituality meeting together.""It's an interesting area - special and retro-futuristic in a sense. I like this kind of vibe. That makes Jodrell Bank an unusual and exciting place to play.""After Bluedot, Jarre returns to the UK in October for a series of arena shows and then he will look, as always, to create more music.While he has no plan to create another Electronica - ""it may happen, you never know in life, but it was not intended like this"" - he does think he will work with other acts again.""What I really enjoyed was opening the door to collaboration. It has been a great journey to work with so many talented artists.""That is something that gave me the desire to want to repeat it again.""Jean Michel Jarre plays Bluedot on 23 July.

entertainment	Tate gallery gifted Cy Twombly works worth £50m	Analysis: Will Gompertz, Arts Editor	"The Tate has been gifted works, valued in the region of £50m, by the late American artist Cy Twombly, who died in 2011 at the age of 83.The pieces include three large canvases Untitled (Bacchus) 2006-8 and five bronze sculptures.The gallery held a major retrospective of the artist in 2008.Tate director, Sir Nicholas Serota, called it ""one of the most generous gifts ever to Tate by an artist or a foundation"".Cy Twombly was one of the most important western artists to emerge from the machismo of 1950s Abstract Expressionism. Along with fellow countrymen and colleagues - Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, - he was responsible for re-connecting American contemporary art with the poetic uncertainties and everyday simplicities of life.The three large abstract paintings that form part of this gift are late works made between 2006 and 2008, which are themed around Bacchus - the Roman God of wine. They consist of huge, loosely painted, red circles that overlap and sprawl across the mighty canvasses. At first glance they may seem like nothing more than doodles, but given time their combined power and scale begins to affect the viewer's senses, in a way - the artist probably intended - that's comparable to drinking a glass of red wine.It was Cy Twombly's wish that these works - which the Tate has nominally valued at £50 million - go to the London-based institution. It considers the gift to be as significant as Mark Rothko's 1969 gift of his Seagram Murals. It is a bold but justifiable claim.""It ranks alongside Rothko's gift of the Seagram mural paintings in 1969,"" he continued. ""Together with Twombly's cycle of paintings The Four Seasons 1993-5, acquired in 2002, this gives an enduring place in London to the work of one of the great painters of the second half of the 20th Century.""The large-scale paintings, inspired by the Roman God Bacchus and his association with wine and debauchery were painted with a brush affixed to the end of a pole.The five sculptures are all bronze casts of found objects, such as the top of an olive barrel.Nicola Del Roscio, president of the Cy Twombly Foundation said: ""On behalf of the Foundation, it is my great pleasure to honour Cy's wishes with this gift.""In 2012, a major collection of modern art - which included works by David Hockney and Lucian Freud - was donated to the gallery."
entertainment	Obituary: Captain Beefheart	Trout Mask ReplicaLegal disputesArtist	"With a growling bass voice, that whooped and hollered in the manner of one of his earliest heroes, bluesman Howlin' Wolf, Captain Beefheart became a hugely influential figure in rock music.Artists like Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Franz Ferdinand, Oasis, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and The White Stripes are among those who have cited him as an influence.Later, under his real name Don Van Vliet, he became an acclaimed painter.He was born in 1941 in suburban Glendale, California, where his father drove a baker's van. He was an only child, and his grandparents lived next door. His family indulged his artistic talents - he was sculpting from the age of four.As a teenager, he discovered the blues along with childhood friend Frank Zappa, who was to remain a friend, and rival, throughout his life.Together, in Lancaster, California, in the Mojave Desert, Zappa and Van Vliet came up with the name Captain Beefheart and the latter formed a blues band, His Magic Band, in the mid-1960s.Though the band's title remained with Beefheart over two decades, the band's membership was to change frequently.After establishing themselves with a small but devoted following, the band, augmented by a 20-year-old slide guitarist named Ry Cooder, made their first album, Safe as Milk, in 1967.Although blues-inspired, the album reflected the era of psychedelia by its surrealist tendencies. It also hinted at the avante-garde that was to become Captain Beefheart's trademark.Various record labels wanted to establish Captain Beefheart as an American alternative to the British blues bands of the 1960s or as a pop band to rival The Beatles.But Van Vliet would not allow them to curb his artistic expression and there were frequent fallings out.Many fans regard his masterpiece to be the 1969 album, Trout Mask Replica, a dadaist blend of blues, free-form jazz, rock and beat poetry.Sometimes manic, always unpredictable, the album was at first deemed as impenetrable. Yet, to its supporters, it showed itself to be a complex mix of metaphor and use of wordplay. ""A verbal prankster"" was how British DJ John Peel described Beefheart.The album was produced by Frank Zappa who gave his friend full artistic rein.""If it had been produced by any professional, famous producer,"" Zappa said later, ""there could have been a number of suicides involved.""John Peel described Beefheart as being "" driven in pursuit of his music to the borderline between imbalance and genius.""He suffered constantly from anxiety attacks. For Trout Mask Replica, he kept his musicians in a house for the eight months it took to write the double album, only allowing them out once a week to get groceries.There was very little money with which to buy anything but the most basic of provisions. The conditions were described by one band member as ""cult-like"".When Zappa eventually got to record the album, it took less than five hours. The lyrics were nonsensical and surreal, and the band members were given nicknames like Mascara Snake, Zoot Horn Rollo and Rockette Morton.The album dispensed with a regular rock beat, constantly changing its songs' time signatures. ""I don't like hypnotics,"" said Beefheart, ""I want things to change like the patterns and shadows that fall from the sun.""His next album, Lick My Decals Off, Baby was equally experimental in nature, but subsequent offerings such as The Spotlight Kid and Clear Spot were far more commercially viable.Beefheart's often errant behaviour caused no end of problems with record companies and, in the 1970s, he became embroiled in various legal disputes which precluded his ability to tour. This deprived audiences of one of the finest live acts of the era.He also proved too hard a taskmaster for many of the band members and there was constant to-ing and fro-ing.His next two albums Unconditionally Guaranteed and Bluejeans and Moonbeams were derided by fans as being too commercial, but the later Bat Chain Puller and Ice Cream for Crow were acclaimed.Throughout his music career, Captain Beefheart kept up a prolific output of sketches and paintings. He was eventually persuaded that if he was to be taken seriously as an artist and not regarded simply as a musician who paints, he should give up music.He returned to his home near the Mojave Desert in southern California and became reclusive. He became more and more renowned as an abstract expressionist whose work, like his music, is regarded as original innovative. It fetches high prices.Eventually, Captain Beefheart/Don Van Vliet was unable to paint after contracting multiple sclerosis.His work, whether in music or drawing, was never mainstream and only ever gained a relatively small following, but he was a larger-than-life character who pushed the boundaries of his art in a way which influenced many who followed in his wake."
entertainment	Antony Gormley and Barbara Hepworth sculptures listed	'Precious national collection'	"An Antony Gormley sculpture has been given Grade II protected status - his first to be listed.It is one of 41 pieces of post-war public art in England newly protected by the government.The list also includes three works by Barbara Hepworth and one by Henry Moore, opposite Parliament in London.Heritage minister Tracey Crouch said: ""Not only are they magnificent sculptures but they are also an important part of our history.""The bright red work of art (and 40 others) now protectedGormley's Untitled [Listening] in Camden, north London, was one of the artist's first public sculpture commissions and dates back to 1984.The work, in Maygrove Peace Park, shows a human figure sat on a boulder, cupping an ear. It was commissioned by Camden Council to show its commitment to peace, with the park opened on the anniversary of the atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki, Japan.Hepworth's Winged Figure, on London's Oxford Street, and Single Form (Memorial) in Battersea Park, London, have been given Grade II* status, with Rosewall (Curved Reclining Form) in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, given Grade II listing.The Oxford Street work was designed to make people ""feel airborne in rain and sunlight"", she said, with the Battersea Park sculpture being her response to the death of a friend.Knife Edge Two Piece, an abstract bronze sculpture by Henry Moore which can be found opposite the Houses of Parliament, has also been listed.The 41 sculptures reflect life in the years following the war, with themes including industry, family and play. There is also a work commemorating children killed in the Blitz.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport made the listings on advice from Historic England.Roger Bowdler, the body's director of listing, said: ""These sculptures were commissioned and created for everybody and have become a precious national collection of art which we can all share.""They enrich our lives, bring art to everyone and deserve celebration. We have worked with the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association, Tate, and the Twentieth Century Society throughout this project to ensure our most special public art is protected and continues to enhance our public spaces.""Fifteen of the newly-listed works are outside of London, including three in Harlow, Essex, which has become known as the Sculpture Town.A map has been made showing the locations of all of the sculptures."
entertainment	What does David Bowie's art say about him?	An enigma	First things first: The Sotheby's sale of David Bowie's art collection is only partial, in that it's not all there.His family has kept a large chunk back - maybe around a third - including a Lynn Chadwick sculpture called Teddy Boy and Girl.According to Kate Chertavian, his art buying advisor between 1992-2000, this is the artwork that precipitated an eight-year fine art spending spree by the late pop star, the results of which make up the bulk of what will go under the hammer next Thursday.Nobody was very keen to talk about the art that's not in the sale, but I got the sense that the auction contained the pieces that either had less emotional resonance with his family, or were deemed to be the weaker works: what you might call the B-side of his art collection.There are some decent pieces, though. Not least, William Scott's Girl Seated at a Table (1938).If I had the £150,000-£250,000 the estimate requires (I don't, and it'll probably go for more anyway) I'd willingly stump up the money.It's earlier - and I think better - than Scott's more abstract efforts, painted when the artist was channelling Cezanne, not Braque.There are also two very nice, small Frank Auerbach sketches, a Kenneth Armitage bronze sculpture called Model for Diarchy (small version - 1959), and a Bernard Leach pot, all of which took my fancy.Of course, art appreciation is a subjective activity, but there are some works in the pre-sale show, which is free to see by the way, that did absolutely nothing for me.The two big paintings by Peter Howson left me cold, as did the group of large, colourful expressionistic pieces by John Bellany - although his Fishermen in the Snow (1965) was easier on the eye.There are a couple of so-so Basquiat's, a decent Frank Auerbach oil and a reasonable Picabia - if that's your cup of tea (it's not mine). But by and large it is a collection of good but not great art.But that's not really the point, is it. The point is that David Bowie owned it. And he was special. A great artist in his own right who touched the lives of millions of people around the globe, but remained an enigma to most.Which is why the 350 artworks and objects on show are so fascinating. What do they tell us about the collector?Well, he was old school in his tastes in terms of materials. He liked paintings and sculptures.There are no photographs, which is surprising considering it is a medium he clearly understood and used a lot in his own work.Similarly, there are no video pieces, no performance art and - other than a couple of Duchamp bits - precious little from the conceptual canon.His taste appears to have been fairly conservative but very specific. He liked British modernism.He liked the art that came from the same place as him: mid-20th Century UK. It is art that you could argue shared his philosophy, a philosophy that went on to shape his aesthetic.It is art that questioned, that was preoccupied with the surface, that had many sides; that never quite settled. Art that performed.The collection strikes me as more about Bowie putting down roots rather than an exercise in creative experimentation: it was for contemplation and ballast, not rock 'n' roll.
entertainment	Mario Testino to display his 'precious' art pieces		"The extensive private art collection of the legendary photographer Mario Testino is to go on public display for the first time in the UK.More than 500 works by artists including Tracey Emin and Gilbert & George will go on show at Sotheby's in London, before being sold at auction.Testino is known for his glamorous, vibrant photos of the rich and famous.He describes his art collection as ""precious"" and ""a document of my time, of my eye, of the people I believe in"".Born in Lima, Peru in 1954, Testino came to London in 1976. Initially he struggled to make a living as a photographer.""When I arrived in England I really had no knowledge of anything to do with art,"" he explains. He knew, he says, that he needed to learn more about photography, ""to train myself"" and ""by looking at other photographers I was inspired by them"".Eventually he started making money and he bought his first photograph in the early 1980s. It was a picture of the actress Vivien Leigh by the surrealist photographer Angus McBean.""I like beauty and I think she was one of those women gifted with beauty.""Beauty today is considered a bit banal and a bit empty and a bit superficial. In the art world you probably can't mention that word, because it's not interesting or not deep enough. But I'm just always amazed by it.""His collection grew from there. He purchased works by Cecil Beaton and Richard Avedon - men who had first inspired him to pick up a camera.Later, under the guidance of the gallery owner Sadie Coles, he started buying fine art. And while most of us are advised to buy what we like, Testino adopted a different approach.""I was collecting things that amazed me. Things that weren't like me.""What you like, you know already, so the time that it's going to last in your head is limited. Whilst things that you don't understand, but that attract you and puzzle you and confuse you, those are the things that you need to be looking at, because those are the things that will make you change your point of view. Those are the ways we grow.""Over the past 30 years, Testino has built up a wide-ranging collection of work by artists from 45 different countries.The most valuable work in the sale is by the American Sterling Ruby, called SP114. Created using spray paint, it was inspired by the graffiti scene on the streets of Los Angeles. It is expected to fetch between £600,000 and £800,000.Abstract art by the Brazilian Vik Muniz rubs shoulder with more figurative works, including a huge oil painting by the German Georg Baselitz.The collection is particularly rich in Latin American art, including works by the Argentine artists Pablo Bronstein and Amalia Pica, the Colombian Oscar Murillo and, not surprisingly, Peruvian artists such as William Cordova.Testino says art has inspired his own work.""We must always remember that to produce, you need to eat somewhere and this has been where I've been feeding myself.""I'm too obsessed with myself, my life, my worries, my needs. But fine artists have really helped me free my mind. They have opened the way I think, they've opened the way I look.""In all, Testino has accumulated more than 1000 works. The decision to sell half of them has been ""hard"".""It's sad to part,"" he says. ""I've never sold anything. I've been too attached to my collection.""But he says: ""I have a mission.""All the proceeds from the sale, which is expected to raise £8m will go to support the Museo MATE, which Testino set up in Lima in 2013 to promote culture in Peru.""I'm selling because I have a unique opportunity to change something in the country I come from,"" he says.Testino addes that he can't maintain the museum ""with the money I have. I can't carry on worrying every month if I have the money or not"".He says ""getting sponsors today is quite difficult"" so he wants to create an endowment to ensure the centre has financial security in the future.But he is not giving everything up. The works he is keeping, will continue to decorate his homes around the world.""There is something magical about a collection, but I still have some, thank God."" They are, he says, ""my precious thing"".Shake It Up - Works from the Mario Testino Collection exhibition will open on 8 September at Sotheby's New Bond Street ahead of two auctions on 13 and 14 September.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Artist Richard Smith dies aged 84	'Glamour and prismatic colour'	"British artist Richard Smith has died at the age of 84.Best-known as a painter and print-maker of the 1960s avant-garde movement, Smith died in New York, his representatives said in a statement.Among his most famous works were large-scale sculptural canvases featuring a ""protruding"" 3D effect, with names such as Panatella and Revlon.Smith pushed the boundaries of painting and had an ""abstract painterly style very much his own"", said the statement.His works are currently on display at Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London.There are also pieces on show at Downing College in Cambridge, until 22 May, and in his hometown of Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, until 5 June.Smith studied at the Royal College of Art and soon after graduation was awarded the prestigious Harkness Fellowship, which allowed him to move to New York and hold his first one-man show.On returning in 1963, he made a name for himself with giant canvases, which would seem to overtake a gallery space.As well as the ""synthetic"" names he gave his works, he chose to paint in loud, vibrant colours, inspired by the consumerism he encountered during his time in the US.Later works for which he became renowned were his Kite paintings. They stood out for replacing the traditional wooden supports used for canvases with aluminium rods and strings.This allowed the paintings to be hung freely in most environments and in a way which complemented the surrounding architecture.Art historian Marco Livingstone said Smith ""was at the forefront of a development in painting that took its cues not from the natural world but from visual stimuli already processed through culture"".""Smith's joyful embrace of glamour and prismatic colour after the grey decade-and-a-half of post-war austerity, brought him within the orbit of Pop Art at its very inception and assured him an important place in its early history,"" Livingstone added.Smith continued in the subsequent decades to construct site-specific works in public and private spaces, often hanging from the ceilings or architectural supports.Smith was chosen to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1970. He also won many prizes for his work, including the Grand Prize at the Sao Paulo Biennial. He was made a CBE in 1971.Permanent collections of his works are held by various organisations and galleries in the UK and the US, including the British Museum, the Tate, the V&A and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.Smith is survived by his wife Betsy and his two sons Edward and Harry and their families."
entertainment	Jackson Pollock painting Mural to be restored		"Click for enlarged image of MuralJackson Pollock's seminal work of art, Mural, is to be shipped from Iowa to the Getty Center museum in Los Angeles for restoration work.The oil on canvas painting, which is 20ft (6m) wide by 8ft (2m), represents a key turning point in the abstract expressionist's career.It is hoped the 70-year-old painting can be returned to pristine condition.Mural will then be exhibited in LA for three months before being returned to its owner, the University of Iowa.Pollock, who died in 1956, is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists in American history.""This painting is of phenomenal importance in the history of 20th century art,"" said President and CEO of the J Paul Getty Trust, James Cuno.Pollock is also credited with inspiring the emergent Abstract Expressionists of the mid-20th century.Mural marks the moment he began to move towards the abstract expressionism seen in his famous ""drip"" paintings, in which he poured paint directly onto the canvas.It was created by Pollock as his first commission from legendary art collector Peggy Guggenheim, who gave it to the University of Iowa in 1951.Filled with colourful, twisting animal-like forms, the artist described Mural as representing a stampede of animals from the American West.Although it is dated 1943, it is believed Pollock created it in one burst of activity on New Year's Day 1944, after complaining for months that he was ""blocked"" and couldn't come up with an idea for Guggenheim.He once wrote of the painting's size: ""I've had to tear out the partition between the front and middle room to get the damned thing up. I have it stretched now. It looks pretty big, but exciting as all hell.""The huge work, which is valued at $140m (£90m) has started to sag over the years.A team of scientists and experts will investigate the materials and techniques used to develop a treatment approach, before cleaning the painting.It is estimated the work will take as long as 21 months, but it is not yet known whether the painting will be flown or driven to Los Angeles.The Getty Museum regularly undertakes the conservation of key works of art from institutions around the world.Last year there was talk of putting Mural up for auction to raise money for art scholarships at the University of Iowa, but that idea was dismissed.Todd Taylor, a state representative, said the sale would have amounted to ""cultural vandalism."""
entertainment	Clyfford Still painting sells for $61.7m		"A work by US abstract artist Clyfford Still fetched an artist's record of $61.7m ($38.8m) at Sotheby's New York.His painting 1949-A-No 1, with its white splashes over red and white, smashed his previous record of $21.3m (£13.4m), for 1947-R-No 1, set in 2006.The reclusive artist died in 1980.A sale total - with commissions - of $315.8m (£198.5m), including an artist record of $20.8m (£13.1m) for Gerhard Richter abstract (849-3), capped a strong week for New York sales.Another Clyfford Still painting, 1947-Y-No 2 - which had a pre-sale estimate of up to $20m (£12.6m) - sold for $31.4m (£19.7m).The artist's record-breaking 1949-A-No 1 carried a pre-sale estimate of $35m (£22m).Four pieces by Still, whose works rarely come to market, were sold, taking a total of $114m (£71.6m).All of the works came from the Estate of Patricia Still and were being sold by the City and County of Denver with funds going towards the new Clyfford Still Museum, set to open in a week's time.A group of eight works by German artist Richter fetched a total of $74m (£46.5m); Francis Bacon's Three Studies for a Self-Portrait sold for $19.7m (£12.4m).Auctioneer Tobias Meyer said the overall total - the auction house's highest for a contemporary sale since May 2008 - ""blew every expectation away"".On Tuesday, a painting by pop artist Roy Lichtenstein sold at Christie's New York for a record $43m (£27m) which helped the auction house to a sale total of $247.6m (£155.5m)."
entertainment	Matisse and Turner in new Tate shows		The Tate has announced a series of major retrospectives for the coming year, including exhibitions on Matisse, Turner and Mondrian.London's Tate Modern focuses on Matisse's paper cut-outs, bringing together 120 works by the artist, while the Tate Britain looks at work from the last 20 years of JMW Turner's life.Tate Liverpool's Mondrian and his Studios marks the 70th anniversary of the abstract artist's death. It will include a life-size reconstruction of his Paris studio.The Matisse exhibition, which takes place next April, is the most comprehensive exhibition ever devoted to the artist's paper cut-outs made between 1943 and 1954.Henri Matisse began working with cut-outs when ill health prevented him from painting. His earliest cut-outs, defined by their sculptural form and use of colour, will be shown alongside text handwritten by the artist.The exhibition will also bring together Tate's The Snail 1953, its sister work Memory of Oceania 1953 and Large Composition with Masks 1953 - which, it is believed, were originally conceived as a unified whole.Also at the Tate Modern, this spring, is the first retrospective to encompass the full scope of pop artist Richard Hamilton's 60-year career.The London-born artist, who died in 2011, was often described as the founder of Pop Art. Yet his eclectic career encompassed much more, including a silk screen of the arrest of Mick Jagger, the cover of The Beatles' so-called White Album (1968) and a computer he designed himself.Late Turner: Painting Set Free will reassess Turner's body of work during Turner's final years (1835-50) when some of his most celebrated works were created, such as The Blue Rigi, Sunrise (1842).It will open at Tate Britain from September 2014.Also at the Tate Britain in the coming months is a major retrospective of the work of leading British sculptor and early Turner Prize winner Richard Deacon, who achieved international recognition in the 1980s with works such as Tall Tree in the Ear.There will also be exhibitions across the Tate dedicated to the work of abstract artist Kazimir Malevich, Germany's Sigmar Polke and a survey of British Folk Art.
entertainment	Mark Rothko painting crowns New York art sale		"A painting by abstract artist Mark Rothko has fetched $75.1 million (£47.2m) at an auction in New York.Rothko's No 1 (Royal Red and Blue), described by Sotheby's as ""a seminal, large-scale masterpiece"", was the subject of a heated bidding war.The price far exceeded the pre-sale estimate of $35m-$50m (£22m-£31.4m) but fell short of the record $86.9m (£54.6m) a Rothko fetched in May.The sale also saw a 1951 Jackson Pollock work sell for $40.4m (£25.4m).Pollock's Number 4, a characteristic drip painting, easily outstripped the previous highest price - $23m (£14.4m) - fetched at auction by a work by the abstract expressionist.The Rothko painting was one of eight works hand-selected by the Russian-American artist for his landmark solo show in 1954 at the Art Institute of Chicago.It had been in the same collection for 30 years before coming to auction.Tuesday's sale of post-war and contemporary art at Sotheby's saw plenty of interest from investors, raising a total of $375m (£236m) - the best auction result in the auction house's history.Andy Warhol had a strong showing, with Green Disaster (Green Disaster Twice) selling for $15.2m (£9.5m) and The Kiss (Bela Lugosi) fetching $9.3m (£5.8m).Another Warhol work, Suicide, that had been estimated to sell for between $6m (£3.7m) and $8m (£5m) ended up going for $16.3m (£10.2m).A ""screaming pope"" by British artist Francis Bacon sold for nearly $30m (£18.9m), a Willem de Kooning piece fetched just under $20m (£12.5m) while a work by Gerhard Richter went for $17.4m (£10.9m).Franz Kline's Shenandoah fetched $9.3m (£5.8m), setting another artist's record.""If you want to talk about the market being happy, healthy and well, here it is,"" said Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer, worldwide head of contemporary art.""That's probably about as good as it gets.""Further high prices are expected at a second Sotheby's contemporary and post-war art sale on Wednesday, with two Christie's sales focusing on the same period also taking place in New York this week."
entertainment	'Leonardo da Vinci artwork' sells for record $450m	Is it authentic?Speculation over buyerOther high-priced paintings	"A 500-year-old painting of Christ believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci has been sold in New York for a record $450m (£341m).The painting is known as Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World).It is the highest auction price for any work of art and brought cheers and applause at the packed Christie's auction room.Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519 and there are fewer than 20 of his paintings in existence.Salvator Mundi, believed to have been painted sometime after 1505, is the only work thought to be in private hands.Bidding began at $100m and the final bid for the work was $400m, with fees bringing the full price up to $450.3m. The unidentified buyer was involved in a bidding contest, via telephone, that lasted nearly 20 minutes.The painting shows Christ with one hand raised, the other holding a glass sphere.In 1958 it was sold at auction in London for a mere £45.By then the painting was generally reckoned to be the work of a follower of Leonardo and not the work of Leonardo himself.It apparently was part of King Charles I of England's collection in the 1600s and got lost, but was ""rediscovered"" in 2005.Analysis by Arts Editor Will Gompetz$450m for Salvator Mundi is an astonishing price to have realised, given both its condition and authenticity have been questioned.It shows that ultimately art comes down to belief.And there were plenty of bidders last night who were suitably convinced by its Leonardo da Vinci attribution to drive the price up to such stratospheric heights.As yet, the new owner is unknown.Speculation will be rife. Which I will contribute to, by noting the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi will have a Leonardo shaped hole in its displays when the decade-long loan deal with the French museums comes to an end.Wherever it ends up, you've got to hand it to Christie's for its masterclass in the art of selling art.In a bold move, without a hint of irony, the painting was sold in its Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale alongside a Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol.Why not in the Old Masters Sale? Because that's not where the elephant bucks are.The big money comes into the room nowadays when Pollocks and Twomblys are on the block, and promptly leaves when the Reynolds and Winterhalters arrive.Read more of Will Gompertz's blogs here.Dr Tim Hunter, who is an expert in Old Master and 19th Century art, told the BBC the painting is ""the most important discovery in the 21st Century"".""It completely smashes the record for the last Old Masters painting to sell - Van Gogh's Sunflowers in 1988. Records get broken from time to time but not in this way.""Da Vinci painted less than 20 oil paintings and many are unfinished so it's incredibly rare and we love that in art.""Before the auction it was owned by Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E Rybolovlev, who is reported to have bought it in a private sale in May 2013 for $127.5m (£98m).The painting has had major cosmetic surgery - its walnut panel base has been described as ""worm-tunnelled"" and at some point it seems to have been split in half - and efforts to restore it resulted in abrasions.BBC arts correspondent Vincent Dowd said that even now attribution to Leonardo is not universally accepted.One critic has described the surface of the painting to be ""inert, varnished, lurid, scrubbed over and repainted so many times that it looks simultaneously new and old"".""Any private collector who gets suckered into buying this picture and places it in their apartment or storage, it serves them right,"" Jerry Saltz wrote on Vulture.com.But Christie's has insisted the painting is authentic and billed it as ""the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 20th Century"".Georgina Adam, who is an Art Market specialist, told the BBC the price of the piece is ""fuelled by the sheer amount of money that billionaires have.""""This is the last Leonardo painting you can buy. This isn't as a store of value, it's the ultimate trophy - only one person in the world can own this.""If you think of the wealth of some billionaires, Bill Gates is worth 87 billion, and I'm not saying it's him, but near to half a billion would not be a colossal chunk out of his income for example.""The auction house has not revealed who purchased the picture, but Hunter speculates it could be a buyer from Asia or even be on the way to the new Louvre in Abu Dhabi.""It's the sort of painting you can imagine as a star piece in a private collection and as billionaire collectors like to set up their own museums, it could be a good piece for them,"" Hunter said.Adam also thinks the piece could have gone to an Asian market.""We don't know who bought it, I went to the Louvre in Abu Dhabi and I did wonder whether the Gulf could be responsible.""People are thinking the Far East, the picture was taken to Hong Kong before it was put up for sale to show to possible buyers there so that is possible. ""1. Interchange by Willem de Kooning - $300m (£230m)The 79 x 69 inch (2 x 1.75m) expressionist piece was painted in 1955. It was sold to hedge-fund founder Kenneth C Griffin, who spent about $500m in total in 2016 on a Pollock piece too.2. Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?) by Paul Gauguin - $300m (£230m)His post-impressionist painting of Tahiti women was sold in February 2015 to a mystery buyer, rumoured to be a Qatari museum, and is thought to share the top spot with a piece by William de Kooning.3. The Card Players by Paul Cézanne - $250m (£190m)This sale to Qatar broke records in 2011. The piece was painted at the end of the 19th Century and was part of a five-part series. The others in the series are at some of the world's most prestigious art museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.4. Number 17A by Jackson Pollock - $200m (£150m)This abstract expressionist piece was also sold in 2016 to Kenneth C Griffin from American businessman David Geffen.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Turner at Tate		Rivals in life, two of Britain's greatest painters Turner and Constable, are the subjects of major exhibitions in London.The general consensus was that Turner had lost his marbles. Old age had addled his brain, leaving him incapacitated as a painter: a past master who was now only capable of splashing paint on a canvas in the most indiscriminate fashion.That was the view in 1840, but not today. In 2014, the late works of Joseph Mallord William Turner are considered to be among his very best. The expressive brushwork, colour harmonies, dazzling light affects, and almost complete lack of pictorial detail is now seen as not only a pre-cursor to French Impressionism, but also to American Abstract Expressionism.Turner is presented not as an old master, but a modern one: a radical innovator, who cared little for rules, and not a jot for the establishment. To re-enforce the point the notoriously avant-garde annual Turner Prize is named after the cockney colourist.The truth is more subtle. Turner was a Romantic painter, who cared as much for words as he did for images. Many of his works are accompanied by texts or poems, either written by himself or those he admired. He was in many ways conservative, and nostalgic.He didn't want to rebel against the establishment, or art history - he wanted to be part of both. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the most straight-laced of art institutions, of which he was a member. He much admired the work of the great landscape painters such as Claude, and often chose traditional mythical subjects for his landscapes.His modernity was a compulsion to re-present the landscape for a new generation. It was an ambition shared with his great rival and contemporary John Constable, who arguably was the more radical of the two - painting en plein air with an uncompromising dedication to depicting reality.Turner took a different route. While Constable concentrated on detail, Turner spent his life removing it. He wanted to arouse the viewer's feelings: Constable was factual, Turner sensual. And never more so than in his late paintings, made largely after Constable's death. There is a freeness and bravura to them: a pure, heady emotion. Turner doesn't just show a storm at sea, he puts you in the middle of it. You can't see much, the swirling mist of sea and fog make it difficult to distinguish between the objects and the elements, the waves are mighty, the chances of survival slim.These late works feel cinematic: epic dramas writ large: think Spielberg meets Rubens with a soundtrack by Beethoven collaborating with Led Zeppelin. The colours are stunning, the compositions complex and often asymmetrical, departing in various directions. The few works in the exhibition that have remained unglazed give a truer indication of the artist's palette. The blues are paler, the yellows more muted. The honey-rich golden texture of many of his canvases look good, until you see how much better they would be without the sepia tinting of discoloured varnish.Turner started out painting watercolours as if they were oils, and ended his life painting oils as if they were watercolours. That in itself tells of a restless artist who never stopped looking, working, thinking and experimenting. And that's what you get from his late works - an energy and freshness combined with ideas and opinions, evident in every inch of every canvas.It has become the norm for painters to make large, increasingly abstract works in the final years. Monet did it, so did Rothko. Hockney is at it today. But, as with so much else in the world of modern art, J M W Turner was there first.
entertainment	'Most diverse Turner Prize to date'	Analysis - BBC arts editor Will GompertzFind out more about the nomineesHurvin AndersonAndrea ButtnerLubaina HimidRosalind Nashashibi	"It was once the domain of outrageous young artists.But this year the Turner Prize has grown up, shining a light on overlooked older artists, unsensational subject matter and traditional methods.The exhibition of the four shortlisted artists opens in Hull on Tuesday.After a rule change, Hurvin Anderson and Lubaina Himid are the first over-50s to be nominated since 1991, while Andrea Buttner and Rosalind Nashashibi are both in their 40s.In the past, the Turner Prize has been famed for works like Damien Hirst, with his cow in formaldehyde, Tracey Emin's unmade bed, and Martin Creed's The Lights Going On and Off.Artists of any age were eligible when the prize was first launched in 1984 but in 1991, the rules changed so that only artists under 50 could be considered.But earlier this year, the rule changed again to allow over 50s to enter.Anderson, 52, and Himid, 63, have taken their places in this year's nominees' exhibition and are now the bookies' favourites to win.Zanzibar-born, Preston-based Himid tackles attitudes to race, from slavery to the present day, through her tableaux of wooden figures and painted-over pottery. Anderson's vivid paintings blend his home city of Birmingham with the Jamaica of his forebears.Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who is chairing this year's jury, said there was a desire to celebrate artists who had previously been neglected by the mainstream.""The art world is more interested than ever before in important but overlooked figures, and work that was made in fairly recent times that didn't have the visibility for whatever reason,"" he said.""Sometimes that's to do with its politics, sometimes it's to do with the identity of the artist - you see, for example, a lot of work by older women being revisited by curators today. And particularly in the case of artists of colour and women artists.""Farquharson said this year's was ""the most international and diverse Turner Prize to date"".He explained: ""There is an artist from a Jamaican background, from an Irish and Palestinian background, an artist born in Tanzania and an artist born in Germany. But they're all part of the British art scene.""Farquharson also said there is ""quite a lot of painting"" in the exhibition - unlike in some previous years. He said artists no longer feel that unusual materials and methods are any more innovative than more traditional artforms.The exhibition is at Hull's Ferens Gallery as part of the UK City of Culture celebrations. The winner will be named on 5 December and will receive £25,000.This year's Turner Prize is an unmitigated disaster for the headline writers of Fleet Street. There are no enormous backsides to riff off, or unmade beds on which to pour scorn - there's no shock, or sensation, no vulgarity or profanity.In fact, the most remarkable thing about the 2017 Turner Prize is that it is unremarkable. All four shortlisted artists can actually paint - if they chose to do so; they largely make their own work, and the political and philosophical points they make are expressed with sense and sensibility.I suppose a more conservative exhibition was the inevitable outcome of removing the age restriction allowing artists over 50 to be considered for inclusion - as indeed two have this year. The Turner Prize has grown up.Read more from Will Gompertz.For the Turner Prize, having paintings on walls is so traditional that it almost feels radical. Anderson's images are split roughly into two types. Firstly there are lush, verdant rainforest-esque vistas, apparently inspired by seeing boys climbing trees in Jamaica and his brother's outings to scrump apples in Birmingham.Then there are set pieces inside barber shops, with bright blocks of colour framing lonely customers and empty chairs. One, titled Is It Okay To Be Black?, is a half-remembered view of a barber shop's wall featuring pinned photos of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.German-born Buttner's work is typical of the Turner Prize's newfound humility - her signature pieces are nine simple, line-drawn, black-and-white woodcuts of beggars, while her other work shows a fascination with the lowly and mundane.One wall is covered in bright yellow high-vis jacket material, upon which are hung what look like three abstract paintings, but which turn out to be enlarged fingerprints from a smartphone. She is also showing a 1990 peace display dedicated to philosopher and activist Simone Weil, which has been borrowed from an anti-war museum in Berlin.Himid's section contains work from the 1980s to today, reflecting her unsung role in art over the past 30 years. The centrepiece is 1986's The Fashionable Marriage, based on William Hogarth's Marriage a a la Mode, which features a cast of cut-out characters including a flirting Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.There are also porcelain dinner sets, found in junk shops. Himid has painted images of black slaves on some and Hogarth-inspired aristocrats - some of whom are vomiting at the news of the abolition of slavery - on others. She has also painted over parts of newspaper pages in a witty comment on the way black people are illustrated in the media.Nashashibi has turned one wing of the gallery into two mini cinemas, complete with reclaimed vintage cinema seats. They are screening her two meditative films, which give an insight into life in two different parts of the world.Electric Gaza is a collection of everyday scenes from the Gaza Strip - from horses being bathed in the sea to people going about their business on unkempt streets - all interspersed with animations. It's meant to show an alternative to the usual depiction of Gazans as victims. The other, Vivian's Garden, shows snapshots of mother-and-daughter artists in Guatemala.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

entertainment	Francis Bacon paintings make £21m at London auction		"Two works by British artist Francis Bacon, including the first painting he ever sold, have fetched more than £21m at a London auction.Head III, which sold for £150 at Bacon's first solo show 54 years ago, was bought for £10.4m by an American private collection.It had been estimated to sell for between £5m and £7m.A 1966 triptych portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne - Bacon's friend, muse and lover - went for £11.3m.Bacon and Rawsthorne became acquainted during preparations for their first solo shows at London's Hanover Gallery in 1949.The work had been estimated to sell for somewhere in the region of £10m to £15m.Other items included in Sotheby's contemporary art sale included David Hockney's colourful tribute to his home country, Double East Yorkshire, which fetched £3.4m - £400,000 more than its estimated value.Alex Branczik, head of Sotheby's London Contemporary Art Department, said it was a ""strong night"" for British art, photography, European abstract works and German artists.""We offered some great historic works of art and achieved some great prices for them, as buyers went down the connoisseurial route - buying with intelligence and passion,"" he said."
entertainment	Malevich: Master of the avant-garde		"Is Kazimir Malevich's famous Black Square (1915) painting a work of art? The majority of people to whom I speak think not. They are not alone.The artist himself didn't think so when he first created the composition in 1913 as a part of the scenery he was designing for a Futurist opera called Victory Over the Sun.It wasn't until two years later that the mystic-loving artist decided that his black square motif, which was ""done unconsciously"", was now an important work. It was, he said, part of a bigger idea that was ""bearing extraordinary fruit"".That bigger idea was to ""free art from the dead weight of reality"". Malevich called it Suprematism but its roots are to be found in Arthur Schopenhauer's 1818 text The World as Will and Representation.The German philosopher argued that we are all trapped by the insatiability of our will, which makes our lives intolerably miserable.The only escape, he said, was through art, the best form of which was music because of its abstract nature.Malevich applied this thinking to painting. By making pictures that contained absolutely no reference to the physical world, with no hint of a tree, a shoe or a house etc, the viewer would be free to react to the work in a purely emotional way.He was, he said, making art that was about the ""supremacy of feeling"".You can now see a comprehensive collection of Malevich's paintings in an exhibition at Tate Modern.The show starts at the beginning of his career when he is responding to the work of Cezanne, Matisse, Monet and Picasso that he had seen in Moscow.He then hops on the Cubist, Futurist bandwagon and gives it a Russian makeover by adding peasants to his pictures.And then comes the moment that he and his fellow avant-garde colleagues had long been striving for: a modern art breakthrough that was made in Russia.This is the pivotal point of the exhibition, the moment at which Malevich's pastiche and experimentation becomes radically innovative, epoch-making art.It is 1915 and he moves into total abstraction, while cutting off all ties with the past by saying his predecessors were ""counterfeiters"".The works are stunning. Even today, nearly a century later, they feel powerful and modern and important.It would and should be fantastically exciting but is utterly ruined by the wretched soundtrack of Victory Over the Sun blasting through the galleries.The opera was very irritating in 1913 and it's still very irritating now.Malevich's Suprematist paintings have many qualities, chief among which is their composition. Unlike most paintings, these abstract masterpieces appear to emit a soundscape - they have an aural quality.You can hear the discordant tones of the clashing geometric shapes that refuse to resolve themselves: the bold black blocks sound a deep, sombre tone, while the thin, jaggedly rectangles of blue and yellow scream out the high notes.But you can't hear any of this because of the incomprehensible noise blaring out from the soundtrack of Victory Over the Sun. What's going on? Surely headphones could be supplied to those who want to listen and watch the film showing a recreation of the opera?I mentioned my irritation to one of the Tate's staff who confessed the music was also driving the gallery assistants crazy.The solution to the problem seems simple, it's a quick fix - turn the opera into a silent disco and free Malevich's art to strike its chords with the visitors.The current situation is hopeless: what should be one the most exemplary shows to be held in London this decade is being thoroughly spoilt by a lack of sensitivity towards the audience and the art.Malevich: Revolutionary of Russian Art is on at Tate Modern, London until 26 October."
entertainment	RA's Summer Exhibition: A sprawling exhibition of varying quality		"The Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition has run uninterrupted since 1769, showcasing the work of professional and amateur artists together in a quintessentially British exhibition.BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz takes an illustrated tour of this year's show.The academy has whittled down 12,000 submitted art works to 1,200 for its 2014 show, it's a sprawling exhibition of varying quality.Rule number one in the exhibition-making manual is to start well with a strong room of good work. It reassures the visitor, gives him or her confidence.Rule number two is: Don't show too much stuff.The RA's Summer Exhibition has heeded the first, and - by design - ignored the second. The quantity of art on display is great, the standard patchy.The show does start well with the RA's Central Hall exhibiting work by newly elected Academicians.Yinka Shonibare's Cake Man II - yours for £162,000 - takes centre stage. The life-size mannequin is bent forwards, balancing a leaning tower of cakes on its shoulders.The figure is dressed in Shonibare's signature colourful African fabrics, topped off with a globe for a head, decorated with stock market graphs. The sculpture is elegant, its message heavy-handed.Bob and Roberta Smith, Conrad Shawcross and Chantal Joffe are all represented in the room, but the standout pieces are by the newly elected Honorary Academician, Marlene Dumas. The South African-born artist has two small head portraits - Helena and Scarlett. Both are excellent, neither is for sale.Turn left and you enter a room of black and white art curated by the artist Cornelia Parker. There's plenty to enjoy in here - not least a break from the chromatic cacophony of the rest of the show. She said she wanted to present work by artists whom she feels ought to be Academicians, like Ryan Gander, Fiona Banner and Martin Creed.Their pieces are fine, but the one that caught my eye was a tiny pencil drawing hidden behind a giant placard by Bob and Roberta Smith. Unlike almost everything else in the room, this is not a work that Cornelia Parker commissioned or selected from friends' studios, but one she chose from the open submission.It's called Haywain After Hieronymus Bosch and is for sale at £2,000, It is by Rowan Fuggle, an artist who appears to be a graduate from the The Ruskin School of Fine Art in Oxford. I grabbed this photo of it on my phone...Next door, a mighty red inkjet print by Turner Prize-winner Wolfgang Tilmans blows away the black & white vibe. Greifbar 1 (£102,000) is one of the German photographer's large abstract colour-field images. Stand up-close and it appears sensuous and fragile, but seen from a distance it becomes powerful and bold. Either way, it's very good.Tilmans is not the only German making a splash with a large abstract work. In the huge Room III Gallery, two of the big daddies of German Expressionism are having something of a face off. On one side of the room there is a large, half painted, unusually delicate canvas by George Baselitz (£370,000).Directly opposite hangs a massive impasto painting by Anselm Kiefer (not for sale) called Kranke Kunst (""sick art"" or ""diseased art"").It's not often that the two artists are hung in such close proximity, a curatorial stand-off that started with their controversial joint commission at the 1980 Venice Biennale, where one of Baselitz's statues was interpreted as giving a Nazi salute.On a lighter note, there are a couple of small watercolours by the actress Una Stubbs, called Benedict and Martin respectively. They are of her fellow Sherlock stars Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch.They're not marvellous, but they are fun - and that's allowed, even at the Royal Academy."
entertainment	Facebook: Social network, media company - or both?	Arbiters of truth	"Is Facebook a media company?This abstract question may strike you as the preserve of Palo Alto wannabes, Lower East Side podcasters, and media navel-gazers closer to home.In fact the answer, while complex, goes to the very essence of democracy in our time.And you cannot understand Thursday's announcement from the company, about its clampdown on fake news, without answering the prior question above.The measures Facebook is taking - which range from making it easier to flag fake news to hurting the finances of fake news generators - while welcome, stop short of what some critics would like to see.The revolution in media means that platforms like Facebook are increasingly doing what publishers do.As Tony Haile argued in a recent episode of the Wall Street Journal's superb Media Mix podcast, ""Publishers do five things: they create, post, curate, distribute and monetise content. Facebook now does four of those five... [But] they don't create.""I think even this point is debatable. It is true that Facebook doesn't commission original content, or journalism. But the advent of Facebook Live brings them very close to doing this.When Lavish Reynolds used that tool to produce an astonishing broadcast of the moments after her boyfriend Philando Castile was shot by a Minnesota Police officer, she was clearly broadcasting live news.Of course Facebook didn't ask her to; but through Facebook Live, as through the social network's Instant Articles feature, Facebook facilitates original journalism, much as Amazon helped entrepreneurs with its Web Services technology.Funded by advertising; helping to create vast amounts of stories; the main source of news for millions around the world. That sounds like a media company, doesn't it?And yet Facebook doesn't see it that way, in one vital respect. It doesn't want to use human judgement to arbitrate between truth and falsehood.On Wednesday I spoke at length to Adam Mosseri, Vice President of Product for News Feed at Facebook. He briefed me on Facebook's latest efforts to clamp down on the fake news which, some argue, helped Donald Trump to enter the White House.Mark Zuckerberg initially described such a claim as ""crazy"", but has since tried to demonstrate he takes the issue seriously. Hence the announcement that Facebook will do four things:Together, these measures will make a difference. As Zuckerberg has argued, and Mosseri re-iterated, fake news is a very small fraction of the material shared by the Facebook community, and weeding it out completely is impracticable.But there is one, fascinating, vital respect in which Facebook will not do what its critics want.It will not ask staff to make a call on what is true or false. In other words, it will not employ editors.As Mosseri said to me in relation to the above, this effort to clamp down on fake news is ""algorithmic"" - Facebook will rely on algorithms, and the judgement of its community of users, to flag potential fake news. It won't make those decisions for itself, using its own staff.Years ago, Zuckerberg described Facebook as a utility company. Then some smart people pointed out that utilities operate in a regulatory environment.So the emphasis changed to it being a technology company. Just this August, Zuckerberg said ""we are a tech company, not a media company"" in Rome.But Facebook's impact on the media industry has been revolutionary, gobbling up advertising and enticing vast new audiences.Every day there are several pieces bemoaning the duopoly that Facebook and Google allegedly have over the media industry. Those complaints unite the New York Times with The Sun.So while Facebook claims not to be a media company, the impact that it has on other media companies, together with its role in disseminating false information, will mean that publishers continue to condemn it.They argue that Facebook may be one of the world's greatest companies, but it is shirking a crucial public duty - namely, to be arbiters of truth.The world's biggest platform, increasingly, has the role once fulfilled by news publishers, without the legal restrictions and social obligations.In short, Facebook is a media company - even though it doesn't want to be."
entertainment	Bridget Riley receives Dutch art prize		"British artist Bridget Riley has become the first woman to receive the Sikkens Prize, a prestigious Dutch art award that recognises the use of colour.The 81-year-old's work is renowned for its abstract geometrical shapes and for what the Sikkens Foundation called its ""purity, subtlety and precision"".To mark the prize, the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague is hosting an exhibition of her art that will run until June.""I hope people will find things in it to look at,"" Riley told The Guardian.According to the Sikkens Foundation, Riley's use of colour has led to ""a sensational oeuvre from which a new generation of artists is drawing inspiration"".The Gemeentemuseum exhibition includes a new 20 metre (65 foot) wall mural, painted by assistants, entitled Composition with Circles 9.""One of the difficulties that many people seem to have with my work is what they complain of as dazzling,"" Riley told the BBC in 2010, the year the National Gallery in London presented a major exhibition of her work.""What I was interested in was visual energy and the dynamics of how you could build up a situation that produced a sensation."""
entertainment	Francis Bacon portrait of lover fetches £42m		"A portrait of Francis Bacon's former lover George Dyer has sold for £42.2m, smashing its pre-sale estimate of £28m.Christie's said the 6ft-tall artwork, entitled Portrait of George Dyer Talking, was the most valuable work of art it had sold in Europe.It was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder at Christie's Post War and Contemporary Art auction in London.Dyer died of an overdose in Paris two days before the painting was exhibited at a Bacon retrospective in 1971.Dyer and Bacon had become involved after Bacon caught Dyer burgling his house.The canvas depicts the artist's lover perched on a stool, his twisted body positioned under a naked light bulb.The 1966 painting is understood to have been sold by Mexican banker David Martinez Guzman. It last appeared on the open market in 2000, when it sold for £4m at Christie's in New York.The most expensive Bacon work ever sold at auction was his triptych of Lucian Freud, which sold for £85.3m ($142m) last November.Also in the sale was Abstraktes Bild, a large abstract canvas by Gerhard Richter from 1989, which fetched £19.5m.Jeff Koons' Cracked Egg (Magenta) fetched £14m - with the seller reported to be Koons's friend and colleague Damien Hirst.Hirst's own Mickey Mouse depiction fetched £902,500, with all the proceeds going to children's charity Kids Company.The work, which represents the figure of the Disney character with a series of large circles, went for three times more than the expected price.Speaking after the auction, the charity's founder, Camilla Batmanghelidjh, said: ""Some childlike magic happened tonight... in reality, Mickey came to the rescue of some of the most vulnerable children.""This money will change lives.

entertainment	Playboy artwork sells at New York auction		"A Dali watercolour of a reclining nude that once hung in Playboy founder Hugh Hefner's bedroom has fetched $266,500 (£168,500) at a New York auction.The nude, which featured in a 1967 issue of Playboy, was among 125 artworks owned by the magazine to go under the hammer at Christie's.Mouth No. 8, a 1966 oil painting of a scarlet-lipsticked mouth by pop artist Tom Wesselmann, sold for $1.9m (£1.2m).Wednesday's sale included 80 photos and 24 cartoons.Nearly all the items up for grabs had appeared in the magazine, first published in 1953.The Dali watercolour was part of a 1967 issue that asked artists to create art inspired by Playboy's ""Playmate"" models.Sold to an anonymous bidder, the piece had been expected to fetch no more than $150,000 (£95,000).Wesselmann's work, part of a series the artist began in 1965, sold for slightly less than expected.Yet Aaron Baker, curator of the Playboy Art Collection, still called it a great example of his work ""from his best period"".In an interview last month, Playboy editor-in-chief Hefner said the magazine had blurred the lines between ""fine"" and ""popular"" art.""Before Playboy and a few other places, commercial art was essentially... very realistic,"" the 84-year-old said.""We introduced into commercial illustration the whole notion of everything from abstract to semi-abstract to stuff that you found on a gallery wall.""According to Baker, the sale represented a fraction of Playboy's archive of 5,000 contemporary works and more than 20 million photographs.The archive is currently held at a storage building in Chicago, where Playboy Enterprises is based."
entertainment	In pictures: Famous names 30 minutes before curtain up		"The half hour before an actor goes on stage, to give what he or she hopes will be a stellar performance, is precious.These are minutes for finding composure, getting ""in the zone"" - and putting the finishing touches to make-up. The special quality of this period has long fascinated photographer Simon Annand.For more than 30 years, he's been immortalising it through his lens after being granted exclusive pre-show access into stars' dressing rooms. The result is a series of images called simply The Half.A forthcoming exhibition from the series will include 74 photographs that have never been seen before in public, with subjects including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Dame Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Gillian Anderson and Stephen Fry.Annand says that unlike working on a film set, where the actor can wait for ages to be called, ""the theatre demands that he or she be ready at a fixed time and this is repeated each day. There is no escape and the discipline required is intense"".In his sessions, he's tried to be as non-verbal as possible, so as not to disturb the rhythm of the actor, he tells BBC News, adding: ""Objective information can be more revealing, allowing the viewer to read the image as they wish. Rather than an attempt to influence their impression.""Annand has talked us through a selection of shots from the show.Gillian Anderson at the Young Vic in 2016 for A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee WilliamsShe played the fragile southern belle Blanche Dubois.Annand: ""For this performance she won the Evening Standard award for best actress and made Blanche her own. This session lasted barely four minutes but that was enough.""Gillian's presence is such that almost anything she does makes a photograph. In this case, turning around, at a moment when she is slipping into the fictional character, suggested to me why she was interested in playing this part.""It has always been my intention to make images where the atmosphere is intense but remains open for the viewer to hang their own story on the picture.""Cate Blanchett at the Albery Theatre for Plenty by David Hare in 1999Blanchett played the heroine Susan Traherne in a post-war drama spanning 20 years.Annand: ""The first photograph I ever took of Cate. She entered the dressing room, rolled a cigarette and was contemplating the performance ahead. Taken through the mirror.""This is not a pose, as some have asked, but the coming together of her demands during the day, going on the stage in 30 minutes and the presence of a photographer in the dressing room.""I have always chosen Cate as my favourite person to photograph, especially as she chose not to chuck me out at a time when privacy might have preferable. Her openness and willingness not to shut down is, in my view, one of her greatest strengths as an artist.""Jude Law for Hamlet at Wyndham's Theatre in 2009Law played the tragic Danish prince in a modern-day staging of the Shakespeare classic.Annand: ""Jude was a very popular leader of the company. The image of Fred Astaire was an antidote to the difficulties of playing the troubled Dane.""It is often remarked by actors that the more intense a story is, and Hamlet is one of the most complex, the more it is necessary to create a mood of light relief backstage. The atmosphere that evening was very playful and this photo shows the actor beginning to take on the demands of a role, minutes before leaving the room.""Phoebe Waller Bridge for Rope by Patrick Hamilton at the Almeida in 2010Waller-Bridge played Leila Arden in a murder thriller set amidst the privilege and emptiness of the jazz age.Annand: ""The first time I had the good fortune to photograph Phoebe was two or three years before this at The Bush.""The sense of her unabashed brightness was noticeable and very refreshing. It's no accident she is adored by the many who know her work.""Dame Judi Dench for Peter and Alice by John Logan at the Noel Coward Theatre in 2013Dame Judi starred alongside Ben Whishaw in a story of loss and grief.Annand: ""This is an image of the great actress just after a conversation about her late and beloved husband Michael Williams.""Judi has always been a supporter of The Half, for which I am forever grateful. It is a privilege to witness her in a moment of introspection and it seemed like her arm was extended to embrace a cherished absence.""Tom Hardy for Festen by David Eldridge at the Almeida in 2004Hardy played Michael in the production based on the first of the Dogme films and which tackles the long-term consequences of child abuse.Annand: ""He is reading the script of a Mission Impossible film… People are sometimes surprised at how Tom looked then.""He appeared supremely confident and in a way plotting the future which was to be so successful. The kind of presence you cannot miss in a room.""Sheila Atim for The Girl of the North Country by Conor McPherson at the Noel Coward theatre in 2018Atim played Marianne Laine in the musical based on the work of Bob Dylan and set during the winter of the Great Depression in the US.Annand: ""Sheila is about to become world famous in the prequel to Game of Thrones.""Everyone in the business has followed her steady rise to stardom over the last four or five years. She has a voice like an angel, is a delight to work with and deserves every credit she will undoubtedly receive.""Stephen Fry for Twelfth Night at The Globe in 2012Fry played the killjoy Malvolio in the Shakespeare comedy.Annand: ""Stephen's performance as Malvolio was his first in a theatre since prematurely leaving a West End production of Cellmates in 1995 after an attack of stage fright.""It seemed charming and wonderfully brave to have chosen the unpopular malcontent for his comeback. Another triumph in a long line of English archetypes he has crafted for his fortunate audience.""Colin Firth for The Lonely Road by Christopher Fetts at the Old Vic in 1985Firth played Felix in a story of family deception set in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th Century.Annand: ""Colin Firth playing in the theatre before his film/TV career took off.""There are some performers who, when they first appear on the scene, it is self-evident very early on they are born to channel certain aspects of human nature. Colin Firth is one of them. It is the theatre's loss that this wonderful actor has not appeared more often on the stage.""Anthony Hopkins at the National Theatre in 1986 for Pravda by David Hare and Howard BrentonHopkins played the Murdoch-like media tycoon Lambert Le Roux in the satirical comedy about Fleet Street.Annand: ""Just back from a long time away in America, preparing for his extraordinary performance in Pravda at the NT. Like many great film stars, to whom the camera is attracted, his head seems large in proportion to his shoulders.""He initially reneged on an agreement to be seen. After reminding him of his senior position in the business, and my intention to promote theatre as live performance, he liked my determination not to give up and enthusiastically gave me two hours for the session.""In those days the session was accompanied by an interview and a tiny recorder can be seen on the left [of the bottom right-hand photo].""Meera Syal for Annie at the Piccadilly Theatre in 2017Syal played the formidable children's home mistress Miss Hannigan in the classic musical.Annand: ""It has always fascinated me why an actor chooses a certain role, and then to see the manifestation he or she will give to the character, especially if a heightened style is used.""The make-up for Meera as Miss Hannigan, the cruel alcoholic who hates children, is a perfect combination to convey the awfulness of the character but it also adds a certain vibrant attraction. Satan was after all an angel who was thrown out of heaven and then tried to take all the other angels with him, down to hell.""David Tennant for The Rivals by Richard Brinsley Sheridan at the RSC in 2001Tennant played Jack Absolute in this classic comedy of errors from 1775 set in five acts and telling the story of the romantic difficulties of Lydia Languish.Annand: ""[Theatre director] Marianne Elliot's mother, Rosalind Knight [actress], said there is a wonderful new talent down at the RSC. Knowing Rosalind had the authority to make trustworthy recommendations, considerable effort was made to secure a session with him. The camera loves a quick and quirky intelligence.""The Half opens on 7 September at the Lawrence Batley Theatre in Huddersfield and runs until February.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	How Mary Poppins has changed for the stage	New characters	"The stage adaptation of Mary Poppins is not the kind of show where the actors can afford to let their concentration lapse.There are several precise and tricky cues for the cast to hit across the three-hour West End production.Props have to appear from (or disappear into) thin air. There are magic tricks. Characters dance upside down on the ceiling. There are scenes that involve complex choreography, kite flying and statues coming to life.It's a testament to how tightly rehearsed the show is that nothing went wrong at the show's opening night on Wednesday.""It does sometimes!"" laughs Zizi Strallen, who plays the legendary leading role. ""But there are contingency plans, that's the beauty of live theatre, and it's my job to cover it up as well if it does go wrong.""The most complicated part of the show, she says, is a scene which will be familiar to fans of the original 1964 film starring Julie Andrews, where Poppins is seen somehow pulling huge items out of a relatively small handbag.""Not only am I singing and being Mary Poppins, I'm then essentially doing magic tricks,"" Strallen explains, crediting the magic specialist who was hired to teach her. ""There's a magic teapot, bringing a plant out of the bag, a hat stand, a mirror, putting them all on the wall so they don't fall off.""There's a lot of pressure in that number, a lot of things to think about. So my brain is going 100 miles per hour. And then when that number's done I think 'right, now I can just have fun'.""The reboot of the stage production, which was first staged in 2004, is the latest instalment of a franchise which the public seem endlessly fascinated by.Last year, a film sequel starring Emily Blunt - Mary Poppins Returns - took $350m (£273m) at the box office worldwide. A very healthy figure, albeit not as high as some of Disney's other recent hits.Veteran theatre producer Cameron Mackintosh, whose group Delfont Mackintosh Theatres owns the Prince Edward, where Mary Poppins is playing, says they've been holding off for the right time to bring the show back to the West End.""It's the first time the theatre's been available, so we had to wait patiently,"" he explains. ""And also, Disney had the film last year and we would've been silly to confuse the public by bringing this back. We were on tour three years ago, and it was an enormous success, but we knew with the film coming out there was no point, we had to wait for the film.""The stage show also stars 86-year-old Petula Clark, who sings one of the film's most famous numbers, Feed The Birds. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and Chim Chim Cheree, naturally, also feature.But there are new songs in the mix too, as well as characters who appeared in the books but won't be familiar to fans of the two films.Mr Banks regularly refers to the stern nanny from his own childhood, Miss Andrew, who then appears later in the show to take over from Poppins, much to the children's horror.Strallen says: ""I want audiences to have not necessarily a new version of Mary Poppins, just a different one. People were open to the Emily Blunt version, and this one is actually quite true to the books. So it would be lovely if they went home and read the PL Travers books.""[We have] Mary Poppins in the park, and the park keeper is introduced, and Miss Andrew is introduced, so we have all these different elements, and I think there's something about seeing magic live which is crazy, and you just don't get that from a film.""The show was awarded a rare five-star review by The Guardian's Michael Billington, who praised the ""excellent performance"" of Strallen.""Every movement she makes is balletic - she doesn't just exit from a room but floats out of it with arms extended,"" he said. ""Travers scholars may still miss the darkness of the books, but for the rest of us the show is an unassailable treat and Eyre's production has acquired the heart to go with its art.""The show also received warm reviews in The Telegraph, The Evening Standard and WhatsOnStage.However, Tim Bano of The Stage described the production as ""muddled"", adding: ""Even at almost three hours, the whole thing feels rushed. The songs are taken at a lick, and the production jolts from one set-piece to another without pause for breath. Watch the film, read the books. Save the magic.""The book for the show was written by Julian Fellowes, who worked on the project several years before he became best known as the architect behind the phenomenally successful Downton Abbey.""It was a rather interesting challenge, because you're having to be true to two sources as opposed to just one,"" he tells BBC News. ""And you don't want to be disappointing for fans of the books or the film. My wife didn't even know there were books. But I enjoyed the challenge of it.""For Strallen, the themes of the show mean it could be staged ""in Edwardian times, or in the future - it works at any time"".""Even though it's set in Edwardian London, it's about family, and it's about appreciating one another,"" she says. ""And that is kind of timeless, it's at the core of everyone's life to love and appreciate each other.Joseph Millson, who plays the children's father, George Banks, adds: ""There are two things to this. There's a financial element that it just was time to do it again and the film went well. So there's all sorts of fiscal reasons for Disney and so on, but you know what, I genuinely believe this is a show for today, that could've been written this year and put on at the National Theatre.""That's my feeling, that there's a genuine usefulness to it. Now of course people are here to eat ice cream and forget about their troubles, but honestly, the little bit that stays with you when you leave, is really useful.""The launch of Mary Poppins follows last week's opening night of Death of a Salesman - which took place two days before a ceiling collapse prompted the theatre to be evacuated and the show to change venue.Given how many theatres in the West End are owned by Mackintosh's group, is he at all worried about the state of venues in the West End?""No, because we've done all mine!"" he replies. ""I'm just finishing the Sondheim, which is going to be glorious and it's completely rebuilt. So I've been doing that over the last 20 years, I've been rebuilding them, and they're the most wonderful places.""Mary Poppins is now playing at the Prince Edward Theatre."
entertainment	Clive James: Australian broadcaster and author dies aged 80	'Condom full of walnuts'	"Clive James, the Australian writer and broadcaster known around the world for his dry wit, has died at the age of 80.Diagnosed with leukaemia in 2010, the author and critic had movingly written about his terminal illness during the final years of his life.Born Vivian James in 1939, he moved to England in 1961 and rose to prominence as a literary critic and TV columnist.He went on to deliver wry commentary on international programming in such shows as Clive James On Television.The show saw him introduce amusing and off-beat TV clips from around the world, most famously from Japanese game show Endurance.According to a statement from his agents, he died at home in Cambridge on Sunday. A private funeral was held on Wednesday in the chapel at Pembroke College.""Clive died almost 10 years after his first terminal diagnosis, and one month after he laid down his pen for the last time,"" the statement read.""He endured his ever-multiplying illnesses with patience and good humour, knowing until the last moment that he had experienced more than his fair share of this 'great, good world'.""He was grateful to the staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital [in Cambridge] for their care and kindness, which unexpectedly allowed him so much extra time.""His family would like to thank the nurses of the Arthur Rank Hospice at Home team for their help in his last days, which allowed him to die peacefully and at home, surrounded by his family and his books.""Singer Alison Moyet was among many to pay tribute to a man she described as a ""bright, beaming boy"".Ex-tabloid editor Piers Morgan remembered him as ""a brilliantly funny man"", while presenter Gaby Roslin said he had been ""incredibly kind"".""We were lucky to have him for so long after his diagnosis,"" wrote actor Samuel West. ""We were lucky to have him at all.""Monty Python star Eric Idle expressed his sadness at losing ""dear Clive James my pal at Cambridge"".Reverend Richard Coles said he was ""the best telly critic that ever there was"", while Margarita Pracatan - the Cuban singer James helped make a household name - paid tribute to his ""intelligence... talent and beautiful way of living"".James was ""unquestionably the greatest Australian poet of his time"", said George Brandis, Australia's High Commissioner to the UK, adding to tributes in the writer's beloved homeland.Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, said the ""irreplaceable"" James was ""a clever, witty and thought-provoking broadcaster"".""He had a huge range of talents and everything he did was essential listening or viewing,"" Lord Hall continued.James was renowned for his pithy turns of phrase. He once likened Arnold Schwarzenegger to ""a brown condom full of walnuts"" and said motor racing commentator Murray Walker sounded ""like a man whose trousers are on fire"".He was equally waspish when describing Dame Barbara Cartland, whose eyes he said ""looked like the corpses of two small crows that had crashed into a chalk cliff"".""Common sense and a sense of humour are the same thing, moving at different speeds,"" was another of his famous quotes.He also had advice for his future obituarists, telling them ""shorter is better, and that a single line is best"".""Any encounter with James, either in print or in person, left you desperate to go and open a book, watch a film or a TV show, or hunt down a recording,"" said Don Paterson, poetry editor at James's publisher Picador.""With Clive's passing we lose the wisest and funniest of writers, a loyal and kind friend, and the most finely-stocked mind we will ever have the fortune to encounter.""Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	From Gormley to Rodin: The famous artworks hidden in plain sight	1. The Rodin outside a Nando's2. The Frink wild boar on the water3. The high street Hepworth4. The Antony Gormley on top of an art shop5. The Epstein on Coventry Cathedral	"A Rodin outside a chicken shop in Essex is one of around 150,000 public sculptures on a list of the UK's art that is being made available online.The artworks will be added to the database run by the charity Art UK over the next two years. It is the largest sculpture cataloguing project undertaken in the UK.There are significant sculptures in public places dotted around the UK - here are five you might not have spotted.French sculptor Auguste Rodin wanted his 1882 statue Eve to be part of his Gates of Hell project. Rodin worked on the unfinished project until his death.Today, this cast of the statue has pride of place outside a string of chain restaurants in the Water Gardens shopping centre in Harlow, Essex, after being bought from Paris's Rodin museum.The Rodin isn't the only sculpture in Harlow. This bronze boar by Dame Elisabeth Frink keeps the ducks company in the Water Gardens.Frink was a celebrated sculptor and printmaker, who has sculptures in many locations around the UK, including Winchester town centre and London's Grosvenor Square.Barbara Hepworth's Winged Figure isn't on the database yet, but it has soared above shoppers on London's Oxford Street for more than 50 years.The Grade II-listed sculpture on the east wall of the John Lewis building was unveiled in 1963.Hepworth once said: ""If the figure in Oxford Street gives people a sense of being airborne in rain and sunlight and nightlight, I will be very happy.""Sir Antony Gormley may be best-known for the Angel of the North in Gateshead or his figures at Crosby Beach, but there's another of his works among Oxford's dreaming spires that's less easy to spot.The 7ft (2.1m) statue of a naked man was commissioned by Exeter College, and is part of Gormley's sculpture series Another Time.St Michael's Victory over the Devil is shown in this statue by Sir Jacob Epstein, mounted on the side of the rebuilt Coventry Cathedral in 1958.American-born Epstein was one of the champions of modernism. He became a British citizen in 1910.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
entertainment	Rare Charlotte Bronte book coming home after museum's auction success	'An absolute highlight'	"A book written by Charlotte Bronte at the age of 14 will return home after being bought by the Bronte Society at auction in Paris.The miniature work, called The Young Men's Magazine, will go to the Parsonage Museum in the Brontes' old home in Haworth, West Yorkshire.It was bought for €600,000 (£512,970) after a fundraising campaign by the Bronte Society, which runs the museum.The museum lost out on the book when it last went under the hammer in 2011.The total price including buyer's premium was €780,000 (£666,790).The work is one of six ""little books"" written by Charlotte, the eldest of the three sisters, in 1830. Five are known to survive, and the Bronte Parsonage Museum already holds the other four.The works were created for Charlotte's toy soldiers and document an imaginary world created by the family called Glass Town.Charlotte is best known for her 1847 classic novel Jane Eyre.Kitty Wright, executive director of The Bronte Society, said: ""We were determined to do everything we could to bring back this extraordinary 'little book' to the Bronte Parsonage Museum and now can't quite believe that it will in fact be coming home to where it was written 189 years ago.""We have been truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from people from all over the world backing our campaign and can't wait to have it in place with the others and on public view to the world.""The museum's principal curator Ann Dinsdale added that bringing the ""unique manuscript"" back to Haworth was an ""absolute highlight"" of her 30-year career at the venue.""Charlotte wrote this miniscule magazine for the toy soldiers she and her siblings played with and as we walk through the same rooms they did, it seems immensely fitting that it is coming home and we would like to say an enormous thank you to everyone who made it possible.""Part of the Young Men's Magazine describes a murderer driven to madness after being haunted by his victims, and how ""an immense fire"" burning in his head causes his bed curtains to set alight.Experts at the museum say this section of the story is ""a clear precursor"" of a famous scene between Bertha and Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, which Charlotte would publish 17 years later.The society said more than 1,000 people had pledged money to help buy the book. Several celebrities, including Dame Judi Dench, Dame Jacqueline Wilson and Tracy Chevalier, backed the society's efforts to raise money.York-born Dame Judi, who is president of the Bronte Society, said earlier this year: ""I have long been fascinated by the little books created by the Brontes when they were children.""These tiny manuscripts are like a magical doorway into the imaginary worlds they inhabited, and also hint at their ambition to become published authors.""The existence of the book that went up for sale - measuring 35mm x 61mm and consisting of 20 pages - came to light in 2011 when it was auctioned at Sotheby's.The Bronte society was outbid by a discredited investment scheme that is no longer operational. The scheme was run by Gérard Lhéritier and his company Aristophil, who set up the Musee des Lettres et Manuscrits in Paris.Lhéritier saw the potential financial rewards in rare works such as the Bronte book, so bought and filled his museum with them. His company was accused of selling shares in a Ponzi-style pyramid scheme, built on false advertising and illusionary market values.About 18,000 people in France are believed to have been defrauded in what went on to become one of the biggest ever arts market scams, having invested nearly €1bn. The company behind it was shut down by regulators in 2014.According to The Art Newspaper, the French government is seeking to recover hundreds of public archives that should never have been sold and a criminal investigation is ongoing.Lhéritier denies all accusations.Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	Berlin Wall: 'Germany was first reunited on the dancefloor'	'Utopian''A friendly revolution''The re-start of a life''Queer culture was crucial''Influential'	"Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, some of the city's clubbers and DJs recall how illegal raves helped bring a once divided nation back together.Berlin today is a temple for dance music fans from all corners of the globe, ready to leave their prejudices at the nightclub door and collectively surrender to the beat.There was a time not so long ago though when scenes of this nature were a physical and ideological impossibility.While baggy ravers in the UK were coming together for an extended Second Summer of Love, people in the German capital remained divided by a 27-mile wall.After it came down on 9 November 1989, as well as rubble and dust, there was a sudden explosion of underground parties in vacant buildings, train stations and power plants.Unlike the discos of old, these ecstasy-fuelled nights took their lead from the new sounds of Detroit techno and Chicago acid house, while emulating the free-spirited experience of parties in Ibiza and at Manchester's Hacienda club.Heiko Hoffmann, who was a teenager at the time, said the ""massive shift"" to rave culture instantly ""changed my life"".Previously, West Berliners like him were only able to visit the east with a day pass. Generally speaking, people in the east could not cross the border.""Just a couple of weeks after the fall of the wall I was dancing in industrial ruins next to people from the east, who just a couple of months earlier I wouldn't have been able to meet,"" says Hoffmann, the co-curator of the new No Photos on the Dance Floor! exhibition.""All of this was happening to mostly very raw techno music,"" he adds, explaining that the name of the collection refers to the prevailing culture of protecting revellers from the judgement of the all-seeing camera.""If someone would tell you today that next week North and South Korea would be reunited, and a radical new form of music that you didn't know existed before would be coming, and people would be dancing together in spaces that were new and unused for both of them, you would think that's completely utopian.""That's what happened 30 years ago.""Wild nights in often temporary and industrial spaces near where the wall had stood - from Potsdamer Platz to Friedrichshain - fitted the primitive music and light/sound systems perfectly.Hoffmann believes the conditions were ripe for this unique scene to grow, because there was ""a social change happening, as well as a musical one.""""Germany was first reunited on the dancefloor of these parties. You didn't really have to make a distinction any longer between east and west.""I think it's crucial that it was not people from East Berlin dancing to music that was already around, or going to spaces that were West Berlin spaces, but it was really that people from the west and east could discover something radically new together.""It took almost a year for Germany to be officially re-unified in October 1990, and even then there were still plenty of legal grey areas.East Berliner Sebastian Szary, of electronic music duo Modeselektor, recalls how budding young DJs and party people like himself at the time took full advantage.""Anything was possible because there was no rule, the government was still in a grey zone - in a no-man's land - and the law was not written,"" he says.""The re-unification was done but there were a lot of things which were unclear. Like the police knew there were illegal parties but [they said] 'We don't know what do - let them do the party!'""People from the UK and across western Europe soon ""found the playground to make dreams happen"", forming collectives, while enjoying east Berlin's cheap rent and ""positive energy"".""I'm 100% sure that is was the result of a friendly revolution,"" he adds.""There was a chance the revolution was going to go in another direction with riots and war - it was really close.""For the next four years there were an uncountable amount of illegal parties, some in forests for hundreds and thousands, and also the Love Parade was growing.""The appetite for a re-unified Germany and the collapse of the Berlin Wall - itself a symbol of the Cold War between Soviet-led communism and the democracies of the West - was already evident at the staging of the first Love Parade festival in July 1989.It saw 150 people - led by Matthias Roeingh, aka Dr Motte - take to the streets for a demonstration of peace, love and music.It would become an important part of the rave calendar, in Berlin and beyond, for decades.Work permit issues forced the parade out of the city from 2007, and ultimately the tragic death of 21 people in a crowd crush in Duisburg in 2010 brought it to an end.Quirin Graf Adelmann, whose Nineties Berlin exhibition chronicles the history of the event, stresses mass unemployment in the previously Soviet-run east side of the city made the DIY dance movement an attractive proposition for many.""Imagine 3.2 million people in Berlin lost their sense of life and the feeling to be useful to society, as there were no jobs,"" he says.""All the education of the past 40, 50 years was blown away. People from the age of 16 to 22, starting their professional lives, had seen everything they'd learned about had disappeared.""""So that was the start of of the '90s. And what are you doing when you are free of the old stories and free of education?"" he asks.""You to try to invent yourself, again. It means you have to experience everything, you have to start something new, and that's what many people tried in Berlin.""On the one hand there was a 20% unemployment rate, and on the other - 50 different nations from everywhere around the world came into Berlin to feel the re-start of a life.""As the scene progressed - and original basement nights like Tekknozid and UFO gave birth to clubs like the legendary Tresor and E-Werk - two things were vitally important in ensuring it could prosper.Firstly, unlike in the UK and other European nations, Berlin's clubs and bars did not have to close at a particular time, due to the abolition of the curfew in 1949. So parties could go on literally all weekend.""There are places that have never closed for the last 17 years - they will open 24 hours, seven days,"" notes Hoffmann.And secondly, the driving influence of the gay community at venues like Metropol - which had previously been ""a Berlin equivalent to Studio 54"", he adds, referring to the famous New York nightclub.""It was basically the biggest queer discotheque that we had in Berlin. When when the wall came down and the techno scene started, what was great is that the initial parties, they weren't really gay nights or queer nights - but people from all sorts of backgrounds came together,"" he reminisces.""So you had football hooligans, and queer [people] and it didn't really matter.""Not everybody was a fan of this newly open party city, but over the next three decades more and more ""Easy Jet ravers"" - as they became known - flooded in.Radio anthems by the likes of Scorpions, David Bowie and David Hasselhoff may have initially ""put the message out in the world,"" that ""freedom"" had arrived in Berlin, but it was this experimental new DJ-led ""machine music"" that truly soundtracked the era.As Hoffmann notes in his exhibition, a whole generation of Berlin clubbers ""haven't stopped dancing yet"", some alongside their own sons and daughters now, at venues like the world-famous Berghain.Szary, who will perform in London next weekend, is certain you can still hear the influence of techno, breakbeat and '90s Berlin in electronic dance music (EDM) and the pop charts today.""It's a fundamental part of commercial music now.""""It's a copy of a copy of a copy,"" he laughs. ""But the influence is always there."""

entertainment	'We live in LS Lowry's house... he might not approve of the colour scheme'		"The Salford house where LS Lowry painted many of his famous works has been recreated for a film about the artist's life, starring Timothy Spall and Vanessa Redgrave.But what's it like to live in the original?Lots of the Lowry fans who make the pilgrimage to Station Road in Pendlebury, Greater Manchester, to find the house where one of Britain's most popular artists lived and worked are unsure whether they have found the right place.""Because the plaque isn't there, people are not sure which house it is,"" says Abigail Johnson, who lives in Lowry's old home with her husband Steve and their four children.""We see them stood outside, and sometimes we let them in to have a look around,"" Steve adds.There was a plaque on the wall. But ""one of the locals pinched it"", Steve explains. ""I believe he's got it in his bedroom, this particular fella. What use it is in his bedroom, I don't know.""The Johnson family may well notice more people lingering uncertainly outside their front door after the release of Mrs Lowry and Son on Friday.The house plays a starring role in the film, which depicts the artist's claustrophobic relationship with his bedridden, unsupportive mother.Elizabeth Lowry, played by Oscar-winner Redgrave, is unhappy at being forced to move to a working-class suburb because of her husband's debts.A line in the film, when she mistakes her son for a burglar, will ring true with the current residents, given the plaque theft. ""Anything's possible living in Pendlebury,"" the character says. ""People get up to all sorts of malpractices as soon as your back is turned.""But whereas Mrs Lowry sees the worst in the area, her son saw a beauty in the industrial landscape.The artist and his mother moved into the house in 1908, when Lowry was in his early 20s. She died in 1939, just as her son was starting to gain recognition for the now-famous scenes of busy mills and markets that he painted late at night in their attic.""One of the things that struck me was the fact that he did all his paintings in the loft room. It is a big room but the lighting must have been rubbish,"" Mrs Johnson says. ""Even if he was to do it in the daylight, all that he would have had is the dormer window.""The addition of a modern velux window has turned the attic into the couple's bright bedroom. In the film, Mrs Lowry disappointedly describes the house as a humble ""two up, two down"", but that's not quite the case. It is in fact a six-bed end of terrace.""They talk about this tiny little terraced house that Lowry lived in for 40 years, but it's not quite so tiny,"" Mrs Johnson says.There was talk of Salford City Council turning it into some sort of museum when it came on the market in 2014, but that didn't happen.Instead, the Johnson family bought it - partly because of the Lowry connection, but mainly because its size suited their family, and it's down the road from the Swinton Palais, a gem of a dancehall that Mr Johnson runs.Was there any trace of the artist left when they moved in? ""His walking stick was here,"" Mr Johnson says. No sketches under the wallpaper? ""No, nothing. It's been knocked about too much.""Some of the original features - like doors, skirting boards and coving - are still there. ""He might not approve of the colour scheme,"" Mrs Johnson says.Much of the film takes place in Mrs Lowry's bedroom, which is now occupied by the Johnsons' teenage daughter. Her metal bedstead is eerily similar to Mrs Lowry's, which is depicted in a painting LS Lowry completed a year after his mother's death.Mrs Johnson says her daughter unwittingly chose a replica: ""I didn't say anything, and later when she chose it and she'd assembled it, I showed her the painting of the original and she went, 'Ooh! How spooky is that!'""The film's writer Martyn Hesford grew up around the corner from the house. The artist had moved out by that time, but he remained a local legend.""When I was 10 or 12, I would often stand outside the house and look up into the attic and think, all those paintings came from there,"" Hesford says. ""And I imagined the conversations he might have had with his mother.""Hesford's mother worked in the factory over the road from the Lowrys' house, but it was his aunt who introduced him to Lowry's work at an exhibition in Salford.""My auntie Brenda took me to Peel Park to see the paintings when I was about six, and that was my introduction to art for the first time, which opened my eyes. And suddenly Salford wasn't just cobbled streets with pigeons. Weeds became coloured flowers, and chimney towers became dragons' breath.""In May, Steve and Abigail Johnson launched a crowdfunding campaign to place a statue of LS Lowry at the front of their house and create a memorial garden. They are hoping the film, which had its premiere at The Lowry arts centre in Salford on Tuesday, will spur interest in the plan.They have also had a new plaque made. ""We've not put it up yet because we were thinking, would it be safe?"" Mr Johnson says. ""Do we need [security] cameras up there? And we're thinking about doing the front garden and everything. So we're going to do it all together.""It does deem a shame there's no recognition of him in the place where he did everything.""Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

entertainment	The stars who can't escape their most famous roles	'I could be a deranged killer!'Mark HamillCarrie FisherJames van der BeekJennifer AnistonChristopher ReeveAnd a few who did escape the typecastingWill SmithHarrison FordEmma Watson	"It's every budding actor's dream - a starring role in a TV show or film that becomes a major hit. But then they try to move on - and find that their iconic character just won't let them.The latest actor to complain about being shackled to his famous alter ego is Alfonso Ribeiro.You may know him better as Will Smith's highfalutin cousin Carlton Banks from 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He's said being overshadowed by his character has ""stopped me from being able to be an actor"".The 45-year-old told Metro: ""It has forced ME to be my character, hosting game shows and America's Funniest Videos.""I would like to try some stuff that is different from how the world sees me, just sink my teeth into… shoot, I could be a deranged killer!""But I doubt someone would automatically think of me when they go, 'We need to cast a killer, let's get the dude who played Carlton.'""He did also say the role was ""rewarding in many ways"" - and you could argue that an actor is lucky to get one part in a hit show in their career.Here are some other actors who have found it impossible to leave their most famous parts behind - and some who have managed to reinvent themselves.Perhaps the ultimate example of an actor known for one role, Hamill (above right) is and always will be Luke Skywalker.His non-Star Wars films remained relatively low-key so he went to Broadway, taking the title role in Amadeus in 1983. But when director Milos Forman made a big screen version, he is reported to have rejected Hamill, saying: ""I don't want Luke Skywalker in this film.""Hamill got around the typecasting by becoming a successful voice actor, including as The Joker in the Batman animated series.The force also remained strong for Hamill's co-star, whose performance as Princess Leia became iconic.Fisher had other roles - like in When Harry Met Sally and Hannah and Her Sisters - and wrote novels. But she said being most closely associated with Leia had been ""great"".""She's a very proactive character and gets the job done. So if you're going to get typecast as something, that might as well be it for me.""Van Der Beek (second left) has struggled to shed the memory of teenage heart-throb Dawson, whose Creek was so admired by teen viewers from 1998-2003.""It did hold me back,"" he said in 2014, adding that movie directors would think he was too recognisable and not take him seriously. ""But at the end of the day, it just makes you work that much harder.""He has also parodied his own fame - even playing a bitter version of himself as an actor trying to revive his career in 2012 sitcom Don't Trust The B in Apartment 23.This could apply to any of the cast of Friends to be honest. In fact, Aniston has arguably done better than the rest - she's been in lots of middle-ranking rom-coms and got a Golden Globe nomination for 2014 drama Cake.But who are we kidding - she's still Rachel.""It's really hard to be cast in [a dramatic film like Cake],"" she said in 2015. Especially if ""you're someone who is battling a persona. Sometimes it's hard to disappear from it in a role.""And sometimes it's hard to get away from a certain haircut.The star of the original four Superman movies in the 1970s and '80s, Reeve later battled to ""escape the cape"".He took a wide variety of roles on film, TV and stage before a riding accident left him paralysed in 1995. Only his later real-life role as a campaigner for spinal cord injury research came close to eclipsing that of the Man of Steel.Starring in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air didn't seem to hold Will Smith back. In fact, it led to a string of hit films including Bad Boys, Independence Day, Men in Black and Ali, not to mention two Oscar nominations.And, presumably to Ribeiro's chagrin, he has even played a killer - as Deadshot in Suicide Squad.Perhaps he should be typecast a bit more. He can do comedy, action or drama - as long as he's an indomitable, smart-talking, high-energy hero. Films where he plays more sombre roles tend to tank.Having proved it possible to break out of the Star Wars universe, Harrison Ford isn't just the bloke who played Han Solo.Perhaps he was lucky in that he made two more major films - Raiders of the Lost Ark and Blade Runner - before The Return of the Jedi could trap him in that particular pigeonhole.Or perhaps there's another explanation - maybe he's a better actor than his Star Wars co-stars.Of the main Harry Potter cast, Emma Watson is probably the one where you think ""oh it's that one from Harry Potter"" least often.She's done a few half-decent grown-up films and we'll see how her biggest post-Potter movie, Beauty and the Beast, performs next week. But more than that - she's positioned herself as a serious social commentator.Daniel Radcliffe, too, is desperately trying to be a proper actor. But, perhaps because he played Harry himself, it might take a bit longer for us to shake off the image of the kid with wand and glasses.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
