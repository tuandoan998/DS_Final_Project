sport	Tokyo 2020: Great Britain's Will Bosi seeks Olympic sport climbing place	"Moving to Sheffield and teaming up with Shauna CoxseyCouples goals - how Bosi's girlfriend is helping his Olympic bidSport climbing has ""improved massively"" pre-Tokyo 2020"	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceBritain's Will Bosi admits attempting to master three climbing disciplines is a ""massive challenge"" but is backing himself to qualify for Tokyo 2020.Sport climbing makes its Olympic debut next year as a triathlon-style competition with speed, bouldering and lead forming a combined event.Bosi needs a top-six finish in Toulouse this week to reach the Games.""It would be a dream to go to the Olympics,"" he tells BBC Sport.""It's difficult because we're basically having to learn and masters three different sports, which is like doing a 100m sprint, the 400m and then a 5,000m,"" he adds.""I know it will be a tough competition but I grew up watching the Olympics and I'm going to do everything possible [to get there] now my sport is in too.""Team-mate Shauna Coxsey claimed a place in the Games by winning World bronze in August, and Bosi has switched his base from Edinburgh to Sheffield in order to train alongside the multiple bouldering World Cup champion.Media playback is not supported on this device""Lead has always been my specialism and it's the opposite end of the scale to bouldering in terms of it being an endurance event,"" he says.""Training with Shauna is so useful because new styles and technical aspects usually come into boulder before they make it into lead, and I'm picking up things that are making a massive difference.""The Scottish climber believes he has also made significant improvements in his speed climbing in recent months after his girlfriend, Elle Duffield, learned Russian.""She's very smart and basically the brains of the operation,"" Bosi says with a smile.Duffield, who is a climber herself, says: ""The best speed nations in the world are the likes of France, Russia and China.""""I already knew French and could watch their videos online but they don't tend to share much, whereas the Russians do. So I've been learning that [language] so I can understand what they're explaining and then work that into Will's speed programme.""While the overall reaction to sport climbing's inclusion in the Olympics has been positive, some athletes expressed frustration that the traditionally specialist disciplines of speed bouldering and lead climbing were combined for one medal event per gender.Multiple bouldering and lead world champion Adam Ondra of the Czech Republic initially suggested he would not bid to take part in Tokyo 2020 by way of protest.However he and many others have now changed their opinion due to the growth of the sport and attention it has received in the build-up to the Games.""The sport has got a lot bigger here in the UK, where there are climbing centres being expanded and new ones popping up all the time,"" reveals Bosi.""The style of climbing is changing and bouldering is becoming more gymnastic and explosive, which fans love to watch. Going into the Olympics is also pushing up the standard massively.""If Bosi fails to achieve the desired top-six result at the IFSC Combined qualifier in France this week he will have one final opportunity to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics via the sport's European championships in Moscow next March."

sport	Zara Hyde Peters: UK Athletics board decision 'for the good of the sport'		"Zara Hyde Peters agreed with the UK Athletics board that she would not take up the position of chief executive ""for the good of the sport"".Due to begin her role with UK Athletics on 1 December, Hyde Peters said the decision was ""one of the most painful experiences I have ever had to face"".A report by The Times alleged husband Mike Peters was allowed to coach at a club where Hyde Peters was vice-chair despite being banned from teaching over an ""inappropriate relationship"" with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.Speaking about the decision for the first time, Hyde Peters told Athletics Weekly: ""Trial by media is almost impossible to deal with and is not a process that properly protects the rights of those caught up in it.""She added: ""I have been a lifelong participant in - and contributor to - the sport of athletics. I have always respected the interests of the sport and my fellow competitors, the officials and all the many volunteers involved; these are the most important things to me.""According to The Times, former Great Britain distance runner Hyde Peters admitted her husband had coached after his teaching ban, but insisted that ""he never coached athletes under the age of 18"".Peters was barred from teaching because of the inappropriate relationship between 2004 and 2005 while he worked as a PE teacher at Bilton School, Rugby. He was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct after being cleared of sexual misconduct.Hyde Peters, 55, has also resigned from her role as a Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games board member and as the chair of its Athletes' Advisory Committee.Funding agency UK Sport will hold talks with UK Athletics chairman Chris Clark in the coming days to discuss the ramifications of the controversy.UK Athletics - which has received £27m of public funding in the period leading up to the Tokyo Games - is already under scrutiny over its handling of the Alberto Salazar scandal, and has now seen its chair, performance director and incoming chief executive depart in the last 10 months."
sport	Doping in sport: Russia face new ban from sport for inconsistencies in data		"Russia face the possibility of a new ban from competing in sport over inconsistencies in anti-doping data.The World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) compliance review committee is expected to recommend the nation's anti-doping agency Rusada be made non-compliant.A recent inquiry found positive doping results from data obtained in 2017 were missing from the version acquired in January 2019.Any verdict is likely to be made at the end of the year at the earliest.Wada said in a statement that its executive committee will meet on 9 December to consider a formal recommendation from its independent compliance committee.Rusada was initially declared non-compliant in November 2015 after a report by sports lawyer Professor Richard McLaren, commissioned by Wada, alleged widespread corruption that amounted to state-sponsored doping in Russian track and field athletics.A further report, published in July 2016, declared Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme for four years across the ""vast majority"" of summer and winter Olympic sports.As a consequence competitors were unable to compete under the Russia flag at Rio 2016, while the Russia team was banned from the Paralympics that year.In 2018, Wada reinstated Rusada as compliant after the national agency agreed to release data from its Moscow laboratory from the period between January 2012 and August 2015.However, positive findings contained in a version courtesy of a whistleblower in 2017 were missing from the January 2019 data, which prompted a new inquiry."

sport	Women's football: One in five adults support sport, as survey finds 60% rise in fans		"Almost one in five adults in the United Kingdom would call themselves a women's football fan, a survey conducted by analysts Nielsen Sports has found.That represented a 60% increase in the past two years, while the survey also found a rise in occasions where women's football is discussed by fans in pubs.Of the 29,252 adults questioned in the UK for the study, 19% called themselves a supporter, up from 15% last year.There was also a rise in fans listening to the women's game on the radio.Television remained the main way that fans informed themselves about the sport, but 33% of women's football fans said they use the radio for their sports news in 2019, compared to 24% in 2018.Nielsen also found that fans of the women's game were more likely than supporters of men's teams to have disposable income.""Our analysis shows that support for women's football in the UK is continuing to grow and quickly,"" Nielsen Sports' Lynsey Douglas said.""Women's football fans are more likely than followers of the men's game to have families and to be key decision-makers when it comes to making purchases for the family.""The data was released after a record-breaking weekend for the Women's Super League - England's top flight - with more than 70,000 people turning up to watch the six top-flight matches on Sunday.A league-record crowd of 38,262 saw Arsenal's 2-0 win at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while Anfield hosted its first WSL fixture as 23,500 fans saw Everton beat Liverpool in the Merseyside derby.Chelsea's home win over Manchester United at their usual Kingsmeadow ground also saw a record broken, as the 4,790 sell-out was the highest for a WSL game held at a non-Premier League stadium.WSL attendances are up more than four-fold since 2018-19 on average so far, after a record-breaking 28.1m people watched BBC coverage of this summer's Women's World Cup on television and online.BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before. Through more live women's sport available to watch across the BBC in 2019, complemented by our journalism, we are aiming to turn up the volume on women's sport and alter perceptions.

sport	Rally Australia: 'It's impossible to think about sport' - Meeke		"Northern Ireland's Kris Meeke says ""it's impossible to think about sport"" after Rally Australia was cancelled because of ""catastrophic"" bushfires.The final round of the World Rally Championship was due to take place this weekend in New South Wales.Three people have died and more than 150 properties have been destroyed in the state since Friday.""To cancel the rally was absolutely the correct decision,"" Toyota boss Tommi Mäkinen said.The cancellation of the final round ended any chance Toyota had of beating Hyundai to the manufacturers' championship, however Mäkinen said that the events in New South Wales had put the sport in perspective.""Of course, the team originally came to Australia to try and fight for a championship, but in these terrible circumstances, we have not been thinking about that at all,"" said the four-time WRC champion.""Our thoughts have only been with the people that have been affected by what has happened: They are the most important consideration, far more important than any rally, so we really did not wish for it to go ahead.""We want to help the situation in whatever way we can, and hope that people's lives can return to some level of normality as soon as possible.""Several drivers visited the Rural Fire Service in New South Wales to show their support for the local emergency services.""Fire is an element that we don't really have so much of in Europe. Here it is quite common but not on this scale,"" Meeke told Toyota Gazoo Racing.""Hopefully they can keep it under control but until there is a decent amount of rainfall then I don't think the threat will go away.""Meeke's comments were echoed by team-mate Ott Tanak, who won the drivers' championship at the last round in Spain.""Safety always comes as a priority, so when it comes to the cancellation of the event it really doesn't matter at all,"" he added.""We really wish the locals all the best and hopefully they can stay strong."""

sport	Women’s FA Cup: Bend it like Beckham’s unsung heroes and other second-round tales	Can Hounslow invoke spirit of Bend it like Beckham?The medical student learning from an England legendDoes a regionalised draw have downsides?Local derby 'makes it even tastier'	"Sunday's Women's FA Cup second round will see the 24 third-tier clubs enter the competition, with a legendary former England forward and unsung heroes of the Bend it like Beckham movie among those involved.The 36 teams in action - all of whom are from the third or fourth tiers - are just two wins away from a potential fourth-round meeting with a Women's Super League club.Chorley are the lowest-ranked side remaining and they host fellow-Women's National League Division One North outfit Brighouse Town, while the respective third-tier North and South leaders, Sunderland and Watford, are the highest-placed.The clubs are competing for £1,000 of prize money - 54 times less than that which the men's second-round winners receive - but there is no less love for the cup's ""magic"", as BBC Sport found when speaking to those involved in some of the round's stand-out ties.The film Bend it like Beckham will always be synonymous will Hounslow, having featured the fictional team Hounslow Harriers. But on Sunday the drama will play out on the pitch rather on the big screen.Martino Chevannes, the first-team manager of the newly-named Hounslow Women, was in the credits for the 2002 movie having helped select players to be Jess Bhamra's team-mates and opponents when managing QPR Ladies.""The vast majority of the players in Bend it like Beckham were from QPR,"" Chevannes, whose Hounslow side host Cardiff City, told BBC Sport.""I was involved in the recruitment of players for [the film]. I was contacted about players. Then, with [producer] Simon Clifford, we worked on a lot of the choreography for the football scenes, with a few of our players in the opposition as well, plus players from other clubs.""A long-serving coach at QPR's community programme, Chevannes continued to manage QPR until earlier this year, before the club broke away to be renamed Hounslow for this season.But the rebranded team are playing their home games at Uxbridge FC's Honeycroft ground - outside of the boundaries of Hounslow - so why the name?""In pre-season, we had arranged to move to a ground in Hounslow, but in the end that didn't materialise, by which point the name had already been approved by the Football Association,"" Chevannes explained.""So we've ended up not playing in Hounslow but being called Hounslow. Once the name is already approved you can't then change the name again until the following season.""With any new club, we've obviously been through a lot of change. It's like building a new team from scratch. We're getting there, slowly but surely. The time that the people who run the Women's National League put in is tremendous and the league is at a really strong level.""Somebody else who knows the strength of the pyramid is England youth international Ella Pusey, who was playing in the top flight with Yeovil Town until moving to Southampton in 2018.That saw her switch from the WSL to - at that stage - tier five, but the move enabled the teenage medical student to study chiropractics in Bournemouth while training under the guise of an England legend.Marieanne Spacey-Cale scored 28 goals in 91 senior caps, in a Lionesses career that spanned three decades until her international retirement after Euro 2001.She has been in charge of Southampton Women since 2018.""The opportunity to work with her was something I couldn't really turn down,"" Pusey said.""She was such a prolific England striker and is a legend. I know I've improved so much and she's such a great role model.""We've got a positive atmosphere around the club, with a lot of energetic youngsters coming through. It's a project that I couldn't resist being part of.""On Sunday, Pusey will face her former club Yeovil away from home for the second time in a week, after she scored in a 2-1 extra-time win at the Glovers in the FA National League Cup on 24 November.""It'll be a weird feeling and there'll be some familiar faces again but I'm looking forward to focusing on the game,"" Pusey added.""It'll be a brilliant occasion. Whether it's men's or women's, the FA Cup has that magic feel to it..""Southampton - who won their fifth-tier regional division last season - are currently top of the fourth tier's south west region, while Yeovil are fourth in the third tier South after dropping down two divisions when the FA rejected their bid for a second-tier licence earlier this year.While those two teams are meeting for the second time in seven days, at least 16 other sides will also be facing familiar opposition, because eight of the ties see teams from the same division go head-to-head.That's partly down to the north-south regionalisation of the second-round draw, and one of the southern match-ups sees Chevannes' Hounslow meet Cardiff for essentially a second straight year at the same stage, having faced the Bluebirds in last season's second round when known as QPR.""Personally I think the format needs to change to bring more magic in to the women's competition, because in a cup, you want to be playing against teams that you don't normally play against,"" Chevannes added.""I know you have to take in to account costs for clubs, travelling to away ties, but I'd have loved to have been drawn against a northern team and play somebody we've never played before. You won't get that as long as the draw remains regionalised at this stage.""It is a great competition and I love it, but a big game is great for your club and your area, facing players that you see playing on the television for England or in the WSL - that's for me is what's going to inspire players to achieve their goals.""However, one arguable benefit of the regionalised draws has seen it throw up some tantalising local derbies.East Midlands rivals Derby County and Nottingham Forest will go head-to-head in Mickleover, while Sheffield FC travel to Yorkshire neighbours Barnsley.Meanwhile, in the north east, WNL Northern Premier division leaders Sunderland host Middlesbrough at Hebburn Town FC.The Lady Black Cats were in the WSL as recently as 2017-18, when they reached the FA Cup quarter-finals for a third straight year, having been semi-finalists in 2016.The club are continuing to rebuild after suffering a double relegation in 2018 amid the restructuring of England's top leagues, but they have enjoyed continuity under head coach Melanie Reay, who took charge in 2017.""We've had a really good start this season and long may it continue,"" Reay told BBC Sport.""We've got a bit more experience now. We came into the league two years ago not really knowing what to expect, not knowing the styles of play clubs were going to use, but having that experience under our belts now, we're a lot more prepared.""We're looking forward to [facing Boro]. We haven't played for a couple of weeks, so we're chomping at the bit to get back to it, and with it being a bit of a local derby it makes it even tastier.""Unbeaten Sunderland have won eight of their nine league games so far and their only draw came against Boro, as Reay added: ""We've picked up a lot of good wins this season but we drew with Middlesbrough, so it should be a good game for the neutral to watch.""We're realists - we're not going to win the FA Cup - but it'd be good to have a nice little run, draw a big team and get them back to Hebburn for the fans to watch.""BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before. Through more live women's sport available to watch across the BBC in 2019, complemented by our journalism, we are aiming to turn up the volume on women's sport and alter perceptions.

sport	Margaret Court: Tennis Australia reiterates stance against views amid anniversary plans		"Tennis Australia has reiterated its stance against Margaret Court's ""demeaning"" personal views while announcing it will ""recognise"" the 50th anniversary of her Grand Slam at next year's Australian Open.Australian Court, 77, won all four Grand Slam titles in 1970.In 2003, Melbourne Park's Court One was renamed the Margaret Court Arena.However, there have been recent calls for it to be renamed because of Court's opposition to same-sex marriage.In 2017, Court - who won a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles - said tennis was ""full of lesbians"" and that transgender children were the work of ""the devil"".Now a Christian pastor, she had previously said she would not fly on Australian airline Qantas ""where possible"" in protest at its support of same-sex marriage.Grand Slam winners Martina Navratilova and Billie Jean King, who are both gay, have previously criticised Court.Tennis Australia has invited Court, her family and friends to the tournament - which starts on 20 January - where she will participate in a ""significant programme of events"".""This is an incredible milestone for me, and I can't quite believe how quickly the time has gone. It's always wonderful to catch up with my fellow legends and I'm grateful to Tennis Australia,"" said Court.""Tennis is a wonderful sport and I'm proud to be part of the history of our great game.""Tennis Australia said it respects Court's ""unmatched tennis career"" but said her views ""do not align"" with its values of ""equality, diversity and inclusion"".""As often stated, Tennis Australia does not agree with Margaret's personal views, which have demeaned and hurt many in our community over a number of years,"" the governing body said in a statement.In an open letter, it also said it would not ""rewrite history"" concerning Court's achievements.""Tennis Australia recognises the champions in our sport as a matter of course, whether it be stadium names, naming of parks, statues around the country and trophies and awards during a player's career,"" it added.""We celebrate sporting heroes who inspire and motivate people through the generations, and who are lauded and respected widely by their peers and the broader community.""As with other great sports in this country and elsewhere, it is common practice to draw a distinction between recognising champions and celebrating heroes, and it is an important distinction.""Australia is fortunate that Margaret Court's extraordinary playing achievements form part of our national tennis history.""However, the philosophy and culture of our sport goes deeper than winning and setting records. We seek to foster a sport that is inclusive and welcoming of everyone.""We all bear some responsibility for creating a safe and inclusive society. As a sport, tennis is unwavering in playing our part."""

Knowing Patrick, I think he would be the right man,"" Seaman told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily Podcast.""I knew what he was like as a player. I knew what he was like as a captain.

sport	Rugby World Cup final: 'Sport is cruel' says England prop Kyle Sinckler after concussion		"Kyle Sinckler said ""sport is cruel"" after being taken off with concussion in the third minute of England's 32-12 World Cup final defeat by South Africa.The prop collided with team-mate Maro Itoje, trying to tackle Makazole Mapimpi, and immediately hit the floor.There was a lengthy stoppage as the 26-year-old was assessed by the on-duty doctor, before he regained consciousness and walked off the field.The Harlequins front-row was replaced by 32-year-old Dan Cole.Sinckler later joined his team-mates on the sidelines after the break but head coach Eddie Jones said the forward ""will go through all the head injury protocol"".""You have 23 guys, you lose a guy early and you have got to be able to cover it,"" said Jones.""I don't think that was a significant factor in the game.""South African hooker Mbongeni Mbonambi was also taken off for a head injury assessment after being replaced by Malcolm Marx in the first half.The forward did not return to the field and said he ""understands"" why he was ""forced off"" despite not wanting to leave the field.""I had concussion,"" Mbonambi said.

sport	Joshua v Ruiz II: The tiny margins between defeat and glory		"Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe legendary light-heavyweight Archie Moore described the feeling as ""walking the street of dreams"", the moment a boxer is transported to a twilight world of scrambled senses by the force of a single punch.Anthony Joshua went down that road in New York last June and, not for the first time, the course of heavyweight boxing history was altered in a split second.At his training base in Sheffield this month, Joshua recalled how the left hook landed by Andy Ruiz Jr in the second minute of the third round marked the beginning of the end of his debut at Madison Square Garden. There was more than half the fight remaining - the referee waved it off in the seventh - but in Joshua's mind it was all over much sooner, along with his reign as world champion.Earlier in the third round, Ruiz had been floored by a right-uppercut, left-hook combination and Joshua went looking to land the same two shots twice in the following 20 seconds. On the second occasion, as Joshua swivelled into his left hook, Ruiz got there first with an almost identical punch. Joshua wobbled away and seconds later fell to the canvas.There would be three more knockdowns suffered by Joshua but he is adamant that the critical damage was inflicted on that first visit to the canvas. ""I never recovered,"" he told me during a reflective interview at the English Institute of Sport.Split seconds and fractions of inches separate success and failure across world-class sport, but in few arenas is the capacity for turnarounds as dramatic as in the ring, especially at heavyweight. Ruiz was two rounds and a knockdown behind before connecting with the punch which ultimately built a new house for his mother.Last weekend, the judges' scorecards showing a clear advantage for Luis Ortiz were reduced to wastepaper in an instant when the wily Cuban left his chin in the path of a Deontay Wilder right hand in the seventh round of their showdown for the WBC title in Las Vegas.The 25th anniversary passed recently of George Foreman becoming the oldest world heavyweight champion, at the age of 45, after catching Michael Moorer with a similar punch in the same MGM Grand Garden Arena. And the right hand again was the clincher for Rocky Marciano when he wrested the world title from Jersey Joe Walcott in the 13th round in Philadelphia in 1952. Like Wilder, Foreman and Marciano were adrift on the scorecards.Joshua's downfall was all the more surprising given the recovery mission he had mounted after being knocked down heavily by Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium more than two years ago. Back then, Joshua was composed enough to tell his trainer Robert McCracken that he had ""taken a round off"" in the eighth in order to regroup.Against Ruiz, Joshua was entitled to attempt to capitalise on his success in inflicting the first knockdown Ruiz had ever suffered. But in engaging in a firefight, Joshua introduced an element of Russian roulette into the equation. He has often mentioned his admiration for the five-round war between Foreman and Ron Lyle in 1976 and suddenly found himself in a modern-day interpretation, if not quite as high octane. Instinct and emotion, so controlled against Klitschko, seemed to cloud Joshua's judgement against Ruiz in relation to the most important distinction a fighter makes in mid-storm: when to take aim and when to take cover.Thomas 'Hitman' Hearns once said: ""For a long time, my pride was too high. But I learned. When you get in trouble, grab hold. Ride it out. Any man can get hurt. And when he does, he must learn how to survive. Or else.""Against that background, with such tiny margins of error, it is remarkable that the likes of Floyd Mayweather and Joe Calzaghe got it right every time: the split seconds and fractions almost always in their favour. Yes, they were in lighter weight divisions and the power ratio might be lower but the punch output in terms of numbers is much greater. And Mayweather suffered just the one (highly questionable) knockdown during a career in which more than half his 50 fights were world title contests.In training, Mayweather and Calzaghe placed heavy emphasis on boxing skills and drills: bags, pads and sparring being every bit as important as strength and conditioning. In our recent interview in Sheffield, Joshua said his focus for this fight had changed. ""More boxing,"" was the instant response when I asked him what modifications had been made in the gym.Over the past two and a half years, Joshua has played his part in a heady era. His fights against Klitschko and Ruiz, alongside Wilder-Ortiz I and Wilder's draw against Tyson Fury, should be recognised now - rather than wait for distant perspective - as the nucleus of a special period in the heavyweight division. As for the future and the scope for more of the same, it could be argued that Fury, Joshua, Ruiz and Wilder are all still improving.Ruiz' only defeat in 34 fights was a debatable points loss against Joseph Parker in New Zealand three years ago. Parker enjoyed enough success at long range to eke out a split decision but Ruiz won virtually every exchange at close quarters. His fast hands tilt the odds his way when standing toe to toe and Joshua's strategy in this department could be crucial to the outcome of the rematch.Even some of the very best have needed a second crack. Lennox Lewis sustained savage knockouts by Oliver McCall and Hasim Rahman but won the return fights, with the win against Rahman in 2001 ranking high among Lewis' finest performances. The response to adversity, warding off the potential for gun-shyness and a severe threat to his legacy, is what Joshua must emulate among the dunes in Saudi Arabia."

Our mindset will be completely different to last year.""Former Hibernian boss Kirk, 41, has overseen league wins over Birmingham City, Brighton & Hove Albion, Merseyside rivals Liverpool at Anfield and his former club Bristol City.Then a 3-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur last Sunday kept the Toffees within four points of the leaders and just three points off a Champions League place.""We were really, really happy with our summer recruitment, and because of that, our training intensity and competition for places has gone through the roof,"" Kirk added.""Nobody in that squad is guaranteed their place anymore, so that's made a huge difference to the way we work and the competitiveness in training.""They've got a duty to each other, to help improve each other by training at full intensity. We're constantly reminding them about that.Media playback is not supported on this device""We're getting the benefits as a club that all 20 players are really buying into that philosophy and challenging each other in training.""Arguably the only negative of Everton's campaign so far has been their home attendances, with BBC Sport figures showing the Toffees have the WSL's lowest average crowd this term at 325.But the club have been playing at Southport's Haig Avenue - around 16.3 miles from Goodison Park - while awaiting their move back to Merseyside and their planned new home at Walton Hall Park.""We're waiting for this move to Walton Hall Park, which will make a huge difference for us, to be one mile from Goodison and in the L4 postcode,"" Kirk continued.""We're patiently waiting for that to happen. We hope it happens sooner rather than later, because goals like Sunday's deserve to be seen by a few thousand, not just a few hundred.""BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before.

sport	Abu Dhabi GP: Honda intends to stay in F1 beyond 2021		"Honda says it intends to stay in Formula 1 beyond the end of 2021 despite extending its contract with Red Bull by only one year.Honda F1 managing director Masashi Yamamoto said the decision to sign a one-year deal beyond 2020 ""does not mean we finish the project in 2021"".Yamamoto said Honda was already ""discussing about after 2022"".But he said Honda needed answers to certain questions about the rules after 2020 before it could commit further.Yamamoto added: ""Of course we understand that it sounds odd to extend for just one year just for 2021.""Yamamoto was speaking in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport.Asked whether Honda's current intention was to stay in F1 beyond 2021 if its questions about the future direction of the rules were answered, he said: ""Yes.""Yamamoto declined to say what Honda's conditions were, but BBC Sport can reveal they surround discussions over fixing the specifications of engines for 2021-25.Engine manufacturers are discussing with F1 a plan to homologate power-units for the next regulation period - so manufacturers would submit a design ahead of the 2021 season and changes would be much more severely restricted than now over the subsequent five seasons.This would dramatically reduce the cost of competing in F1 for engine manufacturers compared to the current rules, under which teams upgrade their engines before every season and then every seven races during a championship.Yamamoto admitted that keeping costs as low as possible was a major factor in Honda's commitment to continue in F1, a decision made by the company's board in the period since the last race in Brazil and the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi this weekend.Honda's improved performance this season - in which they achieved their first victory since their return to the sport in 2015 in Austria with Max Verstappen and Red Bull and have gone on to win a further two races since - was also a key issue.""There wasn't any discussion about going out from F1,"" Yamamoto said. ""Rather we have discussed how we could continue the project in better shape because we are now having the result with Red Bull and Toro Rosso, and that was a big factor.""We know we are getting closer to the top performance and our power-unit is still behind a bit versus Mercedes and Ferrari - but much closer than before.""Another condition we are discussing is how we can minimise the cost.""Honda's one-year extension leaves partner Red Bull in a difficult position because they could have to sign a five-year commitment with F1 without being certain who their engine partner will be for more than the first year of that period.All teams are contracted only until the end of 2020 and are engaged in negotiations over new commercial terms for the next five years.Yamamoto said: ""We agree about your point. It must be quite a tough decision for Red Bull. But the discussion we are making (about) after 2021, it is quite positive and we are discussing how we can continue, under what conditions.""Red Bull team principal Christian Horner declined to comment.The current plan for the new contracts teams sign with F1 for the 2021-25 period is for their to be exit clauses at various points during the five years."

sport	Shafali Verma's journey to breaking Sachin Tendulkar's record		"When Shafali Verma was nine years old, she sat on her dad's shoulders and cheered on her hero Sachin Tendulkar in his final Ranji Trophy match.Six years later, aged 15 years and 285 days, she broke the legendary Tendulkar's record to become the youngest Indian player to score an international fifty.What happened in between is a story of determination and triumph against the odds in a region where girls are often discouraged from playing sport.Inspired by Tendulkar's visit to her local stadium in Rohtak near Delhi in 2013, Verma took up cricket, only to be turned away from her local academy because she was not a boy.Disheartened but not defeated, Verma's father had an idea. He had his daughter's hair cut short to trick people into thinking she was a boy.""Where I'm from there are some things girls shouldn't do, but my family always supported me,"" Verma told Stumped on BBC World Service.""After cutting my hair, I would train with the boys and that's really helped me play the way I play today.""Just one day after breaking Tendulkar's record with 73 runs off 49 balls in a Twenty20 international against West Indies in St Lucia, Verma repeated the feat with an unbeaten 69 off 35 balls against the same opponents.She plundered 22 boundaries across the two innings, displaying a raw power that was honed in an innovative childhood workout.""Close to where I live there is a place where the police force used to have training drills,"" she explains. ""There were tyres there and I used to train lifting and flipping those tyres. That really helped me get stronger.""Verma's power hitting for Haryana Women earned her a call-up to Mithali Raj's Velocity team in the Women's T20 Challenge played alongside the Indian Premier League in May.And it was Raj's retirement from international T20 cricket that created space for Verma's call-up to the full India squad in September.Now, as she looks ahead to the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia in February and March, Verma is hoping her story will encourage more parents from her country to encourage their daughters to play sport.""What I would say to every family is don't think girls shouldn't leave the house,"" she adds. ""You have to support them. It's not that girls will only do well in studies. They can also do really well in sports.""What I want is that if there is a young girl, she shouldn't be stopped from playing cricket. If she works hard and focuses on her game anything can happen."""
sport	Mark Williams: Triple world champion 'hates' snooker, prefers golf		"Former world snooker champion Mark Williams says he ""hates"" the sport.Speaking after beating Scotland's Fraser Patrick 6-2 in the first round of the UK Snooker Championship in York, he said he prefers playing golf.""I really struggled but somehow he struggled more than me and made it easy for me on a couple of frames,"" said the 44-year-old.Williams, who won his third World Championship title in May 2018, has not won a ranking event this season.Currently ranked third in the World, his best performance was in September's China Open where he reached the final losing 10-9 to Shaun Murphy.Asked about his season he replied: ""It's going all right, I'm enjoying myself when I'm on the golf course.""When pushed about his snooker he responded: ""Hate it. I'm just enjoying play golf more.""The double UK Championship winner was also dismissive of his ambition at the York Barbican for the next fortnight.""It's going to struggle. I've got no expectations, if I play like that in the next round I'll get beat and I'll be home on Sunday or Monday,"" said Williams.Williams has in the past talked about retiring from the sport, including an interview with the BBC in 2017.One year later however he went on to become world champion again after a gap of 15 years, and created further headlines by holding his post final press conference naked.Williams is not the only Welsh sports personality with a keen enthusiasm for golf.Wales footballer Gareth Bale has been accused of preferring a round of 18 holes to playing football.Bale is allegedly nicknamed 'The Golfer' by some of his Real Madrid team-mates and his love of the game has led to critical newspaper headlines and supportive chants from Wales fans."
sport	Pete Reed: Three-time Olympic rowing champion on spinal stroke, paralysis and the future	'Walking again would be a miracle' - a new reality'After London 2012, who would think I'd face a bigger challenge?'New boundaries and Paralympic fantasies	"""It was scary. I was lying down and I could feel the life draining out of my legs.""On 3 September Pete Reed walked into his local hospital, an imposing figure at 6ft 6in in his Royal Navy uniform. He had a pain in his chest, numb legs and was unable to pee.A small spinal stroke, the doctors said. Three days later, he was walking around the hospital when the pain returned, only this time it was much more severe. ""Like nothing I've felt,"" he says.He returned to bed as the ""extraordinary"" pain radiated across his chest and his back.""Jeannie [his partner] was holding my feet because I asked her, because I was wiggling my feet up and down, and then slowly they came to a stop,"" the 38-year-old tells BBC Sport.""I could slowly feel it coming up through the legs and up to my chest. Within about 45 minutes the pain had gone and I couldn't move.""Reed, a three-time Olympic rowing champion, had suffered a much bigger spinal stroke. He is now paralysed from the chest down.In his first interview since the injury, he tells Sir Matthew Pinsent how his life has changed in the near three months since.""Once the pain had died away, the first thing I tried to do was sit up,"" he recalls. ""I grabbed the sides of the bed to pull myself up and I fell forwards like a rag doll, and then fell backwards. That's really scary.""Just three days earlier, Reed had been completing an assault course as part of his training for the Royal Marines. Ranked Lieutenant Commander, he had returned to a full-time naval career after retiring from rowing in April 2018.He was doing well. After all, this is a man who is reported to have the world's largest recorded lung capacity and, by his own admission, was a ""physical specimen"".Now, the only movement he has below the chest is the ability to wiggle a big toe. During his time in hospital, he contracted a rare form of meningitis as well as bladder infection after bladder infection.The cause of his injury is unknown and its extent will become apparent once the inflammation due to the trauma reduces. He may gain some movement in his legs, but walking again would be a ""miracle"".""If the damage is done, I won't be walking again. I can try all I like but it might not happen,"" he says. ""That's quite hard to take, but I'll take any movement I can get.""It's a balance of being positive and realistic, so I'll make sure I keep my emotions in check.""After two months in an NHS hospital, Reed moved to the spinal treatment centre at Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust three weeks ago. When he is discharged, he will go to the military rehabilitation centre at Stanford Hall near Loughborough.""People will see someone who has been through the Olympics very able-bodied, and now they'll see the wheelchair, but there's more to it than that,"" he says.""The grim realities are bladder care, bowel care, digestion and skin care and how it all affects you.""In the days after that big stroke, I would be awake at five in the morning thinking 'how am I going to go to the bathroom?'. That's hard.""For many years as a rower, Reed's daily life was planned to the minute. A 20km row on the machine in the morning, a couple of hours out on the water and then more time in the gym.It's still much the same. On his phone he has a colour-coordinated timetable, full of meetings with consultants, physiotherapy sessions and educational sessions, in which he learns about his body's new needs. Green is for visitors - and there is a lot of green.Many of his old crewmates - Andrew Triggs Hodge, Alex Gregory, Stan Louloudis to name but a few - and his former coach Jurgen Grobler have been to visit. It was the latter, GB's mastermind of a head coach, who Reed thinks struggled the most.""Nobody knows my body better than Jurgen,"" he says. ""He saw me at my physical best so for him arriving to see me in a wheelchair was tough.""He was the one person who I would try to impress physically, and it's a different world now.""A different world, maybe, but as Reed says, he couldn't have had better preparation for his new life.""There's nothing more beneficial to me now than my athlete mindset. Nothing.""Reed has lived his life in four-year chunks, Olympiad after Olympiad, winning gold at every Games since Beijing 2008. In this new, very different chapter of his life, he's treating it much the same.""Where we were going before was a gold medal, we knew what the goal was, we knew the venue, the start time, the standard - typically a second or two faster than the world record,"" he says.""Now, the standard is walking again. Let's say a gold medal is walking again, mountaineering, back to my old life and working for the Navy.""It's so familiar it's untrue. I count my blessings that I'm up for that challenge.""If the aim is walking again rather than a gold medal, the target is even bigger than before and the motivation is even bigger than before, and I didn't think I'd ever say that again.""After London 2012, who thought that I'd have a bigger challenge and more motivation to achieve?""Reed doesn't know what his future holds. He hopes he will be able to return to the Navy in some capacity, while he also wants to use his voice and his platform to raise awareness of the difficulties disabled people face.A lot of adjustment, both physical and mental, will take place. He will never return to his first-floor London flat, and he also has to get used to looking up at people, rather than down from his previous towering physique.""I pride myself on being brave and bold and sometimes a bit reckless,"" he says. ""Now, when I go out into the city, a pavement is suddenly an obstacle. Can I get up? Can I get down that, or a set of stairs? At the moment, it's a no-go.""I will learn to tackle these things, I will learn to get as close to my old life.""It will take a lot of time, because a kerb is a boundary. I need to get to a point where there are no boundaries.""Yet could the future also see a return to sport? Could this Olympian one day compete at the Paralympics?""I won't lie, I've thought about it and I thought about it quite quickly. I even started looking up all the Paralympic sports and classifications,"" he says.""But we've got to give the Paralympians credit. While I would fantasise about that, those athletes are incredible.""But which sport? Rowing is out because of his lack of core control and back strength, but javelin, archery or shooting? Maybe.""Invictus Games, why not?"" he says. ""At the moment the Paralympics feel like fantasy land. I've got three Olympic medals and I didn't think I'd ever have those, so why not?""There are lots of things to do in life, but imagine representing ParalympicsGB. That would be cool.""You can hear the full interview on The Inside Track on 28 November at 19:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 Live."

sport	Honda agrees Red Bull engine supply extension deal until 2021		"Honda will stay in Formula 1 at least until the end of 2021 after agreeing a one-year extension to its engine supply contract with Red Bull.The Japanese company committed to continuing in the sport following talks between its board and Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko last week.The company is still negotiating with Red Bull over the period after 2021.F1 is heading into a new era in 2021 after the agreement of new technical rules aimed at making racing closer.The announcement serves as an effective confirmation that Red Bull will continue in F1 beyond the end of 2020, when all the teams' contracts with the sport expire.The teams are in the process of negotiating new commercial terms with F1, which are expected to see a revision of the distribution of the prize fund and a more equitable split in revenues.Of the current top three teams, Mercedes and Ferrari have not yet formally committed to staying in the sport beyond 2020.Honda made the announcement in low-key fashion, deciding not to put out a formal statement or media release.The company said: ""This time it is a contract extension, not a new case. Therefore, we have not made a press release.""Honda joined forces with the senior Red Bull team in 2019 and have won three races, its first since returning to the sport in 2015.It had a difficult first three years back in F1 following its decision to return in partnership with McLaren.The company's engines were criticised for being uncompetitive and the relationship broke down at the end of 2017.But it became clear after Honda moved to supply Toro Rosso in 2018 that some of McLaren's lack of pace was down to the team's car.Honda has made further progress with its power-unit since leaving McLaren and has emerged with Red Bull this season as a force at the front of the grid.Max Verstappen won the Austrian, German and Brazilian Grands Prix, and Red Bull have become regular contenders at the front in the latter stages of this season, which ends with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this weekend."
sport	Newcastle United 2-2 Man City: Late Jonjo Shelvey strike holds champions	City's defensive shortcomings exposedShelvey and Newcastle offer perfect responseMan of the match - Miguel Almiron (Newcastle)'We produced a bit of magic' - what the managers saidShelvey's joy from long range - the statsWhat's next?NewcastleMan CityFull TimeGoal!SubstitutionGoal!SubstitutionBookingSubstitutionSubstitutionSubstitution	"Manchester City's hopes of retaining their Premier League title were dealt another blow when Jonjo Shelvey's stunning late equaliser earned Newcastle a point at St James' Park.City boss Pep Guardiola must have thought his side had won it when Kevin de Bruyne found the net in the 82nd minute with a brilliant long-range effort which went in off the crossbar.But with two minutes of normal time remaining, home substitute Christian Atsu pulled the ball back for Shelvey, who beat the dive of Ederson.Guardiola's side have now dropped 13 points this season and are 11 behind leaders Liverpool.It all began well for City when they took the lead after an early period of dominance.David Silva, sorely missed by the champions in their recent defeat by Liverpool, highlighted his worth with a deft backheel to find Raheem Sterling, who curled in for his 15th goal this season.However, before City could assert their dominance, the Magpies equalised through full-back Jetro Willems, who received a square pass from Miguel Almiron before calmly slotting home.That was the Dutch loan signing's second goal of the season and the eighth Magpies goal in the past 10 scored by a defender.City's Gabriel Jesus and De Bruyne were thwarted by Martin Dubravka after the break before substitute Bernardo Silva pulled a shot wide from eight yards. In stoppage time, Sterling's shot from six yards lacked venom and allowed Dubravka to make an easy save.Up next for Guardiola's side is a trip to Burnley, and they cannot afford any more slip-ups.Media playback is not supported on this deviceDespite the proverbial bus being parked on the edge of the Magpies' area, Guardiola's side still managed 24 efforts on goal.Had it not been for Dubravka's saves and the late misses by Bernardo Silva and Sterling, this would have been a deserved win.The attack played their part, but at times City's defensive structure left a lot to be desired.They made their intentions known as early as the first minute when they pressed high up, with right-back Kyle Walker coming inside to provide almost a second playmaker role.It was a confident move, but also left them exposed to the pace of Newcastle down the wings, particularly Allan Saint-Maximin, Almiron and Willems.City's defence should have made notes in the art of closing down from their Newcastle counterparts as both Willems and Shelvey were given too much time and space to hit their targets.Media playback is not supported on this deviceNewcastle's ability to surprise has been a feature this season.On Monday they were woeful against Aston Villa, allowing Jack Grealish to run the show.But against City they produced a disciplined defensive display while also making the most of the few attacking opportunities they had.Almiron and Shelvey, whose performances on Monday prompted groans from the Newcastle section, played major parts in the fightback.Almiron, without a goal or assist since joining earlier this year, again worked tirelessly across the pitch and provided a clever ball for Willems.When Shelvey's late strike resulted in the loudest cheer of the match, the midfielder ran over to the dugout to milk the applause.It was the perfect response from both him and his team to the 2-0 defeat at Villa.Newcastle manager Steve Bruce told BBC Sport: ""It took them a wonder goal for all the possession they had. We produced a bit of magic ourselves too, but of course we had to defend and I think the players were magnificent in their work.""Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport: ""We played at a good level. It was not easy because they defended deep. We scored two goals but we also let two in which is disappointing.""With substitutions sometimes players forget positions. We found a way to get through but unfortunately at the end we conceded a goal. There are teams that defend deeper like this, it happens all season.""We do the same work we have done over the last few seasons. We tried to score more goals but it did not happen.""City travel to face Burnley on Tuesday (20:15 GMT), while Newcastle are at Sheffield United on Thursday (19:30 GMT).Match ends, Newcastle United 2, Manchester City 2.Second Half ends, Newcastle United 2, Manchester City 2.Attempt saved.

sport	UK Championship: Ronnie O'Sullivan eases through with another whitewash	Rocket matches Davis UK wins record	"Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan ruthlessly dispatched China's Tian Pengfei with his second successive 6-0 win to reach the third round of the UK Championship in York.O'Sullivan cruised past teenager Ross Bulman in 66 minutes on Thursday.And the record seven-time champion took another routine victory on Saturday.Former two-time champions Neil Robertson and Mark Selby both progressed to the last-32 with comfortable victories.Australia's Robertson made a high break of 101 as defeated Robbie Williams 6-4, while Englishman Selby was in high scoring form with knocks of 129, 80, 62, 61 and 50 helping him beat Liam Highfield 6-3.Meanwhile, there were wins for 2015 world champion Stuart Bingham, who beat Martin Gould 6-4, Wales' Matthew Stevens, who beat Ryan Day 6-5, and last year's runner up Mark Allen, who survived a scare to edge past Jak Jones 6-5.O'Sullivan, 43, made breaks of 106 and 71 on Saturday and will face Thailand's Noppon Saengkham next.The world number two will move to a record 37 ranking titles if he triumphs in York.The Rocket is currently level with Stephen Hendry's haul of 36. He is also the only player to compile more than 1,000 career centuries and has more Triple Crown event wins than anyone else.O'Sullivan's recent record at the Barbican Centre is remarkable, having won 29 of his 30 matches at the venue since 2014, lifting the trophy in the past two years having been beaten in the 2016 final by Mark Selby.He described York as his ""favourite city in the UK"", adding: ""I love the coffee shops here, it's great to be able to go and relax, get my computer out and study the things I'm interested in and enjoy the surroundings, which is important.""Asked about his two whitewashes, O'Sullivan, who lost 9-7 to Judd Trump in the Northern Ireland Open final earlier this month, said: ""If I'd beaten John Higgins and Judd Trump 6-0 you'd say it was amazing but no disrespect to my first opponent - he's a rookie on tour and really looked like he was struggling.Find out how to get into snooker, pool and billiards with our fully inclusive guide.""I was pleased to get through today, felt sorry for Tian, he didn't get much going and it's always horrible to see a good friend struggling.""It takes me three, possibly four tournaments to get going, so by the time I start the season most of the guys have already played seven or eight tournaments.""I'm always playing catch-up in terms of when I hit my optimum level, but to be at this stage now I feel like I'm into the season and my game is where it can be.""The victory over world number 65 Tian means O'Sullivan has won a total of 89 matches at the UK Championship, drawing him level with six-time champion Steve Davis.Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news on the BBC app."
sport	Sir Gareth Edwards: World Rugby's drive against dangerous challenges can boost the sport	Gatland brings Wales to 'boiling point'	"Wales and British and Irish Lions legend Sir Gareth Edwards believes World Rugby's drive against dangerous tackles can make the game better.Seven players were sent off or later banned and 26 sin-binned during the World Cup's pool stage.That has led to fears disciplinary action could decide knock-out games.But ex-scrum-half Edwards says if tackles become lower, ""it'll release the ball much faster and I think the game will become a lot better for it"".Ireland centre Bundi Aki is out of the tournament after being banned for three weeks following his high challenge on Samoa's UJ Seuteni in their 47-5 Pool A win.Aki will be an onlooker when Ireland take on New Zealand in their quarter-final on Saturday.He is not alone in having fallen foul of a concerted effort to force players to aim lower and reduce the use of swinging arms at the tournament.World Rugby introduced new rules in 2017 to ""change culture in the sport to ensure that the head is a no-go area"" and published a framework to help referees rule on high tackles in May.Early in the tournament, the governing body criticised its own officials after Reece Hodge's collision with Peceli Yato during Australia's opening win over Fiji went unpunished.And while he applauds the efforts being made against high challenges, Edwards believes the sport has much to learn from its past.He told BBC Sport Wales: ""The game has been allowed to sort of develop a situation where trying to contest the ball or keep it in play or stop people off-loading has meant the tackles have got higher and higher over the period of time.""We all remember the time as schoolboys we used to be taught tackle around the hips, tackle around the legs and so forth.""Now I think if the game gets back to doing that, I think it'll release the ball much faster and I think the game will become a lot better for it.""But getting back to the problem and the point in time, what is happening at the moment is almost inevitable because of the way in which the game has developed - people wanting to smash the ball away with the forearm and, of course, it's just got higher and higher and higher.""Edwards believes the game's image will suffer if issues surrounding head injuries are not resolved.""The danger to the game is that if you don't stop it [high tackles], then I think the consequences are too grave,"" he said.Edwards also sees danger for Wales in their quarter-final against France in Oita on Sunday after Warren Gatland's side beat Georgia, Australia, Fiji and Uruguay to top Pool D.""Wales will be fairly confident, there's nothing wrong with that, as long as they don't get too far ahead of themselves,"" said Edwards.""It'll be a tough encounter. France have got a habit of doing particularly well in the World Cup, but having said that, we've always said at virtually every World Cup 'if you want to win it, you're going to have to beat New Zealand somewhere along the line'.""Let's hope it's in the final. But Wales have acquitted themselves excellently.""It's as if Warren Gatland knows exactly how to get these boys to boiling point at the right time."""
sport	Ronnie O'Sullivan: Judd Trump not yet a snooker great, says rival	Trump is 'ahead of the pack'	"Judd Trump has work to do to be considered one of snooker's greats, according to legend Ronnie O'Sullivan.Trump, 30, has been in imperious form this season following his maiden World Championship title victory in May.The Bristolian has won three ranking titles already this season and, like O'Sullivan, is safely into round two of the UK Championship in York.""Judd is a fantastic player and a great talent but the true test is doing it over 10-15 years,"" O'Sullivan said.O'Sullivan said 30-year-old Trump's CV does not compare to his or that of Stephen Hendry, Steve Davis, John Higgins or Ray Reardon - who are all multiple ranking event winners.Seven-time world champion Hendry and five-time world champion O'Sullivan each have 36 ranking event wins, Higgins has 30 and Davis is fourth on the list with 28. Davis and Reardon have six Crucible titles apiece.Find out how to get into snooker, pool and billiards with our fully inclusive guide.O'Sullivan, who is next in action against China's Tian Pengfei on Saturday, added: ""Many people have won the World Championship, like Ken Doherty. Is he a great? Probably not, he's just a very, very good player.""He said the acid test - across all sports - was success over a sustained period.""You look at [Lionel] Messi, Roger Federer, Tiger Woods and you would say they are greats,"" O'Sullivan explained. ""Rory McIlroy? Is he a great? Not yet. Potentially he probably will be, but you have to watch it unfold.""O'Sullivan said Trump's stunning form made him the ""man to beat"", but added that the 13-year age gap between the pair made calling them rivals ""very difficult"".""The rivalry is probably me, Higgins and [Mark] Williams. You had Davis and Hendry or Davis and [Jimmy] White.""Judd's rivalry is probably someone more like Ding [Junhui] because they are at the right age and going along at parallel careers,"" O'Sullivan added.""At the moment Judd's competition is with himself. He seems to be ahead of the pack. He's number one in the world and world champion.""He's the man in form and the man everyone is going to have to stop to win tournaments.""Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news on the BBC app."

sport	Max Taylor: Manchester United teenager on his cancer, recovery & return to football		"Media playback is not supported on this deviceOne name stands out in Manchester United's squad for their Europa League trip to Astana on Thursday.Defender Max Taylor has never played a first-team game for United. The local-born 19-year-old is another example of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's commitment to the club's youth.Yet for Taylor, it is the latest stage in a remarkable story of resilience and mental fortitude after being diagnosed with testicular cancer in November 2018.""If anything, it has increased my ambition,"" Taylor tells BBC Sport. ""I take things head on. Just go for it. Don't be scared.""Taylor's world was turned upside down in June 2018, five months after he had signed his first professional contract.""I'd been checking and felt a lump. The doctor ran a scan and thought it was a cyst, which is quite common in people my age. But when he repeated the scan, it had got bigger. He sent me to a specialist, who sent me for another scan. That's when I got told inside the area of infection next to the cyst was a tumour, most likely a form of testicular cancer.""Taylor heard the news sitting alongside his mum, Stella, and stepfather, Matthew.""It was surreal. We just looked at each other thinking: 'Has he really just said that? That it is cancer?' The specialist said the cells inside the testicle would have to be taken off. He said removing the testicle was the first thing to happen but I would also need a CT scan to check the rest of my body and I might need chemotherapy.""My mum broke down straight away. I was so taken aback I didn't cry. I got out of the clinic and thought: 'Oh my God.' You hear the word cancer. My mind was running 100mph. 'What will happen? What's next? Will I play football again? Will I be alive?' It repeated in my head, over and over.""United told Taylor to take a break. He was in Portugal when his phone rang.""I knew who it was. I had told them that as soon as they had any information, I wanted to know. The specialist said he really didn't want to tell me the news over the phone but he had the biopsy back which confirmed I had primary cancer in my testicle. I was expecting it. When I came home I had another CT scan. That's when I thought: 'This is actually quite serious.'Taylor was transferred to Manchester's leading cancer hospital, The Christie.""The cancer had spread to the abdomen. There were also a couple of specks on my lungs that might have spread too. They told me I would need quite heavy chemotherapy; a short, but really intense, course. They said the chemotherapy was very effective but I may still need surgery. I knew the percentages but I was scared. One hundred percent I was scared. I had been unlucky enough to get cancer in the first place so when they say there is a chance it might keep spreading, it worries you.""You're in a bubble here [at Manchester United]. It's football, football, football. Training one day. Match the next. Training again. That night, I shut my door at home and thought: 'What's next?' I knew I would have to go along with whatever they said, and I had no idea how my body would react. Everything had been taken away. Not just football - meeting new family members, having a normal Christmas. It was all so unknown.""The emotional toll on Taylor and those close to him was huge.""I put on a brave face for my mum but she could see through it. She knew when I was down and my girlfriend, Lydia, was with me a lot of the time on the nights when I was struggling. My first thought was: 'Will I play football?' But then you get to the point when you're by yourself, you can't sleep and all you're thinking is: 'This could end my life.'""Realistically, the chances of that actually happening were tiny - but you overthink everything. 'What if the chemo doesn't work? This could go further than anyone expects.'""Taylor had his chemotherapy treatment outlined. Three lots of three-week hits. The cycle began on 21 November 2018.""The first week it was Monday: eight hours of chemo, four hours of hydration. Tuesday: six hours of chemo, four hours of hydration. Wednesday: two hours of chemo and the rest hydration. Then I would go home and come back a week later for two hours of chemo, and finally come back a week later for another two hours of chemo. I did that three times.""It doesn't sound too heavy, but the chemo I was having was quite toxic. The first night was the worst. You're up, shaking and sweating, but you feel freezing cold. Then the sickness starts. That first night I realised it was going to be a hard nine weeks.""Taylor found it easier to cope with this bit. He could compare it to nerves building up before a big game and disappearing once it starts. Fellow cancer-suffering footballer Joe Thompson offered his support.""I spoke to Joe the night before I went in. He really helped. He said when I was being sick or at the toilet to remember it was making me better. My immune system was so low I couldn't be in a room with more than six or eight people because of the risk of infection. I wasn't allowed to go and see friends - but I didn't want to. I didn't want them to see me in that state or feel sorry for me. I wanted them to see me on the other side.""At the same time, I needed people around me. It's harder to watch someone you care about going through it, than it is to go through it yourself. My family and girlfriend were the ones seeing me look ill, lose my hair and struggle. At the start they tried to shield it. Once I became more open about it, they could talk about how I was feeling mentally, how they were feeling mentally, what they were struggling with and ask any others questions.""As at other hospitals, every cancer patient at The Christie rings a bell to signal the end of their treatment. Taylor completed this symbolic moment, knowing it did not mean his journey was over.""Two weeks after my last treatment I went for another scan. In terms of nerves, it was worse than any game. I was with my mum and we were both shaking. The doctor said the cancer was cleared but I still needed an operation because my lymph nodes were swollen after the chemotherapy and one had attached itself to the main blood vessel.""Around this time, it was announced publicly I was clear of cancer. Everyone was sending me messages but I still had another big hurdle to go. It was six weeks from the end of my chemo before I could get that surgery done. It was a five-and-a-half-hour operation. Waiting for that was the hardest part because I was in no man's land. My immune system was still low.""Everyone thinks you are normal but I couldn't do anything. Mentally I did not feel normal and physically I was still feeling the side effects. I don't think I slept more than six hours a night. I was struggling quite badly mentally. The [club] doctor used to come round to the house to put my mind at ease. You need reassurance from people telling you to give it time. After the operation I spent five nights in hospital, with an epidural pump in my back and all these wires that were slowly taken out. I still felt ill. I was still bald. I would look in the mirror and think: 'I do not look good.' It was a good three months before I started to feel right.""Between Taylor first being diagnosed and his recovery, Manchester United had changed their manager. He had already been heartened by Jose Mourinho's support. He soon found Solskjaer was aware of his story as well.""Mourinho was great. I remember walking down to the gym one day, he put his arm around my shoulder, asked me what had gone on, what was I preparing for and giving me words of support. When I came back, the first day I came in to see [coaches] Kieran McKenna and Michael Carrick. Ole took me into his office, then invited me out to watch the first team train. I was just stood there talking. It was a great way to come back - very uplifting. That was massive for me. I was thought people might not remember.""On 22 October, Taylor returned to the pitch, as a substitute in an under-23 game at Swansea. On 22 November, he came on at Old Trafford as United Under-23s beat Sunderland 3-0. Now he is getting his first experience of first-team duty in Kazakhstan, with Solskjaer resting many regulars because they have already qualified for the Europa League knockout stages.""There is a side to Manchester United that a lot of people don't see. It is like a family. When I came back, people who are not at the forefront of the Manchester United show - the cleaning staff, the chefs - asked me how I was getting on. It meant so much.""Once I started training again, I just wanted to be treated the same as everyone else. I have known some of my team-mates since I was 14. They are my best friends. It took until the first nutmeg for them to take the mickey out of me. Funny as it sounds, that moment was really good. I am not going to neglect the fact I had cancer, but I don't want it to be what people remember me for. I want to be a good person, a great footballer and someone who gives back.""Last week, 12 months on from his own diagnosis, Taylor returned to The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester.""There were a few young lads in there, football fans. Jesse [Lingard] gave me a shirt to take in for a little lad called Kieran. He is 11. His whole family has to come down from Scotland. They are spending 39 nights away from home, in a hotel.

sport	FA Cup: Chichester City embracing club-record run to second round	A start in the extra preliminary roundThe financial impactA trip of a lifetimeWhat are their chances?	"Chichester City have produced one of the most talked-about moments of this season's FA Cup without even stepping foot on a pitch.The lamentable and protracted demise of Bury meant that one club involved in the draw for the first round would receive a bye.City's players watched the draw from West Sussex via television as the balls were plucked from the bowl by Karen Carney and Jermaine Beckford.After a long wait, theirs was eventually the last ball out, meaning the lowest-ranked club left in the competition would be going through to the second round for the first time in their history without playing.Their celebrations that night have since been viewed more than 1.2 million times on Twitter.For manager Miles Rutherford, it was the ""best moment in football"" the 52-year-old has experienced.""It was a surreal feeling and one we didn't expect,"" captain Connor Coady told BBC Sport. ""I don't think anyone in the room thought it was going to happen. It was phenomenal.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceYet that footage and reaction meant the Isthmian League South East Division side's achievements in the FA Cup thus far have been somewhat overlooked as they prepare to face League One Tranmere Rovers on Sunday.Chichester City are enjoying their first campaign in the eighth tier of English football, having won the Southern Combination Football League title last season.Centre-back Coady was ""sulking a bit in the summer"" thinking their success could not be repeated. How wrong the 25-year-old personal trainer proved to be.City began their FA Cup campaign back on 10 August in the extra preliminary round - a stage they had failed to get past in the previous three seasons - and played seven games as they progressed through six rounds to reach the first round proper.Coady missed the first qualifying round tie at home to Chalfont St Peter while he was away on holiday in Turkey, but sat on his phone ""refreshing Twitter hoping for the result"".Chichester are the first team in 70 years to make it from the extra preliminary round all the way to the second round proper - and the club have won more FA Cup ties in 2019-20 than they did in the previous 26 seasons combined.They have pulled off a few giant-killings, too, knocking out three clubs from the tier above, and victory at Bowers & Pitsea in the fourth qualifying round took the Lilywhites into the first round for just the second time in their history.""Everyone has forgotten how hard the club worked to get to the first round,"" said coach Darin Kilpatrick. ""For us as a club to do what we have done is outrageous.""The second-round draw presented Chichester with a trip to a League One club, with Tranmere eventually becoming the destination after Rovers overcame Wycombe in a replay.The match has been chosen for television coverage, giving City a £75,000 broadcast fee and taking their earnings from their run to just over £157,000.After receiving the bye, club chairman Andy Bell has said the club will make a donation to Bury once the future of their would-be opponents has been decided.The money has given Chichester, who were close to bankruptcy last season, the hope they can become self-sustainable in step four of the non-league pyramid.The local council are set to install an artificial 3G surface at their Oaklands Park home in 2021, which will allow the club to use the pitch for all their youth sides and become a community hub.""None of us are oil-rich chairmen and no-one throws money at this club,"" said Bell. ""It will only survive if the men's first team are doing well.""For Rutherford, it is about the prospect of stability.""This season is probably going to cost us £30,000 and at the beginning of the season we had £20,000.""We knew we were going to be in trouble just after Christmas if we didn't find some more money. The FA Cup has probably secured three years in the league we are in.""There are five divisions between Tranmere and Chichester - the equivalent of Premier League and FA Cup champions Manchester City facing a club in National League North or South.""Chichester City are a proper non-league side with minimal resources,"" said Rutherford.""Not one of the players is on a contract, which shows the level we are at. Most clubs around this area are probably a little bit envious.""Chichester will train at St George's Park - usually home to the England team - on Saturday before staying in the north-west before the game.The players and staff will also have a night out on the town after playing Tranmere, with the pubs and bars of Liverpool likely to be visited before the squad travel back south on Monday.The media attention has been something to contend with, too.""It is nice because more than likely come Monday, there probably won't be a camera around,"" said Coady.""We need to use it to get the whole city involved and get as much exposure for the club as we can.""On the club's only appearance in the first round, in 1960-61, Chichester lost 11-0 to Bristol City as England striker John Atyeo netted five goals.""There is a bit of trepidation about it,"" said chairman Bell. ""It could be our heaviest-ever defeat.""Tranmere will provide a massive step up from Chichester's previous opponents in the competition, while Prenton Park will provide a febrile atmosphere compared to what City's players have previously experienced.The club's highest home crowd this season was for the third qualifying round win over Enfield Town, when around 550 were present to see a 1-0 victory.""It is somehow about trying to take the emotion and magnitude out of the game,"" said assistant manager Graeme Gee.""The players need to relax as much as they can.""Rutherford, a self-employed industrial roofer when he is not in the dugout, said City are ""in the real world"" about their chances.""All the players would have to have the game of their lives and Tranmere would have to have a bad day,"" he said.""We are talking about proper part-time footballers. We need lots of luck, but we can't go there without some belief."""

My dream was always to be an Olympic champion,"" said Barnes on Sportsound Extra Time.Less than a week after announcing his retirement, Barnes has taken up a new job with the Irish Athletic Boxing Association as Club Development Officer for Ulster.As well as his two Olympic medals in London and Rio, Barnes won gold medals while competing for Northern Ireland at the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games.He turned professional in 2016 and won his first five fights, however three losses in his last four bouts made Barnes consider his future in the sport.The defeat to Welshman Harris in four rounds at the Ulster Hall proved to be the final straw for Barnes, who says he had the option of carrying on but knew the time was right to retire.""The only reason I was in the sport was to be the best,"" said Barnes.""I could have fought journeymen and got paid for it, but that's not why I was in boxing for.""I've been to three Olympics, and people told me that I should have turned professional after my second Games.""That was just never a dream of mine and I just wanted to win gold.""Once I did turn pro, there wasn't a transition and I just threw myself into the deep end.""I tried and I came up short, but I have no regrets whatsoever.""Barnes, who has now started a job with Sport NI after retiring, says he has been ""a bit overwhelmed"" since announcing he was quitting the sport.""The response has been mad,"" he added.""There's been over 1000 messages with people wishing me well and thanking me for the memories.""After three defeats in his last four fights, the popular flyweight said he knew that he knew his time in the professional ranks would be limited.""I felt, not just in training, that my reaction times were getting slower.""I noticed it in my last few performances, especially the one in Falls Park, where I wasn't able to slip punches like I used to be able to.""I knew that I was on the decline and I'm a realist.

sport	Jack Grealish, Andrew Robertson, Allan Saint-Maximin: Who are the Premier League's best dribblers?	Grealish the creatorDeulofeuuuu-no!Bringing it out from the backPace, pace, paceTake him on!Kovacic the controller	"The dribble. One of the most exciting aspects of football.A good dribbler gets supporters off their seats as they glide past opponents. But there can be frustration too - all that build-up, no end product and a loud groan from the stands.Now a new 'ball-carrying' metric from data analysts Opta - which measures players running with the ball for at least five metres - means we not only know which players take on the most dribbles, but whose are the most effective too.BBC Sport takes a look at the Premier League statistics...A dribble may be exciting but the most important thing is what comes at the end of it. No-one likes a player who runs down blind alleys.Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish tops the chart for the number of carries ending in a chance being created this season with 17, a reflection of his impressive season back in the Premier League.Earlier this season, Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said a tweak of Grealish's position is helping this improvement.""The manager has been asking him to play a lot closer to the centre-forward Wesley, predominantly from the left-hand side, and it's suiting his game,"" Shearer said.""It's given him some freedom to go and roam.""Another way to assess a dribble is whether a shot came at the end of it.Gerard Deulofeu has had more carries ending in an effort on goal than any other player this season with 17, although he has only scored twice.Chelsea forward Willian is another who likes a shot at the end of a dribble, as is Tottenham's Son Heung-min, although he dribbles less often.There is little point in a lengthy dribble if it is back towards a team's goal.Progressive carries measures the number times a player brings the ball at least five metres upfield, and a number defenders - rather than traditional 'dribblers' - make this list as a result.Liverpool left-back Andrew Robertson leads the way and the presence of Reds right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in the top 10 it suggests this is a tactic effectively employed by the league leaders.""Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold are redefining the way full-backs play,"" former Reds striker Peter Crouch said on Match of the Day 2 earlier in November.""With their runs forward and balls into the box they have always offered such an attacking threat along with the front three, but now they are passing to each other too.""It is a joy to watch at times and they really are outstanding. I don't know a better full-back pairing in the world at the moment, and they are another reason why this Liverpool team is going to be so hard to stop.""The 'average carry/dribble progress' statistic also helps to measure effectiveness.This is the average distance a player carries the ball forwards across all of their dribbles this season. Newcastle winger Allan Saint-Maximin has the largest average carry distance at 12.17 metres.Former Magpies striker Shearer described the 22-year-old Frenchman's pace as ""staggering"" after an impressive performance against West Ham this season.That speed has helped him top the chart with Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford second.It may not necessarily result in a goal or a chance being created, but one thing football fans like to see is their players beating an opponent.It is little surprise that Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha dominates this statistic, which measures the number of dribbles that involve taking on at least one player.Zaha has done this 10 more times than anyone else and fellow wingers dominate the rest of the top 10, including Wolves' Adama Traore in second and Saint-Maximin of Newcastle.Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic is, perhaps more surprisingly, the player who has completed the most dribbles of five metres or more per 90 minutes so far this season.The Croatia international has received plaudits for his improved performance under manager Frank Lampard this term compared with the 2018-19 campaign under Maurizio Sarri, with his high number of dribbles a suggestion he is having a greater impact on games.Garth Crooks said Kovacic has been a ""revelation"" since Lampard took charge at Stamford Bridge and fellow BBC pundit Jermaine Jenas has praised both the 25-year-old and his team-mate Jorginho.""Kovacic is a top player and I think under Sarri maybe he didn't really show he had the ability. Frank has given him a little bit more freedom and the pair of them looked like the real mature heads in that team,"" Jenas said.Who do you think the Premier League's best dribblers are?

sport	Irish League Behaviour: Jim Ervin my toughest opponent says Joe Gormley		"Cliftonville striker Joe Gormley has told BBC Sport Northern Ireland's Irish League Behaviour podcast that he considers Ballymena United's Jim Ervin his toughest Irish League opponent.Prolific forward Gormley, 30, believes Ervin heads a strong defensive cast that includes Colin Coates, Jimmy Callacher and Chris Hegarty.""Jim's a super player. I always find it tough against him,"" said Gormley.""His reading of the game is exceptional.""Colin Coates is very tough to play against but I would say that my favourite defender would be Jim Ervin.""Jimmy Callacher...Chris Hegarty...there are that many top defenders that I can't mention them all but Jim would be one of the toughest.""Gormley celebrates his 30th birthday this week by featuring on the weekly BBC Sport NI podcast hosted by Joel Taggart and Liam Beckett which also has Reds boss Paddy McLaughlin as the other guest.The former Crumlin Star striker brought his goals tally this season to 20 by firing in a typically stunning strike in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Larne.""I've just caught it really well. I always say if I don't shoot I don't score,"" said Joe, who joked that he is now feels like ""a 30-year-old in a 25-year-old body"".""It's always great to score the goals but I would rather help out the team as much as I can. If the goals come, it's a bonus.""Gormley also spoke of how he was on the point of joining Cliftonville's North Belfast rivals Crusaders in 2017 following his return from injury-affected cross-channel stints at Peterborough United and St Johnstone.""I was really close to joining them.

sport	Terence McNaughton brands continuing delays to Casement Park upgrade 'a disgrace'	McNaughton now managing Naomh Eanna'I'm jealous of Kingspan and Windsor Park'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceAntrim hurling great Terence 'Sambo' McNaughton has branded continuing delays over the Casement Park redevelopment project a ""disgrace"".Ulster GAA earlier this week expressed ""deep frustration"" at a lack of progress 1,000 days after its second planning application.The west Belfast stadium last staged a game in June 2013.""It's an absolute disgrace that we don't have Casement by now,"" said McNaughton.""It's not even in the building process - it needs to be sorted out and sorted out quickly.""McNaughton, who won nine Ulster senior hurling championships with Antrim as player and joint-manager, recently led Naomh Eanna Glengormley to their first ever Ulster Intermediate Hurling Championship.""Imagine St Enda's without a home. Imagine any team without one. Your home's your home,"" added McNaughton.""It's a disgrace that we have no home, a county team. I know, from managing Antrim in the past, when you don't have a home, it's like any sport.""Cushendall, Loughgiel, Dunloy, O'Donovan Rossa, St John's. They all have a base and Antrim GAA needs a base.""The sooner people sort this out the better - whatever needs done, it needs to be done quickly - it needs to become everyone's number one priority.""The Northern Ireland Executive agreed funding in March 2011 to upgrade Casement Park into a 40,000 all-seated stadium as part of the Regional Stadia Development Programme.However, while Windsor Park, which hosts the Northern Ireland national football team's matches and Kingspan Stadium, the home of Ulster Rugby, have both been redeveloped since then, Casement Park remains derelict.Planning approval for Casement's redevelopment was quashed in 2014 and this week marked 1,000 days since Ulster GAA submitted a second planning application to Belfast City Council in February 2017.""As an Antrim man and a GAA man all my life, I'm jealous of Kingspan and Windsor Park,"" admitted McNaughton.""Why can they go and get it done and we seem to make a mess of it?""There's no other way to describe it. I don't know all the ins and outs of Antrim and Ulster GAA, but the one thing I do know is if there's a will there's a way, and this needs to be sorted out sooner rather than later."""
sport	Freddie Ljungberg: From underwear model to Arsenal manager	The shy one?'When he spoke, everyone listened'Can Ljungberg stake his claim?	"The shy Swede with vibrant pink hair. The surprisingly private underwear model. Arsenal's new caretaker manager Freddie Ljungberg is a paradox, a far more reserved man than the bolder image many have of him may suggest.Over 12 years since departing as a player, former winger Ljungberg, 42, has been called on to save the Gunners' season following the sacking of Unai Emery.He's an Arsenal and Sweden legend, but what else do we know about the Gunners' new interim boss?Ljungberg spent nine years at Arsenal and was a key figure in the record-breaking 'Invincibles' side that went a whole Premier League season without defeat in 2003-04. He departed for West Ham in 2007 as a two-time league champion and three-time FA Cup winner.In 2017 he was named Arsenal's 11th greatest player of all time, yet despite his loud hairstyles - and his underwear modelling - Ljungberg is in reality a private individual.""Considering the fact he is one of our greatest of all time, we don't know a lot about Fredrik Ljungberg,"" Swedish football journalist Frida Fagerlund told BBC Sport.""He has always been very low key when it comes to the media and other public appearances. He has spoken openly about not really trusting people in general, especially not during his last few years in the Premier League. That is probably why he hasn't done so many interviews.""Even in Sweden - a country recently spearheaded on the international football stage by the outspoken Zlatan Ibrahimovic - Vittsjo-born Ljungberg has maintained his mystery.While his introverted nature has kept him from the headlines, his status as a Swedish football icon has not wavered.Fagerlund said: ""Fredrik will always be considered as one of the greatest. He did a lot for the national team and today Arsenal is one of the most popular clubs in Sweden.""He describes himself as shy but he is a strong character. That he's not driven by fame or recognition may be an advantage in his leadership.""The model work he did for Calvin Klein was a bit of a surprise to everyone but he has said that it forced him out of his comfort zone, and it probably did.""With that being said, he will always be a bit of a mystery. It is quite peculiar.""Spells in Japan and India concluded Ljungberg's 20-year playing career. The Swede returned to Arsenal in 2016 as under-15s coach before being handed the opportunity to join then-academy manager Andries Jonker as Wolfsburg assistant in February 2017.Tasked with keeping the struggling side in the German top flight, Jonker and Ljungberg achieved their objective via a relegation play-off, but were sacked six months later following a poor start to the 2017-18 season.Wolfsburg football journalist Leonard Hartmann told BBC Sport that Ljungberg commanded attention despite his quiet approach - and the club's plight.""Andries and Freddie arrived with a mission to stabilise the struggling team in the worst part of Wolfsburg's history and prevent the disaster of relegation,"" said Hartmann.""The club had many problems. There were insecurities everywhere. Freddie's task was to talk to the players and give them back their confidence. He always acted in the background, but when he spoke, everyone listened.""The players listened carefully when he talked, because they had looked up to him when they were younger.""Given the opportunity to continue into the new season, Jonker and Ljungberg made ""huge mistakes"" prior to being sacked, according to Hartmann. He believes they failed to alter their methods and fitness was neglected in favour of tactics.""Freddie said he wished to have more time to give their ideas a real chance to grow, but it was the wrong time and wrong place. The club had much bigger problems than a former assistant and an inexperienced but ambitious young coach could solve,"" added Hartmann.The Gunners welcomed their club legend back as under-23s boss in 2018, and he impressed sufficiently to becomes Emery's first-team coach.Plenty of big-name managers have already been linked with the vacant managerial position at Emirates Stadium, but could Ljungberg conceivably become permanent manager?Compared with other frontrunners for the position, Ljungberg's CV does not measure up to the Premier League experience of former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino or Wolves' Nuno Espirito Santo - nor the European credentials of Massimiliano Allegri and Carlo Ancelotti.Domestic rivals Manchester United and Chelsea have adopted a 'club legend' approach, with the former's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer earning a permanent contract following a sharp upturn in form after he took interim control.That, of course, will be Ljungberg's sole aim when his out-of-sorts side travel to Norwich on Sunday.""Throughout his career he has always done things his own way,"" Aftonbladet journalist Fagerlund said.""I think that's why he never returned to Sweden. In London it's much easier to be yourself and it doesn't matter what you're into or where you come from. Pre-Zlatan it was still very unusual to have outspoken and slightly unique characters within football.""The truth is we don't really know much about Fredrik's style as a manager. What we do know is that he's done a brilliant job with the youngsters and is likely to continue on that path. He will also probably bring back some players who have been out in the cold.""A number of Arsenal youngsters have praised Ljungberg's influence behind the scenes, with 18-year-old forward Bukayo Saka admitting he often relied on Ljungberg to explain former boss Emery's instructions.With almost a decade of guidance from Arsene Wenger an inevitable influence, Ljungberg knows as well as any the type of football Arsenal fans are accustomed to. But, while the pink hair has since disappeared, it is likely he will know no other way than to add his own personal stamp.""He wants his team to play offensive football and this is what Arsenal stands for,"" added Hartmann.""I think he will do his job like he always has. Quiet, thoughtful and with a focus on technique and tactics.""When someone with such a fantastic career like Freddie gives everything in a small town like Wolfsburg, where everybody liked his unpretentious way, why should he not succeed at the club he loves?"""
sport	Ross County v Celtic: Giant-killings & six-goal drubbings - five famous encounters	10 January 2004 - Celtic 2-0 Ross County10 April 2010 - Celtic 0-2 Ross County9 March 2013 - Ross County 3-2 Celtic31 January 2016 Ross County 3-1 Celtic19 October 2019 - Celtic 6-0 Ross County	"Hampden giant-killings, Parkhead drubbings and Highland thrillers - Ross County and Celtic have contested some blockbuster showdowns in recent years.Since joining the fourth tier of Scottish football in 1994, County have earned a reputation for punching above their weight.Celtic, long established as one of Scotland's trophy-laden heavyweights, have been stunned more than once, but dished out their fair share of heavy beatings.On Sunday, the sides meet in Dingwall, as Celtic aim to preserve their narrow lead at the Premiership summit, and County bid to pull clear of the basement dwellers.Here, BBC Scotland profiles five of their most memorable clashes.The sides first met in the Scottish Cup third round almost 15 years ago with County, playing in the old First Division, raring to tackle a team of Celtic behemoths. The great Henrik Larsson, John Hartson, Paul Lambert, Stiliyan Petrov, Shaun Maloney, and current boss Neil Lennon were all named in the home line-up.Only 10 years out of the Highland League, the Dingwall men were praised for their resolute defensive display on their maiden trip to Parkhead.They failed to replicate the famous success of their northern neighbour Inverness, who ""went ballistic"" in a 3-1 triumph four years earlier, but a 2-0 defeat was no disgrace, with Hartson and Lambert killing them off.This became little County's greatest day, as the second-tier underdogs slew the mighty Celtic at Hampden en route to a first-ever Scottish Cup final.Having already booted out Hibernian in the last eight, 7,000 fans - more than the population of Dingwall - travelled south to watch their side make history in the most incredible fashion.Few gave them a chance against a team spearheaded by Robbie Keane, even though Celtic had floundered domestically under Tony Mowbray, with Lennon taking temporary charge.Georgios Samaras hit the post, Keane menaced, but it was Steven Craig and Martin Scott whose second-half glory goals felled the Glasgow giants.Although they would lose the showpiece to Dundee United, that County side and their miraculous cup run has gone down in club folklore.A Celtic team that had beaten Barcelona fell to defeat in Dingwall in a dramatic see-sawing encounter.The visitors led the top flight by 15 points. Newly-promoted County were on an unbeaten run of 10 games.Four days after their wonderful Champions League voyage was ended by Juventus, Celtic led 2-0 through Charlie Mulgrew and Gary Hooper.But, with fatigue perhaps playing a part, back roared the hosts. Grant Munro and Sam Morrow hauled them level, before German striker Steffen Wohlfarth struck a dramatic 90th-minute header to snatch a memorable win with his first goal for the club.If that was a big upset, this was positively colossal, particularly when Gary Mackay-Steven put Celtic in front after just 26 seconds of the League Cup semi-final.The match was turned on its head when Efe Ambrose was dismissed for fouling Alex Schalk in the box, and Martin Woods netted the resultant penalty.Paul Quinn's header and Schalk's thunderous finish made it 3-1, with Scott Fox saving Leigh Griffiths' penalty to book the Highlanders' place in the final.Not only was this a massive victory in its own right, but with County going on to beat Hibs in the final, it paved the way to their first major honour.Ross County have suffered a couple of four- and even a five-goal defeat at the hands of the Scottish champions, but October's 6-0 loss was a pride-denting moment for the team upon their return to the top division.Mohammed Elyounoussi opened the scoring and Celtic peppered the away goal with 21 more shots before the interval.County held out, but Celtic would score four goals in a nine-minute second-half blitz, with Elyounoussi, Odsonne Edouard (twice), Calum McGregor and James Forrest all netting after the interval."
sport	Callum Smith: 'Victory over John Ryder was right call but it is tough to improve scoring'	Who would want to judge?Know the score?Can tech gather punching power and numbers?'That was too close for comfort'	"World champion Callum Smith says he struggles to see a way judging can be improved after his world title defence against John Ryder.Smith defended his WBA world super-middleweight belt on Saturday, winning 116-112 116-112 117-111 on the cards.Ryder's trainer Tony Sims said the scoring was ""ridiculous"", while 5 Live's Mike Costello and Steve Bunce scored the contest a draw.""I watched it back to confirm what I thought - right decision,"" said Smith.Liverpool's Smith, 29, showed the effects of a tough battle as he spoke to BBC Sport, sporting stitches above his eye and a swollen hand which will be examined.In the aftermath of his win, tensions ran high at Liverpool's M&S Arena, with Eddie Hearn quizzed inside Ryder's changing room by former world champion Darren Barker, who told the promoter ""every single person"" on Twitter believed Smith had lost.Hearn said the scoring - which effectively judged Smith had won eight rounds to four on two cards and nine rounds to three on the other - was ""very poor"".Asked if he was deflated by the reaction to his 27th win from 27 fights, Smith told BBC Sport: ""A little bit. It's just criticism, no-one likes criticism. I made sure I watched it the next day.""It was my own fault for letting it be close but I thought the decision was right. I have my own goals, standards and have my own pressure. If I didn't think I had won, it would eat away at me.""Scoring in boxing is often hotly debated. In 2017 Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin shared a controversial draw, as did Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder last December.A fighter may land more punches on an opponent but be on the receiving end of a smaller number of more powerful blows - creating uncertainty on whether quantity or quality decides the outcome of the round.Judges are also asked to consider a boxer's defence and which fighter is the aggressor.Asked how scoring can be improved, Smith said: ""I just don't know what you can do. You could get younger judges or maybe ex-boxers to judge.""Even with ex-fighters as judges, it doesn't mean they can score a fight, you'd still end up with debate and opinion.""There's no praise for scoring a fight right, just criticism for one you get wrong.""We do need maybe younger or more experienced judges but where you can get them I don't know.""It's like in football, who would want to be a football referee? You'd just get criticism all the time.""In boxing it's always an opinion. For as long as it's a sport of opinion you can't prove anyone is cheating.""There's no VAR you can bring in, it's not that kind of sport. There have been many bad decisions. Will it ever change? I don't think so.""Hearn was also at a loss to find ways to progress judging in the sport after Saturday's bout and pointed to open scoring - where scores are made public during a fight - as one possible step forward.""The WBC do it, with scorecards after four rounds, after eight and then after 12,"" said Smith. ""Some like it, some don't. Just because they are announcing the scores it doesn't mean they will change.""Some fights would be like in amateur boxing where fighters have an early lead, their style would change and they can then run away and stay on their feet, which isn't exciting for the fans.""Bad decisions have been happening for years, amateur and pro. I wish they could sort scoring out, I just don't know if there's a way you can.""One way of removing the opinion involved in judging Smith references would be the use of technology.In September, a world title bout between Britain's Charlie Edwards and Julio Martinez was ruled a no contest after video replays showed the Mexican landing an illegal punch.But isolated incidents are likely to be easier to investigate in comparison to the frenetic blow-by-blow nature of scoring a round.The use of punch statistics gathered ringside are championed in some quarters and dismissed in others.In 2017, a British company detailed technology they hoped could one day be used in gloves that would offer data on the number and strength of punches a fighter lands.""Maybe that will come but if I land 10 scoring jabs in a round and then you hit me with five big power shots, who wins the round?"" adds Smith. ""I'd have landed more but yours were more telling.""Some judges like aggression, some like back-foot boxing. If everyone scored fights on aggression, Floyd Mayweather would not have had the career he had.""It comes down to what a judge likes, an opinion again. No one likes bad scoring. Most sports have a way around issues where as in boxing I don't think there is.""I was robbed of being a 2012 Olympian on a bad decision. I've been there. But you never enter the ring thinking you will be robbed. You think it will never happen to you.""Smith expects to have a scan on his injured hand on Wednesday and has been linked with fights against big names including Alvarez, Golovkin and Britain's Billy Joe Saunders.His team has dismissed the prospect of a rematch with Ryder as he now hopes to secure such glamour fights or contests against the other belt holders in the 168lb super-middleweight division.""I think the weekend confirmed to me and others that I need big fights, that fear factor,"" he added. ""If I turn up like I did on the weekend, the other champions beat me.""Letting this be as close as it was is a kick up the backside that nothing is ever straightforward. When I have underperformed I have been fortunate to get the win in my career. That was too close for comfort."""
sport	UK Championship: Judd Trump bridging the gap with snooker's greats	'Unplayable'	"Twelve months ago, with the UK Championship looming, Judd Trump was contemplating what he needed to do to reinvigorate a career teetering on brilliance, but too often falling just short.Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Steve Davis and John Higgins are assured of their place among snooker's greats.Trump was lagging some way behind, his tally of nine ranking titles an awkward mismatch given his undoubted, thrilling talents.Cue five ranking titles in a calendar year, including a first World Championship, a Masters title and the prestige of being number one in the world.""I can still play a little bit better,"" the world number one told BBC Sport after his latest ranking win at the Northern Ireland Open.Trump's ominous assessment shows a new-found determination, founded on sheer hard work and, more importantly, fun.""The fans seem to be loving it. I am enjoying my snooker and that is the key. And it shows in my performances,"" he added.""When you are world number one it is an amazing feeling being introduced; it gives you five or 10% more every time you go out.""Trump, who faces world number 127 Amine Amiri in the first round on Thursday, previewed last year's York trip by embracing the gathering criticism of his perceived under-achievements as a ""back-handed compliment"".He reasoned, that while still young and with plenty of ranking tournaments on the schedule, winning one ranking event a season before he retired would see him well into the 20s.As it transpired, things didn't go so well in York, with a quarter-final loss to Joe Perry. But with a pre-Christmas trip up north nearing again, the 30-year-old appears to be fast-tracking his way to legendary status.The now 14-time ranking event winner's latest success means he is eighth on the all-time list. O'Sullivan and Hendry lead on 36 apiece, with Higgins on 30 and Davis on 28.Media playback is not supported on this deviceTrump's awesome performance in defeating Higgins to win his first Crucible title in May and the standards he has maintained since have drawn praise from one of the men already seen as snooker royalty, seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry.""Against John Higgins in the world final Judd ""out-matched"" one of the best match players the sport has ever seen,"" Hendry told BBC Sport.""In the second session, he was almost unplayable in every area of the game. He can mix his game up with his safety play and also tear players apart.""Trump is the first, first-time world champion to win three ranking titles the following season since Hendry in 1990/91.""Stephen set some amazing records so any time you are mentioned alongside him, you know you have done something right,"" said the Bristolian, who beat another legend in Ronnie O'Sullivan to retain his title in Belfast.""It's a special place for me. It kickstarted my career again last year. It was a high-standard match; we played some real good stuff and played off each other.""It's a great feeling to be playing my best snooker on the biggest stage, not having to worry about going out there and embarrassing yourself.""When I am under pressure, I can produce that extra level I wasn't able to before. I have always enjoyed going for my shots, but I stepped that back a bit and concentrated on my safety play and now I am able to combine the both of them.""If Trump can continue his sensational form and win the UK Championship for the second time, he will hold all three major titles, following his Masters and Crucible success earlier this year.But he said it's crucial ""not to put too much pressure"" on winning.""I am probably going to go in as favourite along with Ronnie now, so it is important to play myself into the tournament and not get too carried away,"" he added. ""In the past, when I have put pressure on myself, I have ended up going out early.""I need to enjoy myself. York is always a nice place to be at this time of year with good crowds. It would be amazing to be able to top off the best spell of my career with another trophy."""

It is frustrating.""But I played very close to my best in the English Open. A lot of hard work seems to be paying off.""I am definitely going in the right direction.""Selby was a first-round loser against James Cahill in York last season, but a convincing 6-0 winner against Andy Hicks in this year's opening round on Wednesday.""I was a bit ropey at the start, a little bit edgy which is understandable because it's a big tournament,"" Selby said. ""And in the past couple of years I haven't really done that great here.""This is new territory for me, getting to the second round and the TV stage. Of course it's in the back of your mind.""The Leicester potter said Trump's wonderful form and rise to world number one brings a fear factor for those he faces.""It does count for a lot and carries a lot of weight,"" Selby said.""People go into matches against Judd, and against me when I was world number one and world champion, thinking 'it's a tough draw, he's won this and won that', so it does put a little bit of extra pressure on.""But when you are in your seat, it doesn't matter who you are; you can't do anything from your chair.""It is no surprise what he is achieving now. I have seen him since he was nine or 10 years old and he was just one for stardom. He was always going to achieve what he wanted to achieve if he put the work in."""

sport	Rugby World Cup 2019: Tournament will define the sport's direction in Japan	Japan shocked Springboks at 2015 tournament'A different beast'	"The next six weeks are likely to define the direction that rugby takes in Japan.Like any host nation, Japan wants to put its best foot forward and showcase all that is good about the country with the eyes of the sporting world watching on.However, there is an equal pressure on rugby to impress its hosts.It is an opportunity for the game to take its following to the next level in a country where it struggles for exposure.Nothing will grab the public's attention more than a strong showing from the hosts, and Saturday's game against Ireland is a perfect opportunity for Japan's team to launch the sport far deeper into the public consciousness than ever before.Taking down the team ranked second in the world would be something of a seminal moment for Japanese rugby, and it is a moment that the team are all too aware of.""For Japan Rugby's prosperity, we really need to win,"" admitted scrum coach Shin Hasegawa earlier this week.""There is a pressure to fulfil that expectation but we would also like to enjoy that pressure.""Japan's World Cup win against South Africa in 2015 remains arguably the most famous result of the professional era, and launched the country into the consciousness of rugby fans across the world.Four years on, the Brave Blossoms have an opportunity to repeat a similarly unlikely feat, only this time on home soil in front of what will be a sea of red and white at Shizuoka's 50,000-seater Ecopa Stadium.The Japanese team are coping with handling the pressure, something they admitted they did not do to the best of their ability in the opening win over Russia, of knowing that a good performance will secure a bright future for their sport internally, and also project a positive image of their country to those watching on around the world.""Right now this is a good trigger for Japan's people to find out how interesting and exciting rugby is,"" says Yohei Oyoshi, a reporter with western Japanese television channel MBS.""When we think about the competition of course we want Japan to win, but we also want all the teams to enjoy the atmosphere and have a good time here.""This is a very good opportunity to show the world how beautiful our country is, how safe it is and how friendly we are to anybody in the world.""Ireland have won all seven previous meetings between the sides, with the last two coming in 2017.The first of those victories came in the same stadium that will host Saturday's encounter, with Joe Schmidt's side running out comfortable 50-22 winners.""From two years ago they are definitely a different beast to what they are now,"" said Garry Ringrose, who scored one of Ireland's seven tries on that day two years ago.""We are under no illusions to how much stronger and how much better they are.""The physicality they brought was a big thing,"" said Ringrose, who was one of three players, alongside Keith Earls and Cian Healy, to retain their starting place from Ireland's last visit to Shizuoka.""After the game there were a few bumps and bruises and we had to try and regroup for the following week so it was incredibly physical.""With Scotland and Samoa facing each other on Monday, the winner of Saturday's encounter will take charge of Pool A at the midway point of the group stages.With a bonus point win already in the bag, defeat would not be terminal for either side.The future of rugby in Japan, or indeed the success of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, does not hinge on the quality of Saturday's game, but Japan are targeting a memorable performance that could send the sport into new dimensions of popularity within their country."

sport	Deontay Wilder: Is American boxing's biggest puncher?	'Goodnight written all over it'The biggest puncher ever?More than just a puncher...	"Deontay Wilder's ruthless knockout of Luis Ortiz has seen him branded a ""genius"" by a BBC Radio 5 Live Boxing team who think he just might be the most fearsome puncher for a generation.The American defended his WBC world heavyweight title for the 10th time by stopping Ortiz seven rounds into a bout the Cuban had dominated.The nature of the winning punch sent social media into overdrive, while Wilder claimed he was the ""hardest-hitting puncher in boxing history"".So is he? And are those who say his power compensates for a lack of ring craft off the mark?Wilder had lost five of the first six rounds on two of the judges' scorecards, and was 4-2 down on the other, when he thrust a right hand through Ortiz's guard to end the Las Vegas contest. He remains undefeated in 43 bouts, with 42 wins - 41 via knockout.BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello: ""The most attractive and compelling aspect of this sport is the knockout punch. Wherever you may rank Wilder in the history of knockout artists, we are living in the era of one of the great all-time punchers in this sport.""He had barely landed a clean punch and then that right hand. To quote what the referee, Mills Lane, once said about Mike Tyson: 'It had goodnight written all over it.'""BBC Radio 5 Live boxing analyst Steve Bunce: ""By midway in the seventh, hand on heart, I didn't think he was going to do it. He loses the first five rounds, kind of half wins the sixth, starts the seventh badly and I could not see that punch coming.""Knocking out people is an art. You can cuff people, whatever. Part of the artistry is you punch way through the target. The intended target for that right hand was about 12 inches or more the other side of Ortiz. No man can stand that. No beast could stand that.""Wilder, known as ""The Bronze Bomber"", was described as the biggest puncher in boxing history by Tyson Fury's trainer Ben Davison in the aftermath of his win over Ortiz. Fury's rematch against Wilder is set for 22 February, so is Davison right to say ""The Gypsy King"" will again share the ring with a man packing power the sport has not seen before?Costello: ""Edwin Valero, a Venezuelan lightweight, may argue otherwise given he had 27 knockouts from 27 bouts - but if we just look at heavyweights, Wilder's knockout rate is 95%. Mike Tyson was 75%, George Foreman 84%, Vitali Klitshcko 87% - Wilder is out on his own. Yes, you can argue about opposition, but he continues to find the chin.""He is the biggest puncher I have seen in my lifetime. The way I weigh it up is the reaction of his beaten opponents. When Ortiz hit the canvas he looked up with an expression on his face as if to say: 'Where did that come from?'""To be mentioned alongside Tyson and Foreman illustrates how we are in the company of a very special puncher.""Bunce: ""The man is a single-punch genius. He's more than a freak. It's not luck, he means everything he does.""If you analyse his 11 world title fights and put them against other people's runs, the big lad is walking with giants and more than holding his own.""Wilder has been criticised for a lack of ring craft and pure boxing skill, despite holding a world title for almost five years. Former world champion Tony Bellew posted on social media to say any lack of skill ""doesn't matter"", while Wilder's former promoter Lou DiBella called for an end to the talking down of the Alabama fighter's abilities.Costello: ""He moved Ortiz around, put his feet into place and drove through with the right hand. Having had so little success, he was still ready for when the opportunity came.""Our background in the sport is in the amateur code. He went to the Olympics in 2008 three years after taking up boxing. That is a feat in itself. He gets beaten by the Italian Clemente Russo at the Games, a man who beats Oleksandr Usyk. So there is amateur form there that suggests there is some pedigree.""As a pro he has taken on Tyson Fury and Luis Ortiz, two of the most skilled operators in the heavyweight division right now - supposedly the two most unsuitable opponents for a man who can't fight.""Not everybody fought stellar opposition in every single fight. If we get to the end of Wilder's career and he hasn't met an Anthony Joshua or an Andy Ruiz Jr, then we could say there are holes in that credibility.""Bunce: ""It is a misleading narrative that he has no skills. Sometimes he gets his feet tangled up but there are dozens of instances where he is moving his feet well. He is a lot more than a knockout artist."""
sport	Cardiff City: Boss Neil Harris says squad is 'too big'		"Cardiff City manager Neil Harris says some players will need to leave the club in January if he wants to make signings as his squad is ""too big.""The Bluebirds head to Nottingham Forest this weekend having collected four points from Harris' first two games.However, the boss admits he is expecting a balancing act in January.""What I do know is it is a big squad and before we bring anyone in, in January, players will have to leave,"" he told BBC Sport Wales.Harris, who succeeded Neil Warnock who left after three years in charge at the Cardiff City, says his squad size is proving problematic in training sessions.""We are getting better all the time (with fitness), the players out are getting closer, it is getting to the stage where it is tough to put on XI v XI because of the amount of bodies we've got, in some way it is too many, it is too big a squad,"" he added.""We work with it until January and then we start it there.""Harris admits fans will already be speculating as to what business the club will look to do but says he wants to give all his players an opportunity to impress.""As a football fan myself following various teams I know how fans think, you start piecing plans together 'well he's not played, he has played, is he going to go, is he going to stay' it is far too early for all of that,"" he added.""But it's what I am doing, I am sitting there thinking 'well I've not used him.' But it is nothing like that at the moment, everyone is getting an opportunity, because until you get everybody on the pitch, you just don't know about them.""Harris says he will be consulted over who replaces Andy Legg as Cardiff's under-23s manager. The Bluebirds announced Legg's departure last week.""I want to work with the next under-23s manager very, very closely,"" he said.""We want a free-flowing relationship between the academy and the first team.""The club is crying out for opportunities for the youngsters to come through. It's not going to be overnight because of the size of the first team squad.""But over the course of the next six to 12 months I want to see that pathway develop… the club and the fans want to see that as well. If they are good enough they will get the chance to play."""
sport	British sport accused of 'unacceptable' lack of ethnic diversity in boardrooms	Lack of diversity 'completely unacceptable'Lack of boardroom diversity 'doesn't represent the rest of society'	"The British sport sector has been accused of an ""unacceptable"" lack of ethnic diversity across its boardrooms.Research by UK Sport and Sport England revealed that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people account for just 5.2% of board members in 130 organisations they invest in despite statistics showing around 14% of UK population is BAME.The two funding agencies have now pledged to tackle the issue by developing a pool of experienced board candidates from a variety of backgrounds.The study also found that women now account for 40% of board members across funded sports, but for those with a disability, that figure was just 5%.The study also revealed that:""While the greater representation now being seen of women on boards is welcome, the overall picture of diversity in its broadest sense is completely unacceptable and requires practical action and greater, faster change,"" said Nick Bitel, the chairman of Sport England.""Organisations with diverse boards have diversity of thought. That means they make better decisions, are more successful, and crucially are better able to understand and reach the audiences we want to engage in sport and physical activity.""This is one of the most significant and concrete steps forward that Sport England has made in promoting inclusion across the sector and we're committed to continuing this work.""By mid-2021 Sport England and UK Sport want a network of 160 diverse board ready candidates to be in place. A specialist recruitment agency has been appointed to find experienced candidates from a variety of backgrounds including BAME, disabled and LGBT+ to help sport organisations recruit skilled and diverse board members.""There has been significant progress around the number of women serving on boards across the sport sector, and this is hugely encouraging,"" said Dame Katherine Grainger, chair of UK Sport.""But we are under no illusions that there is still a huge amount of work to do in the area of diversity. This is the latest step towards sport boards truly reflecting our diverse and multicultural society.""Two years ago sports bodies were told they must improve gender diversity, and have at least 30% female board representation, or risk losing pubic funding.Grainger told BBC Sport: ""It won't happen overnight, but this initiative is designed to start to shift the numbers, and if it doesn't shift then we'll talk about targets.""Grainger admitted she was ""surprised"" by the low numbers of BAME and disabled board members currently on boards, saying: ""It feels like a low number that doesn't represent the rest of society.""I want to see sport represented in the best possible way across the broadest background. That's not the situation right now and you want to make sure we get to a more representative place.""Many people look at these boards currently and don't see versions of themselves, and we need to get past that point.""A lack of diversity in governance and leadership positions has long been seen as a major problem in football.Earlier this month, former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany linked the issue with a failure to crackdown on racism.""If you don't have diversity in places of power like boardrooms, then you will not receive the correct penalties, that is the real problem,"" he told the Standard.Last month QPR director of football Les Ferdinand said that football had a ""massive unconscious bias"" against BAME executives.He told Training Ground Guru he owed his job to the fact that the club had an unusually diverse board.A report by anti-discriminatory body Fare in 2016 found that across European football, 0.6% of senior governance positions were held by ethnic minorities."
sport	Portstewart to host 2021 Irish Open when event will return to Northern Ireland		"The Irish Open will return to Northern Ireland in 2021 when Portstewart hosts the European Tour event for the second time in four years.The news was announced at the club's AGM on Thursday evening.Portstewart's members were told that discussions between the European Tour and the club resulted in an agreement being finalised last week.The Irish Open returned to Northern Ireland after a 59-year gap when it was played at Royal Portrush in 2012.The event proved to be a huge success as it attracted a then record attendance for a European Tour event.Three years later, the event was staged at Royal County Down before Portstewart was the host venue in 2017 when Spaniard Jon Rahm clinched the first of his two Irish Open victories.BBC golf commentator and former player Maureen Madill, who is an honorary life member of Portstewart Golf Club, welcomed the announcement and backed Graeme McDowell to be tournament host.""I grew up less than 10 minutes from the the first tee at Portstewart. It's a great course that will test the best players in the world, it's extremely scenic and you get a welcome like nowhere else,"" she said.""The blueprint of what the club worked to in 2017 will be very fresh in their mind. There are likely to be a few tweaks but probably not to the course as it was beautifully presented.""Graeme will love it as Portstewart will be set up very well for his type of game. It's very hard to be host and play as well but it has been done before and will be right up Graeme's street.""Royal Portrush's successful staging of the 2012 event helped convince the R&A to bring this year's Open Championship back to Northern Ireland for the first time in 68 years.The Open is expected to return to Royal Portrush over the next decade and Thursday's news surrounding the Irish Open will help to maintain the momentum of the sport in Northern Ireland, which is also aided by Rory McIlroy's exploits around the world.Next year's Irish Open will take place at Kilkenny venue Mount Juliet from 28-31 May."
sport	'Prince Andrew, Donald Trump, climate change and sexism - golf could show a lead'		"As one season ends and another begins, the European and Asian Tours have shown rare sensitivity and enlightened PR by postponing the opening tournament of their 2019-20 campaign.Major winners including Henrik Stenson, Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed would have been heading from the Middle East to the Far East this week, had the Hong Kong Open not been called off.The decision was taken in response to the ongoing civil unrest, with organisers unable to guarantee the safety of their players in the current climate.Furthermore, the sight of golfers competing for millions while, close by, violence flares in the name of democracy would be bad for the game's image.""Playing golf just down the road while Hong Kong burns is not a good look,"" said a high-ranking tour official.There was no other choice. But, it should be said, for golf this shows largely unaccustomed awareness to the sensitivities of the outside world.Most of the time, the sport seems to exist unencumbered by the everyday stresses of life. Indeed it is there primarily to offer an escape from such demands.Sunday's thrilling climax to the Race to Dubai, when Jon Rahm holed the winning putt on the 72nd green, was a fantastic diversion. A five-footer for $5m is hardly the stuff of the real world, but it made for great sporting theatre.But it also prompted a thought-provoking social media post from French filmmaker Sandra Mesrine, a Birmingham-based golf enthusiast, responding to the vast sums that were up for grabs in Dubai.""Golf professional culture is not very attractive,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""Top models [as] girlfriends, materialist lifestyle and no commitment towards issues such as racism, social segregation, environmental issues, etc makes the sport look very superficial indeed. This is so bothering.""Many would dispute her opinions. After all, golf is a source of great enjoyment for millions of people across the globe. But her perception of the game is hard to ignore.It is an uncomfortable fact that golf opens itself up to criticism from the wider community. For many, the sport is, at best, an eccentric, quirky pursuit and, at worst, a home for elitism in its worst guises.And it is easy to see why this is the case when so often the game shies away from the main issues of the day.Yes, it has reacted to the worrying times in Hong Kong but where does it stand on the Duke of York, a prominent golfing figure embroiled in a high-profile scandal?Where does it stand on climate change, on more equal remuneration for top female players, or the racial imbalance among its playing community?While businesses and charities have wasted little time in distancing themselves from Prince Andrew for his association with a convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, golf has said and done very little.As he stepped away from public life, the Queen's second son had no fewer than 27 affiliations to the royal and ancient game. For years he has been a regular inside the ropes at The Open.Royal Portrush, which staged the championship this year, is to discuss his role as patron of the club and Royal Liverpool, which stages the 2022 Open, expressed similar sentiments.But there has been little word from the R&A, one of the sport's governing bodies. The Duke is a member of the St Andrews-based Royal and Ancient Golf Club and was captain in 2004 for its 250th anniversary.When BBC Sport contacted the club, it indicated that while the Duke is a member, he does not carry out any duties for the club.Golf does not always think the same way as other organisations who feel a need to distance themselves from figures who become toxic in the public eye.The sport tends to drag its feet rather than get ahead of the game. It does not go out of its way to inform the public of modern thinking.Why, for example, is there no sign of The Open returning to a US President Donald Trump-owned Turnberry? Better not to say.How long before the wider world starts to ask uncomfortable questions about golf's carbon footprint?It surely does not want to fall behind Jeremy Clarkson, the latest convert to the need for a greener world, on such matters - does it?Only last week, Rory McIlroy quipped that he no longer needs boarding passes for his flights. It was a nice line that among a golf audience raised a laugh rather than eyebrows.Like so many top players, the United States-based Northern Irishman can well afford to fly around the world in a private jet.McIlroy does plenty in his own quiet way to help the world, but what does he do to offset the impact of his preferred method of travel? It may be plenty, but it is not something he publicly addresses.It is also a sport that exists with female players earning a tiny fraction of what their male counterparts make.Yes, market forces and all that, but to a world more and more aware of inequality in the workplace, how does that make golf look?The R&A seeks to narrow the gap by inflating the Women's British Open prize fund, but it is nowhere near the equality regime that exists at the tennis Grand Slams.Golf is one of those sports reluctant to become embroiled in awkward discussions. The nearest you get is professional players fearing the state of post-election tax bills.Political activism is not on their agenda. There is no taking the knee for members of US Ryder Cup teams. Mind you, many of the top names are happy to have a game with President Trump every now and again.Yes, these are scattergun observations - Prince Andrew, climate change, sexism and Trump - but in none of these instances does golf show a genuine, effective lead, nor does it provide evidence that it is a truly progressive pursuit in the modern world.But at least at the start of a new season, they are sensitive enough not to play in Hong Kong this week."

Everyone is talking about the memories from last year and what it would be like to lift the trophy again.""Until Mulholland's last-gasp goals, it had looked like a second-half strike from Megan Bell was going to win the trophy for the Blues.Linfield captain Kirsty McGuinness remembers the pain of that defeat well and is determined to come out on the winning side on Saturday.""Last year hurt a lot - going 1-0 up and losing 2-1 is not great for a cup final,"" she said.""That definitely is an incentive for this year when hopefully it will be the opposite and we will be the ones lifting the trophy at the end of the 90 minutes.""Every match we have played against them this season has been really tight, apart from the first game which we won 3-0.""We are two big teams with a long, long rivalry and I'm expecting there to be great battle on the pitch.""There was a great crowd and atmosphere at last year's final, which was brilliant for the game, and hopefully Saturday night will be the same.""Linfield are still in contention for a league and cup double with the last round of fixtures in the Women's Premiership being played on Wednesday.They are three points behind leaders Sion Swifts but, with the Strabane outfit having played all their games, a win for the Blues by seven goals or more away to Derry City would secure them the title."

The Warwickshire man has been in sparkling form for the Bears this summer, earning him a first England call-up for the winter tour of New Zealand.Two of his five Championship centuries came in a victorious effort against Nottinghamshire in Warwickshire's penultimate fixture, including a second double-hundred of the summer, to cement his position as the leading run-scorer in Division One.In fact, the 24-year-old began the final round of fixtures as the only Division One player to have scored more than 1,000 runs in this season's County Championship.830 runs, average 43.68, one centuryAlastair Cook has been a model of consistency at the top of the Essex order in his first season since retiring from international duty.The 34-year-old has scored six fifties to add to his solitary hundred, and is on the brink of helping Essex to their second Championship title in three seasons.1,114 runs, average 65.52, five centuriesIt has been quite a summer for Marnus Labuschagne, who started it plundering runs for Glamorgan in Division Two and ended it helping Australia retain the Ashes.Labuschagne passed 50 in 10 of his 18 innings for Glamorgan and translated that form to Test cricket, starting the final three Tests of the Ashes series against England after replacing Steve Smith as a concussion substitute at Lord's.He scored 353 runs in his seven Test innings, including four fifties.958 runs, average 50.42, three centuriesSam Northeast last appeared in this list while with Kent in 2016 and you will struggle to find many more dependable County Championship batsmen than the 29-year-old right-hander.He began the final round of fixtures as the third-highest run-scorer in Division One behind Sibley and Yorkshire's Gary Ballance, while Northeast also stood in as captain while James Vince was in England's World Cup squad.His contributions put Hampshire in a position to start their final match against Kent knowing victory would secure third place in the table.933 runs, average 46.65, four centuriesIt is less than two years since Dawid Malan was scoring an Ashes hundred in Perth and, although his first foray into the Test arena was a relatively brief one, the Middlesex captain has showed his qualities once more with an excellent summer in county cricket.His highlight was a career-best 199 against Derbyshire in July, but there is sure to be disappointment that he has been unable to lead the 2016 champions back to the top tier and they will begin a third successive season in Division Two in 2020.1,018 runs, average 84.83, three centuries; 46 catches, one stumpingLancashire have had no such trouble in returning to Division One of the County Championship and captain Dane Vilas has played a pivotal role in their title success.The South African is responsible for the highest individual score of the Championship season - 266 off just 240 balls against Glamorgan in August - and began the final round of games with a batting average nudging 85.Behind the stumps, only Ben Brown of Sussex has been involved in more Division Two dismissals than the Lancashire wicketkeeper.957 runs, average 63.80, four centuries; 50 wickets, average 23.64Zimbabwe-born Ryan Higgins has been one of the standout all-rounders in county cricket this summer.A career-best 199 against Leicestershire was among his tally of centuries, while the 24-year-old seamer passed the 50-wicket mark for the season with an eight-wicket match haul against Worcestershire in Gloucestershire's penultimate fixture.448 runs, average 29.86, one century; 51 wickets, average 15.49Lewis Gregory earned his first call-up into an England Test squad in July and, while he was not involved in the one-off game against Ireland, it was just reward for one of the heartbeats of the Somerset dressing room.The 27-year-old has impressed with bat and ball during their title chase, which climaxes against fellow contenders Essex this week.78 wickets, average 18.11South African spinner Simon Harmer has appeared in BBC users' team of the season at the end of all three of his years in English county cricket.The 30-year-old began the final week of the season as the leading wicket-taker in either division of the County Championship.He has returned nine five-wicket hauls and has twice taken 10 wickets in a match, including figures of 12-61 in a two-day win over Hampshire in June.Throw in the fact that he captained Essex to their first ever domestic T20 trophy, hitting the winning boundary off the last ball of the T20 Blast final against Worcestershire, and it has been another season to remember for Harmer.68 wickets, average 15.70Somerset batsmen are still having nightmares about facing South African pace bowler Kyle Abbott.He dominated Hampshire's penultimate game of the summer, ending with match figures of 17-86 - the best ever by a Hampshire bowler and the fourth-best in the history of the County Championship.That performance alone could have been enough to earn him selection, but it has otherwise been another solid summer for Abbott, who was also named in BBC users' team of the 2017 season.69 wickets, average 18.42Few things are certain in life; death, taxes, Steve Smith centuries and Chris Rushworth being the scourge of opening batsmen in the County Championship.The 33-year-old seamer began the final round of games leading the way in the ""Division Two wickets"" column with 69, including four five-wicket hauls.Defeat at Northamptonshire ended Durham's promotion hopes with one match remaining, but Rushworth's experience is sure to be key if they are to end their exile from the top flight at the fourth time of asking in 2020."

sport	Carl Frampton says he 'must' beat Tyler McCreary to stay in world title frame	Frampton aims to regroup after 'horrible year'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceNorthern Ireland boxer Carl Frampton says defeat will not be an option against unbeaten American Tyler McCreary in Las Vegas on Saturday.Frampton, 32, faces his first bout since losing an IBF world featherweight title challenge against England's Josh Warrington last December.""It's a must-win. I want to fight for a world title in my next fight so I must beat Tyler McCreary,"" he said.McCreary is 11th in the WBA lightweight rankings after 17 unbeaten contests.That is two places higher than Frampton's fellow Belfast fighter James Tennyson in the WBA lightweight list although McCreary was previously ranked fifth in the governing body's featherweight ratings.McCreary, 26, drew with Mexican journeyman Roberto Castaneda in March before edging a split decision in July against Filipino Jessie Cris Rosales, who had been stopped by WBO featherweight champion Shakur Stevenson back in January.While Frampton's connections having been talking up the Ohio-based boxer's credentials, the Northern Irishman should prove too good for the American.Frampton will be looking for an emphatic victory after what he has described as a ""horrible year"".His legal battle with ex-manager Barry McGuigan is scheduled to continue in the Belfast High Court in the New Year. The fighter is suing his former mentor, his wife Sandra McGuigan and Cyclone Promotions (UK) Ltd over an alleged failure to pay purse money from his bouts.The McGuigan family-run Cyclone Promotions issued a writ in London which formed the basis of a counter-claim against Frampton.Back in August, Frampton was scheduled to return to the ring against Emmanuel Dominguez in Philadelphia before a freak accident - when a large ornament was knocked over in a hotel - led to him pulling out with a broken hand.""I've had some huge fights in my career. No matter who the opponent is, it is always going to be the biggest fight because of the situation I'm in now,"" said Frampton in Las Vegas.""He thinks I have been overlooking him. Maybe that gives him some comfort and encouragement. But I have been treating this fight as if it is a world title fight.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt will be Frampton's first appearance in the United States since January 2017, when he suffered his first career defeat as Mexico's Leo Santa Cruz reclaimed the WBA featherweight crown with a majority decision at the MGM Grand.However, the Belfast fighter is confident victory on Saturday will set him on the road to becoming Ireland's first three-weight world champion after his previous super-bantamweight and featherweight title triumphs.""Ireland has a rich history in boxing champions,"" he said. ""We've produced so many great fighters.""But to be the guy on top and be the first and only guy to win three titles in three different divisions, it would mean the world to me.""McCreary's four-inch height advantage was noticeable during Friday evening's weigh-in as Frampton came in at 128lbs.However, Frampton will believe that his boxing skills should be enough to overcome the 26-year-old."
sport	Swim England: Keeping swimmers in the classroom and getting youngsters in the pool	Coaching the coach and developing the individualPrimary concern	"From tackling some startling statistics about primary school swimming to helping develop future Olympians through university link-ups, Swim England has a wide remit.With the Olympic Games looming in Tokyo next year, the focus on Great Britain's prospects in the pool is intensifying.But the work around the edges, trying to ensure there is a better structure for all swimmers to reach their potential, as well as addressing a worrying situation which sees thousands of children leave primary school each year unable to swim 25 metres, is ongoing.Nova Centurion in Nottingham is one of six Performance Centres with links to universities following a scheme that was introduced just over a year ago. The simple aim is to strike the balance between studying and high-quality swim training.The centres provide flexible studies, professional coaching, sports science and medicine support - as well as the swimming facilities.What starts out as learning a vital life skill with a toddler's first tentative strokes in a paddling pool can lead to peaking on the biggest stage, as Adam Peaty and Becky Adlington will testify.Double Olympic champion and four-time medallist Adlington, formerly of Nova, told BBC Sport that ""linking with universities is a great idea"".She said: ""Any help to keep swimmers motivated and supported has to be a good thing. Swimming can often stop at university because of the time pressures.""It's an intense sport. There are so many weekends when you can't do normal things, go to the cinema or go out with your mates. You are training before and after school and it's vital that you get that help and support because it takes over.Media playback is not supported on this device""Communication with your school when you are a teenager is vital and having more help through university is the next step.""Adlington, who won two gold medals at Beijing 2008 and two bronzes at London 2012, is still very much involved in the sport.""I love commentating on elite athletes with the International Swimming League and working for the BBC and I love working at the grass roots [with Learn to Swim and her Swim Stars programme],"" she said.""But it's tough for youngsters at all ages. They still need to enjoy it.""Retaining a love of the sport can be tricky when you are struggling to balance training and education and Adlington believes those ""on the cusp"" of making it need all the support they can get, as does Grant Robins, Swim England's head of talent.He believes the Performance Centres at High Wycombe, Leeds, Guildford, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield will help keep people in the sport longer, but is not expecting a ""quick-fix thing"".Robins explained: ""There's a distinct dropout of swimmers at various ages along their journey - one is GCSEs, one is A Levels, and then it's coping with university studies.""There is definitely a need for education and sport to align themselves. The idea was to set up some centres, sympathetic to studying and training, that they could naturally go to when they finish their A levels.""It's going to take a while. This year is the first cohort of potential people looking at universities as a swimmer, but you've got to build up some trust, you've got to build up some reputation.""The feeling was that outside of the two national centres at Bath and Loughborough, there were not many options for elite swimmers, or those aspiring to be elite swimmers, to stay in the sport - and study.""There's world-class swimmers who can go to Bath or Loughborough but there's also some good swimmers trying to get to world-class,"" Robins added.""There's more options because of finance to go abroad - to the United States - but that doesn't work very well for us. They go to the States and then we never see them again.""One coach helping address that talent drain is Nova director of coaching Nathan Hilton.Hilton swam at national level, but stopped competing at the age of 19 to start coaching part-time, while also working as a quantity surveyor.He went full-time in 2005 and has been in his current role at Nova since April 2014, having been head coach to Team GB's Youth Olympic teams in Singapore 2010 & Nanjing, China 2014 as well as various European & World Junior Championships.And the 40-year-old welcomes the notion of ""strategically-placed bases"" and says it is already showing signs of bearing fruit.""It's filling the post A level void,"" he added.""We have a lad who came in last summer, Michael Rees. He is at university in Nottingham and developing well. In three or four years' time he could be a standout athlete.""It's as good as it has ever been and one of the main challenges now is making people aware of the system that is in place - and that the calibre of athlete we have coming into the programmes is good.""It has certainly helped develop the senior end of the programmes.""Bringing on the next generation requires far more than just having the best facilities and a well-mapped pathway.""Coaching is a tough job, you've got to love it,"" Robins added. ""You've got so many fingers in different pies. Ultimately they're trying to make the experience for swimmers as positive and beneficial as possible.""We're trying to build the person, and the person needs to contribute to society later on in life, so while it's a swimming initiative we're creating a human being as well.""Nathan seems to balance that better than most. He is relatively young, but well and truly experienced.""That's partly why we chose Nottingham to be a Performance Centre. Ultimately as a swimmer you buy into the coach. People go to Nottingham to swim for Nathan because they believe he will be able to make that difference.""But Swim England's focus is not just about developing the elite.There are various camps across the age groups for counties, regions and at national and international level, with coach development, support services, sports science and back-up services. Up to 2,000 swimmers are engaged in the programmes.""We are trying to get people off the sofa into a swimming pool. We are trying to make people go to the Olympics, and everything in between,"" Robins said.""There are 1,100 clubs in the country, there are around 30,000 registered swimmers. We go from Learn to Swim up to Performance Centres and so on.""It's a one-stop shop for all your aquatic needs. It educates people; we have a certification process for coaches and teachers, we are in partnership with RNLI, so it's a life skill and life saving. Whether it's swimming, diving, synchro water polo, open water swimming, there is a touch point that Swim England has for the sport and water.""And there is a huge rehabilitation purpose of swimming that doctors and the NHS like, so it is becoming more and more wide-ranging.""It's got bigger and bigger and the organisation has changed its ways to cope with the market forces.""Worryingly, though, figures included in the recently published Value of Swimming report, show that about 138,000 children leave primary school each year unable to swim the statutory 25m. That works out as 23 per cent, or almost one in four.The report, which was commissioned by Swim England, also says that swimming ability is affected by location. Only 45 per cent of children and young people going to school in the most deprived areas of the country can swim 25 metres, compared to 76 per cent in better off areas.However, children are actually faring better than adults in England, with as many as one in three of them unable to swim one length of a 25m pool.Swimming has been on the national school curriculum for 25 years, but Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said the system is ""failing our children"" and the government must take swimming seriously and invest in new facilities.She continued: ""We have to really push this. It shouldn't be about barriers. There has to be access to pools.""It's not about finger-pointing, it's about how we can make this work and how we can make it affordable.""It's not doom and gloom, but it is absolutely ridiculous - if one in four children left school not being able to read or write there would be uproar.""Learn To Swim is about making sure children can be around the water at an early age. We are working closely with the government and beginning to chip away at this. School swimming is a major focus for next year.""Other key messages from the Value Of Swimming report show swimming and water-based activity is helping to save the health and social care system more than £357m a year, that 4.7m adults in Britain swim at least twice a month and that it has a positive impact with positive changes on mental wellbeing, reducing both anxiety and depression.""I'll continue to bang the drum for swimming to ensure we get a nation swimming and maximise the number of people enjoying all the benefits,"" added Nickerson.""Swimming opens up so many avenues. For all he has achieved, Adam Peaty still loves it and has fun. but it's also about millions of others who enjoy it too."""

Two years ago he was leading the Levi slalom after the first run before a mistake near the bottom of the course.There are 12 slalom races on the World Cup calendar with Ryding next set to race in Val d'Isere, France, on 15 December."
sport	Usada chief calls for complete ban of Russian athletes from Olympics	Analysis	"The World Anti-Doping Agency ""must get tougher"" and ban all Russian athletes from competing at the Olympics, says US Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart.World Athletics, formerly the IAAF, has halted Russia's reinstatement after senior officials were suspended for anti-doping rule breaches.Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015.Some athletes have been able to compete under a neutral status, including at the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics.""Wada must get tougher and impose the full restriction on Russian athlete participation in the Olympics that the rules allow,"" said Tygart.""Only such a resolute response has a chance of getting Russia's attention, changing behaviour, and protecting today's clean athletes who will compete in Tokyo, as well as future generations of athletes in Russia who deserve better than a cynical, weak response to the world's repeated calls for Russia to clean up its act.""It is sad when a country's athletes suffer for the fraud of the governmental and sport system they represent. However, the failure to stand up to Russia's five-year flaunting of the rules would cause even more harm to athletes in and outside of Russia. The time for the toughest penalty available is now.""Last week, Wada's compliance review committee (CRC) recommended a raft of measures - including banning Russia from hosting and competing in major international events - after declaring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) non-compliant over inconsistencies in anti-doping data.Wada's executive committee will consider the recommendations and make the final decision at a meeting in Paris on 9 December.Athletes have not been able to compete for Russia since November 2015 after state-sponsored doping was uncovered. Under the terms of the ban, athletes who have met World Athletics' doping review board's drug-testing criteria can compete under a neutral flag.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has demanded the ""toughest sanctions"" against Russia but would be willing to allow clean athletes to compete under a neutral flag again.""Russia continues to flaunt the world's anti-doping rules, kick clean athletes in the gut and poke Wada in the eye and get away with it time and time again,"" Tygart added.""Wada must stand up to this fraudulent and bullying behaviour as the rules and Olympic values demand. The response proposed by the CRC is inadequate, especially given the deceit perpetuated by the Russian sport system which is controlled by the government.""History has taught us the response to Russian doping used in Rio 2016 and Pyeongchang 2018 - in which a secretly managed process permitted Russians to compete - did not work.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceRussian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov - the former head of Moscow's anti-doping laboratory - has also called for harsher punishments.""The Russian gangster state continues to deploy a predictable and deplorable policy of deception, evidence tampering and lying to cover up its crimes,"" his lawyers said in a statement.""The Kremlin must think the people of the world are idiots to believe this shameless and transparent stunt.""Wada should be applauded for revealing Russia's latest crime, but if the IOC and the international sports regulatory framework gives Russia yet another free pass, other countries will simply follow in their footsteps.""BBC sports editor Dan RoanAll the signs are that, on 9 December, Wada's leadership will accept the recommendation of its compliance panel and cast Russia into the international sporting wilderness.For the second successive Olympic Games, and in many other major events, for the next four years, there would be no official Russia team, with athletes forced to compete as neutrals and only after passing eligibility checks. Given the scale of cheating and deception, many critics will argue a blanket ban on all Russian athletes would be a more appropriate punishment.But even though almost five years have now passed since the Russian doping scandal was first exposed, this is unlikely be the end of the story. Russia is expected to appeal via the Court of Arbitration for Sport and argue that individuals acting on behalf of the state - rather than its sports authorities - were responsible for the audacious manipulation and deletion of data, and therefore athletes should not be punished.Do not be surprised therefore if the build-up to another Olympics is overshadowed by further twists in what has arguably become the gravest scandal in sports history."
sport	UK Championship: James Cahill defeat leaves David Gilbert wanting to 'smash up cue'	'Waiting for Santa to come'	"World number 11 David Gilbert said he wanted to ""smash up his cue"" after losing to 118th-ranked James Cahill in the UK Championship first round.Gilbert, 38, trailed his fellow Englishman 2-0 and 4-3 before levelling at 4-4 with his second century.But Cahill, who beat Mark Selby at the York Barbican last year and stunned Ronnie O'Sullivan at the World Championship in May, rallied to win.""I just love playing against the best players,"" the 23-year-old said.He lost his professional status in 2017 but won back his tour card at the start of the season, following his spectacular win over five-time world champion O'Sullivan at the Crucible.However, Cahill, from Blackpool, had only won one match this season before his victory over Gilbert, losing to many of the world's best players, including Judd Trump, Mark Williams and Mark Allen.""I have maybe tried too hard since the Worlds and maybe put too much pressure to get to where I think I should be,"" he said. ""But I have had quite a lot of tough draws.""I have not had a great season so far but have been playing some good stuff and am glad it showed out there.""When you are not winning a lot it's harder to get over the line. Winning breeds winning and hopefully I can get back to winning ways.""Tamworth potter Gilbert, a four-time ranking event runner-up and semi-finalist at the World Championship last season, said there were ""no positives"" after losing to a player ranked 107 below him in the world.The 38-year-old has only ever reached the fourth round once in seven appearances, having also lost in qualifying on 10 occasions.""I love this tournament but I can't win a game in it,"" he added, lamenting a couple of ""terrible shots"" in the final two frames.""He played all right. Fair play to him. I've just got no bottle. That's why I can't win anything.""He's about 120 in the world and every other top-16 player has probably got a walkover. I was a bit unfortunate that I got a lad that fancies winning.""It's a great tournament and a great arena and I want to be a part of it but somehow I can't win a match here.""I just want to go and smash my cue up and wait for Santa to come."""
sport	Davis Cup: What worked, what didn't & what needs to change	The star names sprinkle stardust on the new finalsDifferent format, same emotions stirredEmpty seats for most matches - give them to the kids?A second venue in Madrid would prevent 4am finishesToo focused on TV fans and not those there?	"With Rafael Nadal falling flat on his back on the baseline, his triumphant team-mates running on court to pile on top of him and a partisan home stadium rocking with pride, it was a familiar scene as Spain lifted the Davis Cup.Yet, while the celebrations were similar to many we have seen in previous years, the host nation's first success since 2011 came at the end of a very different week in Madrid.Unlike in the past, Spain's victory over Canada was not the only Davis Cup tie to take place in November as the tournament culminated. Instead it was the end of an 18-nation finals self-styled as the 'World Cup of Tennis'.The football-style knockout tournament, a bold concept conceived and financially backed by Barcelona defender Gerard Pique and his Kosmos investment group, faced a barrage of criticism before it had even started.And, as with any new event, especially one of such size and stature, there were teething problems in the Spanish capital.But there were also many memorable moments in what proved to be a high-quality tournament on the court.Here, BBC Sport analyses what worked in the new-look finals, what perhaps didn't and the lessons that must be learned before next year's event.For years, the common consensus had been the 119-year competition needed to change.Top players, worried about burn out on the punishing ATP Tour, were regularly not turning out to play in a 16-team world group that saw home and away ties spread over four weekends throughout the year.Pique, a tennis fan said to have been a promising junior player, was the catalyst for change.But his intervention, and the changing of a tradition which had existed in the previous format since 1981, was not welcomed by tennis die-hards, including the most recognisable player on the planet.Swiss great Roger Federer resisted the change and urged that the competition should not become the ""Pique Cup"".While the 20-time Grand Slam champion was not present in Madrid after Switzerland failed to qualify three of the other 'Big Four' did play.Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were the star names present as 11 of the world's top 20 singles players also appeared at the event. Russian world number four Daniil Medvedev and German world number seven Alexander Zverev were the only members of the world's top 10 who pulled out in spite of their nations qualifying.The presence of so many key players was seen as an encouraging sign by Pique and ITF chief David Haggerty.""When we started a few years ago with the project of the new format, what we wanted basically was that the top players participate in the competition. I think that was a fact,"" Pique said.""You saw here the top players playing and representing their countries.""Whether that will continue to be the case largely depends if a merger with January's 24-nation ATP Cup - created by the men's tour and attracting all the top-ranked players except Federer - can ever be agreed to avoid a situation where two men's team events take place within close proximity of each other.Try telling those competing in Madrid - and their compatriots who had spent time and money travelling there - that the new format had devalued the competition as some suggested.World number one Nadal tore around the Caja Magica as he won all eight of his singles and double rubbers to inspire the Spanish.Novak Djokovic along with the entire Serbia team were left close to tears following a dramatic quarter-final loss to Russia. In an emotional news conference post match, Djokovic's doubles partner Viktor Troicki - who played a woeful third-set tie-break - said he felt ""the worst ever"" after been given the chance to ""be the hero, only for God to take it away"".Former world number one Andy Murray was contorted with nervous emotion as he watched his older brother Jamie and Neal Skupski try to put their nation into the final by beating Nadal and Feliciano Lopez in a decisive doubles rubber.And try telling Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut, who was left in tears after winning his singles rubber against Canada three days after the death of his father, that representing his country was still not of significant pride and honour.Fears the emotion could be sucked out of the competition proved wide of the mark, although it remains to be seen what a finals weekend without the host nation competing would look like.Patriotism was not in short supply in the stands either.Clearly that peaked during the Spanish ties where the Caja Magica stands were a sea of red-and-yellow flags as the partisan home crowd, encouraged to make noise by a jaunty brass band and a man barking out instructions through a football terrace-style megaphone, willed their team towards a first Davis Cup triumph since 2011.That understandably gave those matches a flavour of the 'old' Davis Cup - and an advantage to Spain.While some other teams were well backed - notably Great Britain, Canada and Kazakhstan, thanks to the help of their national federation - other matches were played out in half-full arenas.Even Saturday's first semi-final between Canada and Russia saw huge swathes of empty red seats.The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) offered 875 free tickets to British fans for the semi-final against Spain - at a cost of about £60,000 - and British captain Leon Smith thinks there should be an arrangement between organisers and the governing bodies of all 18 finalists to subsidise support in the future.""The most important thing about Davis Cup is obviously trying to maintain the atmosphere,"" he said.""Why doesn't that become the norm that there's X amount of investment given to each federation to get a core group of fans?""Spain's two group games and Sunday's final were the only ties to officially sell out the 12,500 capacity Manolo Santana court, according to the tournament's online ticket portal.""I do think the organisers missed an opportunity there by not giving the unsold tickets to schoolchildren and getting them in to watch the matches,"" British player Jamie Murray said in his BBC Sport column.""That would have been a good idea and would have exposed young kids - the future of the sport as potential players and fans - to tennis.""While Spanish custom dictates the nation generally stays awake until the early hours, a major problem which arose was ridiculously late finishes in some matches with ties outlasting all but the most nocturnal of fans.The group tie between the United States and Italy was the most startling, eye-rubbing example, finally ending at 04:04 local time to become the second latest finish in top-level tennis history behind Lleyton Hewitt's win over Marcos Baghdatis at the 2008 Australian Open which ended at 4:33am.""We expect that some games will be finished late, but obviously 4am was too late,"" Pique said.""That day all the games, they were very long.""But we will have to be more creative in the future. I think this is not a big issue. It's something we have to think how we do it.""Britain's Jamie Murray has suggested the finals should be split across two venues in Madrid next year, enabling one court to host one tie every day rather than two sessions.When asked if the Spanish capital's WiZink Center could be used next year, or where a fourth court could be built at the Caja Mágica, Pique said both options ""are right now are on the table"".Between 800 and 1,000 British fans roared their team on in each of their four matches, with some staying for the whole week in the hope of seeing the 2015 champions end victorious again.The majority of supporters appeared to savour the sense of occasion that mixing with fans from all over the world brought, although a large portion still bemoaned the loss of the previous home-and-away format.""It is a fantastic atmosphere, we've talked to people from loads of different countries,"" said Pam Flatman, who flew over from Norfolk with husband Wayne and their friend Mac Boreham. ""It brings people together and from that perspective it's a good thing.""One common gripe among fans of all nationalities was they felt the tournament was more geared towards the needs of armchair fans than those actually in Madrid.""There are no screens dotted around, so there is no information from the other matches,"" said Mac. ""At Wimbledon you know what's happening but here you know nothing.""Pam added: ""Scoreboards and TVs outside in the concourses are necessary - and more outside heaters because the Madrid winter can be very chilly. It's been freezing standing out here.""The tournament also ended with a tinge of disappointment for fans at the venue. Spain lifted the trophy with many supporters having already left the arena, unwilling to sit through an unnecessarily elaborate and time-consuming setting up of the presentation stage.Those trying keeping up-to-date with the action from afar reported a series of issues.Technological glitches surfaced on the official Davis Cup finals information channels - including website, mobile app and stadium televisions - which ranged from comical errors to more serious issues of fan engagement.While British number one Dan Evans' profile featuring a faceless image instead of a photograph like everyone else was not the end of the world, nor was Germany's team page describing Zverev - absent and a harsh vocal critic - as the 'star of the their team', the fundamental ability to update scores and competing players correctly was a failure.Often, the scores of matches were wrong and slow to update, while Britain were apparently represented by Argentine Guido Pella in their quarter-final against Germany.Selling television rights proved to be a problem in some major markets, with the tournament not shown on a major American broadcaster and only being available to British television audience at a late stage when Eurosport stepped in to secure the rights.Another peculiarity was the decision to set up new Twitter and Instagram accounts under the 'Davis Cup finals' banner rather than use the existing Davis Cup accounts which have a combined 500,000 followers.Although the behind-the-scenes content was excellent - fun, interactive and engaging - and retweeted by the main Davis Cup accounts in a bid to build the brand, the new accounts only had a combined 60,000 followers which leads a suspicion that reach was not as wide as it could have been.""Our vision is to make sure this is seen in as many places by as many people and followed around the world. That's something that, again, is something we can improve,"" Pique added."

sport	Steve Bruce: Have we underestimated Newcastle manager?	How does he compare to Benitez so far?Do the front three deserve more praise?Does this result raise optimism?	"Newcastle fans aren't yet chanting his name, but the noise that shook St James' Park in the 88th minute on a bright and crisp Saturday must have sounded as good to manager Steve Bruce.He and his backroom team jumped in unison when goalscorer Jonjo Shelvey and the rest of the team ran over to the dugout to celebrate the late equaliser that secured a 2-2 draw only minutes after it seemed Kevin de Bruyne had won the game for City.The joy on Bruce's face at the final whistle was in great contrast to his demeanour after his first game in charge of his boyhood club, when they lost 1-0 to Unai Emery's Arsenal following an uninspiring display in early August.Then it was a wet and dreary occasion. A day when the fans, whose cherished manager Rafael Benitez had left them for China, protested against the ownership outside the stadium and also stayed away.Bruce was then short odds to become the first Premier League manager to lose his job, but he remains and enhanced his reputation on Tyneside while Emery has gone.So did we underestimate Bruce? And how far could he take the club?For some Newcastle supporters, Bruce succeeding Benitez seemed like just another insult during a disappointing summer in which their hopes of hanging on to the Spaniard and talks of a takeover from the Middle East vanished in a matter of weeks.For Bruce, a proud Geordie, this was his dream gig. But among the 33 managers to have managed 200 or more Premier League games in charge, his win percentage of 28.1% (110 games in 392 games) was the second-lowest. And he had previously managed Sunderland, which to the staunch Magpies fan was a big no-no.The disillusionment, all too apparent during the protests against the ownership before the Arsenal match, grew after the 3-1 loss at 'relegation rivals' Norwich. The home crowds that were averaging over 51,000 last season were now about 45,000.But then strange results began to pop up. The wins over Tottenham and Manchester United took some by surprise before Bruce's men secured back-to-back victories against West Ham and Bournemouth.In fact, those successive wins occurred about the same period as when Benitez's side found form to go on a three-game winning run last season.And when it comes to points accumulated, it is another feather in the cap for Bruce, whose side have four more at this stage than his predecessor managed last term.For that he has his backline to largely thank for both keeping it tight in defence and providing a threat up front - prior to Shelvey's second against City, eight of the past 10 Newcastle goals had been scored by defenders.On the flip side, some of the Toon Army will tell you their attack of Joelinton and widemen Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almiron have underperformed.The trio cost the club more than £80m but before Saturday's fixture they had only managed one goal and one assist between them - both belonging to Joelinton.Bruce was forced to defend them after their underwhelming displays in last Monday's 2-0 loss at Aston Villa, and social media was awash with people asking for a change.There were more moans early on against a dominant City. When Newcastle won back possession Joelinton again struggled to hold up play, Saint-Maximin ran 40 yards then lost the ball, and on one occasion Almiron struggled to get a shot away in the area when the ball got caught up between his feet.But Bruce said prior to the fixture that he liked what he saw from them in training and wanted to persevere with the trio - and they eventually showed him he was right to do so.Joelinton got the better of marker John Stones and Saint-Maximin drew City defenders towards him, allowing full-back Jetro Willems to take advantage on the overlap, while Almiron finally got some sort of reward for his relentless workrate by setting up the opener for Willems.It is still only one goal and two assists between the front trio, but worth remembering that Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon only scored three between them by this stage last year before vastly improving those statistics in the second half of the season.In the post-match news conference, Bruce was asked by a journalist how his side could produce a listless display like the one against Villa followed by one of a far superior standard.He said: ""That's one thing we have to address. We go up and down too easily, especially away from home. We have to improve.""Consistency is what we're striving for. We have to keep working at it and keep plodding away.""His side have shown the elements required to have a successful season, once that consistency is found. Now the club just have to convince the fans to return and that this is a start of new, happier era.Long-time supporter Robert Michael Chaytor from Stanley, disappointed when he spoke to BBC Sport after the 1-0 loss to Arsenal three months ago, had a more positive outlook after witnessing the draw against City.He said: ""Newcastle won't go down this season. Definitely not.""I've still not seen enough I like though. But Bruce deserves his chance, even though he was a Mackem."""
sport	Liverpool to Feyenoord: Scotland's George Johnston waiting for chance	What do his coaches & team-mates think?What about those who have done it before?	"George Johnston is patiently waiting for a chance to make his mark after making a massive decision in the summer in the hope of kick-starting his career.With the likes of Virgil Van Dijk, Joel Matip, Joe Gomez and Dejan Lovren ahead of him, the Scotland Under-21 defender decided to leave European champions Liverpool. To leave his home in the north-west of England. To leave his family and his friends.The destination? Rotterdam, to join Dutch giants Feyenoord.""It happened unexpectedly,"" Johnston told BBC Sport Scotland. ""One night I got a phone call saying that Feyenoord wanted to buy me, less than 48 hours later I'd signed.""I needed to be in a first-team environment. Liverpool are the best team in Europe at the moment so it's going to be difficult for any young player to break in. I thought Feyenoord would give me a better platform for my immediate future.""It's been a bit of a slow start to life in the Netherlands. Johnston is yet to play for Feyenoord, despite being on the bench eight times, and he spent the first couple of months living in a hotel.He was originally signed by Jaap Stam, who has since been replaced by former Rangers manager Dick Advocaat.""I feel like I'm finally settling in,"" Johnston says. ""It wasn't easy living in a hotel for the first few months but it's better now I've moved into my own place. My family come over quite a lot and I've made mates.""I'm a first-team squad player just waiting for my opportunity which I hope comes soon. When that happens it's just about taking that chance.""Johnston is not the only young Scot forging a career away from home. Everton striker Fraser Hornby is on loan at Belgian side KV Kortjik, while Reading's Jordan Holsgrove is spending the season in Spain's third tier with Atletico Baleares.Their coach with the national under-21 side, Scot Gemmill, believes it can only enhance their development.""It's undoubtedly important,"" he says. ""They learn to play for different managers with different tactics.""You have to really commend the players for their maturity and their bravery to make these big changes. You have to give them credit for being proactive and finding a way to make their dreams come true.""Johnston himself believes more players should follow suit and his defensive partner at international level, Ryan Porteous, says he would definitely consider playing abroad at some point in his career.""There's a lot better standard of football abroad,"" says the Hibernian centre-back. ""A lot of the British boys don't fancy learning a new language and going away from home - I really admire them doing that.""You've seen it when David Bates took the gamble to go to Hamburg and it paid off for him with a Scotland call-up. If you want to play at the highest level you've got to be willing to take that risk.""Former Scotland international Joe Jordan, who played for AC Milan and Verona in ItalyI admire them because they could just sit back and that is not the way to look at a career. You have to go and play football. OK maybe you'll be set up for life but will you be able to look back and prove that you were a player? You have to play. By doing all this you hopefully end up playing for your country.All credit to those lads for being able to make that jump and show belief in their own ability and the character they've shown to go there and it's pleasing. It was the best thing I ever did, the best move of my career for many aspects."
sport	Moroccan side Wydad to lodge complaint with Court of Arbitration for Sport		"Moroccan club Wydad Casablanca say they will return to the Court of Arbitration (Cas) for Sport over May's African Champions League final result.It comes after Sunday's meeting of the Confederation of African Football's (Caf) Appeal Board, who ruled that Tunisia's Esperance won the title in May.Wydad's president Said Naciri confirmed on Monday, as he was re-elected as the president of the Moroccan Football League, that they would go to Cas as permitted by the Caf statutes.""We will defend our rights until the end. For two months we have been fighting this ""oppression"". Esperance don't deserve to win the cup in the way we witnessed in Rades,"" he told BBC Sport.""Our next step is to take the case back to CAS to seek fairness.""The second leg of May's Champions League final ended in controversy as Wydad Casablanca refused to continue playing after a row over the Video Assisted Referee (VAR) system.Play was halted when VAR was unavailable to judge a disallowed equaliser.VAR had been set up on the side of the pitch, but the players had not been told it was not working, although officials were aware.The referee then awarded the victory to three-time former champions Esperance.The Tunisian side were leading 1-0 (2-1 on aggregate) in Saturday's final, which was played over two legs. VAR had been used in the first leg.But in the second leg, Walid El Karti's header for Wydad was disallowed for an infringement.Both sides then lodged complaints with Cas following an initial ruling from Caf that the second leg should be replayed.The court's first ruling in August said that Caf's executive committee ""did not have jurisdiction"" to order that the final be replayed.Following that decision from Cas, the disciplinary committee at Caf ruled Esperance to be the winners of the African Champions League.Wydad then lodged a further case with Caf and its Appeal Board, which on 15 September rejected the Moroccan club's request.""…the Board underlined the fact that the absence of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) has no legal effects whatsoever and that its sole purpose is to aid the referee to take the correct decision...,"" the Caf Appeal Board decision explained.""That the referee is vested with the power to have the final decision on the field of play since the start of the game, and that his decision is not up to review by the Appeal Board.""The match officials' reports were very clear that the Wydad Athletic Club's players refused to resume the match even after several attempts conducted by the referee, to the point that the referee waited almost 90 minutes before he whistled the end of the match.""The Appeal Board has noted that the stoppage of almost 90 minutes was due to the Wydad Athletic Club's players' failure to resume the match, the players were then instructed to resume play by the referee who has seen his attempts fail to no avail.""Therefore the Appeal Board confirms that the match was forfeited by Wydad Athletic Club because their players refused to resume the match.""The Appeal Board added that according to Caf's own statutes, a case would be allowed to be lodged directly with Cas before the 25 September."

""If we beat them, then Kingstonian against Palace at Selhurst Park would be a dream draw for me.""I don't think Palace would allow me into the training ground that week.""Media playback is not supported on this devicePortsmouth v Altrincham (Saturday, 30 November - 15:00 GMT)Not long ago, Jordan Hulme was ready to turn his back on football. Now the in-form forward is hoping to steer Altrincham to victory over 2008 FA Cup winners Portsmouth.Hulme has scored nine of his side's 27 National League North goals this season plus a further two during his side's run to the FA Cup second round - which began in the second qualifying round.""I didn't really like football. I fell out of love with it and got on board with Altrincham to see how things went,"" said the former Salford City player in May 2018.Altrincham's manager is Phil Parkinson - a one-time Crewe junior and former captain of non-league Nantwich Town, not to be confused with the Sunderland boss who shares his name.Parkinson said his side, who play in the sixth tier of English football, will have to play the ""best game ever"" to beat League One Portsmouth.""The lads always step up to the plate on these occasions,"" said Parkinson.Eastleigh v Crewe Alexandra (Saturday, 30 November - 17:30 GMT)The last time Eastleigh played Crewe in the FA Cup, Ben Strevens scored the winner from the penalty spot to send the National League club through to the second round in 2015.Strevens has since been appointed Spitfires boss and wants a repeat of the heroics of 2015-16 when Eastleigh reached the third round before losing to Bolton, who were then in the Championship.""Being at home is important if you are the lesser side,"" said Strevens before League Two Crewe's visit to the Silverlake Stadium.""It evens the tie up. We want to test ourselves against Football League opposition.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceRochdale v Boston United (Sunday, 1 December - 14:00 GMT)These are exciting times at Boston United.The Pilgrims are poised to move to a new £12m ground while they are challenging for promotion from National League North - as well as one win away from a place in the third round for the first time since 2004-05.""I think it's a great time to be a supporter of Boston United,"" boss Craig Elliott told Lincolnshire Live.""There are a lot of big games and, off the pitch, the new stadium is looking fantastic. I'm excited as a manager and I'm sure the supporters are the same.""Boston have won four away ties to reach the second round and a shock win at Rochdale, who play three divisions higher in League One, could give them an opportunity to play one last FA Cup tie at York Street - their home since 1933 - before they leave.Boston's squad includes 21-year-old full-back Demeaco Duhaney, who has Premier League experience with Huddersfield.Solihull Moors v Rotherham United (Monday, 2 December - 19:45 GMT)Solihull's James Ball scored more FA Cup goals in the last round than any player at Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal or Tottenham managed in the whole competition last season.Former Stevenage striker Ball notched four in 18 minutes as the National League club crushed Oxford City 5-1 to reach the second round for the second successive season.Solihull face a tough test against a Rotherham side who have made a solid start to life in League One following relegation from the Championship last season.However, the Millers' form in the FA Cup is hardly impressive. They lost their previous six ties before beating Maidenhead United in the first round.Solihull, managed by former Southampton, Blackburn and England goalkeeper Tim Flowers, are unbeaten in all competitions since 26 October and a 4-1 win at Stockport on Tuesday lifted them to second in England's fifth tier."

""When you give your maximum every day, why would you not sleep?""Everton go into the weekend two points above the relegation zone, with their next three league matches all against teams currently in the top four, going to Leicester on Sunday and Liverpool next Wednesday before hosting Chelsea the following Saturday.Silva said he had not been given an ultimatum by Brands before the trip to the King Power Stadium and would not be distracted by the intense discussion over his future.""I don't waste my time thinking about that. Not one minute,"" he said. ""My focus is on what I can control.""There have been suggestions that Silva has only kept his job this week because of a lack of alternatives and a difference of opinion between majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and chairman Bill Kenwright.After staying silent throughout a turbulent few days, Brands gave an interview to Everton's club media, released less than half an hour before Silva's general press conference.""Of course, we know in sport, as always, you have to perform - that's me, the manager, the players, for everyone,"" Brands said.""It's also important, after a couple of years of instability, to stick together in this situation. It is important that everyone has the feeling that we can turn this around to better results.""Some are not convinced Everton can turn the situation round.On Monday, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said he would be ""massively surprised"" if Everton were not in the relegation zone at the end of a run of six games that ends with a home game against Burnley on Boxing Day.""I don't have the capacity to look five, six or seven matches into the future,"" said Silva.""Nothing is easy in football. If you start losing focus and wasting energy by thinking about Anfield, Chelsea and Manchester United, you are not focusing on the most important thing, which is Leicester.""Everton's trip to Leicester is not made easier by the knowledge Fabian Delph, Morgan Schneiderlin, Seamus Coleman and Theo Walcott are all likely to miss out through injury.Brands did confirm Brazilian striker Richarlison - who has scored just three league goals this season - is close to agreeing a new contract.Silva will not find it easy to get Everton's fans back onside, judging by the boos he endured at Goodison Park last weekend.""I share their frustration,"" Silva said. ""As a manager, you always have to respect the reaction of your fans.""Is it possible things can change? I am not 100% sure. I am not the right person to ask.""What I can do, it is my job and obligation as a manager, is to work really hard, as I did since the first day I joined the club; try to get the right results and keep improving our football.""Silva was backed with almost £90m of new signings in the summer of 2018 and the Toffees finished eighth last season.But, after spending more than £100m on new players in the summer just gone, Everton have won just four league games this season."

In sharing your story of being HIV+, you are saving lives and shattering stigma, by showing you can be strong and resilient while living with HIV.""He filmed the documentary HIV and Me which aired in October, and was met with further praise from fans calling him a ""hero"".Rio Ferdinand's wife, Rebecca, died of breast cancer in May 2015, aged 34, and since then he has spoken openly about how life has changed for him and their children.This has included filming a Bafta-winning documentary called 'Being Mum and Dad', in which he took viewers and fans on his personal journey on coping with grief, and how he was helping his three children.In sharing his personal journey with the nation, he was praised for showing people should ""talk more"" and ""not shy away"" from grief.Important subjects, and incredible bravery.

U got nine months to get better especially the ones that think it's ok for the other two Kiwi born to represent Wales but not me.""That was a reference to McNicholl and Scarlets centre Hadleigh Parkes, who has won 25 caps since making his debut in 2017 and was a key part of Wales' 2019 Grand Slam success and fourth-place finish at the recent World Cup.Asked whether he had encountered any negative reaction on social media, McNicholl said: ""I don't use my Twitter account and no one has direct messaged me. So no negativity, no.""I don't listen to it because it's only a small minority that are probably saying those things, and my advice would be to stay off social media.""Pivac said players who qualify on residency are eligible to be selected but need to be better than the ""local"" player they might be representing.Media playback is not supported on this deviceFormer Wales boss Warren Gatland, who is back in Cardiff to coach the Barbarians, suggested players who qualify on residency would benefit from learning the national anthem.Gatland, himself a New Zealander, feels that singing the anthem before kick-off ingratiates players with the Welsh public.""I have been going hard with the anthem,"" said McNicholl, who played Super Rugby for the Crusaders before switching to the Scarlets in 2016.""It is not a language that I know, so the pronunciation is very hard for me.""But Steff Hughes (Scarlets team-mate) has been very good in that department by writing it down how it is written in Welsh and then writing how I might say it in English.""That way it is a bit easier to learn and I am looking forward to trying to belt it out on Saturday.""I almost know it off by heart and the last line is all I have to nail down now. I should be done by game day.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceMcNicholl revealed it was his intention to play for Wales after moving from New Zealand, although he did not announce that publicly until his initial two-and-a-half-year Scarlets deal was extended.He says he loves the country - ""I've got one daughter born here, one on the way and it feels like home"" - but at the age of 29 he knows time is not on his side.""I don't have that luxury of waiting a couple of years and building my way into the team,"" McNicholl said.""I've got to show what I'm worth straight away… scoring tries, making breaks, making other people look good, making myself look good."""

That is not being disrespectful, I have full confidence in my players and I also respect Maldon a lot.""They did have a fantastic result against Leyton Orient, a well deserved result.""Newport have made themselves the FA Cup's giant killers in the past two seasons.In the 2017-18 competition they beat Championship side Leeds in round three, before holding Tottenham to a draw in round four before losing in a replay at Wembley.Last season they surpassed that by dumping out former Premier League Champions Leicester City in round three and eliminating Championship Middlesbrough in a fourth round replay, before playing impressively in defeat to Manchester City in the fifth round.Flynn says Newport will need to perform and cannot rely on just having a good attitude towards the tricky tie.""We have been on the opposite end of attitudes being questioned. But when the players cross the line everybody wants to win,"" he explained.""It does not matter if it is Man City, Leicester, Spurs or Met Police. They all want to win.""What does happen is that one or two or may be three or four (of their) players might have off days and eight or nine of us have good days.""When that happens you get good momentum. Its a good confidence boost and what it does is keep your in the tie. Once you have a chance anything can happen.""That is what Maldon will be trying to do."""

sport	UK Championship: Barry Hawkins makes 147 in victory over Gerard Greene	Maximum bonus changeSelby and Ding stroll through	"Barry Hawkins made a 147 break on his way to a 6-2 first-round win over Gerard Greene at the UK Championship.The world number 10 compiled the 16th maximum in the tournament's 43-year history in the fourth frame to lead 4-0, before closing out victory on day two at the York Barbican.Hawkins, 40, will pocket £15,000 for the break, although the money will be shared if anyone else matches the feat.""It's 15 grand? Happy days,"" said Hawkins on discovering his reward.""I'll buy myself a Christmas present.""Kent-based Londoner Hawkins, a three-time ranking event winner, began his quest for a first UK title in stunning form with breaks of 91, 68 and 80 before his 147.""For the first four frames I didn't miss,"" the left-hander added. ""I played brilliant. And the 147 was a good one. I had the white under control and was in position for most of the break.""It's brilliant to have one at the UK Championship in the big arena.""I was feeling it big time on the last couple of balls. It's mad, you have plenty in practice but to do it in the arena in match conditions is brilliant.""A controversial new World Snooker bonus scheme means there has to be 20 maximum breaks in a season to trigger a shared £1m bonus.But activating the bonus before the end of the season in early May is ""not going to happen"", Hawkins said.""There are 16 to go,"" Hawkins added. ""There won't be enough to share the prize. It makes headlines but in reality it's not going to happen.""Elsewhere, two-time champion Mark Selby coasted through, the Leicester man crushing Andy Hicks 6-0 in a one-sided contest.A break of 134 was the highlight for Selby, who rounded victory off with another stylish ton against an opponent who only managed a total of 88 points.""I was a little bit ropey, a bit edgy, in the first two frames,"" Selby said. ""That's understandable in a big tournament I managed to nick both of those and that settled me down.""Another former champion, Ding Junhui, routinely progressed into round two in the morning session, winning five frames in a row to beat Welshman Duane Jones 6-2China's Ding, 32, has slipped to 16 in the world and has not won a ranking event in more than two years.But he looked increasingly confident as breaks of 73, 103, 77 and 92 saw him recover from 2-1 down to progress.There were also wins for 2004 champion Stephen Maguire, Marco Fu and ex-world champion Graeme Dott.World number 14 Maguire edged out Billy Castle 6-4, Hong Kong's Fu, the 2008 finalist, beat Craig Steadman 6-3 and Maguire's fellow Scot Dott thrashed Barry Pinches 6-1.Three-time world champion Mark Williams starts his tournament on Wednesday evening against Scotland's Fraser Patrick, a session which also sees world number nine Kyren Wilson take on Riley Parsons.World number one Judd Trump plays Morocco's Amine Amiri in the opening round on Thursday at 14:30 GMT, and seven-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan is in action against Ross Bulman later that evening.BBC television coverage of the tournament begins on Saturday from 13:15 GMT on BBC One.Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news on the BBC app."
sport	Premier League: Man City will 'fight until the last day' - but can they catch Liverpool?	'Liverpool look like title-winning side'Critical December?Will injuries bite hard?'We fight until the last day''We don't think about these things'	"Media playback is not supported on this devicePep Guardiola might well be facing the toughest challenge of his managerial career.In the top-flight seasons in which Guardiola has won titles across Europe's major leagues, he has never had to overcome a gap as large as 11 points - the current margin between leaders Liverpool and his Manchester City side, the defending champions.City twice led at Newcastle before being forced to settle for a 2-2 draw in the early kick-off, before Liverpool overcame a nervy finish - which included a red card to goalkeeper Alisson for handball - to edge past mid-table Brighton on a dramatic day of action.""We have to win games, win games, win games, and when you don't win, it will be more difficult,"" said Guardiola after his side dropped more points.The Spaniard managed to overturn a 10-point gap last season as City hunted down Liverpool to win the Premier League title.And while there are still 24 games to go, have City already left themselves with too much to do?City need Liverpool to have a poor run of form, yet Jurgen Klopp's leaders have dropped just two points all season.Indeed, the Reds have dropped only 13 points in the last 32 top-flight games, even though they have not kept a clean sheet since 28 September.""They looked like a real title-winning team to me,"" said six-time Premier League winner Phil Neville, who watched Liverpool's latest win.""At this stage of the season, sometimes performances don't matter.""When you see the result up at St James' Park earlier in the day, it was a must-win game for Liverpool to extend the lead.""Former Chelsea and Scotland winger Pat Nevin, who was at Anfield for BBC Radio 5 Live, gave City hope when he said: ""Liverpool are not playing as well as they were playing last season.""However, he added: ""They are winning their games and that's what it's all about. With league titles, no-one in the end looks back and says, 'You didn't play well in this game or that game.'""Biggest Premier League leads at the end of NovemberMuch has been made of Liverpool's hectic schedule between now and the start of 2020.Klopp's side face nine games in four different competitions - including a trip to Qatar to play two fixtures at the Fifa Club World Cup, which is being broadcast by the BBC.Yet Guardiola's side have a tough December themselves, with eight matches in three different competitions - including two Premier League games in 48 hours against Wolves and Sheffield United.Will such a busy schedule work against them in view of the lacklustre performance against Newcastle?""They were too laboured, they did not move it quick enough and that's why they were punished today,"" former City midfielder Michael Brown told BBC Radio 5 Live.""They have let Liverpool get that lead now. They have not been themselves.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceLiverpool were without key midfielder Fabinho against Brighton, and the Brazilian is unlikely to play again until next year because of ankle ligament damage.Defenders Joel Matip and Nathaniel Clyne have also been nursing injuries, but City have a busy treatment room too.Germany winger Leroy Sane and French defender Aymeric Laporte are expected to be out until around January and February, while Sergio Aguero is another big miss with a thigh injury.In addition, defender Oleksandr Zinchenko has not played for his club since 6 October because of knee damage.""City have got injuries, but this is not an excuse,"" added Brown.When Liverpool hammered Arsenal 5-1 on 29 December last year, they led third-placed City, who had a game in hand, by 10 points yet Guardiola's side managed to overturn the deficit in the last 19 matches.""The chase is still on. We fight until the last day,"" said defiant City and England defender John Stones after the Newcastle game.That's assuming the title battle goes as far as the final day of the season.""Liverpool can win games playing badly, City played badly today but could not win,"" said BBC Sport football expert Garth Crooks.Klopp's side scored twice in the closing stages at Aston Villa to win 2-1 on 2 November and scored a late winner at Crystal Palace on 23 November. City have failed to hang on to leads in three of their last five league and cup games.Neville believes the way Liverpool keep going until the end could be a critical difference.He said: ""There are a lot of teams at the top who are looking tired. Then you look at Liverpool and the way they came back to win late at Crystal Palace.""A huge sigh of relief could be heard around Anfield when referee Martin Atkinson sounded the final whistle on Saturday.Liverpool had the points and Klopp joined his players on the pitch to applaud the fans - the German preferring to concentrate on the positives afterwards.""It's unbelievable how much they want to win. They made it a really special win,"" he said.Speaking about Liverpool's 11-point advantage, Klopp added: ""It's how it is. But if Leicester win tomorrow we are eight points. We don't think about these things.""At the same time as Klopp was talking to the media, City were on their way back to Manchester to prepare for Tuesday's match at Burnley.""We have another opponent in front of us, so we now have to try to win games and see what happens,"" added Guardiola.""I said yesterday at the press conference that it's not a good idea to think about the Premier League or think, how many points?"""

sport	Ryan Atkin: From linesman to champion - first openly gay referee on experiences	'Still work to be done''The culture is slowly changing'Stonewall's Sport Champions 2019Building a dialogue	"""I got a lot of people just patting me on the back and saying 'well done, it doesn't matter that you are gay'.""In August 2017, Ryan Atkin became the first man refereeing in England's professional leagues to come out as gay.Since then, he has gone from working as an assistant referee in the English Football League to refereeing in the National League this season.From running the line to being the man in the middle, he has been nominated has been named as one of Stonewall's Sport Champions for 2019.Before the charity's Rainbow Laces campaign, which started on Friday and is aimed at tackling homophobia in sport, Atkin spoke to the BBC's LGBT Sport Podcast and says he hopes that others can follow in his footsteps.""You're either good at refereeing or you're not, and your sexuality shouldn't come into that,"" he said.""Ultimately, within sport, you want the best people to get to the top, and it should only be through their profession and how good they are that they do progress.""But what we do want to ensure is that we've got a diverse pool of people who have the same opportunities if they are good enough.""Many referees working in English football can speak of the insults they are exposed to from the stands, and even as recently as the past week, there was an alleged incident of homophobic abuse in a League One game.It occurred during Tranmere's match against Wycombe and led to a man being arrested.But it was not an isolated incident, and there have also been instances of racist abuse, prompting Atkin to call for the problems to now be tackled seriously.""I think what we've seen over the past couple of years is, unfortunately, a real undercurrent of racism, which I think is terribly sad in 2019,"" he said.""It has to be stamped out and addressed. And if we haven't even achieved that, then homophobia in football is trailing behind. There is still a lot of work to be done.""Similar problems exist in other sports too.Earlier this year, Australian rugby union authorities ended Israel Folau's contract over a social media post in which he said ""hell awaits"" gay people.And England forward Billy Vunipola was later warned by his club side Saracens about his behaviour after defending Folau's actions.Meanwhile, no professional footballer in the United Kingdom has yet come out as gay, a situation Atkin is hopeful will change.He said: ""It can sometimes be slightly disheartening to think that there are other people who are LGBT who don't feel that it's the right time for them or have the confidence to come out.""I often speak to people who are not out in sport, and ask them, 'What are your fears?' You get a mixture of responses about why they wouldn't chose or won't come out.""I'm just hopeful that, as time progress, and especially within football, the culture is slowly changing.""With the 2022 World Cup in Qatar - a country where homosexuality is illegal - fast approaching, Atkin says his experiences at last year's World Cup in Russia gave a flavour of what to expect.""Having attended [the 2018 World Cup] in Russia myself, and having had dialogue with people in Russia who are LGBT, who actually embraced the World Cup coming, what it does is bring the media and bring a spotlight onto some of the issues these countries face, and it allows for dialogue to open,"" Atkin said.""It lays paving slabs to hopefully build a path to where further discussions can take place. So, for me, while it is a massive negative that we are endorsing going to these countries, on the flip side of it, there are massive positives to come out of it.""So, would Atkin feel comfortable refereeing at the World Cup in Qatar in three years' time?""Yes, I think I would. I think I would embrace my sexuality,"" he added."

sport	Lewis Hamilton at Ferrari? Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - all you need to know	Earliest 'silly season' ever?Wolff relaxed about Hamilton exploring optionsWill Mercedes stay in F1 beyond 2021?One more spin around the block	"The 2019 Formula 1 season is not quite finished but already minds in the sport are turning to the future - and particularly that of Lewis Hamilton.Pretty much all the top drivers are out of contract at the end of next year, so the 2020 transfer market promises to be particularly interesting. And Hamilton will be at the centre of it.The world champion has never indicated any desire to leave Mercedes, but he has inevitably been linked to Ferrari on and off through his career, and this weekend has seen the latest example.Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport ran on Saturday with a splash headline saying Hamilton had met Ferrari chairman John Elkann twice this year, in what the paper said was an attempt by Ferrari to ""chat him up"".That followed team boss Mattia Binotto saying in a news conference in Abu Dhabi on Friday: ""Lewis is certainly an outstanding driver, a fantastic driver. Knowing that he's available in 2021 can make us only happy, but honestly it's too early for any decision.""We are happy with the drivers we've got at the moment and I think certainly at one stage next season we will start discussing and understanding what to do.""In F1, the driver transfer market is known as the 'silly season'. There was a time when it happened in August and September before the following year. It has been creeping earlier but this is probably the first time it has started before the end of the season before the one in question has even started.Perhaps it's a reflection of the fact so many big names will be out of contract at the end of the year - Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel are certainly available. The status of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc is less clear, as while he is known to be on a long-term deal with Ferrari, the exact nuances of it are not publicly available. So possibly him, too.Inevitably, Binotto's comments and the Gazzetta story proved a major talking point on Saturday at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, and Hamilton was asked about it.""This is the first time I've heard of that,"" he said, referring to Binotto's remarks. ""I think that's the first compliment I've had from Ferrari in these 13 years.""I honestly don't remember them ever mentioning me, so thank you, I'll take it. Doesn't really mean anything, it's all talk but yeah, it's nice that finally… it's taken all these years for him to recognise maybe, but I'm grateful.""Pressed on whether he would be interested in a move to Ferrari for 2021, Hamilton said: ""It's never a waste of time to be nice to someone. It has been a long, long time and a team that I've always appreciated over the years, so to earn their respect from someone from there who's obviously very high up is obviously not a bad thing.""They've got two great drivers as is, so who knows what the driver market's going to be doing over the next year?""But if I'm really honest, I'm not really focused on that right this second: trying to make sure I finish off strong. I've got this incredible group of people who hire me where I am and I feel like I just continue to owe it to them to give my heart to them and my energy 100% to them, particularly as I'm still in contract and negotiations haven't started yet.""I honestly don't know how the next phase of the months is going to go when it comes to contract. It's very odd that you have to do it almost a year before it ends and it can't be done towards the end, but that's just the way it goes. We shall see.""When Hamilton has been asked this question in the past, he has always tended to emphasise the strength of his bonds with Mercedes, how long they have been together, the fact he has been supported by them since he was 12.In Brazil two weeks ago, he said: ""When you've been with a team for so long, we are kind of joined at the hip. All that small detail can take its time. It's no real stress, our word is our bond has been all these years and we've always had that. Mercedes since I was 12 have always stood by their word and vice versa.""But you need to set some time aside to say: 'Where are we? What's the next goal? What else are we planning?' Because it rolls over for the future. And that in itself can be time-consuming. And, sure, once you have put something in place you're always later: 'Oh damnit, we could have done this.'""It is trying to have as much foresight as possible. But I have not found it distracting in the seasons when we have been doing it through a season, so it is not about rushing things.""Hamilton will have a lot to weigh up when he makes this decision. As he seeks to keep winning as long as he stays in F1, he will want to have the most competitive car. But he will also have an eye on Mercedes as a brand and the strength of their relationship and how much they could do together in the future, long after he hangs up his helmet.In Abu Dhabi, Ferrari neither confirmed nor denied whether Hamilton had met Elkann; a spokeswoman simply said she did not know.At Mercedes, team boss Toto Wolff was also asked about it, and he said: ""I am totally OK with that. This is a free world and I recognise that everybody needs to explore career options and make the best decision for themselves, drivers and everybody else.""So I am very open about this. I have started to embrace the fact that everybody has objectives and needs to have the best possible opportunity for his career so in that respect I am absolutely open for everyone to explore options. My personal priority for the team would be to continue this successful journey, we are really benefiting from a healthy relationship.""How the values within the team are, loyalty and integrity are number one on the list and understanding Lewis' position and objectives will be key for any decision we take.""We will not embark on a fishing mission with potential drivers out there before Lewis and us have had that discussion. That hasn't taken place because we wanted to wrap up the season and we wanted to see how it goes. We have a consensual relationship. We need both sides to be happy.""There are other complexities in this, as well - not least the fact no team is contractually committed to F1 beyond 2020.The teams are in negotiations with F1 over the financial terms of their contracts and have been for some time. The uncertainty - and the complexity of the global car market - has led to speculation as to whether Mercedes will continue in F1 beyond next year.Hamilton said on Thursday: ""Mercedes is here to stay."" Asked whether that was confirmation they would be in F1 beyond 2020, he added: ""It is not an announcement but I am pretty sure Mercedes is here to stay. The board members are here this weekend so I will double-check with them. They are all hardcore racers and I am pretty sure they want to stay.""All the indications at the moment are he is right because F1 works for Mercedes both financially and in terms of exposure.In 2018, the F1 team's total budget was £338m, and they spent £311m. Daimler's cost exposure on that was in the region of 10-15%, taking into account sponsorship and other income.And Ola Kallenius, the chairman of the Daimler board, said in an investor call on 14 November: ""F1 has been an activity in terms of our marketing and branding strategy that has paid off handsomely in the last few years. You have to look at these investments in a rational way.""We weigh all our marketing and media investment in terms of reach, impact and cost. If you use the Nielsen method to measure the media value of our F1 activities, they are north of €1bn a year. So an extreme reach and impact from this activity. And the costs - that we would not like to disclose publicly - are surprising low because there is a cost and revenue side in F1. We are committed.""Right now, the smart money would be on Hamilton continuing in F1 in 2021 and staying with Mercedes.As Wolff said: ""Racing drivers are always going to try to be in the quickest possible car, and the quickest car is always going to try to have the best racing driver in there. So there is a good consensus between us as to what we are trying to achieve.""We need to push very hard to provide the drivers with the quickest possible car and if we are able to do this, I am 100% convinced we will have the best possible driver line-up and everything points to our relationship continuing. But in life you never know.""Hamilton has got what he wanted in Abu Dhabi so far - a pole position to end a season in which the only minor blot on his record had until that point been that team-mate Bottas had more poles than him.Hamilton had made it clear that irked him, so he was delighted with a superlative lap to make them five each in terms of poles and which put Hamilton 14-7 ahead on their qualifying head-to-head.He is hot favourite, too, to take his 11th win of the season, which would equal his best tally for a year.Bottas has been demoted to the back with a penalty for using too many engine parts and on the face of the weekend so far, neither Red Bull nor Ferrari look quite on Mercedes' level.Verstappen said: ""We just seemed to lack a bit of grip compared to them. They are always really dominant on this track and we are just lacking a bit too much in that last sector.""We have to be realistic and I think Mercedes is really quick but we will give it everything we have in the race.""But Mercedes are wary of all threats and while Ferrari were not competitive on the soft tyre in qualifying, Hamilton pointed out that Leclerc had topped second qualifying on the medium tyre, albeit Mercedes had not done a second run, and Wolff said Ferrari's race pace on the hard in Friday practice had also been impressive.The Ferraris being on split strategies - with Leclerc starting on the medium like Hamilton and Verstappen, and Vettel on the soft - also complicates matters.""Red Bull was the strongest compared to us on the long runs but Ferrari are fast on the straights and that gives them overtaking opportunity,"" Wolff said, ""and I think all of us will have a chance for the victory tomorrow.""Hamilton has walked the championship but the racing has been terrific for much of the year. Abu Dhabi is not famous for exciting races - to say the least - but it would be nice to end the season on a high.Not many would bet against Hamilton, though."

sport	Five things we noticed: Winning ugly, stubborn Stute and sharing the burden	Coleraine bounce back...justGormley's greatnessStute dig deep once againTurning point for Glenavon?Sharing the burden	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceAnother week, another cracking round of games in the Irish Premiership. We really shouldn't be surprised.We have dissected a busy weekend of action and have selected five talking points, from the Bannsiders' resilience to Institute's dogged displays.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAfter last week's shock defeat by basement side Warrenpoint Town, Oran Kearney needed a response from his players against Carrick Rangers.The Coleraine boss got got one and praised the character of his side after the game, but they really had to work for it against a Carrick side who were very unlucky not to take anything away from the Showgrounds.Carrick twice went ahead, and ultimately Tim Marshall's decision to award Jamie Glackin a penalty was the lifeline that the Bannsiders were looking for.Ben Doherty's composure brought them level, before youngster Alex Gawne brilliantly took his chance to make sure Coleraine returned to winning ways.""It's not about entertainment, it's about putting points on the board,"" said Kearney after the game, and when necessary, winning ugly is what the best sides do.From a Carrick perspective, Niall Currie says that everyone was shocked when the spot kick was awarded and called the manner of the defeat ""a sickener"", but despite the result, he can take tremendous pride in his team.Media playback is not supported on this deviceJoe Gormley is sublime. I know that we're stating the obvious a little bit here, but his goal against Larne represented everything that the striker is about.The touch, the strength, the power and accuracy to beat Conor Devlin from such a tight angle - it had everything. Not to mention it was also was his 20th goal of the season despite the fact we haven't hit December yet.When he is in his current form then it is a delight to watch him play and Paddy McLaughlin will be praying that the knock he picked up on his ankle at Inver Park isn't too serious.While McLaughlin has done a brilliant job at tightening up the Reds at the back, it's crucial that Joe the Goal is kept fit and fresh to lead Cliftonville's title charge.As a nice footnote, Gormley's effort against Larne means that he has now scored against 31 clubs while playing for the Reds. Utterly ruthless.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAre Institute the hardest team to beat in the league?This may sound silly as the Brandywell outfit sit second from bottom in the league and have conceded 35 goals in 16 games.However since Sean Connor arrived in the dugout mid-September, Stute have beaten Warrenpoint Town and have dug out draws against Ballymena United, Crusaders, Larne and Glentoran.When you throw in a run to the semi-finals of the League Cup, where Crusaders await, then things are looking rather rosy.Plaudits have to go to Connor, who has really turned things around. Although it may not be three points week after week, if Stute keep nicking scalps off some of the big guns then they can climb their way to survival.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAnyone who watched Glenavon's performance against Linfield on Friday will wonder how on earth the Lurgan Blues have been struggling so badly this year.Gary Hamilton has been telling anyone who will listen that Glenavon's squad were able to turn their form around, they just need it to click.That's finally happened, and although any form of challenge for the title is surely out of reach, it's crucial that the Lurgan Blues rebuild their confidence and get back to the place that had them pegged as a top-three side last year.The challenge now is to see if they can back the win up against Institute, who as we have discussed, are a tricky opponent to negotiate.With Josh Daniels and Jonny Tuffey impressive on their returns from injury, plus a starring cameo from Hamilton, then it looks like the ship may be beginning to turn at Mourneview Park.Media playback is not supported on this device""Over the years, we've probably relied too heavily on Curtis Allen, but this season we have got goals coming from all over the pitch.""That's a pretty good summary from Robbie McDaid, who fired home a hat-trick as Glentoran hammered Dungannon Swifts 6-1.With the ever-reliable Allen out injured, McDaid has been in scintillating form recently and has been ably backed up by high-rated youngster Paul O'Neill and Croatian free-kick wizard Hrvoje Plum.Marcus Kane and Paddy McClean have been chipping in with goals from the back too, with midfielders John Herron and Elvio van Overbeek also contributing.A lot has been made about Glentoran's investment and their boost up the table, but both McDaid and O'Neill were at the Oval before the takeover which shows their step-up in form isn't just down to their new backing.While there will still be the odd blip, it seems like the club's upward trajectory is going to continue.As for the Swifts? It really is worrying times indeed.Watch the NIFL Premiership Highlights Show with Nicola McCarthy and Cliftonville forward Chris Scannell."

sport	UK Championship: Judd Trump's transformation down to drive and desire - Stephen Hendry	Matching the maestroAge is just a numberThe UK Championship and how money talks	"Judd Trump's hunger and focus is finally enabling him to deliver the results his talent merits, according to seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry.Trump won the world title for the first time in April and has dominated the sport in the past year, winning three ranking events and a second Masters crown.The 30-year-old world number one's quest for a second UK Championship title, eight years after his first, begins on Thursday against world number 127 Amine Amiri.And Hendry told BBC Sport: ""Judd has made snooker his life. That was not always the case. It's now his number one priority.""On his day he could always be amazing, but he is far more consistent now.""Judd had to start thinking if he would end up like Jimmy White, not winning a world title and as many ranking events as he probably should have given his ability. He probably got tired of watching Ronnie and Mark Selby, and others winning everything.""He was ready to sacrifice and not view snooker as a part-time thing and it's working.""Trump's latest ranking win came when he retained the Northern Ireland Open title in Belfast earlier this month.Perhaps fittingly, it was a second successive 9-7 win over Ronnie O'Sullivan, like Hendry a legend of the game with 36 ranking victories to his name.Thirty years on from Hendry's win over the all-conquering Steve Davis in the 1989 UK final, the Scot believes that Trump's recent upturn in fortunes could signal a changing of the guard in snooker.Davis had tasted Crucible success on six occasions in the 1980s, and also won four UK titles.But five months after the first of his five UK successes, Hendry went on to win a maiden world title and then completely monopolise the sport in the 1990s.The 50-year-old told BBC Sport: ""Steve was still the main man, the benchmark, and to beat him over a similar distance to the World Championship was a massive confidence booster.""When I was 13, Jimmy White was my snooker hero because of the way he played, but Steve was the one to model my career on because of what he won and the way he went about it. I knew I could learn from him.""Trump's new-found focus means he has ""a great chance"" of ending his career being mentioned among the game's elite, according to Hendry.He added: ""With the age Judd is, and the fact Ronnie, Mark Williams and John Higgins are now into their 40s, there is every reason to believe that in the next five or six years he can have around 30 ranking events to his name.""There's Neil Robertson, Shaun Murphy and Selby and lots of great players out there, but he is just that little bit above everyone else at the moment.""Hendry's fellow Scot Alan McManus, a former Masters champion and three-time World Championship semi-finalist, believes O'Sullivan, 43, remains Trump's biggest threat in York.Along with fellow legends Higgins and Mark Williams, who are both 44, O'Sullivan is still in the top five in the world rankings - and only Trump's remarkable form has denied 'the Rocket' the number one spot.The trio are quick to point out they are past their very best but, while they may not be at the peak of their powers, results suggest they are not that far off.With 88 ranking titles between them, O'Sullivan, Higgins and Williams are still maintaining the sort of standards many can only dream of emulating.McManus, who is poised for his 23rd appearance at the UK Championship, said: ""People forget how much desire Ronnie still has.""He tries his heart out and when you consider how much success he has had and how much he has won, that's incredible. He's still hungry and no one talks about the hunger but he is still switched on. There is the odd game where he looks like he's not too bothered but he still wants it badly.""John needs his rhythm and he has got that because he has won shed loads of matches this season already. Consistency is key with him and and he is practising hard.""He has the right regime and the right environment. When he's in the groove then he's incapable of playing badly. He's savvy, he understands he is not always going to be top dog, so he knows it can happen that he reaches a final and will lose. But he is still a top player.""Mark Williams has had some time off so it will be interesting to see how that pans out. Has he lost the enthusiasm? Maybe, but he is still very difficult to beat. You can't work out his frame of mind. He is so so laid back and he can play his way into a tournament in a couple of matches. But if his heart is not in it, then it's tough.""O'Sullivan has only entered three ranking events this season, reaching the fourth round of the English Open and finishing runner-up to Trump in the Northern Ireland Open.Higgins has already reached two ranking semi-finals so far, as well as the Six-Reds final and the last eight of the Champion of Champions.Welshman Williams narrowly missed out on the 23rd ranking title of career, losing a final-frame decider against Shaun Murphy in the China Championship.But McManus said that now it's Trump who ""thinks he is the man"".""And that is the most important thing,"" McManus added. ""He has genuine belief with his results. His game is on a new level. It takes times to feel settled and he looks settled out there now. Two years ago he lost tamely to Graeme Dott 6-2, having led 2-0.""But now he will take some stopping. He is just playing the table and having fun. That's a dangerous combination.""Hendry concurs.""One of the big things with Judd now is that he gets into a tournament and is timing it right so that by the time he is playing in the semi-finals and final he is peaking,"" Hendry explained. ""His stats in the latter stages are incredible and he is playing his best against the best opposition.""Having targets in an individual sport is a big thing and it really was for me. It's the same with lots of other individual sports, where someone sets standards that others have to follow, like Tiger Woods chasing Jack Nicklaus in golf.""When I won my seventh world title, I just kind of thought, 'what now?' There was no target to go at. I found it much more difficult so I had to invent new goals rather than chase someone."""
sport	Premier League predictions: Lawro vs Sonny Bill Williams	LAWRO'S PREDICTIONSNewcastle 2-2 Man CityBurnley 0-2 Crystal PalaceChelsea 0-1 West HamLiverpool 2-1 BrightonTottenham 3-2 BournemouthSouthampton 2-1 WatfordNorwich v Arsenal (14:00 GMT)Wolves v Sheff Utd (14:00 GMT)Leicester v Everton (16:30 GMT)Man Utd v Aston Villa (16:30 GMT)How did Lawro do last week?GUEST LEADERBOARD 2019-20	"Unai Emery was sacked by Arsenal on Friday but the pressure is mounting for some other Premier League managers, and this weekend's fixtures could be crucial for their futures.Everton boss Marco Silva takes his side to in-form Leicester while there's a tough London derby for Manuel Pellegrini's West Ham as they travel to Chelsea.At the bottom of the table, Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl faces Quique Sanchez Flores' Watford.""Three or four managers in the league look like they are one more bad result away from losing their jobs unfortunately,"" said BBC football expert Mark Lawrenson.Lawro is making predictions for all 380 top-flight matches this season, against a variety of guests.This week he is up against dual-code rugby star Sonny Bill Williams, who has just joined Canadian Super League side Toronto Wolfpack.Williams, who has also been a professional boxer, is a two-time rugby union World Cup winner and is switching codes for the third time.But despite his versatility in the sporting arena, he admits he is no football expert.""Football to me means rugby, that's my knowledge of football,"" Williams told BBC Sport.""But I understand now that football is a religion here and if I say some things that upset some people then please, please forgive me.""I grew up a Manchester United fan but don't hold that against me.""I don't know too much about soccer but me being a proud Muslim athlete, I know players like Didier Drogba and Liverpool's Mo Salah.""I'd love to go to a United game and I'd also love to go and support Salah at one of his games. I don't really know too much about any of the other teams apart from Everton - Tim Cahill used to play for Everton, my Pacific Island brother.""A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless stated.Lawro's prediction: 0-2Sonny's prediction: 0-2Match reportLawro's prediction: 2-0Sonny's prediction: 1-0Match reportLawro's prediction: 2-1Sonny's prediction: 3-1Match reportLawro's prediction: 3-0Sonny's prediction: 4-0Match reportLawro's prediction: 2-0Sonny's prediction: 0-0Match reportLawro's prediction: 2-1Sonny's prediction: 5-1Match reportNot enough has been made of Norwich's defensive injury crisis, so it was a really good result at Everton the other week.They will definitely go for Arsenal because they have a soft centre.It was a disappointing result and performance for Arsenal in the Europa League and this game might be too soon to see a big change in performance.Lawro's prediction: 1-1Sonny's prediction: 1-2Sheffield United have been a breath of fresh air this season and they are great to watch.Wolves, however, have surprised me. I thought they would struggle with having the Premier League and Europa League but they are doing really well.Lawro's prediction: 2-0Sonny's prediction: 4-2Leicester have played extremely well this season and results have been good. They look like a team that can finish in the top four and be a real threat to some of the big guns.They are at home and Everton look like a team that don't know where the next positive result will come from. There is a lack of goals in them and away from home they have a real fragility.Lawro's prediction: 2-0Sonny's prediction: 2-1I have seen enough from Villa to believe they will be fine and avoid the drop.With Manchester United it is a difficult one, like the toss of a coin: heads they look like a good side, tails they look like they just met on the M62.It was a little bit like that at Sheffield United last week although they got a point and could have had three. They are still a work in progress with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.Lawro's prediction: 2-0Sonny's prediction: 5-0Last weekend, Lawro got three correct results, including one exact score for a total of 60 points.He beat WWE star Seth Rollins who got three correct results, and no exact scores, for a total of 30 points."
sport	Eilish McColgan says clean sport is 'probably not' achievable		"Clean sport is ""probably not"" possible as some athletes will always be ""corrupted"", according to Scottish athlete Eilish McColgan.The middle distance runner, 28, is preparing for the British Championships in Birmingham this weekend.And having competed against retrospectively banned athletes, McColgan says cheats will always exist.""The sad reality is people are always going to be corrupted by money,"" she said.""Whether it's medals, fame, there's people that are going to be bad eggs in all walks of life.""There are just girls who are more talented than me, who train harder, that are just genetically more gifted - I'm not naive to that. So I go in with an open mind that everyone's on an equal playing field but of course the reality is, that's not the case.""The British Championships acts as qualifying for the World Championships in Doha in October, with McColgan having already secured a place in the 10,000m and looking to add the 5,000m to her schedule.The Scot made headlines recently after responding to abuse on social media calling her ""skinny"" as she replied: ""Go body shame elsewhere.""""I'm surprised at how much it just took off,"" the European silver medallist said. ""I had a lot of people replying to it, a lot of people sharing with it and agreeing with it.""It's nice to feel that it's obviously an issue other people are dealing with, it's not just elite athletes, it's across everyone.""McColgan says her comments were to promote a healthy attitude to body image among young girls.""I don't want young girls to look at me and think I'm unnaturally reducing my food in order to be this size and I need to be this size to run fast,"" she added.""We're so involved now with Love Island, with the Kardashians and these unrealistic body shapes and types. And people feel they need to have all this cosmetic surgery in order to strive to achieve that, because it's deemed the perfect body image.""Young girls feel more confident looking like that than their own natural bodies and it's a shame, I can't believe we've got to that point."""

sport	RugbyX: One-on-one to decide drawn games in sport's version of Twenty20		"RugbyX will see the introduction of rugby's version of the 'Super Over', with drawn matches decided by a revolutionary one-on-one contest.In the event of a draw, a single attacker from one team will try and score past a single defender from the other.The 'one-on-one' has been included as part of the full laws of RugbyX, which have now been confirmed by World Rugby.Rugby's newest version launches at the 02 Arena on 29 October.England, Ireland and the Barbarians are among the teams involved at the debut tournament, which involves both men and women's teams.Dubbed 'Rugby's Twenty20', RugbyX is a five-a-side version of the game, is full contact and played on a half-sized pitch.Halves will be 10 minutes each, with no break in between.Kicking is allowed, but kicks must not exceed 10 metres in height, with the distance monitored by ball tracking technology.Among the other confirmed laws:""The RugbyX laws have been developed with the objective of encouraging simple, fast and skilful gameplay with minimal stoppages, whilst retaining the core fundamentals of the game we love,"" said RugbyX Technical Director Ben Ryan.Former England winger Ugo Monye, co-host of the Rugby Union Weekly podcast, believes the 'one on one' is a dramatic and revolutionary way of deciding a game.The attacker will start with the ball 30 metres from the line, while the defender will begin 5 metres out, with a 10 second time limit.""As a defender it's a nightmare, but as an attacker the pressure is on you to score,"" he said. ""I would love to see someone like [Springbok wing] Cheslin Kolbe doing it.""For me, RugbyX is a simplified and condensed version which cherry-picks the best bits of what rugby is."""

Feyenoord host Rangers on Thursday in the sides' second meeting in Europa League Group I, with Rangers having beaten the Dutch side at Ibrox September.It is Rangers' first visit to De Kuip since losing 4-3 on aggregate in the Uefa Cup in 2002 during Alex McLeish's spell as manager.Rangers took a first-half lead in Rotterdam but were then undone by two stunning free-kicks from former Celtic striker Pierre van Hooijdonk and a diving header from Bonaventure Kalou.McLeish's side pulled one back from the penalty spot and a red card for Patrick Paauwe gave them hope, but those aspirations disappeared when they themselves went down to 10 men with 18 minutes left.Can you remember the 11 men who started for Rangers that night?

sport	Lauren Jones: Wheelchair tennis player on how 'sport changed her life after accident'	'I was a young girl whose dreams had been shattered''The best decision my parents ever made''Sport really did change my life after my accident'Pushing on through setback after setback'I've been fully focused on Tokyo'	"""I knew I was disabled, but I never wanted to live what I thought was a disabled life.""On 13 June 2009, a young Lauren Jones was climbing a tree with a friend when she slipped, fell 20 feet to the ground hitting a branch on the way and breaking her spine.Aged 13 and a promising footballer, Jones was on the books of Brighton & Hove Albion when she was told she would never walk again.A decade since the accident, Jones is now a professional GB wheelchair tennis player on the road to the Paralympics.The Worthing-born teenager was initially airlifted to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester where doctors quickly learned her injuries were too severe. She needed to be transferred to Southampton General Hospital.""I was in a room of about 20 other people, a couple of my surgeons who had flown in from America to operate on me and the rest were nurses and my parents,"" Jones recalls to BBC Sport.""I was laying there in a neck cast and everyone was crying. They told me I would never walk again.""I laughed. It was a shock reaction, I thought it wasn't real.""It wasn't until I looked at all these professionals completely heartbroken and the look on my parents' faces, that for me is when it hit home.""Today, Jones is former junior world number one in her sport and has been ranked as high as 24 in her senior singles career.But her career has not been easy. She has faced multiple injury setbacks, including missing out on the Paralympics in Rio 2016 and has recently been diagnosed with Crohn's disease.Despite setbacks, Jones continues to work towards her goal of competing in the Tokyo Paralympics in 2020, and talks to BBC Sport about:Before her accident at Chichester Boat Marina in 2009, Jones was a promising footballer. She played for her local team in Worthing and had just started playing for Brighton & Hove Albion Girls Centre of Excellence.She had previously played for the Seagulls as a nine-year-old, but was told to return once she had a growth spurt in her teenage years.But that return would unfortunately coincide with her accident and Jones found it hard to adjust to the news she would never walk again.""I used to lay in my hospital bed trying to move my legs,"" she said. ""It was a completely life-changing experience and really tough to take.""But when she finally began to understand the severity of her accident, she started asking questions.""I wanted to know what I couldn't do anymore,"" she said. ""One of the first things I asked is 'could I travel?' which is ironic considering now I travel the world every month competing.""The football lover was a season ticket holder at Reading. Just several hours after finding out about her future, she was asking whether her new disability meant she would be able to get better seats at the Madejski Stadium.""It was the end of my footballing career, but I knew I wanted to be involved in sport.""As Jones regained the strength to move her arms, she started to become a bit of a character on her ward at Southampton General Hospital.""I was known for being a bit of a joker, making skid marks as I raced around in a wheelchair and creating a basketball hoop out of a sick bucket,"" she recalls.""I told doctors I wanted to be involved in sport.""But they were concerned the initial surgery would not cater for the sporting lifestyle Jones wanted.""There was a chance the rods and screws that realigned my spine from the first surgery would bend and potentially break,"" she said.""My parents had the choice of putting me into major surgery so I could have a better quality of life, but with the risk I may not survive.""I always say it's the best decision they've ever made. They had to collapse both my lungs and put me on life support.""They removed one of my ribs, blended it and put the mashed up bone inside my vertebra, surrounded by a metal cage.""The surgery was a success and enabled Jones to go on and immerse herself in sport.Due to her strong desire to play sport and just over two years since her major surgery, Jones was selected for a Paralympic training day at the age of 16.""I think I was the only one there that wasn't over 25 with massive muscles,"" she said.After trying a variety, Jones was selected to progress in four sports, eventually deciding to pursue tennis.""I liked the technical side of tennis and how the professional level of the game ran alongside the able-bodied game such as Grand Slams and Wimbledon,"" she added.""Before my accident, I didn't know disabled people could play sport, so I didn't go into tennis with any expectations of becoming professional.""But, within two years of starting to play, I was junior world number one.""Jones went on to win doubles with the boys' junior number one at the time, Alfie Hewett, who has since won three Wimbledon titles and two silver medals at Rio 2016, and is now ranked world number four.Soon realising she had natural ability in the sport, Jones decided to move away from education to focus on her new goal of becoming a professional tennis player.Jones has competed all over the world as a professional athlete since taking up wheelchair tennis.Sadly, following automatic qualification, she was ruled out of the 2016 Rio Paralympics because of injury.""That was four years of work where I wanted to compete in Rio that was taken away from me,"" she said.The blow has spurred Jones on to work towards Tokyo 2020, but that too has had its setbacks, including being diagnosed with Crohn's disease last year.Crohn's is an inflammatory bowel disease, its symptoms including fatigue, malnourishment and stomach pain.""It can have serious effects on your body, I was falling asleep by seven o'clock every night,"" she added.""I just assumed that's what it was like to be a professional athlete with Crohn's.""Jones' pain and exhaustion worried doctors and after multiple tests, they found the then 23-year-old had two abscesses the size of tennis balls attached to her ovaries and bowel.She was rushed to hospital in March this year needing surgery, and has had to spend three months out of training in the run up to Tokyo.""It was a very upsetting and tough time for me, they told me I might not be able to have children. It was just the wrong timing following not being able to qualify for Rio,"" she said.""I didn't want it to get the better of me so I focused on my career off court.""I created a really great network of businesses and people around me and turned it into a positive.""Jones' profile has grown rapidly this year, noticed by Worthing's local anonymous street artist Horace, who creates portraits of the town's icons, including rock singer Billy Idol.Coming back from injury in May, Jones has to now climb the ranks to earn automatic qualification for Tokyo.Once 24th in the world, recent injuries have seen her drop to 61st. To be in with the chance of competing in the Paralympics, she needs to reach the top 25.Since her return, Jones has had five tournaments, winning two doubles, two singles and a career highlight beating world number 21 Macarena Cabrillana from Chile in February.Her progress has been promising and she beams by the tennis court she trains at in Southampton as she looks ahead to the Paralympics.""I'm playing the best I've ever played, I'm the strongest I've ever been and I feel like I'm in the best place I've ever been in my career.""Those recent performances have seen Jones climb back into the world's top 50 and she will surely leave no stone unturned in her bid to reach the top 25 in time for Tokyo."

sport	Peterborough United's Toney, Maddison & Eisa - more prolific than Salah and co	'We're happy hogging the goals''Flawed geniuses' wantedToney the jewel in the crown	"They have scored more goals this season than Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane.In fact, Ivan Toney, Marcus Maddison and Mo Eisa have a combined goals total that is higher than every other club in England's top four divisions - with the exception of Manchester City and Oxford United.Peterborough United have long been associated with developing up-and-coming strikers, selling around £30m of attacking talent over the past decade.Toney, Maddison and Eisa are the club's latest hotshots and they spoke to BBC Sport about being England's most prolific front three.Peterborough's 39 goals from 17 League One games makes them the country's highest scorers - but more staggering is that 33 of those have been shared by the three players.Toney and Eisa have 12 each and Maddison nine - with Eisa and Maddison also scoring once in the FA Cup.Midfielder Josh Knight is the only other player to find the net more than once for Posh this season.""We've got a great partnership, us three - every game we know we're going to score, and that confidence is a good thing to have,"" club-record signing Eisa told BBC Sport.""The manager [Darren Ferguson] puts so much pressure on us. Because we've got the three of us I think we'll continue this throughout the whole season.""A continuation of their current 2.29 per game average would see Posh bag 100 league goals this season and surely see them secure a return to the Championship after a seven-year absence, having been relegated in 2012-13 despite earning 54 points.""We're happy hogging the goals, but if others chip in it's obviously great,"" said former Newcastle striker Toney.""We just want to score as many goals as we can, all three of us, and I'm sure if we all come off the pitch and none of us have scored we're going to be angry.""But despite the trio's exploits Darren Ferguson's side are only fourth in the table - below Wycombe, Ipswich and Coventry who have scored 27, 25 and 22 goals respectively - primarily because of five defeats .""When I first signed for Peterborough I wanted to achieve promotion, and unfortunately year after year I've failed to achieve that with my team-mates,"" said playmaker Maddison, who claims he ""doesn't score goals"" despite his nine so far this term.His manager agrees that however prolific his forwards are, it is the league position in May that matters, saying: ""It's all well and good them scoring goals and having a fantastic season [but] if we don't get what we're after then it won't be deemed as a success by anyone.""Since chairman Darragh MacAnthony took over 13 years ago, Peterborough have signed several exciting forward players and sold them on for big profits.Dwight Gayle, Britt Assombalonga, Jack Marriott, Craig Mackail-Smith, George Boyd and Lee Tomlin all made names for themselves at Peterborough - and the list doesn't end there...So what is the club's recipe for talent-spotting success?""You're looking for a flawed genius. At our level you're not going to get a genius unless there's flaws,"" said MacAnthony, who last year sold half of his stake in the club to two Canada-based investors.""Brentford, Preston and Barnsley have definitely followed us on the talent, gem and lower league scouting side of things.""We're probably the best producers of talent from a revenue point of view, when it comes to attacking players.""The past decade has seen a conveyor belt of sharp-shooters pass through Peterborough, with Ferguson - in his third spell as manager - at the forefront alongside the owners and director of football Barry Fry.""I think our model's a very good one - it's now being repeated by others but we started it a long time ago in the sense that we wanted young, hungry players that could be coached and developed, and try to fulfil their potential,"" Ferguson said.The thing that sets the club aside from most is they almost court offers for their players, hyping them up and putting them firmly in the shop window - but for a price.""As well as a sport, football is a business. The best clubs in the world lose their players - who would've thought Real Madrid would sell Ronaldo?"" MacAnthony said.""If a player wants to go he's going to go - we give players an opportunity, if they do well and a bigger club come in, and it works for us, then fine.""While former Cheltenham and Bristol City striker Eisa is seen as the finisher and Maddison - described as being a ""free spirit"" and ""misunderstood"" - is the so-called assist king, the biggest excitement currently centres on 23-year-old Toney.He emerged at Northampton before a move to Premier League Newcastle, where his four substitute appearances matched the number of spells he spent out on loan.Costing just over £500,000 in the summer of 2018, he already has 35 Posh goals to his name, leading the chairman to insist a League One record fee - eclipsing the £11m paid by Everton for Ademola Lookman in 2017 - would be needed to prise him away.""Ivan Toney is better than what we've had before and his physicality means he'll go for more,"" said Irishman MacAnthony.""All our strikers have had pace but he has physical presence. That's why I put a premium on Ivan - if anyone in the top half of the Championship buys him, that gets promotion - which is worth £200m.""He will in the future go and we'll have to replace him.""Toney's manager agrees he could ""top the whole lot"" of strikers to have passed through the doors over the past 10 years, which is quite a compliment.Whether he is sold in January, next summer or later remains to be seen, but the player himself is casual about all possible outcomes.""Everyone can say how much we're worth, or how much we're going to go for, but we can't really look into that too much,"" he said.""If there's a move on the cards and it doesn't happen then that's not going to affect any of us because we're all happy where we are, scoring goals and playing well."""
sport	UK Championship: Judd Trump cruises through but Shaun Murphy suffers shock loss	Trump stays on track for 'treble'	"World number one Judd Trump raced into the second round of the UK Championship, but there was a shock first-round defeat for Shaun Murphy at the York Barbican.Reigning world champion Trump was in relaxed mood as he outclassed world number 127 Amine Amiri 6-0.Murphy, champion in 2008, let a 3-1 lead slip in his 6-4 defeat against world number 121 Eden Sharav.""That's the best win of my career,"" said Sharav, 27.""I have beaten some good players, like Stuart Bingham and Ali Carter, but that's definitely the best.""It's the first time I have won here. To beat a player like Shaun is amazing.""Sharav had not won a match in six previous attempts this season but scored four breaks of more than 50 and held his nerve impressively in the latter stages to progress.""I wasn't at my best but didn't play terribly,"" Murphy said. ""I didn't see that coming. I've had a good season. Credit to Eden. He played fabulously and he took his chances. I have no real complaints.""Trump, the UK champion in 2011, has won five ranking titles in this calendar year, including a first Crucible success and a Masters title.Victory over Moroccan Amiri, who was making just his second appearance on the snooker tour, means he could still become the first player to hold all of snooker's 'Triple Crown' events of World Championship, UK Championship and Masters at the same time since Mark Williams when he won all three in the 2002-03 season. The last player to win all three in a calendar year was Stephen Hendry in 1996.Trump said: ""It's good to be playing well.""I am on a good spell. You never know when it can end so you just have to enjoy it.""It's good to get through and be in the tournament properly,"" added Trump, who scored one century in the whitewash.In the morning session, Trump's good friend, the world number 13 Jack Lisowski, had little trouble seeing off David Lilley 6-2 to secure his place in round two.The Gloucester man, 28, was not at his best, but was still a class above his opponent despite having to play with a new cue.Scotland's Alan McManus, 48, was also a first-round winner, the world number 55, opening with two centuries on his way to an impressive 6-1 success against over England's Elliott Slessor to tee up a match with Barry Hawkins."
sport	Gareth Southgate believes England are now seen as a threat at Euro 2020		"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland manager Gareth Southgate believes his team will be seen as a threat to win Euro 2020 next summer.After a surprise run to the World Cup semi-finals in Russia last year, England are joint bookmakers' favourites along with France to win the tournament.The Three Lions will play all three group games at Wembley, which will also host the semi-finals and final.""We've gained some respect and people would view us as a threat, which certainly wasn't the case ahead of Russia,"" Southgate told BBC Sport.""We also know we have got to improve to another level.""It's hard to assess exactly where we are after this qualifying campaign. But if we look at a World Cup semi-final, a Nations League semi-final, and qualifying with the most goals in Europe, we have done all we can and we are on a good track.""The draw for the finals takes place on Saturday in Bucharest (live on BBC 2, 17:00 GMT).England already know they will be in Group D at Euro 2020. They will be joined by one of France, Poland, Croatia and Switzerland from Pot Two, as well as one from Portugal, Turkey, Austria, the Czech Republic and Sweden from Pot Three.If Scotland come through their play-offs in March, they will play England at Wembley.Before the draw, BBC sports editor Dan Roan spoke to Southgate to get his thoughts on where England are as they prepare to stage part of a major tournament for the first time since Euro 96.We sat down this time two years ago in Moscow for the World Cup. How does it feel now, before your second major tournament in the job?We're better prepared as a whole staff for what lies ahead, the realisation that what got us to this point won't be enough to be successful in the summer. So we are a more experienced group of staff for sure, the playing squad is more experienced in some aspects, and in others we are very young again.So we are excited, but the continuity of thinking is that we are excited by the challenge ahead.How much further advanced is the team after reaching the World Cup semi-finals? And what is the difference between this group and those that have struggled in the past?You could argue that we had more experienced teams. I don't know about more talented, but we certainly had teams that had Champions League winners throughout the squad and a high number of caps. This is a different time for English football.We have a lot of young, exciting players coming through, they are used to working at St George's Park, they are used to coming through the development teams together which has given them a strong bond, and they are very clear on the style of play that we want to play.Years ago, we didn't have the advantages of having our own training facility, but ultimately it's down to the group of players and how much England is part of their lives and how important it is for them to win.Have you developed and grown as a manager over the last few years?I heard Jose Mourinho the other day say that he will make mistakes but not the same mistakes that he's made in the past. That's the life of a coach. You should never stop learning. Every day there is a new challenge, and the game and the world evolves so quickly that you have to be ahead of new training methods and new technology and everything else, so that's part of the process.Are England viewed differently now and are they a team that others now want to avoid?I think we've gained some respect, and I think people would view us as a threat which certainly wasn't the case ahead of Russia. We also know we have got to improve to another level.It's hard to assess exactly where we are after this qualifying campaign. But if we look at a World Cup semi-final, a Nations League semi-final, and qualifying with the most goals in Europe, we have done all we can and we are on a good track.In the World Cup, there still seemed to be a small gap between England and the top teams? Has it closed? Are England at that level now?In terms of consistency of performance, we are. Nobody else got to the World Cup semi-finals and the latter stages of the Nations League. So we are in that mix of teams, but there are lot of good teams and the difference on one day between any of the top 10 teams is so marginal in football.It's a bit different in rugby union, where there are only really four or five contenders. With us in the European Championships, it's always been more random than a World Cup actually, so you could look at any one of 10 teams and think they could win it.How inspired have you been by England's cricket and rugby union teams?It's always great to see people from our country doing well, it does inspire you. It reminds you of what it can feel like when everybody is involved and the nation is watching and the excitement of it.You see the level of detail and performance that is needed to be the best in the world in any sport. I loved watching both teams play, and as an Englishman I was really proud of what they did and it was heart-warming to see.How big an advantage will it be to play three group games at Wembley?Ten or 12 teams will get the opportunity to play group matches at home, so a lot of teams will benefit from that. That will be a brilliant experience for our players and fans to have that part of the tournament at home.We then have to go on the road like everybody else and it becomes more like a normal tournament for the knockout phase. If we are good enough to get to the semi-finals then we have the advantage of that being at Wembley, which would be brilliant.Is getting to a semi-final at Wembley the target?It's hard to assess what our target would be. We always have an internal view of where we can get to, but there are so many random things that can happen with the draw so we have to got to make sure we are performing at a level where we can beat those better teams.We are getting towards that level. We want to be in the games that matter all the time, the latter stages of tournaments and if you are in the latter stages often enough then you start to win them. That's the same with all big teams.How big could next summer be and will the draw spark excitement?The draw is always a decisive moment for everybody, knowing the dates and knowing what the route looks like. The country feels like they have been more engaged with the team over the last two years and that's one of the biggest highlights for me when I travel around, that people do care.I knew they did, but I think everybody was wounded by disappointment. The players deserve huge credit for that. They have played and conducted themselves in a way which people have been proud to watch them.How does this compare to the Euro 96 squad which you were part of and is this a second chance to put that right?In terms of the teams, they are very different. We had seven club captains and quite a few players in their late twenties and some in their early thirties, so this team is in a different moment in their journey, both individually and collectively.The tournament next summer is not about me and redemption. On a personal level, the World Cup in Russia was, I guess, my own catharsis of getting out of a penalty shoot-out. That was something that was nice to do, but the team is about the player and the team is about our fans and it's more important that we make them proud. We have to win matches to do that.There are only a few friendlies left before naming your squad. How many of your starting XI do you know and how many places are up for grabs?You know if you played tomorrow you would have a very clear idea. But at this stage when we last saw them they had played 12 league matches and when we next see them they will have played 30.So their form and fitness, because a lot of difference between those players is very tight, a lot of them we will learn as much about them with their clubs as we will do with England before the tournament.That is the reality. There are definitely places up for grabs and there is competition for places. We are pretty clear on how we want to play and at the moment there are some ahead of others, but that can change for sure.Was the reported interest from Tottenham flattering? Do you realistically see your journey with England still lasting until 2022?I haven't planned anything in my managerial career. None of the jobs that I've taken were a reality in my mind until about 48 hours before they happened.I love the job I'm doing, we have an exciting team which continues to improve. At every team you work with, there maybe comes a moment when the fans or the players have had enough of you and that's probably the time to go. I don't sense that at the moment.For me, in the next month we are going to the draw for the Euros and to do some planning for Qatar and that would be my focus.The team is known for its togetherness. But the recent incident (between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez) was the first challenge for you as regards that unity so do you have any regrets about how it was handled? Is the England culture back on track?For sure, it's not the only challenge we have had to our culture over three years. Absolutely it is done. From the group of players and internally, it was done by Tuesday morning.Of course, with England there is always going to be noise around that and noise from outside the camp and that's part of what we have to deal with. That's one of the challenges of the national team.You know as a leader there are often going to be situations where however you deal with something, there will be a negative response to it. You just have to accept it. You can't share all the details with people, you can't necessarily defend yourself and it's not the right thing to do.So we know the landscape but the team are very together. I know the two boys have moved on from it and I'm sure we will have similar disagreements between people moving forward and for certain we will have learned a lot from what we went through.You've had the chance to reflect on what happened during the qualifier in Bulgaria a few weeks ago when racial abuse meant the game was stopped twice, with your players close to walking off. What has been the effect on them and the sport generally do you think?We were the first national team to go as far through that protocol as we did, and it was a very difficult topic for all of us. But I hope we have made [a difference] in people's minds.I know people in cricket the last couple of days have talked about what we did [following the racist abuse of England's Jofra Archer in New Zealand], and they felt it had a positive impact, which is good.It's sad we are still having to deal with this situation in this day and age, but the most important for me was our players felt supported and felt very together that night, and subsequently.And if we have an opportunity because of our position as a national team, if we have an opportunity to make a difference to some social issues, then we should seize that chance."
sport	Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Time to say goodbye to F1 2019	Perfectly pristine but lacking excitementWhat's the form guide like for Abu Dhabi?How to follow on the BBC	"And so the curtain prepares to come down on the 2019 F1 season under the floodlights of the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi.After a thrilling Brazilian Grand Prix, which saw Red Bull's Max Verstappen twice pass world champion Lewis Hamilton on his way to victory, the drivers are again racing for pride with the title long since wrapped up by the British Mercedes driver.Restoring pride is very much on Ferrari's agenda after the nightmare collision between Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc at Interlagos, with the Scuderia desperate to put on a united front before the end credits roll.Elsewhere, the traditional end-of-season goodbyes will be in full swing, with Renault's Nico Hulkenberg among those bidding farewell.Hulkenberg is without a seat for next year, and with only one 2020 drive to be filled - Williams have yet to replace the departing Robert Kubica - it seems likely the German's 10-year F1 career is at an end, for now at least.Abu Dhabi arrived on the calendar in 2009 and took over as the season finale from the much-loved Interlagos.Expats and fans from all over Europe flock to this sunny destination for a blast of some much-needed winter vitamin D. The facilities are as flash and futuristic as you'd expect, given the bottomless pit of money that was made available for its construction.The Hermann Tilke-designed track is surrounded by seven hotels, Michelin-starred restaurants and Monaco-style mega yachts in the marina of Yas Island.A bonding session between Vettel and Leclerc could also be perfectly accommodated at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi. The mostly indoor amusement park is a Scuderia supporter's dream and is home to Formula Rossa, the world's fastest rollercoaster.The circuit itself is camera-ready pristine, with a manicured backdrop of twinkling lights and picturesque palm trees. Lights out at dusk means plenty of atmospheric shots of drivers racing off into the sunset.In 2013 the event even coincided with a partial solar eclipse to add a bit more visual drama to the proceedings.Two long straights, a minor elevation point and 21 nondescript turns leave a slight sterile feel to the season finale. The best chance of an overtake - and hopefully some Brazilian-style driver contact - is into Turns Eight and 11.Abu Dhabi has witnessed a few heart-stopping moments. Hulkenberg emerged unhurt from a frightening-looking accident in which he was pitched into a roll and landed upside down in a first-lap clash with Romain Grosjean's Haas 12 months ago.Hulkenberg sounded frantic as he came over the team over to say: ""I'm hanging here like a cow. Get me out. There's fire."" The marshals were quick to react and the German was able to climb out unaided.Yas Marina probably isn't a circuit that is going to provide the unfamiliar faces on the podium like the Brazilian Grand Prix did two weeks ago.Hamilton has won four times in Abu Dhabi - three with Mercedes and once for McLaren - while Mercedes as constructors have taken five victories.Hamilton dominated last year's race from pole with a controlled drive to end 2018 with 11 victories.The Briton can repeat the achievement again this weekend if he takes the chequered flag for the first time since the Mexican Grand Prix in October.Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas celebrated an impressive victory from the front of the grid in 2017, holding off the threat of Hamilton to record Mercedes' third one-two finish at in a row at Yas Marina.However, the Finn may have to take a grid penalty in Abu Dhabi if his car needs a new engine following his retirement at Interlagos.Andrew Shovlin, Mercedes' trackside engineering director, explained what happened to Bottas' car in a Twitter Q&A: ""When you started to see the smoke, the rate at which the oil was being consumed increased and eventually the car actually switched itself off.""That power unit has come back to Brixworth, they are going to be looking at it and will be making an assessment of whether there has actually been any damage and whether or not we will need to take a penalty.""In 10 years of racing in the United Arab Emirates, Ferrari have never recorded a win at Yas Marina. Vettel is just one behind Hamilton with three victories at the track but of all them came during his multiple title-winning period with Red Bull.The German took the inaugural win here in 2009, then sealed his maiden F1 championship twelve months later with a memorable display that saw the then 23-year-old start the day in third place in the drivers' standings.Vettel has at least enjoyed podium success in the UAE with Ferrari, including a second-placed finish last year and consecutive third-placed finishes in 2016 and 2017.BBC Sport has live coverage of practice, qualifying and the race, across the website and BBC Radio 5 Live. There will be live digital coverage on the BBC Sport website and app - including audience interaction, expert analysis, debate, features, interviews and audio content.You can follow all the action and the latest news on the BBC Sport F1 page and via the BBC Sport app, and catch up with analysis and interviews with the BBC Radio 5 Live Chequered Flag podcast."
sport	Unai Emery: Arsenal manager may have taken club as far as he can - Martin Keown	'I am being positive but I'm also realistic'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceArsenal's home defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt showed manager Unai Emery ""may have taken the team as far as he can"", said ex-Gunner Martin Keown.Arsenal took the lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but Daichi Kamada's double secured a 2-1 victory for Frankfurt, although the Gunners remain top of Europa League Group F.Keown said his old club's second-half performance was a ""shambles"".""He seems to have lost the players and the desire has ebbed away,"" he added.The Gunners will seal qualification for the knockout stages if they avoid a heavy defeat at Standard Liege in their final group game, but Keown questioned whether Emery can still ""motivate"" his players.The final whistle brought boos and jeers from fans at a sparsely-populated Emirates Stadium and means Arsenal are on their longest winless run since February 1992.""The team selection, the team motivation, the substitutions, the performance, everything was missing here. It was a dreadful performance,"" Keown told BT Sport.""I think maybe the manager may be in a position where he feels he needs to step aside now. Serious questions need to be asked. This is as bad as I have seen it and it is relegation form [when they return to Premier League action].""Decisions need to be made, otherwise the club is going to plunge further down the table.""The fans turned on [former manager] Terry Neil, 37 years ago. I was at the club when it happened and things got very toxic. I think we are getting close to that again.""But former England defender Keown added: ""I think he will get the time because there isn't a ready-made replacement.""Emery, who has won the competition three times as a manager and also steered the Gunners to the final last season, said his side ""lost control for 15 minutes"".""We showed an improvement in the first half and we had a lot of opportunities to score but we did not take them,"" said the Spaniard, whose side have gone seven games without a win.""The first five or 10 minutes of the second half were good but then we lost control and we could not change the result. We tried to come back but we did not create any big opportunities to score.""I am being positive but I'm also realistic and we lost against a good opponent. We have improved from our last match and we are still first [in the group] and have the opportunity to qualify, but we missed the opportunity tonight.""Following Emery's comments, former Arsenal striker John Hartson said the Spaniard's interview ""sounded a bit delusional"".""It's like he's hiding from the reality that his team just aren't good enough,"" said the Welshman.""I'd love a manager who was as kind as that. I know he's trying to protect his players and if I performed like that I wouldn't want to go into training and see my manager."""

Faddes joins Stuart McCloskey in midfield and Johnston partners Cooney in the half-backs.Treadwell's inclusion in the second row is one of two changes in the forwards, with Rea returning at blind-side flanker.Scarlets, who lie second in Conference B with five wins from six outings, are without a number of players on duty with Wales, who play the Barbarians on Saturday.Ulster are second in Conference A with four wins from six but trail leaders Leinster by nine points.Dan McFarland's side come into the game at Kingspan Stadium on the back of wins over Bath and Clermont in their opening two European games.The Irish province defeated Scarlets in three of the four meetings between the teams last season.Ulster: Ludik; Baloucoune, Faddes, McCloskey, Gilroy; Johnston, Cooney; O'Sullivan, Herring, Moore; A O'Connor, Treadwell; Matthew Rea, Reidy, Coetzee.Replacements: McBurney, Warwick, O'Toole, D O'Connor, Timoney, Shanahan, Curtis, Kernohan.Scarlets: S Evans; Baldwin, S Hughes (capt), Asquith, M Williams; D Jones, Hardy; P Price, Elias, Lee, Rawlins, Lousi, Cassiem, Macleod, Thomson.Replacements: M Jones, D Evans, Kruger, Cummins, J Morgan, J Evans, Lamb, Conbeer.

sport	Euro 2020 draw: What you need to know	Who could the home nations face?How do the other groups look?So what are we actually waiting to know?Why do we know this much already?How can I follow the draw?Where are the games?	"The Euro 2020 draw takes place on Saturday from 17:00 GMT in Bucharest - live on BBC Two - with England and Wales waiting to discover their opponents.Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will also be watching with interest - with all three sides playing in the play-offs next March.But the unique nature of this tournament - with the qualified countries of the 12 host cities having to be placed in specific groups - means some things have already been decided.England know which group they will be in - while there are only two options for Wales.So what do we know - and why? What are the best and worst-case scenarios for the British nations? And how can you follow it?England already know they will be in Group D because Wembley is hosting three games in that group. The winners of Scotland's Euro 2020 play-offs (Path C) will also be in the group.The Three Lions and Scotland could end up in a group with world champions France and European champions Portugal, because they are among the second and third seeds respectively.Seeding is based on positions and then points in the qualifying groups, rather than world rankings.But a kinder draw would see them in with Poland and the Czech Republic, ranked 21st and 43rd in the world respectively. England met the Czechs in qualifying, winning 5-0 at Wembley but losing 2-1 in Prague.England will host all three of their group games, with Scotland at Hampden Park in their other two games if they qualify. Steve Clarke's side need to get past Israel at home on 26 March and then Norway or Serbia away five days later to qualify.That means England will not know all their opponents until 31 March. Statisticians Gracenote give Scotland a 19% chance of qualifying, with Norway most likely to progress at 40%.There are only two groups Wales could be in - A or B.Group B, which has already been finalised apart from Wales or Finland, would see Ryan Giggs' side in with Belgium, Russia and Denmark.They beat the first two of those on their way to the Euro 2016 semi-finals and lost twice to Denmark in last year's Nations League.If they are in Group A - Italy's group - they could end up with the Azzurri, France and Portugal - or Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic.Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Gracenote, says: ""There is probably not much difference between A and B for Wales pre-draw. If either the Czech Republic or Austria ended up in Group A though, Wales would not be the outsiders to progress.""The other home nation still keeping a close eye on the draw are Northern Ireland. They are in the March play-offs, away to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the semi-finals and at home to the Republic of Ireland or Slovakia in the final - if they beat the Bosnians first.The winners of those play-offs will be in Group E with Spain. Two of their group games will be in Dublin, with the game against Spain in Bilbao.The most difficult group for Northern Ireland (or the Republic) would see them in with Spain, France and Portugal. The easiest according to the world rankings would be Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic.Gracenote say Northern Ireland have a 21% chance, with a 16% chance for the Republic of Ireland. Bosnia are clear favourites, with a 39% probability of winning.Ukraine and the Netherlands are in Group C, while Germany do not know any of their opponents in Group F yet.These two groups are linked because Bucharest hosts half the Group C games, with three Group F fixtures in Budapest. But Romania and Hungary are both in the Path A play-offs - so only one can qualify.If Romania win the play-offs, they will go into Group C with Ukraine and the Netherlands - and the Path D side will be in Group F. If Iceland, Bulgaria or Hungary win Path A they will go into Group F with Germany, with the Path D winner going into Group C.Euro 2020 runs from 12 June to 12 July, with Italy involved in the opening game at the Stadio Olimpico - with the final at WembleyWith the play-off winners not being decided until 31 March, only 11 teams are waiting to find out which group they will be in.There are four groups France, Poland, Switzerland and Croatia could be placed in - and five possibilities for third seeds Portugal, Turkey, Austria, Sweden and the Czech Republic.Then Wales and Finland will be in Group A or B.The draw starts with teams from Pot 1 (ie the top seeds) - although we already know which group each of them will be placed in.To determine the position of the team in the group - eg A1, A2, A3 or A4 - a ball is drawn from a bowl. This decides the order of who plays when in the group. England's three games are on Sunday, 14 June, Friday, 19 June and Tuesday, 23 June - but they do not yet know when the potential Scotland game would be.The draw continues with Pot 2, 3 and 4 to decide which group they are in, and then which position of that group they take. That means Wales will not discover their group until nearly the end of the draw.So much has already been decided because any hosts who qualify need to be placed in the group that their home games are in. So England and Scotland (if they qualify) have been destined to play in the same group since a random draw on 7 December 2017 - likewise Spain and the Republic of Ireland.Because four of the top seeds are hosts, their groups are set in stone - so there were only two groups left that the other two top seeds could go in. But Ukraine are not allowed to be in a group with Russia for political reasons (although they could meet in the knockouts) so it means there was only one group they could go in, leaving Belgium in the other.And with the four play-off winners needing to go in specific groups (even though two of them may be swapped around) it means there are only two possible groups that Wales and Finland - also bottom seeds as the two teams to qualify with the fewest points - can be placed in.The draw will be shown live on BBC Two and on the BBC Sport website, alongside a live text commentary, from 17:00 until 18:30 GMT.Mark Chapman will be presenting with former Wales boss Mark Hughes, ex-England defender Micah Richards and French football journalist Julien Laurens.The uninterrupted feed of the draw will be available on the BBC Red Button and BBC Sport website.You can also listen to the draw during Sports Report on BBC Radio 5 Live.England benefit from hosting all their group games, as well as the semi-finals and final - so it is possible to map out where all their games would be in the tournament. There is one last-16 tie at Wembley, although Gareth Southgate's side could not play in that one.The top two teams from each group go through to the last 16, along with the four best third-placed teams. That means only eight teams actually go out in the group stages.Wales will face at least one trip to Azerbaijan or Russia - with their two possible groups being hosted in Rome-Baku or Copenhagen-St Petersburg."
sport	Nuno Espirito Santo is a potential replacement if Arsenal sack Unai Emery		"Arsenal have identified Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo as a potential replacement for Unai Emery if the Gunners decide to sack the Spaniard.Head coach Emery is under pressure after a winless run of six matches across all competitions.Arsenal have only won four of 13 Premier League games this season.BBC Sport understands that if Emery is sacked and Nuno is allowed to speak to Arsenal, then the Portuguese would be a strong contender to take over.Nuno said it would be ""disrespectful"" to talk about being linked with Arsenal when asked in a news conference before his side's Europa League tie against Braga on Thursday.""I wouldn't ever mention an issue which is not a reality,"" he said. ""Speaking about a job which has a manager would be disrespectful and I will not do so.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceEmery said he still has the full support of the club, having been warned results must improve while being offered public backing by the Arsenal hierarchy earlier this month.""Really the club is supporting me,"" he said. ""I feel the club, everyone responsible in that area, is backing me. Really I appreciate it a lot.""I feel strong with that support and know my responsibility to come back and change that situation.""The former Sevilla and Paris St-Germain boss added he is only focused on ""today and tomorrow"" as he prepares for his side's Europa League match at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.""My job is to prepare for the match, to show the best performance in front of our supporters,"" he said.Arsenal go into Thursday's game top of Group F, four points clear of both their German opponents and Standard Liege.On Sunday, a number of Arsenal fan groups called for ""urgent action"" over the ""state of things"" at the club.""My focus is only today and tomorrow, to do all the things that we have worked on here at the training ground,"" Emery added.""We know our supporters were disappointed by the draw against Southampton, but we have the perfect chance to reconnect with our supporters.""Our wish is that every supporter tomorrow helps the team, we need them.""Arsenal are also eight points adrift of the top four and 19 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool."

sport	Guinea stadium finally hosts matches		A 50,000 seat stadium in the Guinea capital Conakry is finally hosting matches eight years after construction work was completed.It is being used to host games at the ongoing West African Football Union (Wafu) Zone A Under-20 Championship in Guinea.Work on the stadium, which was funded by the Chinese government, began in 2007 and handed over to Guinea four years later.Despite the main construction being completed BBC Sport understands that the stadium was unable to host matches immediately as some of the other facilities needed were not finished.Just an hour before the stadium hosted its first match on Sunday, the Guinean prime minister Ibrahima Kassory Fofana formerly announced the stadium had been named after General Lansana Conte who was president.The stadium is now the second standard stadium in Conakry after the 28 September stadium.Fittingly Guinea won the first game in the stadium as they beat Mauritania 2-0 in the opening match of the Wafu under-20 tournament.The honour of the first goals in the new arena went to Algassimou Bah and Lamine Soumah.Fans did not have to wait long to witness the stadium's first hat-trick either as Pape Matar helped Senegal to a 4-1 win over Sierra Leone in the second Group A match.Seven countries are taking part in the two-week tournament with Liberia, The Gambia and Mali in Group B after Guinea Bissau were late withdrawals.The top two teams in each pool will advance to the semi-finals.
sport	Arsenal sack Unai Emery: Manager leaves after 18 months in charge		"Media playback is not supported on this deviceUnai Emery has been sacked as Arsenal manager after 18 months in charge.The Spaniard, who previously led Paris St-Germain to the French league title and won three Europa Leagues with Sevilla, was appointed Gunners boss in May 2018, succeeding Arsene Wenger.He has been replaced on a temporary basis by assistant and former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg.Arsenal said the decision had been ""taken due to results and performances not being at the level required"".The Gunners have not won in seven games and lost 2-1 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday.It is their worst run without a victory since February 1992, which was eight games under George Graham.They are without a Premier League victory since 6 October and eight points off the top four.Ljungberg took training on Friday and the Arsenal statement added: ""We have full confidence in Freddie to take us forward.""The search for a new head coach is under way and we will make a further announcement when that process is complete.""Ljungberg posted on social media: ""However long I oversee Arsenal for I will give everything I have to put smiles on faces again. We have a busy few weeks ahead and the team needs your support. Let's get to work.""Arsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi and technical director Edu informed Emery at about 09:00 on Friday and the players were told at 10:00 as they arrived for a recovery session.Ljungberg addressed the players and Emery also had the chance to say goodbye.On Wednesday, BBC Sport reported Arsenal had identified Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo as a potential replacement for Emery.Other names linked with the post include former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, Manchester City assistant coach Mikel Arteta, ex-Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri and Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.The Arsenal Supporters' Trust (AST) said Emery's dismissal was ""unfortunate but inevitable"" and the ""more difficult challenge is to recruit a suitable successor"".It added: ""We are far from certain that Arsenal has the right personnel to lead this process.""The AST has long been advocating that the most important changes needed at Arsenal are in the boardroom where Arsenal need better governance.""Arsenal finished fifth in 48-year-old Emery's first season in charge at Emirates Stadium after he replaced Wenger.They went into this season having spent more than £130m in the summer after signing winger Nicolas Pepe, centre-back David Luiz, left-back Kieran Tierney, striker Gabriel Martinelli and defender William Saliba, who will join next summer.The club also brought in midfielder Dani Ceballos on loan from Real Madrid.They started this season with back-to-back victories against Newcastle and Burnley, but that run ended with defeat by Liverpool, before draws with north London rivals Tottenham and Watford followed.Their last Premier League victory was a 1-0 win over Bournemouth.On Saturday, they battled to a 2-2 draw - their sixth of the season - at home to Southampton, with Alexandre Lacazette scoring an injury-time equaliser.Arsenal have conceded 19 goals in 13 top-flight games this season and former Gunners keeper Bob Wilson said the team's defensive statistics were ""frightening"".""The interesting thing is every successful side starts with the defence,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.""Look at Liverpool and them spending millions [£75m] on Virgil van Dijk, who has made their defence solid.""They [Arsenal] are shipping goals and don't seem to have any idea of the defensive structure.""Emery is the third managerial dismissal in the English top flight this season, after Javi Gracia and Pochettino departed Watford and Tottenham respectively.Arsenal's last victory came against Vitoria Guimaraes in the Europa League on 24 October, in which they needed two late Pepe free-kicks to secure a 3-2 win."
sport	West Ham 2-3 Tottenham: Jose Mourinho is 'back where he belongs'	Jose's still box officeNo histrionics, no controversy	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt has been a long 11 months for Jose Mourinho.Sacked by Manchester United on 18 December 2018, Mourinho has not exactly disappeared from public life.There were a number of interviews, a few sponsorship commitments and those compelling appearances on Sky Sports' football coverage.Only now, back in management and able to reflect on a satisfying 3-2 win for his new club Tottenham in a potentially tricky London derby at West Ham, can Mourinho admit he sometimes wondered during that time: ""What am I doing here?""He has never felt like that in the technical area. Not even when it was going wrong at United or, previously, at Chelsea when answers proved so elusive.Once Son Heung-min had scored the first goal of Mourinho's Tottenham reign to put his new club on their way to a victory at the London Stadium that was far more comfortable than the eventual scoreline suggests, life was just fine again for the 56-year-old Portuguese.""I was back where I belong,"" he said. ""This is my natural habitat.""Was I extra emotional? No. Was I nervous before the game? No. But I just love it.""To confess, the most difficult moments for me in this 11 months was the part of the summer when, for the first time, I didn't have a pre-season. I was looking at other managers and clubs doing things. It was a weird feeling.""That Mourinho was making his remarks in a packed room full of football journalists told its own story.Today's match would have been a reasonably big deal anyway given the local rivalry but, in truth, without Mourinho it would have been behind Manchester City's meeting with Chelsea and, possibly, Liverpool's win at Crystal Palace as the must-see event of the weekend.Tottenham limited media to one representative per organisation when they unveiled Mourinho at their training ground on Thursday and still had to turn down more than 50 requests for entry.The London Stadium played host to 380 football journalists in their various guises. The guy on the gate who distributes the passes and, it is not unkind to say, has been round the block a few times, said it was unprecedented.That may or may not be true. But, beyond question, Mourinho is box office. He may say, as he did again on Saturday, it is ""not about him"". But it regularly seems to end up being all about him.No matter how the relationship between manager and club works out, Tottenham will reach the end of Mourinho's time in charge with a bigger profile than they have right now.Given that chairman Daniel Levy is looking for a naming sponsor for their magnificent new stadium, and is trying to bridge a commercial gap that still exists between Spurs and the other members of England's 'big six', some astute members of the football fraternity are speculating that Mourinho's box office appeal could be a significant reason behind Levy's latest managerial appointment.So tepid were West Ham for the first 70 minutes of the game, it is impossible to draw any noteworthy conclusions from Mourinho's first match in charge.There were no significant substitutions because Tottenham were already three goals ahead when he started to make them.Before Son scored the opener, it was interesting to see Mourinho prompt him into nudging a couple of strides backwards to close the gap between him, Andriy Yarmolenko and full-back Ben Davies, who was marking him.Equally, when Tottenham got their second, Mourinho first yelled at the group of players to his left who were celebrating - then, when he got no response, to Toby Alderweireld 40 yards away to his right, to deliver an instruction.""I want to do my things and I have started doing my things,"" he said afterwards with a glint in his eye. ""I hope that you [the media] don't understand it very well and you don't speak about it a lot.""But the positional play is different and very adapted to the players.""A combination of Mourinho's managerial history and the hand gestures he was using as he delivered a mini lecture to Davies indicates emphasis was being put on making doubly sure opponents loitering in dangerous positions were being adequately watched and that the ball was being played forward quickly on the counter.The more interesting stuff, especially about Harry Kane, who is not a battering ram striker in the mould of Didier Drogba or Romelu Lukaku, for which Mourinho is noted, can only be assessed over time.As was the case at United, the early impressions of Mourinho at Tottenham have been favourable.He said it was important to hear music pumping in the dressing room after the West Ham game because it meant the players were happy. The choice was down to the players, he said - although it is understood he was stunned to hear them playing 1980s tunes on Friday. Mourinho said there needed to be a change, so Dele Alli has taken over as DJ.It will take a while for the stain of his last few weeks at Manchester United to be removed and some stereotypes will never disappear. The West Ham lift operator joked before kick-off: ""When I have finished doing this I am going to park Jose's bus.""There were no songs in the new manager's honour from the Tottenham support. But there were none for Mauricio Pochettino either.If those I spoke to beforehand are any guide, while there is huge disappointment to see the popular Argentine leave, there is also recognition that the situation could not be left as it was indefinitely because results and performances were not good enough.Mourinho has been brought in to change the dynamic. He must do so knowing many of his squad felt a special bond with Pochettino, which will not be erased because he is no longer around.Nevertheless, Mourinho looked content.His celebration at Tottenham's opener indicated an element of relief as he punched the air in front of him. But there was none of the pent-up anger from the night of his last but one victory as a manager, when he smashed a crate of bottles into the ground following a late Marouane Fellaini goal at Old Trafford.After staying for the final whistle - something he did not always do in Manchester - Mourinho just turned calmly, shook Manuel Pellegrini's hand, embraced Alli and hugged his backroom staff.No histrionics, no controversy. Just a man doing what he does best."
sport	Ulster Club SFC Final: Naomh Conaill and Kilcoo battle for glory at Omagh	McGettigan stars in semi-final win	Media playback is not supported on this deviceKilcoo and Naomh Conaill will battle for long-cherished Ulster Club Football glory in Sunday's decider at Omagh.During a run which has seen them win seven of the last eight Down titles, Kilcoo lost the 2012 and 2016 deciders.With Naomh Conaill suffering their Ulster final defeat back in 2010, Kilcoo's need might look the greater but sentiment will not decide this one.Naomh Conaill were the more impressive semi-final winners but good semi-final displays don't guarantee final wins.Still, the Glenties side's display against a highly-fancied Clontibret side spearheaded by Conor McManus marks them out as clear favourites going into the Healy Park decider.After being portrayed as a defensive outfit as they outlasted defending Ulster champions Gaoth Dohair in a Donegal Final trilogy and then held off Castlerahan, Naomh Conaill suddenly showed superb attacking intent to stun the Monaghan champions in the provincial semi-final.Centre half-forward Eoghan McGettigan hit six of Naomh Conaill's points with the closing three-point margin, if anything, flattering a decidedly second-best Clontibret.Leo McLoone's towering midfield display, aided and abetted it must be said by the efforts of captain Ciaran Thompson, laid the platform for Naomh Conaill's win.Naomh Conaill raced out of the traps to lead 0-6 to 0-1 after 16 minutes and in truth, never looked like being caught.In contrast, Kilcoo were unconvincing in their semi-final win over a Derrygonnelly side, who admittedly had shown their credentials in surprising Trillick in the quarter-finals - via a penalty shootout.Derrygonnelly missed a couple of crucial goal chances with Kilcoo having keeper Martin McCourt to thank for one particularly superb early stop to deny Shane McGullion.Even with those missed goal chances, Derrygonnelly surely still would have triumphed but for a bad free-taking afternoon.As Derrygonnelly missed their chances, Aaron Branagan's 38th-minute Kilcoo goal proved the crucial score as the Down champions held on in a frantic finale at the Athletic Grounds.Key forward Jerome Johnston will be available for Kilcoo on Sunday as his semi-final sending off came following two yellow cards.As ever, Paul Devlin's free-taking could prove crucial - particularly in a low-scoring contest - while few will begrudge the ever industrious Conor Laverty - now part of the Monaghan senior management - an Ulster Club medal if the Down champions can fashion an emotional triumph.Mickey Moran guided Slaughtneil to their 0-12 to 0-9 triumph over Kilcoo in the 2016 Ulster decider but is now at the helm of the Mourne club, with Ballinderry's 2001 All-Ireland winner Conleith Gilligan part of his management team.Gilligan will bring some insider knowledge of the opposition into Sunday's contest after stints as part of Naomh Conaill's backroom team over the past decade.What tactical plan Moran and Gilligan come up with to stifle Naomh Conaill remains to be seen. Kilcoo's method usually relies on counter-attack but predicting the nature of Sunday's game is fraught with difficulty after both semi-finals did not necessarily go to the script.
sport	Scott Williams: Wales call up Ospreys centre for injured Willis Halaholo		"Ospreys centre Scott Williams has been called into the Wales squad in place of the injured Willis Halaholo for Saturday's match against Barbarians.Halaholo will have surgery to repair his anterior cruciate ligament after he was hurt during Cardiff Blues' 14-11 European Challenge Cup defeat by Leicester on Saturday.Williams had been training with Wayne Pivac's squad since Halaholo's injury.The 58-times capped centre missed out on selection for the World Cup.Pivac named three specialist centres in his original squad, with New Zealand-born Halaholo joined by Hadleigh Parkes and Owen Watkin, for his first match since taking over from Warren Gatland.Halaholo only qualified for Wales on residency at the start of November.A statement on the Cardiff Blues' website said he will have an operation next week.Williams, a Grand Slam winner with Wales in 2012, won a Pro12 title with Pivac at Scarlets.He has returned from a serious back injury that ruled him out for most of last season and Pivac last week explained why the centre was not in the initial party to face the Barbarians on 30 November.""I know a lot about him,"" said Pivac.""I coached him for four years and he's been a very, very good player for me in the past. We've won a championship together."""

We're now focused on a really important game against Crewe Alexandra.""Embleton was originally placed in interim charge of Orient following Edinburgh's death in June. He was re-appointed to the post when the club sacked Carl Fletcher earlier this month after just 29 days in charge.In a statement following Saturday's match, Forest Green chairman Dale Vince told BBC Sport that Cooper and Edinburgh were ""close friends"" and both the referee and fourth official had confirmed to the club that neither had heard any such remarks during the game.Cooper, who has been in charge of Forest Green since May 2016, made no mention of the first-half incident in his post-match interview, in which he described the atmosphere as ""hostile""."
sport	Fantasy football tips: BBC Sport and Fantasy 606 help for gameweek three	Everton keeping it cleanMeanwhile, at Anfield...How strong should your bench be?Other things to consider...	"All hail Teemu Pukki.There were those who doubted whether Norwich's first-choice forward could cut it at Premier League level (just as they had foolishly questioned his Championship goalscoring credentials 12 months ago).However, those who backed him to continue in the top flight where he left off in last season's second tier have already received a stunning return for their humble outlay as he followed his gameweek-one strike at Anfield with a lethal hat-trick against Newcastle.But don't worry if you haven't got the Finnish finisher in your side, just like ex-Canaries striker and Fantasy 606 pundit Chris Sutton, who fears that including him will jinx him in real life (by this rationale, I owe Vincent Janssen a huge apology for having him on my bench in 2016).BBC Sport and Radio 5 live's Fantasy 606 podcast are here to help.For the first two-thirds of last season, Everton defenders were as hit and miss as a Paul Pogba penalty, with them managing just six clean sheets in the Toffees' first 27 games.However, for the last 11 matches of 2018-19 something clicked for Marco Silva's back line, with them racking up an impressive eight shutouts - a record they have followed up with two out of two at the start of this campaign. They haven't conceded at home since 6 February.Their next four fixtures (before a potentially nasty trip to champions Manchester City) are Aston Villa (a), Wolves (h), Bournemouth (a) and Sheffield United (h) - matches that could well yield yet more points for their skinflint back four.But which of the Blues' defensive quartet should you pick?Well, Lucas Digne is the obvious pick because of his ability with both an open play and set-piece delivery. He's the joint top-scoring defender in the Premier League's fantasy game on 17, level with Sheffield United's John Lundstram.However, he is, understandably, the highest priced Everton defender at £6m.If you want to save yourself £500,000, Yerry Mina (who has just a point less than Digne) and Michael Keane are alternatives. Both are big lads and a bonus threat from set-pieces.Seamus Coleman, who is also priced at £5.5m, is the other intriguing alternative, especially if he can recapture the marauding form that made him such a fantasy football darling between 2013 and 2017.Is it really time to trade out your Liverpool defenders?The Reds possess the most popular back-line in the Fantasy Premier League game, with Virgil van Dijk (selected by 51.8% of players), Andy Robertson (26.7%) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (22.8%) all in the top six of most-picked defenders.But with the cheapest of these priced at £6.5m (Van Dijk) are they providing value for money?The Reds have yet to keep a clean sheet, conceding at home to Norwich (that man Pukki) and at Southampton (cheers, Adrian).""Looking at the stats, there are a lot of worrying things here, with the Liverpool defence conceding a lot of shots on goal,"" says Statman Dave on the Fantasy 606 podcast. ""You see what Norwich did to them, opening them up with a lovely through ball.""I don't want to spend £7m on a defender that isn't going to pick up clean sheets.""In the next 10 games Liverpool have to play Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Manchester City. If there is any time to bin your Liverpool defenders it is right now.""So, it could depend on how much you back them in an attacking sense? To help you weigh it up, here are some stats...""The value has to be there,"" explains Statman Dave. ""I usually go for £4.5m players, £5m maximum, on my bench. You are rotating those guys in so you look to when they are facing teams they might beat.""You might want to look at teams like Norwich for this - players like Todd Cantwell, who has started the season well, is £4.5m and only Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne has created more chances.""You need value in your first team but then look and think: 'If a clean sheet might come at Burnley, I need one of their defenders to throw in and then take out.'""*This article originally contained a section about Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele. However, it was confirmed on Friday that he will miss Sunday's match against Newcastle United with a thigh strain."

He was found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct after being cleared of sexual misconduct.BBC Sport has contacted Hyde Peters for a comment.BBC sports editor Dan RoanLess than a year before the next Olympics, one of the UK's best publicly funded sports governing bodies lurches from one crisis to the next.UKA was already under significant scrutiny over its judgement and handling of the Alberto Salazar scandal, and its close relationship with the disgraced coach and the now-closed Nike Oregon Project.A 2015 review by the organisation cleared Sir Mo Farah - who is not accused of any wrongdoing - to continue working with Salazar despite allegations against his coach. In the wake of Salazar being banned by US Anti-Doping, the UKA Performance Director Neil Black stepped down following a disappointing World Championships.And now the incoming chief executive has been axed from her £200,000 per year role just days before she was due to start.All-powerful funding agency UK Sport will now be asked whether a financial penalty should be the consequence of such turmoil - UKA currently gets £27m in funding from them for the Tokyo cycle.UKA's recruitment of Hyde Peters will also now come under scrutiny, as could chairman Chris Clark's backing of her appointment last week after the allegations surfaced, before reviewing the evidence.In contrast, the Commonwealth Games Federation acted much more decisively, urging Birmingham 2022 to suspend her pending an investigation."

sport	'It's about football' - Botswana's female coach Carolin Braun	Warmly welcomed	"As Botswana began their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign earlier this month, there was a piece of history for the Zebras as they had a female assistant coach.Dr Carolin Braun, from Germany, moved to Botswana in February for two years to assist in football development, to educate coaches, identify talent and work with women's football, under the German Olympic Sports Confederation.But new Zebras coach Adel Amrouche has decided to also use her in the national team coaching set-up as his assistant coach, and she started with games against Zimbabwe and Algeria.Braun is highly-qualified, with a PhD in sports science and a Uefa A Coaching Licence, and she is pleased to have her new duty with the national team.""Of course for the world it's still something new, and at first probably everyone is looking and asking, 'is this really a woman', but for me it's the same, it's football and I love working with the women as well as working with the men,"" Dr Braun told BBC Sport.""It's one game and it's even better if we get rid of any kind of thinking that it's not for girls.""I don't know if any other national team has a female assistant coach, so it's a good sign and an important sign nowadays to show that it's not a problem at all.""With her help Botswana drew 0-0 away in neighbouring Zimbabwe and the lost narrowly 1-0 to African champions Algeria in Gaborone.Superstitious beliefs about women in football mean that some clubs in some African countries are reluctant to even have a female medic, with a mentality that a woman should not set foot on the pitch.But for Braun things have played out differently.""For the players it's fine, we're just working, it's about football, and as long you have knowledge they highly respect you,"" she insisted.""And I have probably what most coaches don't have, with a PhD in sports science.""Braun worked in The Gambia in women's football on a short-term project, and has been head of football at the University of Munich.Her lengthy CV also includes being coach for 11 to 14-year-old boys with the German Talent Promotion Programme, but Braun is always looking to gain new skills.""For me there's a lot to improve, I'm always willing to learn in coach education, and as an instructor I can learn things from participants - never stop learning, that's what I think,"" she explained."

"Media playback is not supported on this deviceManchester City put five goals past winless Bristol City to claim a sixth win from their opening seven Women's Super League games.Belgium's Tessa Wullaert brought down Janine Beckie's cross to slot in the opener in a quiet first half.England striker Ellen White calmly doubled the lead from Keira Walsh's through ball after the break.Pauline Bremer's double, either side of Caroline Weir's good strike, saw the visitors run away with it late on.The victory was Manchester City's fourth in a row in all competitions and lifted them to the WSL's summit at least briefly, prior to title rivals Arsenal and Chelsea's later kick-offs.The title-chasing visitors controlled the midfield possession and comfortably avoided a repeat of last season's dropped points against the Robins, after these two sides shared two draws in their WSL meetings last term.Bristol City were more threatening up front in the second half after the introduction of in-form forward Ebony Salmon at half-time, but her low strike was turned around the post by Lionesses goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck.Salmon, 18, forced another save from Roebuck in the closing stages, before Germany forward Bremer's clinical double and Scotland's Weir finish ensured the hosts' winless streak stretched to five games in all competitions.The visitors had earlier taken control when Wullaert scored for a third consecutive game in all competitions, before White netted for the fourth time in five matches for club and country.England and Manchester City striker Ellen White told BBC Sport:""It was another professional performance. We dominated possession and we're really pleased to get a clean sheet and to have scored five goals.""We had some chances in the first half and probably could have put the game to bed in the first half, but we carried on really professionally.""The game started to open up a little bit in the second half and we really dominated and then we were really clinical in our finishes in the last 25 minutes.""Bristol City boss Tanya Oxtoby told BBC Sport:""I thought we were excellent for the first 70, 75 minutes, especially considering the result on Thursday (losing 7-0 at Arsenal in the Continental League Cup).

sport	Euro 2020 draw: England drawn against Croatia, Wales in group with Italy	Where and when do England play?Where and when will Wales play?What do Scotland and Northern Ireland need to do?The most difficult group ever?Would England be better finishing second?	"England have been drawn against Croatia and the Czech Republic at UEFA EURO 2020, with Wales alongside Italy, Switzerland and Turkey in Group A.Germany will face world champions France and reigning European champions Portugal in Group F.The winners of Scotland's play-off path, which includes Norway, Serbia and Israel, will join England in Group D.Gareth Southgate's World Cup semi-finalists will begin their campaign against Croatia at Wembley on 14 June.The tournament's opening game will see Italy host Turkey in Rome on 12 June.Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all feature in the play-offs next March, where 16 teams will compete to fill the final four places.The tournament, which will take place in 12 cities across Europe, will be hosted across the continent for the first time to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition.*Iceland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary / Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus**Scotland, Israel, Norway, Serbia***Slovakia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland, Republic of IrelandMedia playback is not supported on this deviceEngland, joint bookmakers' favourites along with France to win the tournament, will benefit from hosting all three of their group games at Wembley.Southgate's side already knew they would be placed in Group D, with the qualified countries of the 12 host cities purposefully placed in specific groups to ensure at least two home games.England's tournament begins against Croatia in a repeat of the 2018 World Cup semi-final, which was won by Zlatko Dalic's side.If England win their group, their last-16 tie would be in Dublin against the runner-ups in a hugely competitive looking Group F - which already includes Germany, France and Portugal - with a potential quarter-final in Rome.Should they finish second, it would be a trip to Copenhagen against the runner-ups from Group E, which features Spain, before a quarter-final in St Petersburg. There are other possibilities if they are one of the best third-place finishers.Reacting to the draw, England manager Southgate said: ""I'm never sure whether it's a good draw. We have played two of the teams before and for us to play at Wembley is something special. We are looking forward to the tournament.""We have to accept that expectations have changed from where we were. We are very critical of ourselves. We would rather be a team that are fancied than a team with no chance.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceWales, semi-finalists in 2016, land in Group A alongside 1968 winners Italy, who won all 10 of their qualification matches and conceded just four goals.They are joined by Switzerland, winners of their qualification group, and a Turkey side that earned a win and a draw against world champions France.Italy will play their three group games at Rome's Stadio Olimpico, with the other venue in the group Baku's Olympic Stadium.Guaranteed to face at least one trip to Azerbaijan or Russia prior to the draw, Wales boss Ryan Giggs will be pleased with his side's travel plans which sees them play twice in Baku before a final group match in the Italian capital.On his side's draw, Giggs said: ""Logistically looking at it, it's Baku, Baku, Rome, rather than having Rome in the middle - so for the fans it's much better. Switzerland are a good team, talented. Turkey were in a group with France and Iceland so have done well to come through that. And Italy have won every game so that will be tough.""I'll get around and watch the players as much as I can. You hope that come June you have a group of healthy players to choose from and if we have that, we're a match for anyone. We want to take our chance, just like in 2016.""Triumph in the Euro 2020 play-offs in March, and Steve Clarke's Scotland would end a 22-year wait for major tournament football.That wait would come to an end against the Czech Republic in Glasgow on 15 June, with a trip to face England at Wembley following on 19 June and a final group game at Hampden Park against Croatia four days later.But first, Clarke's side must find a way past Israel at home on 26 March.Succeed, and they will then face an away tie against the winner of Norway's play-off semi-final with Serbia five days later to battle for qualification.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland are away to Bosnia-Herzegovina in their play-off semi-final, with the winner at home to the Republic of Ireland or Slovakia in the Path B final.Saturday's draw means Spain, Sweden and Poland would await Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland in Group E should they qualify.However, with the play-off winners not being decided until 31 March, there remains a bit of a wait yet for the final groups to be confirmed.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWorld champions France, European champions Portugal and the previous World Cup winners Germany are all together with one play-off team in Group F.This is only the second major tournament where the world champions and the European champions will have met in the group stage - after Euro 1992, when the Netherlands beat Germany.Germany, who won the 2014 World Cup, will host their three group games in Munich, with the other matches in Budapest. If Hungary win their play-offs, they will be in the group, hosting two games.One big boost for the trio is that four of the tournament's six third-placed teams go into the last 16.""This is a group of death,"" said Germany boss Joachim Low.""The games in Munich will be football festivals. The expectations will be quite high. For our young team, this will be a huge challenge but also a big motivation. This is the reward for winning the qualifier group.""In a similar vein to the 2018 World Cup, England may well be better off finishing second in their group.The winners of England's Group D will face the runners-up in Group F - probably Germany, France or Portugal - in Dublin.But if England finish as runners-up, they would face the team who finish second in the group containing Spain, Poland, Sweden and possibly Northern Ireland or the Republic in Copenhagen.However, the quarter-finalists either way are likely to be difficult - possibly Spain in St Petersburg if they win their group, or the winners of Group F in Russia if they finish second.""If you can win and be top seeds then you have to take control of your destiny,"" England boss Gareth Southgate told BBC Sport. ""Let's hope we have the decision to make. We will take on whoever comes. Everyone will be thinking the same about playing us."""

sport	Robbie Savage makes Stockport Town debut after eight years out of football		"Eight years after retiring, Robbie Savage made his footballing comeback with non-league club Stockport Town on Monday.The former Wales international announced on Sunday that he would be putting his boots back on to play for the Greater Manchester side in the 10th tier of English football.The 45-year-old came off the bench to play the last 10 minutes of a 3-2 home win against Oswestry Town, who are top of the North West Counties Football League First Division South.The prospect of Savage making his playing return attracted a crowd of 225 - Stockport Town's highest league attendance in the NWCFL.The ex-Leicester and Blackburn midfielder is involved with the club's new owner Pro Football Academy, which helps young players to get back into the game after being released by clubs.Savage was released by Manchester United aged 19 but then signed for Crewe and went on to make 623 professional appearances and win 39 Wales caps between 1994 and 2011.Town chairman Rob York told BBC Sport that Savage played in defensive midfield and came on to ""great applause"", before helping his side see out the game.""Savage managed to get a few telling touches to break up the midfield and used his experience to clear the Stockport lines on a couple of occasions,"" said York.""Following the game and the warm down, Savage took time to chat to and have photos taken with the many fans waiting for the opportunity to meet with him.""For a player with 89 Premier League yellow cards, all that was missing from his return was a booking."

sport	Jamie Murray column: Good week at Davis Cup, ideas to improve next edition & eating vegan	'Pique would be silly not to talk to the players''I've tried eating vegan and would consider becoming fully vegan after tennis'	In his final BBC Sport column at the Davis Cup in Madrid, Jamie Murray discusses Great Britain's semi-final exit against a Spain side inspired by Rafael Nadal, the lessons that need to be learned from the inaugural finals and trying veganism.Overall the Great Britain team had a very good week at the Davis Cup finals, reaching the semi-finals and with all of us enjoying being part of the new-look tournament.Although the manner of the semi-final defeat by Spain is going to hurt Neal Skupski and me for a little while, it was a great match against Rafael Nadal and Feliciano Lopez in the deciding doubles.It was exciting and the crowd were right into it - that's what the Davis Cup is for me.It is just a shame Rafa and Feli were so inspired!I couldn't touch Rafa's serve; everything was 195kph on the lines.On one of the set points we had, I had a volley I could have maybe done a bit better with but it was a good return close to the net, it wasn't easy to deal with it.Then Rafa had that amazing lob from full stretch forwards on another, which is pretty tough to do.It is unfortunate, but you've got to give Rafa and Feli massive credit.The match helped show again what a great sport doubles is, that it is so fun and exciting.In this case, it was a contrast of styles, with singles players going against specialist doubles players with different skill sets.It was a good platform for doubles to show itself in its best light.To see Rafa fighting so hard for his country in the decisive doubles rubber was cool. Obviously those top singles players aren't playing every week - but when they do, it is exciting and it elevates our discipline.For the players, the tournament was a positive experience. I particularly enjoyed seeing all the players and fans from 18 different nations being in the same place and wearing their national colours - and I thought organisers Kosmos did a good job from our perspective.With this new 'World Cup of tennis' event being such a radical change from the old home-and-away format, there were always likely to be some issues and there are obviously a couple of major things that need to be addressed going ahead.One is the scheduling because some matches weren't finishing until the early morning, including one at 4:04am between the United States and Italy.A solution could be to have a second venue in Madrid, somewhere that's got two or three courts like the Caja Magica.That would mean matches could be split across both venues and played in one day-to-evening session, instead of a day session followed by a night session like this year.If they had six courts, the three at the Caja Magica and three somewhere else, then they can have one tie on each court and start at midday or early afternoon.That would see play go through to the evening or until about 10pm and stop the late finishes we have seen this week.The second issue is getting the stadiums fuller for all of the matches, because only the Spain matches were sold out.We were fortunate we had a lot of British fans who travelled to the event and made it a good atmosphere for all the matches we played. It wasn't like that for all the other matches.I do think the organisers missed an opportunity there by not giving the unsold tickets to schoolchildren and getting them in to watch the matches.That would have been a good idea and would have exposed young kids - the future of the sport as potential players and fans - to tennis.Once the tournament finishes, I would hope that Kosmos president Gerard Pique and the International Tennis Federation speak to the players to get our views on the week. I think it would be silly not to.I'm sure they are already aware of the good and the bad things from this week and they need to address the things that didn't work.With them investing so much money into the event, they will want it perfect.I think there were positives this week and they will want to build on them to make next year even better.When we were playing in Basel last month, I posted a picture of a few of the British guys - me, Neal Skupski, Dan Evans, his coach Mark Hilton and our Davis Cup captain Leon Smith - with a caption 'Back the (vegan) Brits'.Evo is vegan and Hilts is doing it, so we were all eating vegan that week, going to a Thai restaurant every night for vegan food.I've tried veganism before. I'm not fully vegan but I think as a base diet, the staple of your diet, it is really good.But I find it too hard to maintain when I'm travelling and also it is about making sure you get enough content to eat. If I'm at home, I can control it but sometimes when I'm travelling it is out of your control, in terms of what food they provide at tournaments.I did it for a couple of weeks after the French Open and I lost about two and a half to three kilos.That tells you I probably needed to lose it, or I could afford to lose it, but I wasn't eating as much as I needed to - that's why I was losing the weight because I wasn't getting the calories in.It's tough to say if that weight loss affected my training levels or performance, positively or negatively. I couldn't honestly say if it was beneficial or not, I don't know.I think if I was eating enough food, then going vegan full-time would be fine, but at the time I was training a lot and not getting enough calories.That was because I was getting food delivered each day, which had a certain amount of calories that I wasn't used to and I wasn't topping up loads.I like the ethics of veganism and for me the biggest thing was for my own health.Post-career, I would maybe think about becoming fully vegan. You have less appetite because you are not working out as much and need to be more aware and careful - as you need to keep the weight off otherwise you would balloon!Jamie Murray was talking to BBC Sport's Jonathan Jurejko in Madrid.
sport	Super League: Five-second shot clock reduction to make game even faster in 2020		"Rugby league may become an even faster game in 2020 following the successful introduction of the shot clock.In 2019, the shot clock ruling gave 35 seconds to restart the match from a scrum and 30 seconds from a drop-out.Super League say it helped cut the average time of games by over five minutes - from 95 minutes 59 seconds in 2018, to 90 minutes 47 seconds in 2019.Next season, there will be a further five-second reduction - 30 seconds for a scrum, and 25 seconds for a drop-out.The new shot clock restrictions will also operate in the Championship and the Challenge Cup, but referees will continue to manage time-keeping in League One.Super League executive chairman Robert Elstone said: ""The facts tell us the introduction of the shot clock was the right thing to do.""It has made a significant, positive impact. Fans tell us repeatedly that pace of play sets our sport apart and is a major factor in their enjoyment of the game.""Backed up by evidence from the NRL (in Australia) and, after watching our players watch the shot clock in action in 2019, it confirmed to us there was the scope to shorten times further.""The shot clock was one of several new measures brought in for the 2019 season, along with a reduction in the number of interchanges for each team from 10 to 8 and the introduction of golden-point extra-time.The 2020 Super League season begins on 30 January."
sport	Caster Semenya: Double Olympic champion 'never felt supported' by women in sport		"Double Olympic champion Caster Semenya says she has ""never really felt very supported"" by other women in sport.South Africa's three-time world 800m champion will not defend her title in Doha in September after a setback in her challenge to the restriction of testosterone levels in female runners.""I'm targeted because I'm undefeated,"" the 28-year-old said.""Since I have been in sport, I have never really felt very supported, I've never felt recognised mostly by women.""Talking as the headline speaker at a women's conference in Johannesburg, Semenya added: ""I think it comes more into the international stage when you see your own rivals come with this, what can I call it, these rude responses in terms of me competing against them.""Semenya is challenging the International Association of Athletics Federations' new rules that she and other athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) must either take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete in track events from 400m to the mile, or change to another distance.Potentially chasing a third successive Olympic gold should she compete in Tokyo next summer, Semenya had been able to race while awaiting the decision of a Swiss court, but a ruling allowing her to take part has since been overturned.She has twice appealed against IAAF rules preventing her from running without medication.On a perceived lack of support from her fellow athletes, Semenya added: ""I'm the best at what I do. When you are the best in the world people get obsessed with what you are doing.""Probably I'm a problem because I'm an over-achiever so we must get rid of you.""Whoever is going to stop me from running is going to have to drag me out of the track. There's not much that I can say about the case. What I can tell you is that I am on top of my game."""
sport	Premier League predictions 2019-20: BBC Sport pundits pick top four	Man City - 'The best squad, a great manager and a drive for more'Liverpool - 'psychologically, they will be ready to go again'Tottenham - 'Dybala would have been a game-changer'Arsenal - 'Gunners could sign Van Dijk and not finish in the top four'Chelsea - 'The Frank Lampard effect... but they do not have the firepower they need'Manchester United - 'A massive achievement to get them in the top four'	"Manchester City successfully defended their Premier League title last season - will anyone stop them from completing a hat-trick?No team has been champions of England for three successive years since Manchester United reigned from 2006-07 to 2008-09, but that is the next target for City boss Pep Guardiola, who has already achieved the feat in Spain (Barcelona, 2008-11) and Germany (Bayern Munich, 2013-16).Liverpool, who finished a point back, came closest to stopping the City juggernaut last time out, but who will challenge them in 2019-20?Will the Reds repeat the run of results that led to that near-miss? How will Chelsea fare with Frank Lampard in charge, but without Eden Hazard and under a transfer embargo?Will Tottenham, who lost 13 league games last season, maintain their challenge this time? Is this when Arsenal get back in the Champions League places after a three-year absence, and are Manchester United serious contenders again after going six years without coming close to the title?We asked 24 BBC TV and radio pundits to pick their top four with explanations for their selections.The predictions were made on the basis of how each squad shaped up on Thursday, 8 August, after the deadline for incoming transfers but with the potential for players to leave up until the transfer window shuts in the rest of Europe at the end of August.Six teams feature in the forecasted top fours, and only Manchester City and Liverpool feature in all 20.In terms of who will win it, Manchester City are favourites, with 16 votes. Liverpool get the other eight.This is the fourth season running where City have featured in everyone's forecasted top four, and the second successive season where no-one thinks they will finish below second.Joleon Lescott: I've watched a few pre-season games and City have looked exactly the same as they did last season, even while playing without a recognised striker. They have got a settled squad and it just seems like the longer they spend under Pep, the stronger they get.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMicah Richards: As well as City's strength in depth, they have got a great manager who pushes every player to the limit. After winning the title you can sometimes rest on your laurels a little bit, because you think about how good the rest of your players are, but there is no room for that with Pep. If you do, there is not going to be a place for you.Micah Richards and Alex Scott are the guests on Football Focus on BBC One and the BBC Sport website at 12:00 BST on Saturday.Stephen Warnock: The only thing I think could have an impact on City this season is how much they will miss Vincent Kompany, because he was massive for the dressing room and setting standards.Media playback is not supported on this deviceChris Sutton: City are one of the teams who will really benefit from this new law that means goalkeepers do not have to pass the ball out of the box from goal-kicks. A lot of clubs might try to copy them and come a cropper, but City can play their way out.Pat Nevin: They have bought well and also have Kevin de Bruyne back from injury. He is exceptional, so they have to be favourites.Sue Smith: By adding Rodri and Joao Cancelo, they have got the best squad in the league, but they will be focused on Europe. They will just miss out on another title but will win the Champions League which is what they desperately want.Chris Waddle: I have looked at the fixtures and in the last six games, Liverpool have got a harder run-in. It is tough to keep wining titles but City have got the hunger. The big loss for me is Kompany - because that leaves them vulnerable at set-pieces.Alan Shearer: It is going to be City and Liverpool going head to head for the title again and I think it is going to be very close - they are both exceptional teams but I just have a feeling Liverpool will edge it this time.Alan Shearer joins Ian Wright and Gary Lineker on Match of the Day at 22:30 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website for highlights of seven Premier League games (including Friday night's season opener).Last year 14% of people we asked thought Liverpool would win the title and 96% thought they would finish in the top two. This season, 33% think they will be champions, the proportion who think they will finish in the top two stays at 96%.Matthew Upson: What Liverpool did last season was worthy of a Premier League title, and without making any signings, having Jurgen Klopp in charge means they will grow from within. He has had another pre-season to implement his style and his mentality and I think they can still get a little bit better.Alex Scott: I am edging towards Liverpool, only because I think teams found a way of beating City last year and it took a dip from Liverpool in the New Year to let City back in touch.Media playback is not supported on this deviceChris Sutton: My gut feeling is that it won't go down to the wire again. I see Liverpool slipping up a couple of times, which almost happened last season. To win the league they will probably have to get to 97 points again, and the margin of error just isn't there.Mark Lawrenson: My only reservation about Liverpool is that the front three have played non-stop for two years. It worries me a little bit.Paul Ince: There is a way of managing players who have not had the summer off. When I came back late after playing at international finals, I came back fit - because you do not have time to lose your fitness - and at the start of the season, while most players had the Sunday off training, I had the Sunday and Monday off, to give me some rest. I am sure Jurgen Klopp has got a plan for Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane.Stephen Warnock: If the front three stay fit, I think Liverpool win it. The start of the season is going to be so important. We know how good Klopp's tactics are, and his man-management, but how he manages his players' game-time in the first few weeks is one of his biggest challenges.Kevin Kilbane: Tottenham are a big test for City early on but they are the only one of the big six teams that City play in their first 11 games. I think City could steal a march early on because in the same period, Liverpool play the other four leading teams.Join Jason Mohammad, Dion Dublin and Kevin Kilbane for Final Score on Saturday, from 14:30 BST on the Red Button and from 16:00 on BBC One.Leon Osman: Depending how you look at it, Liverpool had incredible good fortune - or good management - for their front three to not pick up any major injuries last season. But if you look at the fact they have not had any rest, I think that is going to catch up with at least one of them, and possibly all three of them. If that happens, I don't see them being able to cope as well as City managed without De Bruyne last season.Media playback is not supported on this deviceRuud Gullit: Last year I backed Liverpool but City have more depth to their squad. They can change their players and have the same kind of results.Joleon Lescott: Unlike with City, I don't see Liverpool as a machine where it doesn't matter too much who is playing. With City you just know that it is going to happen - that whoever is in that position at that time will score for them. With Liverpool it feels like it is individual brilliance that wins games for them, rather than patterns of play.Danny Murphy: Signing one forward player would have been ideal for Liverpool, given the situation they are in. But they could not have done any more last year without winning the title and psychologically, they will be ready to go again.Their level of performance last season showed that their mindset and their mental strength is not a problem at all. Why would there be any reason to doubt their ability to do that again?This is the second successive season where no-one has backed Tottenham to make the top two, but 88% of people think they will finish third. Last time out, 46% thought they would miss out on the Champions League places - they finished fourth, and only 8% think they will finish any lower this time.Jermaine Jenas: Spurs were within two points of City at Christmas last season then fell away, which was down to a lack of depth in the squad. They have had a go at addressing that problem with the signings they have made, and they do look stronger - but they did not get Paulo Dybala, who would have been a game-changer.Mark Lawrenson: Have they strengthened enough to become title contenders? No. Are they more of a goal threat without adding Dybala? No.They have brought in another playmaker in Giovani lo Celso, and Tanguy Ndombele is a big talent, but they could lose Christian Eriksen later this month and lose all of his goals as well as his assists. It is asking a lot for Lo Celso to come in, replace him and be bang at it straight away.Media playback is not supported on this deviceDanny Murphy: It is hard not knowing what is happening with Eriksen, but I have seen quite a bit of Ndombele and the fans are going to love him. It will be interesting to see what role they give him, because he has got defensive qualities but he is also terrific going forwards.Sue Smith: Spurs have added some real quality to their squad and will be pushing but I think City and Liverpool are too strong for them to break into the top two. They need to keep hold of Eriksen though - he is key.Chris Waddle: I actually think Eriksen will stay - the clubs he thought would come in for him have not made a move - but in any case Spurs are a very efficient side. I am confident they will finish third but for me this is it - this is the time when they have to start winning silverware.Last season, only 25% of BBC pundits thought Arsenal would qualify for Champions League football again, and no-one thought they would finish higher than fourth. They ended up fifth. This season, 54% think they will make the top four, but again no-one is predicting a top-three finish.Jermaine Jenas: Nicolas Pepe is a very exciting signing and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette are absolutely potent. I think they will score the goals that might just sneak them into the top four.If Arsenal boss Unai Emery plays with a back three, which he did at times last season, then David Luiz does massively help them defensively too. When he has played in a three he has proven he can be a huge asset, although in a four he can be a bit of a liability.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMark Lawrenson: I am not convinced by David Luiz because he makes mistakes. While he is a good footballer, he is not a particularly outstanding defender - and he is not a leader either. They have not signed a Virgil van Dijk who will improve their whole team by his presence.Leon Osman: There is still a question mark over their defence but they surprised a few people last season and, after a year in the job, Emery will know a bit more about the Premier League and his own squad. I actually think they will do all right.Kevin Kilbane: With the money Arsenal have spent, there will be a lot of optimism from their fans, but they still have issues in midfield and defence that they need to sort out.Danny Murphy: I don't have them having a say in the top four, I really don't. People talk about their defence, but you attack as a team and you defend as a team and who in their midfield apart from Lucas Torreira gets his foot in and wants to protect the backline?That is not something you can put right just by signing a new centre-half, there is more to it than that. Arsenal could sign Van Dijk and they would not finish in the top four because there are other problems in their team.Some 63% of BBC pundits thought Chelsea would miss out on the top four last season - they finished third. This time, 75% are predicting that they miss out on the Champions League places.Chris Sutton: I think in terms of aspirations, it is the first time since Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003 where you look at Chelsea and think they can't win the title this season.Media playback is not supported on this devicePat Nevin: Arsenal and Spurs are stronger than they were last season, whereas Chelsea are not. The transfer embargo means they have not been able to add anyone and they have lost one or two, including one in particular - Eden Hazard.Jermaine Jenas: Hazard won games on his own last year. You would think that people like Pedro, Willian and the rest will step up, and Christian Pulisic should do well. Their midfield will dictate a lot of games, but when you look at their strikers - Olivier Giroud, Tammy Abraham and Michy Batshuayi - they do not have the firepower they need.Ruud Gullit: It is more of a hope that Chelsea will finish second than a belief, but I do think they can adapt without Hazard. The rest of the team knows now they have to do it themselves, not rely on him. Sometimes that brings the best out of players.Joleon Lescott: They will not be near the title race but I do think Chelsea will nick fourth place. Jody Morris going there as Frank's assistant is massive. The top players will respect Frank - he has played with them and done whatever they have done - but Jody knows and understands the young players, which is going to be so important this season.Media playback is not supported on this deviceRachel Brown-Finnis: The Frank Lampard effect will galvanise Chelsea in some ways, and with his history at the club and Jody's knowledge of the youth players they could not have picked a better pairing to handle a pretty unique situation and bring the club together - after his predecessor Mauricio Sarri had such a fractious relationship with the fans.Kevin Kilbane: Frank will get time, something Chelsea managers don't always have, and it will be refreshing to see a change from their hire and fire approach. This season is going to be a good one for the development of Chelsea's younger players, but they do have a lot of proven quality and experience as well - it looks like Willian is going to have a key role.Jermaine Jenas: United and Chelsea are the weaker of the top six teams - just given Frank's lack of ability to go into the market and how United just seem a bit topsy turvy with a lot of players wanting to leave.If you look at Everton, Wolves and Leicester, they are all pulling in the right direction, have got good teams, and can play well home and away. I think they will really put a challenge into the top six this year - I am looking forward to seeing them doing that.Chris Waddle: I have gone for Chelsea to finish fourth but I thought Leicester could have challenged them if they had brought in a dominant centre-half to replace Harry Maguire.This is the second successive season that no-one thinks United will be champions. Last year, 55% of pundits tipped them to finish at least third and 83% to make the top four - they finished sixth. This time, only one person (Ruud Gullit) tips them to make the top three and only 29% think they will make the top four.Chris Sutton: I can imagine it being a really turbulent season for United. It would be a massive achievement if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer got them into the top four - I have got sympathy for him, because you can see in his eyes he is a good man and desperate to do well. He needs time but I do think people are waiting for him to fail and that is deeply unfair.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMark Lawrenson: Their approach to transfers has been somewhat scattergun - it is a concern they have not brought in a replacement for Romelu Lukaku, and they do not have many options up front - Yes they have got Marcus Rashford, but Anthony Martial can be indifferent, and what is happening with Alexis Sanchez? In midfield, it looks like Paul Pogba is going to stay, but does he want to play?Paul Ince: There is nothing wrong with being outspoken but you have to back that up with performances on the pitch, and if you don't you are always going to get criticised for it. I just feel with Pogba that he has as good as said he wants to leave - or a ""new challenge"" as he put it - and he had hardly endeared himself to the fans last season anyway.So, come the start of the season you are going to get a disharmony between him and the fans, which does not help United at all. If he does stay, he is going to have to win the supporters over.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMicah Richards: They weren't able to sign him, but Christian Eriksen was exactly the sort of player United needed - someone who is not afraid to get on the ball. In midfield I find some of their players hide from the ball, because they do not want to be the one to make a mistake. They play in fear of what the headlines are going to be - it is similar to when I played for England.Chris Sutton: They have not replaced Romelu Lukaku and I just don't see their squad or first XI being as strong as the other contenders. I can see the Pogba situation flaring up again if he has an iffy couple of games, and I don't think that will be helpful - there still seems too much behind the scenes which does not feel right.Matt Upson: The trouble is Pogba is so toxic. If everything is not right and he is not happy, it will affect the whole club.Alex Scott: I like Aaron Wan-Bissaka but I think he needs the right players around him to progress and apart from Harry Maguire, who will add maturity and responsibility to the defence, United don't have those sort of players anymore.I don't look at their signings as being enough to get them back in the top four - I don't think too much has changed - they are rebuilding and still a long way off the title.Media playback is not supported on this deviceJermaine Jenas: United were desperate, which is where the £80m fee for Maguire came from. I think as a player, person and character they have got someone who will improve them in a huge way so they have got their man - but the fact they have not sorted out their midfield scenario for me is bizarre.Michael Brown: If it knits for United, they could surprise a few people but I don't see them reaching the levels of the top three and, if they lose some early games, the pressure is going to pile up on Solskjaer after the way he finished last season.Leon Osman: United are in a huge transition period. I am expecting them to have a really tough season and I think Everton will pip them to sixth. The Toffees finished last season strongly, and will have to hit those heights quickly, but they have made some decent additions and have improved their squad depth."
sport	Georginio Wijnaldum: Liverpool player will walk off the pitch if racially abused		"Liverpool and Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum says he would walk off the pitch if he was racially abused.""A lot of people don't understand the pain you feel as a black player if you get [racist] abuse,"" he said.Last weekend, footballers in the Netherlands' top two divisions did not play during the first minute of games to protest against racism.When asked if he would walk off due to abuse, Wijnaldum said: ""Yeah, I would.""He continued: ""I think everyone should [walk off]. That's the way you support another person, because why should you go on?""If you go on it will never stop, because the people will think 'OK, we will abuse the player, they will go inside, we will stop a little bit, but they will come outside again, we will play the game, so why should we stop?',"" Wijnaldum told CNN Sport.The 29-year-old, who has been a mainstay in Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool side this season, went on to say he would walk off if he heard abuse during a major final.""Yeah, I would [walk off], for sure,"" he said. ""Because those things in my opinion cannot happen.""Everyone will have their own opinion about it, but in my opinion you should also protect the players.""Brescia striker Mario Balotelli kicked the ball into the crowd and threatened to leave the pitch due to racist abuse during his side's 2-1 defeat by Hellas Verona this month.The former Manchester City and Liverpool player later criticised the ""small-minded fans"" who shouted abuse at him.However, Balotelli has since been branded ""arrogant"" by his club's ultras group, before Brescia stated that their chairman Massimo Cellino's controversial comments regarding the striker were ""clearly misunderstood"".""It frustrates me a lot to see that because you don't know what he is feeling,"" said Wijnaldum.""With Balotelli it was not the first time it happened, so you don't know what he is feeling. Why don't you support him and walk with him from the pitch? Why don't you do that?""They will say 'Don't let them get in your head', but they don't feel the pain of the person who gets racially abused."""

sport	Netball: The men's teams growing in a 'girls' sport'	Knights in shining armour?'It's a girls' sport'The other World Cup this summer'We want recognition, not funding'	"""We can't harp on about equality and then not make netball accessible to men.""Ama Agbeze captained England to a historic Commonwealth Games gold in 2018 and netball fever again swept the nation this summer as Liverpool hosted the World Cup.It is not just girls and women falling in love with the sport, with mixed leagues thriving and one prominent men's club breaking through the glass ceiling.Yet the men's game is not recognised by the International Netball Federation (INF), and there is no England national seven-a-side team.BBC Sport has spoken to male players with an ambition of starting a league of their own, but wanting to stay in the shadows of their female counterparts.While men have played in mixed netball teams for some time, in April 2018 an ambitious all-male team formed to put it on the map.Lewis Keeling got into the sport through his sister-in-law and founded London-based Knights, who play regular training games against top-level women's sides.In the first nine months of their existence Knights had faced eight of the 10 Superleague teams, as well as taking on Northern Ireland, Scotland and Barbados to help them prepare for the World Cup.""I never thought we would be at this stage so quickly,"" Keeling told BBC Sport.""I had basic goals at the start of what I wanted to achieve, but I never expected that this year.""Knights have gained exposure from these matches and now have about 50 players across three squads, but what is in it for the more established women's teams?""Our version of the game is unstructured and uncoached and things happen that you don't expect,"" Keeling said.""The common feedback is it makes the opposition think because they can't just do what they think is going to happen in a structured game.""Saracens Mavericks are one of the sides to have taken them on and director of netball Kathryn Ratnapala thinks men have attributes that can help her squad.""Some of them will have come from other invasion sports and there are transferrable skills from that, and they bring their own elements to the game to try to match,"" she said.""Players like Mary Chalok (Uganda and Loughborough Lightning shooter who is 6ft 7in) are difficult to replicate, with that strength and stature, so you can try to replicate it against men's teams.""In England, netball is offered as a mixed game up until the age of 11.Declan Kohl has this year formed Northern Titans - a new men's team pooling players between Leeds and Manchester - and believes that needs to change.""That's where you lose men's netball. At 11, boys are told it's a girls' sport.""We've definitely had things on Instagram and Twitter where people say 'it's a girls' sport' - we're trying to change that bias.""Attitudes in big cities have changed a lot in recent years. In Leeds and Manchester you do have that intercity, cosmopolitan feeling.""England Netball do not have male participation figures in the country as their funding focuses on women and girls playing netball from a grassroots to an elite level.In London, Keeling says people tend to be open-minded about men in netball, but thinks we can learn from other countries.Find out how to get into netball with the BBC Get Inspired guide""It's seen to be a girls' sport through schooling but it isn't - you only have to look as far as Australia and South Africa to see it's not and they're loving it over there,"" added Keeling.""The reaction seems to vary. Sometimes people have a look of shock but in London there's a lot of positivity.""Once you've said you've been able to represent your country, play in front of a packed arena and against some of the best players, they immediately get it.""The Netball World Cup may have been and gone but a version of the sport with a modern twist still has its flagship event to come.NETS - previously known as indoor netball - is a faster version of the game played inside netted courts and crucially, England will be taking a mixed side to South Africa for the World Cup next month, alongside a women's team.For Keeling, his first taste of playing international sport came in 2016 at the NETS World Cup.""NETS is seen as the pinnacle of the men's game at the moment, because that is where the opportunity for England representation is.""But not many people know about the sport.Jen Walsh is captain of the mixed squad and got involved in the form of the game having played netball at school and university.""There were Superleague netballers who didn't know about it, there's quite low awareness,"" she said.""Mixed players need to be more physical. Sometimes people jump to the conclusion that the men might be more dangerous but they're experienced in playing, they know the rules.""The timing of this World Cup, following on from the Netball World Cup, is good.""However, male netball players still await the opportunity to compete for their country.At the 2018 Commonwealth Games it was the only sport not to offer categories for both sexes, but men's club bosses Keeling and Kohl both stress it is not about detracting from the women's game.""It's sort of going against the grain - we're bringing a sport to add a male side to it, which is sort of going against the promotion of female sport,"" acknowledges Titans co-founder Kohl.""Netball needs to be celebrated as a female sport first and foremost, we're just trying to say this sport is for all and be inclusive.""Giving men an equal footing in the game could also aid netball's chance of one day becoming an Olympic sport, but Knights chief Keeling feels the priority should be to ensure female players are financially supported.""Our women's teams don't get paid half as much as they should do and so if we're going to focus on funding it should absolutely be for them.""We're just looking for recognition of the game, that it's a worthwhile thing and people enjoy it.""We're a small organisation trying to help netball in a small way which hopefully could have a big impact in the future.""BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame this summer to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before. Through more live women's sport available to watch across the BBC this summer, complemented by our journalism, we are aiming to turn up the volume on women's sport and alter perceptions.

sport	Harlequins 15-9 Bath: Quins edge dogged Heineken Champions Cup affair	'We should have scored more' - what they saidTeams	"Harlequins ground out a hard-earned win over Bath in the Heineken Champions Cup at Twickenham Stoop.Quins fly-half Marcus Smith kept the scoreboard ticking with three first-half penalties to hand the hosts the advantage in soggy conditions.Smith added a fourth after the break but the visitors' confidence grew after Freddie Burns kicked two penalties.James Lang kicked Quins out of reach and above Bath into third in Pool Three despite a late Burns penalty.The hosts, who were heavily beaten by Clermont Auvergne in their opening European game last week, were dominant up front in the early exchanges.England prop Joe Marler made his first appearance since the World Cup and was influential in handing his side a platform.Twenty-year-old Smith was immaculate off the kicking tee to reward Quins for their dominance by opening up a nine-point gap at the interval.Bath were better after the break as they eradicated some of the errors and Smith's opposite number Burns kicked two penalties to reduce the deficit.But when Marler demonstrated his experience to win a penalty at the breakdown just inside the Bath half, centre Lang stepped up to land a huge penalty and end Bath's challenge.Burns added another three points moments later, but ultimately the visitors fell short by conceding 13 penalties compared to Quins' three.Harlequins head coach Paul Gustard told BT Sport: ""The joys of victory aren't as deep as the despairs of defeat, I feel more relief than happiness. I thought we were dominant and our set-piece was good but we should have scored more points than we did.""We are a young coaching group in terms of experience, and we looked at things we could fix like ball retention. It's a simple game and if we can run hard and keep the ball we will be a good team.""Bath director of rugby Stuart Hooper told BT Sport: ""The conditions were ropey but we have to adapt. Ultimately, we didn't hold on to the ball and we were not disciplined, the penalty count was 13-3 and it's difficult to win games playing like that.""We got ourselves in decent positions in the second half but coughed up pressure by giving the ball away.""Harlequins: Brown; Chisholm, Campagnaro, Lang, Murley; Smith, Care; Marler, Elia, Collier, Lewies, Symons, Robshaw, Evans, LawdayReplacements: Head, Garcia Botta, Kerrod, Cavubati, Kunatani, Saunders, Lasike, IbitoyeBath: Watson; Rokoduguni, Joseph, Wright, McConnochie; Burns, Cook; Boyce, Walker, Judge, McNally, Ewels, Stooke, Bayliss, LouwReplacements: Dunn, Obano, Stuart, Garvey, Davies, Chudley, Priestland, Roberts"

We need to tackle any behaviour which can compromise the safety of our supporters including the use of pyrotechnics, overcrowding and offensive chanting or banners.""Regrettably, these charges and sanctions continue to damage the club's reputation and this behaviour continues to threaten supporter safety.""Uefa's rules and the club's long-established ground regulations are very clear. Indeed, the club engages in regular dialogue with all supporters groups to ensure these are well known and understood. It is disappointing that behaviour which is unsafe and which we all know will breach Uefa and club regulations has continued."""
sport	Jose Mourinho at Tottenham: Is Mauricio Pochettino's replacement the right man?	Can he work with Levy?Can Mourinho win over the fans?Will Spurs players accept hardline Mourinho?Which Mourinho will Spurs get?	"Jose Mourinho is in unfamiliar territory as he takes charge at Tottenham Hotspur following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino.Mourinho's arrival at a new club is usually a source of optimism because he invariably brings a guarantee of the silverware that has eluded Spurs since their 2008 League Cup win.Not this time. This time he is replacing a hugely popular figure whose dismissal has angered many Tottenham fans, who then doubled down on their discontent by questioning the Portuguese's suitability to succeed Pochettino.So is Mourinho the right man for Spurs?Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is fulfilling an ambition by appointing Mourinho, who once revealed he had an offer from Spurs as far back as 2007, claiming they tried to agree compensation for a clause relating to his departure from Chelsea in 2006 that prevented him working in the Premier League for two years.He finally has his man but will he find - as others have - that while Mourinho may bring some of the success he craves, he is also a high-maintenance, boom-and-bust manager whose time in charge usually ends in tears. Lots of them.And how will Mourinho cope with Levy's caution with the pursestrings?It was a source of tension for Pochettino, who worked on a shoestring compared to his rivals. Spurs did not buy a player for two successive transfer windows, and the Argentine suggested before the start of this season his title should be changed from manager to head coach, such was his lack of influence and control outside the playing arena.Mourinho does not come cheap. And he does not work cheap either.Tottenham are proud of the club's academy and see the likes of England midfielder Harry Winks as a signpost to the future; Mourinho often gives the impression of not caring whether an academy exists.It is hard to imagine Levy signing off on an £89m fee for Paul Pogba, £75m for Romelu Lukaku, or £52m for Fred, as Ed Woodward did at Manchester United.When I put Mourinho's name to one club recently, the instant response was: ""He'd want £250m for new players before he sat down at his desk.""Spurs and Levy do not work like that - or at least they have not under Pochettino. After arriving from Southampton in May 2014, he spent £394m on players but recouped £295m.Pochettino was prepared to work, for a time at least, within that template as he achieved four straight top-four finishes in the Premier League and reached the club's first Champions League final.Levy may cut Mourinho more slack than Pochettino, though. This is a Tottenham team in serious need of renewal and his new manager simply does not work without ready-made, expensive players.They say that good marriages require a bit of give and take. In transfer terms, Mourinho has always wanted owners to give so he could take - while, in the same context, Levy has been reluctant to give.The Spurs chairman may be in a more benevolent mood given he has wanted Mourinho for so long, but it takes a long stretch of the imagination to believe this relationship between two such strong and single-minded individuals will not have its tensions.Media playback is not supported on this deviceTottenham's motto is: ""To dare is to do."" It is emblazoned all around their magnificent new £1bn stadium.Mourinho is not a manager who dares, and that is something Spurs fans are already wary about - despite his track record of winning three Premier Leagues, plus league titles in three other countries, and two Champions Leagues. The so-called failure at Manchester United still included Carabao Cup and Europa League success in his first season.This is different.Yes, many Spurs fans had questioned Pochettino's approach and demeanour this season, but the 47-year-old still retained huge affection and admiration for what he had achieved.Mourinho's arrival has not just been greeted in many quarters with suspicion and incredulity, but also hostility on two counts.He is taking over from a manager loved by supporters who feel he was sacked in haste - and this is not the Mourinho who walked into his previous jobs. The Portuguese has left a shambles behind him after his past two jobs at Chelsea and United, both in terms of the team and morale at the club.Pochettino was a unifying figure for most of his time at Spurs. Mourinho is confrontational and divisive. He also needs to prove he is not a busted flush, a man out of his time compared to Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp.The Argentine made an emotional connection with Spurs fans, who warmed to him and his personality. Mourinho is not interested in warmth and emotion - only results.He is also ruthless and pragmatic - which brings us neatly on to his style of play.Tottenham supporters bought into the fast-paced, intense, pressing style of Pochettino's teams. They have been attractive to watch while moving into Europe's elite group.Mourinho's style is set in stone and, it should be stressed, has been successful - but it is the opposite to Pochettino. Solid, organised, get the job done fare.Spurs fans may accept that in these reduced circumstances - but for how long?Mourinho is also the polar opposite of Pochettino when it comes to man-management.Until the tension-fuelled final months when the Pochettino became unsettled and a more distant figure, he forged the closest of bonds with his players.Mourinho, in contrast, is hardline. He constantly puts players to the test and can be ruthlessly dismissive when those demands are not met.Pochettino could certainly see players off when no longer fitting his system, but he was largely a supportive, sympathetic figure. He would encourage individuals who struggled patiently in the hope they would eventually benefit the team.This has not always been the case with Mourinho - as Kevin de Bruyne and Mohamed Salah may testify.He will need to tread carefully, with the whispers starting about striker Harry Kane's future and the likes of midfielder Christian Eriksen looking for an exit.Mourinho's approach will be a shock to Spurs' system. It could be exactly what they need - but it is not without risk.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThis will be the deciding factor on determining whether Levy's gamble works.Will it be the Mourinho who had such success in two spells at Chelsea, or the Mourinho who was so disconnected at Manchester United, living in a hotel while keeping a base in London and eventually sacked, unloved and surrounded by ill-feeling?Will it be the smart, humorous Mourinho who produced winning teams, or the embittered individual who raged at the world in his final months at Old Trafford?Levy, evidently, is banking on the former in both cases.At least Mourinho lives in the same city as the club he will be managing, which is a start.The 56-year-old has spent time on rejuvenation in his 11-month absence from the game, insisting he has learned from past mistakes, shaping a new backroom staff and even entering the world of television punditry.Now we will know if Mourinho is prepared to change, to modernise his approach and to recognise his previous flaws in an attempt to restore the old glories in his shiny new surroundings at Spurs.Only time will tell. But, as ever, it will be pure theatre."
sport	Premier League predictions: Who will finish where, plus BBC Sport readers' table	Manchester CityLiverpoolTottenham HotspurChelseaManchester UnitedArsenalEvertonLeicester CityWolverhampton WanderersWest Ham UnitedWatfordSouthamptonBournemouthAston VillaBurnleyCrystal PalaceSheffield UnitedBrighton and Hove AlbionNorwich CityNewcastle United	"The crystal ball is polished and it is that time of the year again - Premier League predictions.A few surprises, plenty of imponderables and a slight excuse that it is still not transfer deadline day yet.Disagree? Make your own prediction here.So here we go - how the Premier League will pan out in 2019-20...Last season - ChampionsThis season - ChampionsManchester City remain the team to beat - they showed resilience and brilliance to put together a 14-match winning streak to see off Liverpool last season and have strengthened in midfield with the addition of Rodri from Atletico Madrid.Vincent Kompany's presence, so vital in the run-in, will be hugely difficult to replace on and off the pitch but class in all parts of the field will make it a Premier League treble for the side who swept the board domestically last season and the perfect sign-off to David Silva's brilliant career in England.Media playback is not supported on this deviceLast season - SecondThis season - SecondThe other half of a rivalry that will be a battle for silverware for years to come. Liverpool will try to end what will be a 30-year wait for the title after falling agonisingly short despite losing only one league game last season, to the eventual champions.The Champions League was more than consolation but this season the Premier League will be firmly in the sights of manager Jurgen Klopp and his players.Liverpool may not have made the big eye-catching purchase as deadline day approaches but all their world-class stars such as Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah are secured and this is a team built to last.Klopp's team is not going away. It will be a fight to the finish but it may well be that the title will have to wait for another year.Last season - FourthThis season - ThirdIt was a strange pre-season for Spurs with some discontented utterances from manager Mauricio Pochettino, including a suggestion of a change of job title to coach because of a lack of influence over transfers.This, however, is still a club and a team in fine shape.Tanguy Ndombele, a club record signing at £53.8m from Lyon, could prove an outstanding midfield addition to a team packed with quality and with the power to add before the deadline.Spurs reached the Champions League final last season, which will have whetted the appetite, and are now at home in a magnificent new stadium and will challenge this season.The title? No - let's not forget they lost 13 league games last season - but top three and time to end Pochettino's wait for a trophy.Now it gets difficult.Last season - ThirdThis season - FourthThe Premier League's top three is pretty clear (when viewed through this crystal ball, at least) but it will be a real dogfight for that last Champions League place and several clubs may be involved.Chelsea have taken a real gamble appointing the unproven Frank Lampard after one season in Championship management in which he took Derby County from sixth to sixth.Has owner Roman Abramovich invested in romance with this former legend rather than realism?And the biggest puzzle of all is how can Chelsea cope without the 'X Factor' provided by the now departed Eden Hazard?The reason for this prediction is that Chelsea have an uncanny habit of achieving against the odds - remember the ""disappointment"" of last season under Maurizio Sarri when they only finished third and won the Europa League?Never bet against Chelsea for a trophy either.Last season - SixthThis season - FifthFor all the cheerleading and predictable talk about a ""feelgood factor"", I have serious doubts that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the man to turn around this big beast of the Premier League - doubts voiced before the initial bounce was deflated into those embarrassing performances at the end of last season.Solskjaer, rather like Lampard, is totally unproven but was the safe choice for United's hierarchy.Harry Maguire, at an exorbitant £80m for a central defender who is serviceable without being anywhere near the Van Dijk class, will provide leadership in a defence still containing familiar faces such as Phil Jones and Chris Smalling while Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James will provide youth and pace.Can Solskjaer turn around United's decline? A game-changing signing in the next day or two may help but currently I struggle to foresee a top-four place.Last season - FifthThis season - SixthThe Gunners will challenge Spurs, Chelsea and Manchester United for a top-four place and will not go short of goals with Nicholas Pepe arriving from Lille for a club record £72m to augment Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette.Dani Ceballos on loan from Real Madrid could be a masterstroke but this Arsenal side, now without Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny, still lacks leadership, and manager Unai Emery must cure the old flaws such as travel sickness.They blew their top-four chances late on last season and lost the Europa League final to Chelsea - hardly a catastrophic failure but can they take the next step?Best bet may be a domestic cup.Last season - EighthThis season - SeventhEverton ended Marco Silva's first season strongly and attractively, illustrated by home wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United - and he has been backed in the markets, so owner Farhad Moshiri will expect a top-six challenge and domestic cup run at least.Idrissa Gueye will be a real loss but Everton have secured the classy Andre Gomes on a permanent basis, added the talented Jean-Philippe Gbamin from Mainz and secured one of Europe's emerging teenage talents in striker Moise Kean from Juventus.If they can get it right in the final days of the transfer window, and that must include adding a central defender, they could have a real crack at that top six and beyond.Last season - NinthThis season - EighthOptimism abounds at Leicester thanks to Brendan Rodgers' fine start as manager after succeeding Claude Puel and some shrewd summer work in the transfer market.The Foxes are another club with genuine top-six aspirations.Maguire is a loss but they have recouped a serious fee and the additions of the gifted Youri Tielemans, such a success on loan last season, and striker Ayoze Perez from Newcastle builds on a squad that offers a potent mix of youth and experience.Rodgers will also want to prove his worth after moving from Celtic so I fully expect a very satisfactory season at The King Power Stadium.Last season - SeventhThis season - NinthI had rare success with a surprise prediction last season when I said then Premier League newcomers Wolves would finish seventh. Nuno Espirito Santo's side delivered and proved an excellent top-flight addition, backed by quality signings and an attacking style.No longer a surprise package and with a Europa League campaign to navigate, I'm not going so high this season but fully expect a top-10 finish, especially with the addition of striker Patrick Cutrone from AC Milan to support those who excelled last season such as Raul Jimenez and Diogo Jota.Last season - 10thThis season - 10thIt was a season of relative serenity at West Ham under the experienced Manuel Pellegrini, whose air of calm made it a solid first season in charge.The addition of Spain attacker Pablo Fornals from Villarreal and striker Sebastien Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt for a club record £45m will add quality and creativity, and you can bracket the Hammers with those other clubs who might fancy breaking into the top six if they get the wind in their sails.Media playback is not supported on this deviceLast season - 11thThis season - 11thYes - you have read it right, Watford supporters. No relegation tip this year… which may of course be bad news.The painful embarrassment of that 6-0 FA Cup final loss to Manchester City aside, it was a very decent season for Javi Gracia's team, a well-organised team at a well-run club.Troy Deeney remains the talisman and Gerard Deulofeu delivers the magic. Another good mid-table finish in the offing.Last season - 16thThis season - 12thAfter losing their sure touch with managerial appointments after the failure of Mauricio Pellegrino and the short-lived reign of Mark Hughes, Southampton look to have got it right again with the charismatic Austrian Ralph Hassenhuttl.He ensured their survival last season with a high-energy style that he will have further engrained in close season, an approach that saw a revival for the likes of Nathan Redmond.If the excellent Danny Ings can stay fit and Che Adams can transfer his striking talent from the Championship with Birmingham City to the top flight, and Moussa Djenepo can adapt, then watching Southampton may be very entertaining this season.Last season - 14thThis season - 13thIt was the usual mix of top-class victories and heavy defeats that sums up Bournemouth's Premier League life under manager Eddie Howe last season - and I do not see anything different this time.Keeping Ryan Fraser (so far) is crucial, while England striker Callum Wilson's new contract is a real vote of confidence in the Cherries' future. The absence through injury of David Brooks for three months is a blow.Philip Billing's arrival from Huddersfield will add stature but the goalkeeping looks a weakness. A late move there - Jack Butland from Stoke perhaps - would give more solidity.Last season - promotedThis season - 14thIf you had a pound for every time you heard ""doing a Fulham""…Fulham spent more than £100m losing their identity and their Premier League status last season and Villa's similarly expensive sweep of the transfer market has brought the same accusations.Not from here - yes it is ambitious and contains risk but manager Dean Smith has also signed players he knows in the likes of Jota, Ezri Konsa and the likes of Tyrone Mings and Anwar El Ghazi, who were on loan last season.Plenty of eyes will be on the likes of Wesley, Trezeguet and Douglas Luiz - but Villa have also secured one of the best deals of the summer in signing an experienced goalkeeper of quality in England's Tom Heaton from Burnley for only £8m.Jack Grealish has Premier League quality and John McGinn can make a big impact.A season of consolidation is in prospect at one of the great old clubs.Last season - 15thThis season - 15thSean Dyche has done a superb job keeping Burnley in the Premier League, especially last season when he kept his nerve after a horrible spell up to Christmas. A smart manager who knows how it works and how to get the best out of his squad, he will keep Burnley up again.The return of Jay Rodriguez to his home town club will provide goals and quality and the return to fitness of Nick Pope meant Burnley could sell Heaton.It's a big season ahead for Pope. I predict survival for the Clarets.Last season - 12thThis season - 16thStrange times at Crystal Palace. Manager Roy Hodgson will always provide solidity and, more likely than not, safety - but when will Eagles supporters and their hierarchy want more?They stayed up in comfort last season but so far it has been an unfulfilling summer with the departure of Wan-Bissaka and the confirmation of Jordan Ayew's signing hardly one to get the pulses pumping, although Gary Cahill will at least add experience to the defence.If the unsettled Wilfried Zaha is still at Selhurst Park at the weekend then their chances of a decent season instantly improve but currently looking like another season where mid-table consolidation is the best a superbly supportive fan base can hope for.Last season - PromotedThis season - 17thThere is always at least one prediction that goes against the grain and this is mine.Sheffield United are plenty of people's tips to go down but I am going with the Chris Wilder factor and the stirring surroundings of Bramall Lane to keep the Blades in the Premier League.Wilder revels in his ""old school"" managerial persona. Do not be fooled.He is smart, meticulously prepared, has proved his tactical flexibility and his impressive record shows a manager waiting for this chance to show that he can sit comfortably at the highest level.Phil Jagielka's return will provide experience, while Oli McBurnie, at a club record £20m from Swansea City, will be relied upon for potency.Last season - 17thThis season - 18thBrighton's dip in form that plunged them into trouble last season cost manager Chris Hughton his job and brought a new face and approach in the highly rated Graham Potter.Leandro Trossard from Genk is part of the new look while heavy responsibility will fall on the shoulders of new central defender Adam Webster, signed from Bristol City in a club record £20m deal - especially if Lewis Dunk leaves.Potter has many supporters and Brighton is a club to admire - but last season's decline must mean worries this time around if they do not make a good start.Last season - PromotedThis season - 19thNow this is one prediction that may well come back to bite me given the exciting football played by Daniel Farke's side in the vibrant atmosphere of Carrow Road last season. The Canaries will be a colourful addition to the Premier League.Can Farke make this style work in the top flight? Plenty will hope so.So much will depend on whether Teemu Pukki, who scored 29 goals last season, can make the transition to elite level. If he can then I shall order a large helping of humble pie in advance.Last season - 13thThis season - 20thWhere do you even start? Where will this all end?Rafael Benitez, predictably, has gone and Steve Bruce finally becomes Newcastle United manager in a blizzard of discontent from supporters who, contrary to belief, do not want too much - just a little of what they genuinely deserve.Bruce is experienced and a realist. He will know he must make a big early impression or this has the potential to be a very miserable existence for the Toon Army under the continued ownership of Mike Ashley.Joelinton, a club record signing at £40m from Hoffenheim, steps into the spaces vacated by Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon. He carries a huge burden, while French winger Allan Saint-Maximin, a £16.5m signing from Nice, will be the man Bruce hopes can be the provider.When will the torture end for Newcastle's supporters? It may get worse before it gets better."

sport	Alex and Claire Danson: Sporting sisters pushing each other's rehabilitation	'Open to anything in a wheelchair'	"Sporting sisters Alex and Claire Danson are feeding off each other's determination as they plot their respective paths back to competitive sport.Alex won Olympic hockey gold for Great Britain in 2016 and captained England to the World Cup quarter-final in 2018.But just weeks later, a seemingly innocuous bump on her head while laughing at a joke her husband told on holiday in Kenya, left her suffering long-term concussion.The 34-year-old is nearing a full-time return to training, but younger sister Claire is now starting her own recovery from a life-changing accident.In August, the triathlete was paralysed from her stomach down after colliding with a tractor when riding her bike.Claire, 30, underwent numerous operations after the accident severed her spinal cord, punctured both lungs, and broke both her wrists and a finger, as well as the head of her humerus and both shoulders.She was also left her with fractures to all the bones in her neck - including one break - and all of her ribs.On one of her first days out of hospital, Claire attended a charity cycle ride in Hampshire, organised with the help of Alex's husband - Alex Bennett - to raise funds for her ongoing rehabilitation.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBut Claire's focus is already on what opportunities may lie ahead having previously planned to turn professional this year in triathlon before her injuries.""I want to get back into sport, probably Para-triathlon,"" she told BBC South Today. ""But I'm open to trying anything I can do in a wheelchair.""But on the other side, this injury and being in a wheelchair has slowed me down and allowed me to spend more time seeing my family and friends.

sport	UK Championship: Neil Robertson and John Higgins win 6-0 in first round		"Former champions John Higgins and Neil Robertson enjoyed crushing 6-0 victories in the first round of the UK Championship, but world number 11 David Gilbert was a surprise loser.Two-time winner Robertson hit a century and two 81 breaks to demolish Malta's Alex Borg in the afternoon session.Scotland's Higgins, the 1998, 2000 and 2010 winner, whitewashed fellow veteran Peter Lines in the evening's action.But Gilbert lost 6-4 to world number 118 James Cahill at the York Barbican.Cahill, who beat Mark Selby in last year's tournament and also stunned Ronnie O'Sullivan at the World Championship in April, once again showed impressive quality and an ice-cool temperament.He scored a century and two breaks of more than 80 on his way to a 4-3 lead.Gilbert's second ton got him level but Cahill got over the line.Australian Robertson, meanwhile, was thrilled with a victory that ended up being ""nice and easy"", but felt he missed out on three more centuries.""Alex is very experienced but he didn't show up,"" added Robertson, 37, who plays either Robbie Williams or Luo Honghao in the second round. ""I wasn't really put under any pressure.""In the evening session, world number four Higgins, 43, said he ""used up all his luck"" despite a routine victory over Lines, 49.Earlier, Ali Carter and Stuart Bingham also progressed to round two.Carter, twice a UK semi-finalist, was also a 6-0 winner against fellow Englishman Brandon Sargeant but Bingham had to survive a big scare to beat 16-year-old Lei Peifan 6-4.Bingham, the 2015 world champion, who made the UK semi-finals for the third time last season, struggled to find his best form.The 43-year-old world number 12 shared the first four frames against China's Lei before seeming to settle, a break of 53 helping him establish a two-frame lead.The world number 117 responded again to level at 4-4 before a frustrated Bingham pinched frame nine with a 62 clearance, after Lei had missed a black from the spot, and then closed out victory.World number one Judd Trump plays Morocco's Amine Amiri in the opening round on Thursday at 14:30 GMT, and seven-time champion O'Sullivan is in action against Ross Bulman later that evening.BBC television coverage of the tournament begins on Saturday from 13:15 on BBC One."
sport	Davis Cup: 'Great Britain should be excited for future,' says Leon Smith		"Captain Leon Smith says Great Britain can be excited about their chances of future success in the Davis Cup despite a heartbreaking semi-final defeat by a Rafael Nadal-inspired Spain in Madrid.Doubles pair Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski lost the deciding rubber to Nadal and Feliciano Lopez in a 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (10-8) defeat.It clinched a 2-1 win for hosts Spain, who play Canada in Sunday's final.""I look forward to a really positive 2020,"" Smith said.Britain's five-man team of Andy Murray, Dan Evans, Kyle Edmund, Jamie Murray and Skupski reached the last four of the inaugural season-ending finals, which are the brainchild of Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, to ensure an automatic spot in next year's event.Edmund, 24, was the star player for Britain, winning all three of his singles rubbers in straight sets, despite a disappointing ATP season where he has slipped to 69th in the world.Andy Murray, 32, missed the last three matches after struggling for fitness during a sluggish three-set win over world number 179 Tallon Griekspoor in the opening victory over the Netherlands.Evans, who won one of his four singles matches, is ranked as the British number one, while Jamie Murray and Skupski are continuing to improve as regular doubles partner.Smith also pointed to Cameron Norrie and doubles player Joe Salisbury - Britain's sole representative at the recent ATP Finals - to illustrate the depth at his disposal.""Everyone's got their different journey to go on, but I think we should be excited by what we have in British tennis,"" said Smith, whose side also beat Kazakhstan and Germany.""We've got so many different things going. I think it's great, it's positive.""Hopefully everyone can just keep on that path and we come back here next year with an even stronger team than the strong team we have already got.""Jamie Murray and Skupski, who had an impressive week on his Davis Cup debut, could not convert any of four second-set points against world singles number one Nadal, 32, and 38-year-old Lopez in Saturday's semi-final.The Spanish pair, roared on by a boisterous home crowd in the Caja Magica, swung the momentum back in their favour and converted a second match point to leave the British contingent devastated.""The emotion is still raw,"" Smith told BBC Sport.""You're within a couple of points of going into a deciding third set and then it's game on. There was nothing in it. I'm proud of all of them.""We're hurting, but we've seen an amazing tie here against Spain, who are arguably the strongest team in the competition, especially with Rafa in it.""We've pushed them within a couple of points to a deciding set to see who goes into the final.""To reach semi-finals is a brilliant achievement, we have come through tough matches and tough moments.""Everyone has stepped up and we'll look back proudly on this."""
sport	Lee Tomlin: 'Maverick' Cardiff City forward has 'huge part to play' - Neil Harris		"Cardiff City's new manager Neil Harris says forward Lee Tomlin has a ""huge part to play"" for the Bluebirds.The 30-year-old came off the bench in the second half against Charlton Athletic and scored to earn Cardiff a point in Harris' first game in charge.Leicester-born Tomlin's opportunities under previous manager Neil Warnock had been limited.""I'm pleased he showed his qualities when he came on,"" former Millwall boss Harris told BBC Sport Wales.Tomlin has made only 22 Cardiff appearances since joining from Bristol City on a three-year deal and has spent time on loan at Nottingham Forest and Peterborough United.His equaliser at Charlton was his second goal of the season having netted to rescue a point against Sheffield Wednesday in October and Harris says Tomlin has much to offer.""It's not just about qualities he has with the ball - his work ethic without the ball and he's worked hard over the summer from what I've heard to get himself fitter,"" Harris added.""He's going to play a huge part. The fans want to see shots, they want to see crosses and they want to see the end product.""But they want to see the players have a right go and to do that you've got to have shape behind and let your players play and at times you need mavericks and Lee Tomlin is a maverick.""Cardiff, who are 16th in the Championship after the draw at Charlton, host Stoke City in Harris' first home game in charge on Tuesday.Harris said Callum Paterson will be assessed after he suffered a knock against Charlton."
sport	Davis Cup: Great Britain fans given 900 semi-final tickets by LTA	'We need to keep monitoring Andy'	"The Lawn Tennis Association has given away 900 tickets to Great Britain fans to cheer on the team at Saturday's Davis Cup semi-final with hosts Spain.After Andy Murray pledged to ""sort out as many tickets as possible"", the LTA said fans could email the governing body to get up to four free tickets for the match, in Madrid.Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund booked Britain's place in the last four with victory over Germany on Friday.""We want you here!"" the LTA tweeted.British tennis' governing body originally said it had bought 500 tickets for fans.In a Twitter message, GB doubles player Jamie Murray said: ""All the tickets available have been taken...it's an incredible effort by you guys [the fans] and we're looking forward to seeing you.""Great Britain are appearing in their third semi-final in five years at the revamped Davis Cup.They begin their best-of-three tie at the 12,500-capacity Manolo Santana Court at the Caja Magica at 16:30 GMT.Britain were backed by about 1,000 fans in their opening two group matches against the Netherlands and Kazakhstan, with that number thought to be slightly lower for the quarter-final against the Germans.Murray, 32, did not feature in the quarter-final after captain Leon Smith decided not to recall the former world number one, who also missed the match against Kazakhstan after a laboured performance in the opening win over the Netherlands.In the Scot's absence, 24-year-old Edmund has won both of his matches, while Evans dug deep to earn his first victory in Madrid against Germany.Smith had said before the quarter-final that it would be one of his toughest decisions whether to name Murray in the team or not and he was giving little away about his selection for the semi-final.""He [Murray] wasn't feeling great on the court. It was tough for him and if we have players like Kyle and Dan playing at a really good level then they are ready to play. We need to keep monitoring Andy,"" Smith told BBC Sport.""While Kyle and Dan are playing at that level he knows it is not like it used to be where he has to play.""That's a good thing for us. The squad is really strong now.""If it is the same team as against Germany then I'll be really happy and if Andy comes in I'll also be really happy.""Britain or Spain will face Canada or Russia in Sunday's final."

Also there's the opportunity to play at different grounds and it's fantastic to have a couple of games at Newport,"" Wallace told BBC Sport Wales.The county will also stage the usual Championship matches at St Helen's in Swansea and at Colwyn Bay.Their away schedule includes visits to Middlesex's out-grounds at Merchant Taylors' School over four days and Richmond in the T20.Glamorgan's Sophia Gardens headquarters will host all of the Welsh Fire's men's team's home matches, while the women's team will play one match in Cardiff alongside two fixtures in Bristol and another in Taunton.Wallace is hoping the new fixture list will keep existing supporters on board as well as attracting new ones to Sophia Gardens.""We (Glamorgan) had an improved season last year and we're grateful for the level of support we had, we want to grow that support.""Then when Welsh Fire are here, hopefully that'll revitalise lapsed supporters, give new supporters their first taste of the game and also give regular cricket-lovers the chance to see some of the world's very best players."""

sport	Euro 2020: Russia allowed to compete despite potential four-year ban	Analysis	"Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 even if a four-year ban from sporting events comes into effect.The World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) compliance review committee (CRC) recommended Russia be banned from hosting and competing in major international events on Monday.Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant over inconsistencies in anti-doping data.St Petersburg will also remain as a host city at next summer's tournament.If the ban is upheld by Wada's executive committee at a meeting in Paris on 9 December, and backed by the Court of Arbitration should Russia contest it, it would not include the European Championship as Uefa is not defined as a 'major event organisation' in regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches.Russia's participation in qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar would, however, be under threat.A statement from football's governing body Fifa on Tuesday read: ""We will await the final considerations of the Wada executive committee on this matter until any potential material decision is taken by Fifa.""Russia also faces exclusion from the Olympic and Paralympic summer and winter games in 2020 and 2022, though individual athletes would be cleared to compete if able to demonstrate they are not implicated in any way by the non-compliance.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has called for the toughest sanctions to be brought against those responsible for manipulating test data and has described attempts to cover up positive findings as ""an insult to the sporting movement worldwide"".BBC sports editor Dan RoanAll the signs are that on 9 December, Wada's leadership will accept the recommendation of its compliance panel and cast Russia into the international sporting wilderness.For the second successive Olympic Games, and in many other major events, for the next four years, there would be no official Russia team, with athletes forced to compete as neutrals, and only after passing eligibility checks. Given the scale of cheating and deception, many critics will argue a blanket ban on all Russian athletes would be a more appropriate punishment.But even though almost five years has now passed since the Russian doping scandal was first exposed, this is unlikely be the end of the story. Russia is expected to appeal via the Court of Arbitration for Sport and argue that individuals acting on behalf of the state - rather than its sports authorities - were responsible for the audacious manipulation and deletion of data, and therefore athletes should not be punished.Do not be surprised therefore if the build-up to another Olympics is overshadowed by further twists in what has arguably become the gravest scandal in sports history."

sport	Euro 2020: Record-chasing Ronaldo and echoes of 1996 - next summer set to be exciting	Fans lapping up the 12-nation format'Home' games could rekindle spirit of Euro '96A wide-open tournament?The Oranje look good againEngland in fine form and Wales back once againRonaldo will be a man on a missionWhat do you think?	A Euro for Europe - that's how Uefa billed next year's European Championship given it is spread across the continent for the first time in history.We now know 20 of the 24 teams who will feature at Euro 2020 after the groups came to an end on Tuesday. All that remains are the play-off games in March next year.With 12 different host nations, an unprecedented demand for tickets and some of Europe's top teams and star players going into the tournament in top form, it promises to be a memorable event.Here, BBC Sport takes a look at some of the reasons to get excited about it.This is, officially, the tournament that more people than ever before want to be a part of.During the month-long first phase of the ticket application window between 12 June and 12 July, 19.3 million requests were made for the 1.5 million tickets that were made available. For context, there were 11 million requests for the equivalent phase of Euro 2016.Delving further into the numbers, according to Uefa there were 1.9 million tickets requested for the final of Euro 2020 at Wembley - 22 times the capacity of the stadium.The figures suggest people are also embracing the fact the tournament is taking place in multiple cities, with each fan applying for 14 tickets for games over at least two venues.There's always a party atmosphere in the country where a European Championship or World Cup is being held, with football fans from all over the world mingling and generally having a good time.The new format for this year's competition means that 'festival of football' feeling will be spread across 12 countries.But for England fans there is the added bonus that Wembley will host more games than any other stadium in any other country. Both the semi-finals and final will take place in London, as well as three group games and a last-16 match.With a total of seven matches taking place at Wembley it could well rekindle the spirit of Euro 1996. That was the last tournament England hosted and the whole country got swept up in football fever as the Three Lions progressed to the semi-final, where they suffered penalty heartache against Germany when current England boss Gareth Southgate had his spot-kick saved.That tournament may not have ended the way England fans would have hoped, but the atmosphere around the country is still fondly remembered and plenty of 'home' Euro 2020 games should make for an exciting time to be in and around London next summer.Have a chat with your mates about who you think will win Euro 2020 and it's a fair bet there will be a few different answers.With 12 different hosts and without a dominant-looking team in qualifying, next year's tournament promises to be one of the most open and unpredictable yet.France are the favourites with the bookies after winning the World Cup last year and although they qualified for the tournament by finishing top of their group, they were occasionally unconvincing along the way - losing to Turkey and scraping a 1-0 win in Iceland courtesy of a second-half Olivier Giroud penalty.They, unlike several of their rivals, also do not have any fixtures on home soil at the tournament - although neither do Euro 2016 and Nations League winners Portugal.England are second favourites and certainly possess an attack that will be the envy of many, while Belgium, Spain and Italy - who have turned things round dramatically since failing to qualify for last year's World Cup - all look strong after finishing comfortably top of their respective groups.For almost half a decade the Netherlands national team was in the doldrums and football, you could argue, was poorer for it.From their lively fans to their free-flowing football, the Dutch have always been welcome at international tournaments, but the 2014 World Cup semi-finalists had to watch from the sidelines during Euro 2016 and last year's World Cup after failing to qualify for both.Now, however, they are back with a bang.They qualified with a game to spare for Euro 2020 and are a side that look both defensively strong and exciting in attack.There will be few better partnerships in the centre of defence at Euro 2020 than Virgil van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt while the former, along with Frenkie de Jong and Donny van de Beek, are part of a new and exciting generation in Dutch football.Add to that the experience of Memphis Depay, Quincy Promes, and Georginio Wijnaldum - who are all in excellent form for club and country - and the Dutch seem sure to be one of the most entertaining teams to watch at Euro 2020.It was a case of so near yet so far for England at the World Cup last year as hopes of ending a 52-year wait for a major trophy were ended with a semi-final defeat by Croatia.However, the Three Lions' hugely impressive qualifying campaign, coupled with the blooding of some exciting youngsters, means there is reason to be optimistic of a strong showing at Euro 2020.England were one of the highest-scoring teams at the tournament with 37 goals in 10 games. Harry Kane accounted for 12 of those as he finished top scorer.And Wales are back on the big stage once again after securing qualification for a second successive European Championship.At Euro 2016 - their first appearance at a European Championship - they enjoyed a fairytale run to the semi-finals and they will be hoping to at least replicate that next year.Former Iran striker Ali Daei holds the record for the most goals in men's international football with 109 - but there is a very realistic possibility Cristiano Ronaldo could surpass that tally at Euro 2020.The Juventus forward took his international tally to 99 goals with Portugal's second in a 2-0 win against Luxembourg that also secured qualification.So will he get the 11 goals he needs to surpass Daei's tally at Euro 2020?His 99 goals have come in 162 games for Portugal, a strike rate of 0.61 goals per game.If he maintains that rate he would need 11 games to surpass Daei's record but, given he has scored four goals in his past two games, if he keeps up that recent form he would take fewer games to reach his target.With friendlies to come between now and next summer plus a potential seven games at Euro 2020 should Portugal get to the final, there is a chance Ronaldo will make history at the tournament.

sport	Beth Cobden: 'I knew within seconds my World Cup dream was over'		"""I knew when I went down my World Cup was over.""Beth Cobden is reflecting on the moment she ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) for the second time in a year.In May, the 26-year-old England netballer was only three games into her debut season with the Adelaide Thunderbirds when she experienced a horribly familiar feeling.Nine months earlier she had damaged the ACL in her left knee, playing for Loughborough Lightning in the Superleague final.""It took a bit longer to sink in this time,"" she told BBC Sport as she talked for the first time about the injury that would rule her out of a home World Cup.""Last time I got this feeling where your knee dislocates, and I expected to look down and see my knee on the side. I looked at it and it looked normal but I think that was the shock talking.""After a couple of seconds I was like: 'Oh no, I've done it again…'""Centre-courter Cobden, part of the Roses team that won Commonwealth gold in April 2018, said she had ""no issues"" during her first pre-season with her new team.""I wasn't back to my best but I was getting there,"" Cobden added.""In training I could feel myself getting my confidence built up, but I went from such a high the year before - winning the Commonwealth gold - to rock bottom.""Cobden, who is working for Netball South Australia organising school holiday training camps, believes fatigue may have been a factor in the initial problem as she was ""exhausted"" following a full Superleague campaign and the Commonwealth Games.But she believes this year's injury was ""a freak"".""I'd passed all the tests. I didn't rush back. I hadn't played for nine months and I felt fine, so it was a shock,"" she said.Cobden, who was in Liverpool to watch her team-mates win bronze at the World Cup in July, has opted not to play competitive netball in 2020 to give herself extra time to recover.This is her third ACL problem, having also injured her right knee when she was 17.""I won't be back until 2021 but I want to play for England again and I hope a club will take me if my body still works,"" she said.""I want to take my time. I don't want to risk anything as I've done three ACLs now. If I'm still playing at 30, I'll be pleased."""

sport	Women's Autumn Internationals: England comfortably beat Italy	Red Roses end 2019 with a flourishTeams	"England scored 10 tries as they crushed Italy 60-3 in Bedford to complete a clean sweep of victories from their autumn internationals.The Red Roses' driving maul and scrum were imperious throughout, with Vicky Fleetwood, Poppy Cleall and Heather Kerr going over from close range in the first 25 minutes.Abby Dow beat two players to score and see England go in 22-3 up, with world player of the year Emily Scarratt surging through a gap to add a fifth try.As weather conditions worsened hooker Kerr muscled over for the second time, with a penalty try adding to scores from replacements Amy Cokayne, Rownita Marston and Sarah Bern.Italy - who finished second to Grand Slam winners England in this year's Six Nations - showed short spells of resistance in the first half but looked a beaten side after the break.Simon Middleton's side, meanwhile, finish the year with 12 wins from 13 games and extend their run of victories on home soil - now up to 17.In front of a 5,000 capacity crowd at Goldington Road - home of men's Championship side Bedford Blues - England made five changes to the side that edged past France in Exeter last weekend.The Red Roses' opening three tries all came via lineout mauls before Dow finished off a fine move in the right corner with arguably the try of the match to close the first half.Rain poured down during the second half but England were persistent as the Italians tired on an increasingly heavy surface.Scarrett showed agility to cut back through a gap to dive over, while referee Hollie Davidson sin-binned Lucia Cammarano and gave England a penalty try as the visitors could not live with the physicality of their opponents.Having made her England debut off the bench last week, Marston came on to score her first international try before fellow replacement Bern took the hosts into double figures.England - ranked second in the world - will return to action in February as they begin their Six Nations defence.England head coach Simon Middleton told BBC Sport:""I thought we played exceptionally well in really tough conditions.""When you play a team you know you could dominate it's easy to go away from your gameplan and struggle with your basics, but we executed well and stuck to our plan brilliantly.""I thought we were ruthless in how we played and there were some really good individual performances.""England forward Sarah Bern told BBC Sport:""It was good to see how we wore them down - Italy are always a great side to come out against.""Coming on we just needed to inject a bit of energy and I think that's exactly what our bench did.""We're in a fantastic place. We've got some new people in the squad, we've tried all our different combinations and I think we're in a great place after three wins.""England: McKenna; Dow, Scarratt, Scott, MacDonald; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Kerr, Brown, Cleall, Aldcroft, Packer, Fleetwood, HunterReplacements: Cokayne, Perry, Bern, Beckett, Marston, Riley, Daley-Mclean, BreachItaly: Barattin; Magatti, Sillari, Rigoni, Sarasso; Cavina, Stefan; Turani, Bettoni, Gai, Fedrighi, Duca, Locatelli, Franco, Giordano.Replacements: Cerato, Merlo, Tounesi, Ruzza, Cammarano, Sgorbini, Paganini, Capomaggi."
sport	Laura McAllister: Ex Sport Wales chief highlights 'crumbling facilities'		"Former chair of Sport Wales Laura McAllister believes sport in the country continues to prosper despite problems like ""crumbling facilities"".Prof McAllister used her speech at the Welsh Sport Hall of Fame dinner in Cardiff to highlight the challenges.""Sport continues to thrive in difficult times, less volunteers, crumbling facilities, less funds,"" said McAllister.""This means clubs, sport's lifeblood, are being squeezed and priced out.""She continued: ""Without clubs, their coaches and volunteers, we are in danger of missing the next Nicole Cooke or the next Lauren Price or the next Daniel James.""Prof McAllister is also concerned about what she perceives as the lack of physical education in schools with the new draft curriculum, due to be introduced in 2022, not specifying a set amount of activity every week.The curriculum leaves it open for individual schools to decide on PE lessons.Baroness Grey-Thompson said in June 2019 she was concerned PE would disappear off the curriculum in some schools, causing potential problems for the NHS in 15 to 20 years' time due to people being unfit.These concerns were echoed by a group of AMs, who recommended schools be required by law to provide at least two hours of PE every week.The Health, Social Care and Sport Committee said the change was vital to tackle a public health crisis, with more than a quarter of four and five-year-olds starting school in Wales last year classed as obese or overweight.Prof McAllister, a former Wales football international, called for the Welsh Government to drive school participation.""It starts early, almost always in schools,"" said McAllister.""It's a sobering and depressing fact most Welsh schools don't deliver two hours of PE, that's 120 minutes across a week.""A recent Assembly committee report recommended this as a minimum statutory requirement with proper inspection by (education and training inspectorate) Estyn.""So over to you Welsh Government. This is not that difficult you know.""All of us know if PE and sport continue to be the Cinderella subjects in schools . . . we are condemning children to sedentary life styles, poor health and all the dreadful problems that accompany that.""In 2013, Baroness Grey-Thompson chaired a group which examined PE in Welsh schools. Its main recommendation - that PE be made a core subject with the same status as maths, English, Welsh and science - was not implemented.Education expert Prof Graham Donaldson was then commissioned by the Welsh Government to draw up a new curriculum.That first draft was published in April 2019 after consultations with schools and is made up of six areas of learning and experience - including wellbeing, which incorporates physical activity alongside topics like sexuality, relationships and healthy eating.Supporters of the new curriculum said it would lead to children being more active and healthy as, for the first time, the wellbeing of pupils would be placed at the heart of school life.Sport Wales, the organisation responsible for promoting sport and physical activity in Wales, supports the new curriculum but its chief executive Sarah Powell said success would stand or fall on the training teachers receive.Education minister Kirsty Williams agreed on the importance of solving the issue.""We all want our children and young people to be healthy, active and confident,"" said Williams.""It's integral we ensure all our children and young people get their daily physical activity.""Pupil well-being is a priority and we're working with Sport Wales and others to embed physical literacy into the Health and Well-Being AoLE (area of learning and experience).""Consultation on the new curriculum is open for feedback until 19 July.""I welcome the dialogue and invite everyone to respond,"" added Williams."

sport	Welsh sport minister makes board warning over lack of representation		"Welsh Sport minister Dafydd Elis-Thomas has warned that the absence of Welsh representation on the board of UK Sport is ""detrimental"" to sport in Wales.Lord Elis-Thomas has repeatedly called on the Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns to approve the nomination of Sport Wales Chair Lawrence Conway to the UK Sport board.Mr Cairns must confirm any appointment.Wales has not had official representation at a UK Sport board meeting since September, 2016.BBC Sport Wales has obtained emails between Welsh ministers and the UK ministers which reveal that Mr Cairns previously put forward his own nominee to represent Wales on the board of UK Sport.It is understood that Mr Cairns withdrew his nomination and the situation appears deadlocked.Sources within the Wales Office have suggested that Mr Cairns has explored various ways that Wales can guarantee it has representation on the board of UK Sport and ensure that Wales has a ""strong and credible"" voice on the board.In a letter from Lord Elis-Thomas to Mr Cairns sent in February, 2019 he describes the situation as ""totally unacceptable"" and says it is ""compromising the ability and role of UK Sport to act on behalf of the UK as a whole"".In a statement UK Sport told BBC Sport Wales: ""It is of great importance to us to have a nominee from all four of the home country sports councils on our Board as soon as possible.""Whilst the appointment is a matter for the UK and Welsh Governments to resolve, in the meantime we have been ensuring regular and proactive engagement with Sport Wales in our work at a Chair and Executive level.""We will continue do everything we can to support a resolution to this matter.""Former Sport Wales chair Paul Thomas was suspended along with fellow board members in November 2016 before he was sacked in March 2017.He was replaced on an interim basis by Mr Conway in September, 2017 before Mr Conway was confirmed in the post in June, 2018.Mr Conway was previously a senior civil servant who worked closely with former Labour First Minister Rhodri Morgan from 1999 until Mr Conway's retirement in 2010.After leaving the civil service he worked as a special advisor to Mr Morgan's successor Carwyn Jones.The Chief Executive of Sport Wales, Sarah Powell said: ""It's really important to Sport Wales that we have representation on the Board of UK Sport so that we can provide insight and guidance on the future direction of elite sport across the UK.""A UK government spokesperson said: ""Appointments to this position are made in line with UK Sport's Royal Charter. It requires the Secretary of State for Wales to make a recommendation to the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Welsh Secretary continues to give this matter consideration."""
sport	Change the Game: Women's sport 'at a crescendo' this summer		There is plenty more to come in a glorious summer of women's sport - and three top-class sportswomen have been discussing it in depth.The Fifa Women's World Cup has just finished - having attracted record-breaking television audiences - Wimbledon is entering its second week, and the Netball World Cup begins on Friday.Fed Cup captain Anne Keothavong, Commonwealth Games gold medal-winning netball captain Ama Agbeze and Arsenal footballer Danielle Carter - a Women's Super League winner - spent a morning at Wimbledon discussing the current profile of women's sport, their sporting idols and where they see their sports in five years' time.Question: What do you think about the level of coverage of women's sport this summer?Agbeze: We are at a crescendo and reaching a climax with women's sport this summer but it won't be the end. We need it to keep going, need to keep pushing it.Growing up, it was all male sport that I saw. I wanted to be an F1 driver but all I saw were male drivers, so I knew I had to do something else. If you can't see it, you can't achieve it.But what's great about women's sport at the moment is that we are winning things, so promotion and growth overlap.Carter: It's a great coincidence that there are such world-class tournaments happening at the same time. The Fifa Women's World Cup is in your face, on TV, papers and radio. I even drank a sports drink the other day and it had England captain Steph Houghton's face on it! It's what's been needed. But we need to keep the momentum going.Keothavong: I can't remember a time when women's sport has had this level of coverage. The Fed Cup win in April captured a lot of people's attention, and hopefully inspired a lot of people as we showed how capable female athletes are.Question: What can sports do to support players more, for example around maternity policies?Agbeze: We're just in the starting block. There should be equality but there's a lot to do, like there is outside sport in the work place.We use our bodies to perform but until we start talking about issues like this, nothing will change. Like Serena Williams and the protected rankings she campaigned for.Keothavong: Tennis is further ahead. The rules have been changed to help support players to have a family and come back into the sport. Protected rankings have increased from six months to two years so you can recover properly.I've got a three-and-a-half-year-old and a 20-month-old and any mum will tell you that trying to sort childcare out is a nightmare. I have had to take my baby to meetings but I also have a very supportive family to enable me to do the job I do.Wimbledon has the best creche on the tour. Historically, creches seemed to have been the norm on the men's tour but with more female players having children, there are more opening on the women's tour.But it's not just players; female performance coaches find a lot of barriers because of the travel involved and unsociable hours. We have lost a lot of talented women this way.Carter: It's not really talked about in football because there have been very few who have had children while playing. I couldn't even tell you if it is mentioned in my contract.Question: Who were your sporting idols growing up?Carter: I looked up to Rachel Yankey and was lucky to play a few games with her at Arsenal. And Serena Williams, as I admire her not only as a player but for all the battles she's had off the court.Keothavong: Monica Seles, as I loved her fighting spirit and the intensity in which she played the game.I am also a big admirer of Jade Jones. I used to do taekwondo as a kid in Hackney as my parents were keen for me to learn self defence. I made it to a red belt but I am in awe of Jade's high kicks!Agbeze: Growing up, I watched a lot of sport. My dad loved boxing so I would watch a lot of old Muhammad Ali videos, also a lot of F1.And I loved the Olympics and Denise Lewis. I grew up in Birmingham and was involved in athletics until I was a teenager and I used to be so excited if I saw Denise at training.I was selected for an under-17s netball tournament in New Zealand and it clashed with the English Schools [Athletics] Championships. I chose netball because of the trip to New Zealand!I then got a netball scholarship to Bath University and I love netball as it's a team game where there isn't focus on one player.Did you believe you could make a living out of your sport?Carter: I played football at primary school with the boys and I was spotted by Leyton Orient, who had a girls team. My mum was very supportive; she used to drive me to training and matches and kept me going.I never thought I would be able to make a career out of being a footballer; I just thought it would be a hobby. I have seen the transition from semi to full professional football in such a short space of time in the women's game and I'm fortunate enough that my age group are reaping the benefits of those who played before.Although we're professional, we are not set up financially for the rest of our lives.My mum pushed me academically and I did a degree in physiotherapy. I am a qualified physiotherapist and I was the under-17s physio at Arsenal before I went fully professional as a player.I am already thinking beyond my playing career. I am studying for a Masters CEO of a Sports Organisation as I am interested in the governance side of sport.Agbeze: When people ask me what I do and I say I'm a netball player, they then ask what else I do! I do get funded to be a full-time netball player.Question: Where do you want to see your sport in five years' time?Carter: I don't think women footballers will ever earn the crazy money we see in the men's game.But there is growing interest and more sponsorship opportunities in the women's game and we are changing perceptions. The sport is coming on leaps and bounds, getting bigger and bigger and developing.I don't think it will ever be as big as men's football but we are on an upward trajectory.Keothavong: Tennis has come a long way and even though there is equal prize money in the Grand Slams, the ATP and WTA tours are not comparable.The old argument is the duration of matches - men playing five sets, women playing three - but the women do just as much training as the men. People should just respect these athletes for the quality they bring on to the court and admire and appreciate what they can do.I also think we need to open up the sport to as many people as possible, to inspire people to be out there and active. Tennis players - male and female - are great role models.And we need male advocates. More David Beckhams and Andy Murrays to support us!Agbeze: Not many men play netball and I think they should play. We can't harp on about equality and then not make netball accessible to men. It will take time for male netball to grow but we should support it.I don't see netballers being paid megabucks in the next five years but what I would like to see is clubs being more stable, the league more sustainable, and more sponsors.The more visible the game is, it will encourage participation and we know how important a healthy society is.BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame this summer to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before. Through more live women's sport available to watch across the BBC this summer, complemented by our journalism, we are aiming to turn up the volume on women's sport and alter perceptions.

sport	Jose Mourinho praises ball boy as Tottenham beat Olympiakos in Champions League	Mourinho apologises to Dier'Not a bad player to beat' - Kane on bettering Del Piero	"Harry Kane bettered Alessandro del Piero's landmark and Dele Alli continued his return to form - but there was an unexpected recipient of Jose Mourinho's praise after Tottenham's Champions League win over Olympiakos.Spurs trailed 2-0 after 19 minutes but Kane scored twice, with Alli and Serge Aurier also netting as they reached the knockout stages in Mourinho's first home game.The turnaround was helped, as the former Manchester United boss was quick to point out afterwards, by a quick-thinking ball boy. With Spurs trailing 2-1 and Olympiakos attempting to regroup as the ball drifted out of play, the youngster quickly launched a ball to Serge Aurier, whose throw-in down the wing found Lucas Moura and the Brazilian picked out Kane for the equaliser.""I love intelligent ball boys like I was. I was a brilliant ball boy as a kid,"" Mourinho told BT Sport. ""And this kid today was brilliant. He reads the game, understands the game and made an important assist.""He's not there just to look to the stands, lights or scarves. He's living the game and playing it very well.""The Portuguese - who has won both games as Spurs boss so far - sought out the ball boy after the goal celebrations to shake his hand and give him a hug.Mourinho told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I tried to invite him into the dressing room after the game to celebrate with the team but he'd slipped away.""Mourinho apologised to Eric Dier for replacing the holding midfielder with the more attacking Christian Eriksen after only 29 minutes with Spurs trailing 2-0.He tried to sign Dier - who completed 10 of his 11 passes - while he was Manchester United boss.""The most difficult moment of the game for me was not when Olympiakos scored their first or second goal. It was when I made the change in the first half,"" he said.""I hurt the player but hurt myself. He's a very intelligent boy who has a good understanding of what a team is. It wasn't about his performance, it was about what the team needed.""I felt one midfield player was enough. We needed a second creative player who could play with Alli in an open triangle and not a closed triangle with Dier and Harry Winks. I apologised to him, although he knows I did it for the team. Christian gave us what we needed.""Kane's double took him up to 20 Champions League goals in 24 games. Nobody had ever reached that mark so quickly.The previous record was Italy legend Del Piero's 26 games for Juventus. He would end his career on 42 Champions League goals, all for Juve.Ruud van Nistelrooy took 27 matches, with Filippo Inzaghi needing 28 games and Mario Gomez next on the list with 32.""Not a bad player to beat,"" said Kane afterwards. ""It was about qualifying, no matter how we did it but we had to win and we did that."""

sport	Feyenoord v Rangers: Dick Advocaat recalls 'most beautiful period of my life'	'In Holland they underestimate Scottish football''To speak about Fernando is difficult'	"Dick Advocaat has described his Rangers tenure as ""the most beautiful period"" of his life as the Feyenoord head coach attempts to plot the Ibrox club's Europa League downfall.Rangers face the Dutch side on Thursday knowing they could clinch a last-32 spot with victory in Rotterdam.But Advocaat, who won five trophies in four years in Glasgow, has other ideas.""I have a special bond with Rangers. It was the most beautiful period of my life, really special,"" he said.""Rangers have style. There is a lot from the club and the fans that make you aware of that.""Something happens to your mind and your body. It comes from everybody there up to the lady who does the washing. Everything about the club has style.""Advocaat insists Rangers will face a different team from the one that was blown away at Ibrox on matchday one.Jaap Stam was in charge during the 1-0 reverse - a result that does not reflect how much Feyenoord were outplayed - only to resign little more than a month later on the back of a demolition by Ajax.Now under the stewardship of the 72-year-old, Feyenoord have gone four games without defeat and have a slither of hope that they can progress in the Europa League.Under Advocaat they have gone from 12th to 10th in the Eredivisie and sit two points off fourth - but whether it is enough to avenge the result in Glasgow remains to be seen for him.""In Holland they still underestimate Scottish football a little but Celtic and Rangers are top European clubs,"" said Advocaat, who was Zenit coach when the Russians beat Rangers in the 2008 Uefa Cup final.""I saw some games from them and they are really close to the level they want. It's the same for Celtic.""In that game [at Ibrox] it was only one game, and I didn't see Feyenoord. Tomorrow we have to do it differently. We have to show what we want and we have a very fanatical crowd here, the same as Ibrox. We need those supporters to make us give them a surprise.""When asked about the comparison with this game and that final in Manchester 11 years ago, a smile crept across his face as he replied: ""I am quite confident but in that evening I was more confident. A surprise is always possible.""While that result over two months ago ended with raucous celebrations at Ibrox, proceedings were ignited after a sombre silence in memory of former Dutch international Fernando Ricksen, who had lost his battle with motor neurone disease the day before.Ricksen was a player Advocaat had an intrinsic bond with. He was the man who first brought him to Scotland in 2000, while calling on him once more at Zenit St Petersburg.When asked about the former Netherlands international, the Feyenoord coach took time to pause in the De Kuip media room before mustering an answer.""To speak about him is still difficult,"" he said, his voice noticeably lower. ""He was a guy who fought so hard to stay alive for his family.""I brought him first to Rangers and he is a legend there. After that he had some problems and I brought him to Zenit, and he became a legend there as well but in a different way.""For me he was a really great guy and always honest. Even when he had a dark side as well. I feel very sorry for his family."""
sport	Aaron Sexton: Dual-sport star ready to focus on rugby after leaving athletics	'Do as much as you can for as long as you can'	"Ulster Academy prospect Aaron Sexton admits he was ""gutted"" to miss out on a medal in his final athletics race.The 18-year-old came fourth in the 200m final at the European Under-20 Championships in Sweden last Saturday.The race signalled the end of Sexton's glittering junior athletics career as the Bangor native opted to pursue a full-time rugby career.Sexton, who plays across the back three, signed an Academy contract with Ulster in June.Going into the Championships in Boras much was expected of Sexton, the fastest schoolboy in Irish athletics, who clocked the best qualifying time for the final but agonisingly missed out on a podium finish.""Going in as favourite and coming out fourth in my last ever race, I was gutted,"" he said.""It was a tough one to swallow but coming into pre-season means I haven't had too much time to dwell on it.""Last season Sexton scored seven tries in six games on his way to collecting the Ulster A player of the year award.As his stock rose on both the track and the pitch, Sexton began to sense that he was reaching an impasse that would force him to give up one of the sports.It was only when signing his first full-time contract with the province that he was forced to make the final decision.""Athletics was such a big part of my life, my dad was my coach,"" he said.""It was massive, it would be the only thing I would think about sometimes which is kind of sad when you think about it.""But I've known for the guts of two years now that it was going to be rugby, it was just a question of for how long I could keep doing athletics.""In June Sexton broke the Irish Under-20 200m record at the All-Ireland Schools Championships with a time of 20.69 seconds, the seventh fastest of any Irishman over the distance.Pace, unsurprisingly, is by Sexton's own admission his biggest weapon, and it is something that he has learned to channel effectively in both sports.""I would recommend to any young kids to do as many sports as you can for as long as you can, the rewards you get from it are amazing,"" he said.""Rugby and athletics are similar in that you've got to go to some dark places, but knowing the rewards that come from it make it all worth it.""You've just got to be psychologically strong enough to get through it"".Ulster begin their campaign against Ospreys on 27 September, with several key players expected to be on international duty at the World Cup in Japan.Sexton will be among a number of Academy players hoping that the absences will provide an opportunity to showcase their ability in the senior squad."

sport	Dillian Whyte: Promoter Eddie Hearn expects ring return despite UK Anti-Doping case	'These processes are taking too long'	"It ""would be ridiculous"" for Dillian Whyte to halt his career despite returning an adverse doping test in July, says promoter Eddie Hearn.Briton Whyte, 31, is ""really likely"" to fight on 7 December according to Hearn.Whyte was cleared to fight Oscar Rivas in July despite his failed test and Hearn has urged UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) to clarify its findings more quickly.""He is not suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) or Ukad and he has a career,"" Hearn said.Asked if Whyte will feature on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's bout with Andy Ruiz Jr on 7 December, Hearn told BBC Sport: ""I think it's really likely.""He needs to fight. This is his career, his livelihood, his job and what he does.""We are still waiting for Ukad to give their official synopsis of the event but he's had his hearing, he is cleared to fight. It would be ridiculous of him to wait while there is no reason for him to wait.""Whyte passed all tests with the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) in the build-up and aftermath of his bout with Colombia's Rivas, but gave an adverse test with UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) in the run-up to his win on 20 July.He was notified of the test result on 17 July but was cleared to fight by an independent panel on the day of the bout.The BBBofC allows Ukad to handle its anti-doping procedures and has confirmed Whyte is not suspended, while Ukad has so far declined to comment on the case.Earlier this week Ukad suspended American fighter Ryan Martin for four years over a failed drugs test after a bout against Scotland's Josh Taylor more than a year ago.Asked by BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello if Hearn was ""putting the ball back in Ukad's court"" by letting Whyte fight, Hearn replied: ""What you have just said I have never thought of but I think it is quite smart. It would help as we don't want to continually ask questions.""It's not a game. It's not about chess moves. We went through the correct process. We had a hearing with the National Anti-Doping Panel and they cleared Dillian Whyte to box.""If you have a problem with that show me another decision but make sure it's the right one.""We can't wait, wait, wait. We saw Ryan Martin banned for a fight that took place last November. These processes are taking too long. Whyte had his hearing and has been cleared. If you have something to say, let's hear it but in the meantime let Dillian continue his career."""
sport	Dr Freeman tribunal: Lawyer calls on newspaper to release documents		"Dr Richard Freeman's lawyer has urged the General Medical Council to exert more pressure on the Daily Mail to release documents she says are related to his medical tribunal case.Former British Cycling and Team Sky medic Freeman is contesting four of 22 charges to determine his fitness to practise.They include ordering banned testosterone to British Cycling headquarters in 2011 knowing or believing it was for an athlete.But Mary O'Rourke QC believes that a signed affidavit or witness statement held by the newspaper and signed by former British Cycling performance director Shane Sutton might help Freeman's cause.She has requested that the tribunal see those documents under Section 35a of the Medical Act.And, after a 14-day deadline passed, she has now asked the GMC to ""pursue an obtaining order"".Freeman, who left British Cycling in 2017, has denied ordering 30 sachets of Testogel to the National Cycling Centre for performance-enhancing purposes, but has admitted to making the order and trying to cover it up.He says he was bullied into ordering the Testogel for Sutton's erectile dysfunction. The Australian, who stormed out of the tribunal on Tuesday last week, denies Freeman's claim.In a day when the tribunal in Manchester was hit by technical problems, denying an endocrinologist an opportunity to give evidence, O'Rourke also provided an update on her application to access the documents held by the Daily Mail.She claims the legal document signed by Sutton relates to a story by the newspaper and ""contains a number of lies"". She also says it is ""inconsistent"" with evidence Sutton gave to a Department of Culture, Media and Sport inquiry into doping in sport in 2016.On Friday, O'Rourke said she had received an acknowledgement from the Daily Mail but described that as ""inadequate"", adding: ""We have asked the GMC to pursue an obtaining order and they are still considering their position.""She also said that her client, Dr Freeman, was keen that the tribunal did not ""drag out"" should the alleged document itself become the subject of litigation.The tribunal, which has already been hampered by legal argument, is set to conclude on 20 December.Friday's sitting was postponed until Monday after technical issues prevented endocrinologist Dr Richard Quinton from giving evidenceHe was set to say that Sutton did not have a medical need for testosterone. The Australian said last Tuesday he no need for the drug, which can improve sex drive.The tribunal is set to continue on Monday where both sides will argue whether Sutton's evidence is admissible after his premature exit at the tribunal last week.O'Rourke has also said she will apply to have the four charges which Freeman contests thrown out.She said: ""The GMC has no evidence to support its case."""

sport	Danil Lysenko: Officials suspended over anti-doping violations involving high-jumper	'It doesn't bode well for Tokyo 2020' - analysis	"The president of Russian athletics and senior officials have been suspended for anti-doping rule breaches involving high jumper Danil Lysenko.The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) said the provisional suspensions were linked to an inquiry into whereabouts violations committed by the world indoor champion.Lysenko and his coach have also been suspended.Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015.That followed a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) which found evidence of widespread doping in the sport.Some athletes from the country have been able to compete under a neutral status, although last year Lysenko had that revoked by world governing body IAAF because of his failure to provide whereabouts information.The AIU said: ""A number of senior federation officials, including the Russian athletics president Dmitry Shlyakhtin and executive director Alexander Parkin, the athlete and his coach, have been charged with tampering and/or complicity under the anti-doping rules and been provisionally suspended.""This follows a 15-month AIU investigation (in co-operation with Russia anti-doping agency Rusada) which concluded that federation officials had been involved in the provision of false explanations and forged documents to the AIU in order to explain whereabouts failures by the athlete.""The AIU said the Russian athletics federation has until 12 December to respond to the notice of charges.Alex Capstick, BBC Sports News correspondentRussia's official return to international competition in track and field now seems more remote than ever. The charges brought by the AIU are serious and undermine attempts to persuade World Athletics that the suspension, in place since the country was accused of running a ""state sponsored"" and ""systematic"" doping programme in 2015, should be lifted.The sport's governing body has become increasingly frustrated with Russia's response to the conditions laid out for its return, but that has been compounded now that senior officials have been charged with covering up doping violations. At the moment it's not clear what further sanctions Russia could face - a formal expulsion has been mentioned. It certainly doesn't bode well for the chances of Russian athletes competing in their national colours at next year's Tokyo Olympics.It's a scenario that could extend to the entire Russian Olympic team. Earlier this week it emerged that Wada will receive a recommendation to reinstate a ban on the country for non-compliance after discrepancies were found in drug testing data from a Moscow laboratory."
sport	Natasha Jonas: British fighter on setbacks, motherhood and growing women's sport	A painful setbackPunches and soft playPounce on Eureka moments	"Natasha Jonas is the fighting mum, with a World Cup football-playing sister and world-title aspirations undimmed by recent setbacks.At 35 the Liverpudlian is still making tweaks to her training, has overcome the ""emotional"" stress of a first defeat last year and wants that title tilt soon.Meanwhile, passionate in her backing of women's sport, she calls on governing bodies to pounce on ""eureka moments"".As Jonas prepares to face Bec Connolly in Liverpool on Friday, she sat down with BBC Sport to talk school runs, bouncing back and the health of women's sport.In becoming the first British woman ever to box at an Olympic Games in 2012, Jonas' profile grew - but her move into the professional ranks took a further five years, with daughter Mela coming along in 2015.Life in the paid ranks has seen her persistently linked with a shot at Ireland's Katie Taylor - who eliminated her from the London Games - but a defeat by Brazilian Viviane Obenauf in August halted her progress towards a bout with the unified world lightweight champion.""It wasn't the loss itself that hurt, it was the manner of the defeat,"" said Jonas, who outpointed Tanzania's Feriche Mashauri in March. ""I'd never been stopped before in amateur or professional, so it hurt.""The first time you lose it's a very emotional thing. Its your pride, your ego, everything.""People are on a journey with you and not everybody is a boxer, so they judge off results. When you're winning they think you always will. They follow your career and don't expect you ever to lose.""No-one ever wants to lose, so once you have that undefeated record it does become a burden. It becomes an added pressure as you don't want to lose it. You want to be a Floyd Mayweather or a Joe Calzaghe - but when it does go it's also a relief as it's happened; the pressure is off so crack on.""Jonas insists she learned more from defeat than she had during any point in her career, prompting changes in her training.She believes her return to winning ways in March has provided a momentum and hopes the chance to fight for a world title will come at the ""end of the year or the start of next year"".Daughter Mela would no doubt be impressed with such an accomplishment.""She can't go past a swing in a soft play area without throwing punches and saying 'look mummy, look',"" adds Jonas.""She loves watching the shows, anything where someone is on TV who she knows.""Everyone asks if I will push her into boxing. I'll do what my mum did and encourage her to be active.""It's tough but I think being a working mum everyone finds it tough - it's just my job is a bit different. You're still doing the school runs and being a mum. People go to the office, I go to the the gym and hit a bag or someone else.""Jonas' boxing career was preceded by 18 months at St Peter's College in the United States on a football scholarship.Her sister is Lyon forward Nikita Parris, who recently starred for the England's women on their run to the World Cup semi-finals.Having witnessed the boom in women's boxing and the growth of her sister's profession, Jonas is hopeful about the future of women's sport.""We still have a long way to go before it is equal but we are progressing in the right direction and it's making it easier for young people coming through,"" she said.""It's important that those coming in while it's on a rise don't go through the same struggles we did.""I think every sport has a 'eureka' moment. For boxing it was London 2012 Olympics as people saw women performing at the elite level. That changed a lot of minds and opened the eyes of young females. I think there was a 57% increase in females who wanted to box.""For football I think it was the 2015 World Cup - that was massive. Hockey saw the 2016 Olympics, netball saw the Commonwealths in 2018.""When you have that eureka moment it's up to associations to keep that ball rolling, with sponsors, TV companies on side.""You have to keep it growing."""

A lot of thinking and mental stuff - I'm fitter than ever before, and had massive weight loss. The team have learned a lot as well.""Defending two-time champion Jean-Eric Vergne started well down the field and retired from the race, but has a chance to atone in Saturday's race in Ad Diriyah."

Before the championships in October, she told BBC Sport she was in a ""much better place"".Cox, who is a Paralympic champion in both athletics and track cycling, finished sixth in the 200m on Wednesday. She has since flown home to the UK.After the 200m, Cox, who has multiple sclerosis, told BBC Sport she was receiving ""amazing support"" from British Athletics.""Kadeena has got a long-standing problem, which she has been really open about,"" said Dunn. ""It's not going to be a quick fix.""Kadeena's got a really good support team around her, she's got her medical team supporting her and we are just following that advice.""Ultimately, she is the centre of decisions we make, Kadeena the person and not the athlete. We are going to be led by her team and we are just going to support Kadeena through this.""We know there are going to be ups and downs until she gets to the end of it but as both sports, cycling and ourselves, our main concern is to make sure Kadeena's wellbeing is the priority."""

James Anderson (90%)Who missed out?Pick your England Ashes team	Pace bowler Jofra Archer should make his Test debut for England in the Ashes opener against Australia, according to BBC Sport users.Archer, one of the stars of England's World Cup triumph, is expected to be named in England's 14-man squad on Saturday for the first Test at Edgbaston starting on 1 August.Of more than 115,000 people who picked their England team, 82% felt Archer deserved a chance in the longer form of the game.Jason Roy, who made 72 on his Test debut in the win over Ireland at Lord's this week, and Rory Burns were the most popular choices to open the batting, although there were plenty who wanted Alastair Cook to come out of retirement...Roy - a central figure in the World Cup campaign - may not have answered all the questions about his technique in scoring a Test half-century on debut, but he was almost a unanimous choice to open against Australia.Another batsman with technical flaws. Selected by 91% of users for England's tour of Sri Lanka last winter, Burns has seen his stock fall considerably on the back of some inconclusive performances.There was never really any doubt that Root would be picked but, interestingly, 51% of users think he should bat at three - compared to the 47% who think he would be better in his preferred position of four.Despite bagging a pair against Ireland, Bairstow's place in the team is secure. There was less certainty over where he should bat, though, with number four (32%) preferred to three (21%) and five (22%).England's World Cup final hero and a nailed-on presence in the middle order. While 37% of users picked all-rounder Stokes at six, 45% thought he was good enough to bat at five.Buttler was another player whose name features on the majority of team sheets. He is the users' favourite to occupy the number six slot, although 26% were in favour of pushing him one place higher.Despite Moeen's miserable form - he averaged 19 with the bat and 46 with the ball in the World Cup and managed only nine runs in two innings against Ireland - he gets the nod as England's sole spinner.Given that the majority of votes were cast before Woakes' 6-19 blew Ireland away on Friday, he was already a popular choice as one of four seamers in the team for the Ashes opener.BBC Sport users obviously saw enough of new boy Archer during England's World Cup campaign to convince them that he has what it takes at Test level. Behind only Anderson as the most popular seamer among those who voted.England's second-highest Test wicket-taker of all time he may be, but Broad is far from a guaranteed pick in the team. His 4-19 in the second innings against Ireland might have seen him picked by more if voting was starting now.It appears to be a no-brainer to select the most prolific pace bowler in history, and a man who remains the master of his craft. Perhaps only a recent calf injury persuaded 10% of users not to pick him.All-rounder Sam Curran, as the next most popular player with 35%, will perform 12th-man duties, while leg-spinner Adil Rashid (31%) is overlooked in favour of Moeen.Interestingly, 21% of users want England legend Alastair Cook to come out of international retirement to solve their top-order problems.Mark Wood (20%), Joe Denly (16%), Ben Foakes (14%), James Vince (12%) and Jack Leach (11%) were the best of the rest.Not picked your team yet?

sport	England: Euro 2020 - the team we predicted five years ago	So how did we do?How did you get on?	Over the past few days we've been reminded about a BBC Sport tweet from five years ago...It seems that back in 2015, we tried to predict England's XI for Euro 2020 - so now it's time to revisit it and look at how clever we actually were.It seems we've got an eye for a forward, with Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling both in our side.But then we've also struggled in a few positions - although, in fairness, injuries have played their part.On the face of it, how could you go wrong by picking the Premier League's 2014-15 Golden Glove winner Joe Hart?But hindsight's a great thing, isn't it? These days, 32-year-old Hart is struggling to get games at Burnley, where he is number two to current England squad member Nick Pope.We were at least a little closer with John Stones, who is well in the mix, while Eric Dier played in the World Cup in Russia in 2018 could yet make Gareth Southgate's squad next June - albeit he has not figured since the Nations League third-place play-off against Switzerland in June.OK, we were a million miles out with Nathaniel Clyne, who hasn't played for the Three Lions for three years, while Luke Shaw has had his fair share of injuries, which brings us nicely into midfield.When fit and firing, Jack Wilshere looked the real deal. He's still only 27, but unfortunately this gifted midfielder's injury count is higher than caps these days.Jordan Henderson was one of our more inspired choices, with the Liverpool midfielder well in the frame for next summer's tournament, as is Ross Barkley, who played in October's internationals.The same cannot be said of Nathan Redmond. Talk about old tweets coming back to haunt you!We were not alone in seeing mixed results for our predictions, however.Looking back on your suggestions, there were some questionable shouts for who else might be present in England's Euro 2020 squad.There were, admittedly, a few commendable efforts:Adam Smith: Is it too much of a punt to call Dele Alli into the squad?Ed: I think Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Dominic Solanke will be up there.Kwadwo Boadu: I think Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be in rather than Nathan Redmond and I would not be surprised if Jon Flanagan will be in rather than Luke Shaw.And then, of course, there were the less successful ones:Macauley Mills: What about Jon Flanagan and James Ward-Prowse?

sport	Carl Frampton: Belfast boxer could fight for world title in home city in 2020	'We could sell out Windsor Park'One defeat away from retirement	"Carl Frampton could fight in Belfast again next year as he bids to become a three-weight world champion.The former super-bantamweight and featherweight champion returns to the ring on Saturday when he fights Tyler McCreary at 128lbs in Las Vegas.He revealed his next fight, if he beats the American, could be against WBO super-featherweight champion Jamel Herring in his home city next spring.""It makes sense,"" said Frampton of a world title fight against Herring.""It looks like it is going to happen. There are no contracts signed or anything, but Bob Arum [Frampton's US promoter] has mentioned it to me and Jamel Herring is making the right noises about it.""The fight against McCreary is at 128 because it gives me the chance to go up or down [in weight]. If a title appears at featherweight I'm happy to step in, but I would like the chance to become Ireland's first three-weight world champion and fight Jamel Herring.""Speaking on Sportsound Extra Time from his US training camp, Frampton said the possibility of the fight being in Belfast surprised him.Frampton fulfilled a lifetime ambition when he fought at Belfast's Windsor Park in August 2018, defeating Australian Luke Jackson, and a return to the national football stadium could be a possibility.""It came out of the blue - Bob Arum just said he would like to do it in Belfast,"" the 32-year-old said.""It was great to hear. There was talk of fighting in New York on St Patrick's Day which would have been ideal as well, but to get the chance to become a three-weight world champion in your own backyard is unreal.""When you think about it, it makes sense. If we did it in the spring, we could sell Windsor Park out.""Before any potential match-up with Herring, Frampton must first beat the undefeated McCreary in what will be his first fight in 11 months since losing to Josh Warrington in Manchester just before Christmas last year.The Belfast fighter admitted that a defeat against the 26-year-old could lead to his retirement from the sport.""No, it's not,"" Frampton said when asked if it was too simplistic to say that he could quit after his next loss.""If I lose to Tyler McCreary, I would probably be five fights away from a world title shot, but I'm not thinking about that.""I feel that I will not just beat him, but will beat him in style. I feel that I am going to knock him out."""

sport	Formula 1: How Toto Wolff made Mercedes one of sport's greatest teams	Setting the right objectivesTwenty engineers sitting in a room chanting 'om'Fear of failure as a motivationThe tension between stability and changeThe Hamilton factorWhat about the future?And Wolff's own future	"Toto Wolff is more or less on time for our interview, which is a bit of a novelty for the boss of the Mercedes Formula 1 team.Such are the demands on the time of the 47-year-old Austrian, as head of Mercedes' motorsport programme, that his lateness for appointments has become a bit of a running joke between Wolff and his closest advisers.But it's a joke that misrepresents the reality of the expertise with which Wolff runs his finely honed organisation, which is poised to become the most successful team in the history of F1.After winning eight races in a row at the start of this season, Mercedes are firmly on course for a sixth consecutive double of drivers' and constructors' championships, which would break the record of five set by Ferrari in the era of Michael Schumacher.Typically, successful F1 teams start to fracture sooner or later - through stasis, or ambition, or complacency, or a combination of those and many other factors.Somehow, Wolff has prevented that happening at Mercedes. It's little wonder Lewis Hamilton calls him ""the best person I know for managing a business"".Wolff ascribes the team's success to ""permanent scepticism"" and says the ""relentless pursuit of excellence"" seen in Hamilton as he marches towards his own sixth title this season is ""something that is very ingrained in the team"".""Lewis has played a big part in that,"" says Wolff. ""He never stops pushing for performance. He is very self-critical. He is the only driver I have ever seen coming into a debrief and saying: 'Don't look at my data because my driving was not good enough.' And that from a five-time world champion.""This relentless pursuit of being a better you tomorrow than you have been today, and brutal honesty with yourself, transparency within the organisation to overcome mistakes and shortcomings, is something that is a very big part of Lewis' character - and the mindset of the team.""BBC Sport sat down with Wolff to discuss leadership and success, how Mercedes have avoided the pitfalls that usually befall successful F1 teams - and intend to carry on doing so for some years to come.It is a story of open-mindedness and humility. It includes unexpected and unusual details - 20 engineers meditating together in a room, for example. And it reveals the reasons behind the remarkable achievements of a team who show no sign of slowing down.Since Mercedes started their winning run, with the advent of the turbo-hybrid engine formula in 2014, hints of weaknesses have been few and far between. And the desire to win is as strong five years on as it was when Mercedes were setting out to end Red Bull's four-year domination at the start of this decade.The secret, Wolff says, is framing targets that keep motivation high throughout the organisation.The ""right objectives keep you motivated and energised,"" he says.Although the target is the same every year - winning the world title - each season has offered a different angle which has allowed the team to ""reinvent"" themselves.""Winning the first championship was a huge mountain we wanted to conquer,"" Wolff says. ""And then we wanted to prove we were able to do it a second time.""After that was achieved, a major change of rules for 2017 - introducing wider, faster cars - created the ambition ""to be the first team to win through a regulatory change"".This year, that was the case again - but more important was the desire ""to beat the all-time Ferrari record, which means six double championships in a row"".Wolff sums it up: ""You can see that the ultimate target of winning the championship always remained the same, but there was a little nuance to it that motivated us.""You need to wake up in the morning with a sense of purpose and clear objectives, and that keeps you going.""Wolff describes the F1 environment, where advanced technology is combined with the intense psychological strain of being measured in public 21 times a year, as ""tremendously challenging"".""Staying energised, physically and mentally fit, is not trivial,"" he adds.Mercedes provide support for their staff, employing physical and psychological coaches.""We do mindfulness,"" Wolff says. ""We have actually rolled out meditation across the whole team over 1,000 people. You need to utilise those marginal gains in order to extract the most out of your group of people.""Wolff is well aware that the idea of F1 engineers - people who spend their lives engaged in science and data - embracing meditation sounds incongruous.""Yes,"" he says with a smile. ""There is a funny story. I have actually been quite into meditation for many years and I am an active practitioner. But when we started, we chose a group where we believed there would be some of the most hardcore, stubborn, hard-line engineers who would think this is some kind of tree-hugging exercise.""We put them all in a room - there were about 20 of us - and you will be surprised to hear that after the full course, which was six or seven sessions, the ones we believed would drop out immediately because it was all just 'nonsense', they did the whole thing to the end and actually improved their mental wellbeing and their performance.""This was 20 engineers sitting in a room, all chanting ""om""?""Yeah, we actually sat in a half-circle in the first session and started by closing our eyes and opening the palms of our hands,"" Wolff says.""I didn't dare to open my mind because I felt it would be quite a funny situation and I wouldn't be able to hold myself [back]. But we pushed through that initial phase of resistance and I must say that I have increased the quality of my life tremendously by doing it, and the feedback we received was very positive.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceThis open-minded approach to maximising the team's potential extends to learning from other successful sports teams.Mercedes work with a forensic psychiatrist, Ceri Evans, who has also been instrumental in the success of the New Zealand All Blacks. Evans' ""see it, say it, fix it"" mantra, Wolff says, ""encourages everybody in the organisation to speak up and point out our shortcomings and deficits, and he has been very instrumental in making us successful.""This openness and lack of blame culture is key to keeping the team together, Wolff believes.""I think the people enjoy going to work. They are well incentivised - but that doesn't necessarily mean it is all about money. It is also about recognition and having a place where you enjoy being and the interactions and the relationships that you build in the team. And I think this has been one of the strong points within the team.""We keep our values up very high. It is a place where there are no internal politics. Integrity and honesty are most important. It is an environment where people dare to speak up.""We actually encourage people to say their opinion because it is important for your own development. So, overall a positive environment in a world where things are not always very funny.""But success at Mercedes has not solely been about ensuring the team works as efficiently and effectively as possible.After difficult races, Wolff often talks about learning from failure - a favourite phrase of his is ""turning your worst days against your rivals"".""The days we fail are the days we learn the most,"" he explains. ""You never leave a track with a great victory saying: 'Why the hell did we win?' But you leave the track saying: 'Why the hell did we lose?'""Indeed the diligence of the analysis to leave no stone unturned is much deeper and intense when you have lost.""The pain of losing lasts many days, probably up until the next race. The enjoyment of winning disappears on the Monday morning after the grand prix. And this has kept us going.""To watch Mercedes over a grand prix weekend is to see a team of people who have worked together for well over 10 years. Key personnel such as chief engineer Andrew Shovlin, chief strategist James Vowles and sporting director Ron Meadows have been with the team since it was Honda in the mid-2000s, and through the Brawn year of 2009.But this contrasts with the car-design operation. When Wolff took over running the team from former boss Ross Brawn at the start of 2014 - having joined as executive director a year earlier - he kept the technical team in place and installed former McLaren technical director Paddy Lowe to run it.After three years of success, Lowe left and was replaced by James Allison, formerly of Ferrari and Lotus/Renault. Under Allison, there has been a period of organic change and a gradual shift as the men who led the design department under Brawn have moved into different roles, and a new leadership team has emerged.Wolff says: ""In areas of weakness, you mustn't be afraid to change. But change is only the last resort.""First, it is about trying to reposition, develop, help, support. And sometimes when the organisation develops in a different direction - because the regulatory environment changes, for example - you need to look at the individuals.""But, overall, I believe the people in this team have high potential and when we were able to motivate them and energise them, we have seen the results.""There has also been a change on the car front this year. Mercedes have struggled on low-speed circuits in recent times, but this season Allison, technology director Mike Elliott, head of aerodynamics Jarrod Murphy, head of vehicle dynamics Loic Serra and chief designer John Owen developed a new design philosophy - and slow corners are now the car's biggest strength.Wolff says: ""What you need to achieve is to try to have an environment where you can develop your strengths and reduce your weaknesses.""It was very visible that on tracks like Budapest and Singapore we under-performed - high-downforce tracks, for example. And we really tried to improve our game there.""We completely turned the aerodynamic philosophy of this car upside down, because we knew it would fit the new regulations, or we were hoping it would. And it was absolutely the right call they made.""The car is not the only key area of Mercedes in which the bar has been raised in recent times. That also applies to the team's lead driver.Hamilton has said that in the second half of last year he found a ""sweet spot"" - and that he has held on to it ever since. The result has been 12 wins in the past 17 races.This has coincided with a marked change in the Briton - over the past two and a half years he has become a much more serene character than the occasionally anguished figure of his first three or four years at Mercedes, or his McLaren years.Equally noticeable is a recurring theme in Hamilton's life, and coverage of it - he receives criticism for what is perceived by some to be an irresponsible lack of commitment to his job, such as flying from Shanghai to New York to launch his new clothing collection before last year's Singapore Grand Prix, only for him to turn up at the race and smash it out of the park.Wolff is unapologetic about the freedom he gives his lead driver to live his life the way he wants to - in fact, he says it is key to his on-track performance.""Most important is to acknowledge that we are all different individuals and we need different frameworks in order to perform well,"" Wolff says.""Lewis is somebody who needs to be able to pursue his other ambitions and interests. And rather than putting somebody in a box and saying, 'This is how a racing driver needs to behave - you need to be on time, you need to avoid jet lag before the race, or don't record music overnight when you are jet-lagged but try to sleep,' I realised very early on that giving him the freedom of pursuing his interests, we were able to extract more performance on track.""I have the feeling that he needs to get his mind off motor racing. If he's able to do a fashion show that excites him, or record some music, or do some snowboarding with his friends, he forgets about the racing side, and he can come back stronger and more energised.""And yet Wolff did not know this the first time he allowed it to happen, after which he needed the courage to continue to let it happen. Not everyone would have found that an easy idea to embrace.""I realised in previous roles that you need to be able to accept that we all function in a different way,"" Wolff says. ""And sometimes the most creative people, the ones that are able to outperform others and perform on a different altitude, are the ones that live a different life. And you just need to be able to embrace that.""When you take the analogy to a very popular sport in the UK - rugby - you need the solid members of the team that keep the team going. But you realise that probably the geniuses score the tries, and these are the ones that are sometimes not easy to integrate in a structure that needs process.""But with Lewis, we love who he is and he is clearly an absolutely outstanding athlete, and we have been able to embed him in the organisation. And he has been able to inspire us and drag us with him.""While Mercedes winning the championship this year looks close to a certainty, Wolff says he ""struggles to talk about a possible scenario that we haven't achieved yet"".Beyond that, Mercedes will inevitably start favourites to raise that bar to seven consecutive titles in 2020.The introduction of a new set of regulations is due for 2021, including a budget cap, which will, as Wolff puts it, ""put the F1 world upside down"".But that simply creates the latest in a series of motivational targets for Wolff and his remarkable team.""This current championship is the one we need to concentrate on most,"" he says. ""It could be our sixth consecutive championship, something that has never been done before. So all eyes are set on this target this year.""But equally we want to maintain our levels of performance in the years to come.""In 2021, we want to be able to prove we are a team that wasn't a flash in the pan but we have been able to sustain maybe a decade of success.""As for Wolff himself, he runs a successful investment business alongside his role as head of Mercedes Motorsport, which expands next year with the car company's formal entry into the all-electric Formula E series.With his track record, it is perhaps inevitable that he has recently been linked with a role running F1 itself after his existing Mercedes contract expires at the end of next year.But listen to him talk, and that sounds far from his mind.""Restlessness is an important personality trait that you just want to be better tomorrow,"" he says. ""And fundamentally I really enjoy what I'm doing. But I have been thinking over the winter what is it that I enjoy most, and it's actually the relationships with the people.""We had a coach that asked me the question, 'Which are the places you enjoy being the most?' And I realised it was in the garage with the mechanics and seeing them work on the cars, or being in the engineering treehouse at the track and listening to the intelligence of these unbelievable people who are able to put a fast car on track.""You can sum it up as a relentless curiosity that drives me.""Mercedes is entering into Formula E at the end of the year and that is an exciting new chapter. And then with all these rumours out there I have been trying to think about what actually drives me.""It is the pursuit of lap time. I enjoy the benchmarking, the competition of racing. The bad days and the good days. And lap time is somehow so brutally honest. The stopwatch never lies."""
sport	Ryan Hedges: Wales call up Aberdeen winger for Euro qualifier		Wales boss Ryan Giggs has called up Aberdeen winger Ryan Hedges for Tuesday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium.The former Swansea City trainee, 24, has won three caps since making his debut in November 2017 against Panama.After winning 2-0 in Azerbaijan on Saturday, Wales will qualify automatically for Euro 2020 if they beat Hungary on home turf.Wales will have Stoke City midfielder Joe Allen available after suspension.In Allen's absence in Baku, Joe Morrell - on loan at Lincoln City from Bristol City - impressed in the holding role as Wales largely nullified any threat from the home side.The control Wales had allowed Giggs to substitute Gareth Bale after an hour, the forward not having played for Real Madrid for a month due to injury.Aaron Ramsey has had his own injury problems at Juventus and the midfielder replaced Bale to enjoy a useful 30-minute workout ahead of the Hungary game, giving Giggs plenty to ponder before picking his starting XI on Tuesday.Media playback is not supported on this device

sport	Jack Nowell: England and Exeter Chiefs winger reflects on World Cup setbacks	'As close to world class as you could ask for'	"England winger Jack Nowell says his return to the Exeter side has ended one of the toughest periods in his career.Injury and illness since June saw the 26-year-old play a bit part in England's World Cup campaign.But Nowell impressed on his return to action for Exeter as the Chiefs beat Glasgow 34-18 to take command of their Champions Cup pool.""It's been a pretty frustrating five or six months for me, but I'm relieved to get back out there,"" he told BBC Sport.Nowell injured his knee and ankle in last season's Premiership final loss to Saracens and suffered a burst appendix in the build-up to the World Cup.Having overcome those issues, he hurt a hamstring in his try-scoring appearance against Argentina in Japan and played no further part in England's run to the final.""Coming towards the end of my rehab each time, something seemed to happen,"" he said.""My appendix burst and I got back from that, lost 10kg of weight and finally put it back on, and I was really excited to get back out for that Argentina game, but unfortunately my hamstring was a bit dodgy towards the end of that game.""It was quite upsetting to finally get back fit, almost taking that step into a game and then getting injured again.""Nowell played a key role in the build-up to two of Exeter's four tries against Glasgow as they achieved back-to-back bonus-point wins at the start of a Champions Cup campaign for just the second time to top Pool 2.""What's fantastic for me is I know he's nowhere near 100% yet,"" said Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter.""That doesn't mean he's not fit to play, but he's not at optimum level yet. That ankle is going to take a bit of time and treatment to get to 100%.""There was one moment he created which led to a try which was as close to world class as you could ask for - he's got no space and he appears out of the other side of three or four defenders and then makes a good pass and we're gone. You won't see another player in England do that, you genuinely won't.""Nowell added: ""There's always that drive to get back as you miss it when the boys are out there playing and you're watching.""No matter how hard it is and the rehab and stuff, this is why you do it, this is why I want to be out there playing."""
sport	FA Cup second round: Maidstone United looking to join Premier League clubs in third round	Changing lives for the better'I'll know when it's time to retire''1,000-a-week use pitch'	"""They won a corner and I suddenly found myself standing next to him. It was the only time I got anywhere near him.""Former Arsenal defender Gavin Hoyte is talking about his brief encounter with Lionel Messi in front of 40,000 Argentina fans in Buenos Aires in 2014.Five years on from his substitute appearance in Trinidad & Tobago's 3-0 friendly defeat in South America, Hoyte is set to turn out in the FA Cup second round for non-league Maidstone United at Blackpool on Sunday.Hoyte was 18 when he made his senior Gunners debut alongside Aaron Ramsey in a League Cup tie in 2008.While Ramsey has since moved to Juventus, Hoyte combines playing in the sixth tier of English football with working as a learning support assistant in special needs schools in Essex - and says he ""could not be happier"".""I get a sense of achievement going into schools and doing that,"" said Hoyte, who has been in non-league since leaving Barnet, then in League Two, in December 2016.This is his first season in National League South after being released by Dagenham & Redbridge in the summer and Hoyte, who joined Arsenal as a nine-year-old before leaving in 2012 after four senior appearances, says he is still adjusting.""At Arsenal you play on a carpet and you have to shout to the other person in the changing room because it is so big,"" he added.""At this level some opposition grounds are terrible. Some don't even have hot water. It's very windy, there might be 500 watching, it's really hard to get up for.""But it's the real world and I wouldn't have it any other way.""Obviously I do look back and think 'what if I had played more games at Arsenal?' but you've got to be positive. I've got six or seven assists this season and I couldn't be happier.""Maidstone - nicknamed the Stones - finished bottom of the National League last season but their summer signings reflect a club determined to make a quick return to non-league's top flight.As well as bringing in Hoyte, who also appeared in the Championship for Watford, they signed George Elokobi, veteran of 58 Premier League appearances in Wolves' defence between 2009-12.Wolves fans fondly remember Elokobi for his powerful headed goal in a 2-1 win over Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in 2011 - and the celebration which followed where he took out his delight by kicking the corner flag.""I went through a lot with Wolves in terms of they took me in as one of their children and it was a love relationship from the beginning,"" said the Cameroon-born player.""There may be players who I played with in my three seasons in the Premier League who said to themselves 'I'm not going to drop down to non-league'.""But people forget I started my career in non-league with Dulwich Hamlet.""I worked my way up through sweat and blood and I'm humble enough to play at any level - even if it's parks football.""Stones captain Elokobi has played in all four cup wins against Cheshunt, Hitchin Town, Kings Langley and Torquay United to help the Kent club pocket £72,750 in prize money so far.Away from Maidstone's 3G pitch, the 33-year-old runs his own business as a life coach and motivational speaker, inspiring clients to change their lives around and achieve their potential.As a child growing up in Cameroon, Elokobi had to come to terms with the death of his father, grandad and uncle all in the space of a few months.He moved to England at the age of 16 to start a new life and lived with his mother in Brixton.""I did not get in trouble, I did not get mixed up in gangs when there was peer pressure to do so,"" added Elokobi. ""I chose to lead myself but not in an arrogant way.""Maidstone, who train three mornings a week, went through two different managers last season - Jay Saunders and Harry Wheeler - before appointing John Still as head of football in January.It is the 69-year-old's second stint at the club having steered the original Maidstone United to the Football League in 1989 before standing down because he wanted to stay part-time to continue running a company selling industrial clothing.Still's managerial career, which started in 1976, includes spells at Peterborough, Luton, Dagenham & Redbridge as well as Barnet.He is responsible for helping to develop forwards Dwight Gayle, now at Newcastle, and Andre Gray, who also plays in the Premier League for Watford.Still stood down as Barnet boss last December to spend more time with his wife, Barbara, who was seriously ill. He is enjoying being back at Maidstone - three points off a National League South play-off spot - working alongside head coach Hakan Hayrettin.Five months away from his 70th birthday, Still is not thinking of retirement any time soon.""My body will tell me when I'm ready to pack it in,"" he said. ""I'll know when the time is right. When I no longer enjoy it or when no one wants me - whichever comes first.""Maidstone hire out their 3G pitch to increase income, with around 1,000 people each week using the club's £5m facilities on the banks of the River Medway.The Stones played their first match back in their home town following an absence of 24 years in 2012 after the completion of the 4,200-capacity Gallagher Stadium.Two years earlier the club had been laden with around £350,000 of debt and almost went out of business.""There was no money,"" co-owner Oliver Ash, a chartered surveyor and economics graduate, recalled.""The club was within one or two weeks of going under.""Businessman Terry Casey, a lifelong fan, came on board with Ash and the joint-owners have since stabilised Maidstone's finances - although the club is seeking new investment.""We have lots of community teams, an award-winning disability section, a thriving women's section and 2,000 fans coming to home games,"" added Ash, who lives in France and is a shareholder and director at French Top 14 rugby union side Brive.""We also have 50 students in a full-time academy based at the club.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceMany Stones supporters remember Chris Smalling turning out for the club in 2007-08 at the start of a career which would take him to Manchester United and Roma.On Sunday, those same fans hope Hoyte and Elokobi will be able to inspire the non-league side to a famous win at the home of 1953 winners Blackpool."

sport	Sierra Leone's Mohamed Buya Turay is recovering from 'juju injury'		"Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Buya Turay says he is recovering from a leg injury which he claims was caused by 'juju' or black magic.The 24-year-old missed his country's 1-0 loss in Benin in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers last Sunday due to the injury after he had featured in in their 1-1 home draw to Lesotho four days earlier.""I've almost fully recovered from my injury,"" Buya, who won the Swedish league with Djurgarden and also finished as the league's top goal scorer last month, told BBC Sport.""I had no toe injury when I played against Lesotho because no one stepped on me or kicked me.""But I started feeling pain on my toe when I returned to the hotel where the team were camped the following day.""""I informed the team's physiotherapist who couldn't figure out what was wrong, and the pain got heavier when we were on the bus heading for the training ground.""The pain got worsened when we arrived at training ground, it extended to the whole foot and leg and I then decided to call some of my family members who took me to a woman native doctor.""The native doctor told me that the cause of toe injury was because I stepped on a spiritual object in Leone Stars camp, put there for me by a person who wanted me to get elephantiasis thereby destroying my career.""She further told me that if I had gone to the hospital for treatment or had used conventional medicine to try and heal the toe that would have ended my career.""In an earlier social media post he said that the person responsible was jealous of the Golden Boot that he won in Sweden.He also rejected claims by some fans that he avoided the Benin game in order to appear in a TV documentary aimed at promoting his career.Buya says he believes everything that the native doctor told him and that the person he claims wants to destroy his career will not go free.""I believe all what I have been told, I have heard before about things like these happening in the Leone Stars camp. Now I have seen it for my self,"" he continued.""I don't want to reveal the identity of the person now but I promise to fight back, he'll not go scot free.""Buya who is on loan to Djurgarden from Belgian club Saint-Truidense is not sure about his international future for now because of what had happened.""It's not easy for me for now. Right now I'm not thinking about whether or not to play for Leone Stars, I'll think about it later when I put behind my back what has happened with me,"" he said.The Sierra Leone Football Association, the national side's technical team nor the sport's ministry have reacted to Buya's claims."
sport	Tiger Woods: His scandalous, tumultuous and redemptive decade, sparked by a car crash		"Tiger Woods sped out of his Orlando driveway, across kerbs and a central reservation, collided with a fire hydrant and ploughed into a neighbour's tree.For the world's most recognisable sportsman, this incident during the very early hours of 27 November, 2009, began a scandalous, tumultuous and spectacularly redemptive decade.In the previous dozen years Woods had dominated golf like no other player. He won multiple majors - the championships that define careers - and reeled off tournament victories all over the world.In the past 10 years he has won only one major but his life has turned around. He is a doting father, his sport's greatest ambassador and still a player capable of winning at the very highest level.Comparing the most recent decade with the all-conquering period that preceded it, Rory McIlroy, who is one of his biggest rivals, says: ""I think what he had to go through to get to the other side in the last 10 years is equally as impressive.""In the wake of the crash, Woods' image plumbed shameful and painful depths before eventually soaring again to hit epic highs.That night, 10 years ago, he was surrounded by shattered glass and was groggy from a cocktail of painkillers and sleeping pills. He then lost consciousness and was ferried to hospital in an ambulance.We were about to discover that this proud champion was, in fact, a deeply flawed individual. The crash occurred in the moments after his wife Elin had found out that her husband had been cheating.In the days and weeks that followed, it became clear Woods had been a serial philanderer. Celebrity gossip magazines and websites were all over the story. They became an essential source for hard news, as the downfall of Woods made headlines everywhere.He had always jealously guarded his privacy. Now the whole world knew his address: 6348 Deacon Circle, Windermere, Florida 34786.The crash happened a week after Woods added yet another tournament victory to his glorious career. He won the Australian Masters in Melbourne, but reporters from the National Enquirer were on his tail. The American celebrity magazine suspected Woods had a secret girlfriend, Rachel Uchitel, in tow at the luxury Crown Casino and hotel.When he returned to America he warned his wife the Enquirer would be publishing a story. He denied its allegations and multiple accounts state that he set up a call between Uchitel and Elin to reassure his wife.Then on 26 November, Woods went to the nearby Isleworth clubhouse to spend Thanksgiving evening playing cards. He returned home, took an Ambien sleeping tablet and went to bed.At this point Elin started to go through his mobile phone. She texted Uchitel and then called her. In the process she confirmed the affair. ""I knew it,"" she is widely reported to have said. Elin then confronted a groggy Woods, who ran to his driveway, jumped into his Cadillac Escalade and fatefully crashed exiting his property.No-one tracked Woods closer in 2009 than journalist Robert Lusetich. He was writing Unplayable, a book examining the character of this most guarded of golfers.Lusetich was playing golf with friends on 27 November. The Australian reporter recalls: ""One of the guys looked at his phone and he said: 'Tiger Woods has been injured in a car accident and nobody knows how bad it is.'""It was like 'wow, that's incredible'. So I sent Steve Williams [Woods' caddie] a text. He was in New Zealand.""Williams called Mark Steinberg, Woods' long-time agent from the International Management Group.Lusetich heard back from Williams. ""Steinberg said everything will be fine,"" the writer says. ""And then he said: 'Don't believe anything that you're gonna hear.' That's a strange thing to say. When we saw the story from the National Enquirer it became clear that this was indeed a scandal of some magnitude.""Numerous women subsequently came forward to say they had secret relationships with the world's best golfer leaving his fans and fellow players stunned.""I've learnt a few of the new websites this week,"" said Irishman Padraig Harrington, who was one of Woods' biggest rivals at the time. ""It's a phenomenal story, the spotlight is massive.""When Woods was front page of the New York Post for 20 consecutive days, it beat a record set by the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001.""I'm just amazed,"" admitted the 2006 US Open winner Geoff Ogilvy. ""How did nobody know? Tiger Woods is quite recognisable.""Woods retreated from competitive golf - the sport he dominated with 14 majors, second only to the game's most successful player, Jack Nicklaus. He had been on track to overhaul that record of 18 major titles. It seemed only a matter of time for such a special player, one who had grown far bigger than just golf.A black man dominating a white man's game, he could flash a million-dollar smile. Woods was the face of multinational companies such as Nike, Accenture, Gillette, Gatorade and Tag Heuer. He was the number one golfer in the world and Forbes made him sport's first billionaire.There was a seemingly idyllic domestic scene with a photogenic wife and two young children. To the outside world he had it all, but inside there was turmoil.And it came cascading to the fore with the relentless revelations which detailed his behaviour leading up to that infamous car crash.Woods was released from hospital the following day and headed to Arizona where he had plastic surgery to repair his lip which had been cut in the crash. His whereabouts were known to only his closest confidants.""I couldn't believe that Tiger Woods would be that reckless,"" says Lusetich. ""He had basically convinced himself that he was bulletproof because of prior incidents and being able to cover them up.""On 11 December Woods released a statement which said he was taking an indefinite break from golf.""I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children,"" he posted on his website.After Christmas, he checked into Pine Grove Behavioural Health and Addiction Services, a facility in downtown Hattiesburg, Mississippi. It was reported he enrolled on the ""Gratitude"" programme to treat sex addiction.Woods has never confirmed the nature of his treatment. ""Gratitude"" was designed by Dr Patrick Carnes, who first introduced the term sexual addiction into medical circles in 1983.What seems certain is that Woods faced a brutal regime of self analysis well away from the outside world. It meant he missed the first birthday of his son Charlie.""I can't go back to where I was,"" he later said. ""I want to be part of my son's life and my daughter's life going forward.""Not everyone was convinced of the wisdom of Woods' treatment. A future president weighed in on Fox News: ""I would recommend Tiger just call it a bad experience,"" said Donald Trump.""Say bye-bye, go out, be a wonderful playboy, win tournaments and have a good life. The most important thing Tiger can do is get back on the golf course and win. This whole thing with sex rehabilitation, I'm not sure I'm a believer.""Woods returned home to Isleworth on 15 February 2010 and it was time to address the world.Four days later, surrounded by close friends and his mother Kultida, he stood before a television camera in a room at PGA Tour headquarters in Florida. Twenty-two TV networks in the US interrupted schedules to broadcast Woods' 14-minute statement. Never had this supreme champion looked so vulnerable.He apologised for his ""irresponsible and selfish behaviour"" and afterwards his mother stated: ""I'm so proud to be his mother, period. He didn't do anything illegal. He didn't kill anybody.""The Open champion at the time, Stewart Cink, commented: ""It was probably one of the most difficult things he's ever had to do.""The night before the apology Woods went to the range to hit his first golf balls since the scandal broke. ""I hit them solid,"" he is reported to have told Hank Haney, his coach at the time.He returned to action at the first major of the year, the Masters, a little under two months later and received heavy criticism from Billy Payne, chairman of Augusta National Golf Club.""He disappointed all of us,"" Payne said at a remarkable chairman's news conference. ""And more importantly, our kids and our grandkids. Our hero did not live up to the expectations of the role model we saw for our children.""Remarkably, Woods finished fourth in the tournament, a stunning result against the best players in the world after four tortuous months away from the game.Within days Woods split with Haney, who subsequently wrote a tell-all book, The Big Miss. It detailed his hugely successful time coaching Woods and provided unique insights on someone so secretive of his life on and off the course.Haney revealed Woods' obsession with the military, that the player had trained with Navy Seals and undergone punishing regimes that put enormous stress on his body.Throughout his career he has needed multiple surgeries to correct knee, neck and back problems. ""Some of the injuries, I believe, did not come from golf,"" says Lusetich.""He went through that crazy phase of wanting to be a Navy Seal and did some dangerous things that hurt both his back and his knee.""Nevertheless, by 2013 Woods returned to the top of golf's world rankings. He was dominating the PGA Tour but failed to add to his major tally. No longer feared in the way that he was pre-scandal, he appeared a weaker force on major weekends.""What happened 10 years ago, I think there was always that aura of invincibility around Tiger, so I think that showed a little bit of a vulnerable side to him,"" says Rory McIlroy.""It humanised him a little bit. It is obviously very hard to come back from something like that from a mental standpoint.""But as a fellow competitor, McIlroy is also impressed by how Woods coped with the injuries that threatened his career. ""He's been through the wars just with what he's had to go through physically,"" says the current world number two.""I remember to this day the lunch we had in 2017 and he was sort of talking 'maybe this is it? Maybe I can't play anymore'. Then 15 months later he's winning on the PGA Tour again.""Weeks after that pessimistic lunch date, on April 20, 2017, Woods had what proved to be a career-saving back fusion operation. It was the last throw of the dice, surgery essentially aimed at making him able to be an active father and family man. If he could compete again as a golfer, that would be a bonus. ""It is hard to express how much better I feel,"" Woods wrote a month after the procedure, his fourth and most important back surgery.But, although he was repaired there was more shame to be endured. To cope with the rehab and previous pain, Woods was dependant on a cocktail of painkillers and sedatives. Within days of that upbeat assessment, he consumed a potentially lethal concoction of drugs.In his system there was Vicodin for pain relief, Dilaudid - a controlled substance to combat severe pain - Xanax to ease anxiety, THC - the active ingredient in marijuana and Ambien to help sleep.We know this because he was found by Jupiter police slumped at the wheel of his Mercedes car which was parked up with punctured tyres at around 2am on 29 May, 2017.Video footage of an incoherent, shambolic Woods being questioned by police, handcuffed and put in cells for the night went viral. His puffy-eyed mugshot stared from the front page of pretty much every newspaper.His DUI (driving under the influence) arrest led to prosecution for reckless driving. There was no alcohol in his system but the episode threatened uncomfortable echoes of his calamitous downfall of 2009.""The biggest part of his comeback and the one that will get least attention from 'Camp Tiger' is that DUI,"" insists Lusetich. ""I think that was rock bottom.""When everyone saw him slurring, unable to walk, the great Tiger Woods and that video, there was a sadness to it. It was a tragic vision of a once great but now fallen star.""Once again Woods needed to put his life back together. He got clean and furthermore found he was able to swing a golf club with freedom. It was a revelation and meant he could do what he always did best - compete.He came close to winning the 2018 Open at Carnoustie and the US PGA the following month. Then he won the season-ending Tour Championship, eclipsing McIlroy, his playing partner in the final round.""And fast forward another seven months after that and he's won another major,"" McIlroy says. ""I think it's been incredible.""I think it shows his character, his mental capacity, his grit that he can come back after all these mishaps, whether it be personal life or the physical injuries that he's had to endure.""Woods has reconstructed his whole life since the 2009 crash. Elin divorced him in the wake of the revelations that followed. Between 2013 and 2015 he dated US skier Lindsey Vonn, someone well aware of the unique demands of life in the sporting spotlight. Now the golfer is in a long-term relationship with Erica Herman, general manager of his restaurant in Jupiter, Florida. She was there with his children to greet him at Augusta after Woods won this year's Masters.For the champion, the fact that his children were there to witness his 15th major title, his first since the pre-scandal US Open of 2008, was the most thrilling aspect of that extraordinary triumph last April.""I think he achieved more as a person in the last decade,"" says McIlroy. ""Think about the wonderful job he has done as a dad to Sam and Charlie.""That takes up a huge chunk of his time now, trying to be with them as much as possible. He doesn't travel as much because he doesn't want to be away from picking them up from school, watching their football matches or any of that.""That side of him has really blossomed because of all the stuff he's had to go through,"" adds the Northern Irishman.Earlier this month Woods won again. The Zozo Championship in Japan provided his 82nd PGA Tour success, equalling the record set by the legendary Sam Snead.The tournament spilled into a fifth day because of weather delays. On the final morning English golfer Ian Poulter warmed up alongside Woods.""He's amazing,"" says the 43-year-old, who has played throughout the Woods era.""It was as good as I've seen Tiger Woods ever hit it. Ever. It was as controlled as I've ever seen him,"" Poulter adds.""To listen to the strike, watch the ball flight and to see him finish off that tournament, Tiger has still got it. He doesn't need his A game, his A minus game is still good enough to get the job done.""Woods remains deeply private but his image has softened and in a controlled way he lets more people into his life. On Golf TV, where he provides insights for subscribers, he demonstrates previously unseen charm and humour.""He did a great job of not allowing the human being to come out and be seen,"" Lusetich says of Woods' former life.""It's not like he's an open book these days but things like he does now with Golf TV, and I know they pay him, open him up more and there is more depth to him.""It has been a remarkable journey over the last decade. From rock bottom, Woods rides high once again. He is a redeemed, restored champion still more vital to his sport than any other player.Next month he returns to Australia a different man. He captains his country in the Presidents Cup, a Ryder Cup equivalent against the rest of the world outside Europe. He is playing so well he had to pick himself as a wildcard selection.He turns 44 at the end of this year, a leader and player, fit and fighting and a champion of more substance than the figure who was hiding so many secrets in the first part of his career.As McIlroy says: ""He's a wonderful ambassador for our game. Everyone involved in golf, you in the media, ourselves as players, equipment manufacturers - everyone benefits from Tiger Woods being at the top of golf.""I think we should all count ourselves very lucky that he's still in that position."""
sport	European Curling Championships: Scotland face holders Sweden in women's final		"Eve Muirhead's Scotland rink will face Anna Hasselborg's Swedish reigning champions in Saturday's European Curling Championships final.The Scots edged out world champion Silvana Tirinzoni's Swiss 3-2, drawing the final stone of the extra end.Tirinzoni's rink had tied the dogged contest in Helsingborg by scoring a single in the final end.""That game was 100% a game of patience,"" former world champion Muirhead said.""I think we called a really good game, but Sweden's going to be a different game. It's going to be tough, a big battle and it'll be about digging deep, but I'm up for it and I think we're capable of something pretty special.""Hosts Sweden romped to a 9-3 win over Alina Kovaleva's Russia thanks to scoring a five at the eighth end.It leaves the two sides who finished joint top of the round-robin, with only one defeat apiece, playing off for third place.Scotland and Sweden both suffered two defeats in their nine games and Muirhead will need to avenge a heavy 11-4 loss to the holders earlier this week if she is to add to her 2011 and 2017 European titles.Hasselborg will be seeking her second title, having won silver at the previous two Europeans, losing to Muirhead in the final two years ago.Sweden will be going for double gold in front of their home fans after Niclas Edin's side defeated Ross Paterson's Scots in Thursday's semi-final."
sport	Jadon Sancho: How single-minded schoolboy made his dream a reality		"Jadon Sancho drops his schoolbag and sits down. His white shirt - sleeves rolled up and blazer discarded - hangs from his 14-year-old shoulders. His burgundy-and-gold tie is knotted loosely around his neck. He and his team-mates from Watford's under-15s have been excused from their classrooms and, one by one, called into one of the school's small upstairs offices.Their coach, Louis Lancaster, is there to meet his players and discuss their ambitions. When asked what he wants from football, Sancho's reply comes without hesitation. ""I want to play for England, and I want to play for one of Europe's top clubs,"" he says. ""I want my family to be proud of me.""Aged 19, he has achieved all of those feats and his goal for Borussia Dortmund against Barcelona in the Nou Camp on Wednesday was his latest footballing landmark. Whether he has many more at the club remains to be seen, with reports suggesting he is set to leave in January after a falling-out over ""disciplinary issues"". He is, it seems, wanted by many of Europe's leading clubs.Being at the centre of such a high-stakes transfer saga is a world away from the environment in which Sancho gained his earliest footballing education. That came in the cages - the all-weather sports courts - near his home in Kennington, south London. He was childhood friends with Arsenal's Reiss Nelson and Ian Carlo Poveda, who later became a Manchester City team-mate. He was spotted by Watford aged seven and would travel across London three nights a week to train with the Hornets until, at 11, he was old enough to attend the club's partner school, the Harefield Academy in Uxbridge, west London.The commute from Kennington to Uxbridge was too long to be feasible daily, and so came the first of many sacrifices the young Sancho would make in pursuit of his dream: he left his family home to move in with an aunt in Northolt, and was ferried the 14-mile journey to school by taxi each day. When boarding facilities were opened at Harefield, Sancho left his family to live on the school grounds.From Monday to Friday, his routine revolved around football. Morning classes were interrupted for training. He'd return to school in the afternoon and, when the other kids went home, he'd have to make up for the lost lesson time before evening training began. Then it was back to the boarding house, rinse and repeat.Perry Price was a left-back in Watford's academy and a schoolmate of Sancho's. ""He's always mentioned big clubs - Real Madrid, Barcelona,"" Price tells BBC Sport. ""It was always part of his plans. He sacrificed his youth for football.""Sancho was not a disruptive student but, during school time, football dominated his focus. ""I remember one of his teachers saying: 'Jadon, can you get off YouTube and carry on with your work,'"" recalls Lancaster. ""I look over at his computer and he's got Ronaldinho on the screen. Down goes the browser. She turns around, I look back - Ronaldinho's back on the screen.""Lancaster admits there was little internal hype over Sancho at Watford, but when he first saw the winger in action as a 13-year-old, he was in no doubt he'd seen a future star. Leading a summer session that included boys as old as 16, the coach ran the players through a drill in which they could lay the ball off simply to either side to earn one point for their team, or dribble around a defender for three points. Not once did Sancho take the safe option.""I just remember everything being so smooth and elegant for Jadon,"" says Lancaster, who now coaches the Chinese Taipei national team. ""He didn't break sweat. He was effortless. When I drop a shoulder, no-one moves; when he does it, people fall over.""What I liked about him was his fearlessness. He was always looking to take players on, to try new things and be creative.""Sancho soon joined Lancaster's under-15 side. He was playing a year above his age group but was, by some distance, the team's best player. He lit up one midweek match against Arsenal with a solo goal of jaw-dropping brilliance. On the pristine main pitch at Arsenal's Hale End academy, Sancho collected the ball near the halfway line and burst between two defenders. The Arsenal youngsters were unable even to keep up with the shadows Sancho cast under the floodlights as he unleashed a 35-yard shot that arrowed into the top corner.On another occasion, against Colchester, he scored into an empty net after replicating one of Brazil great Pele's most famous tricks - rounding the goalkeeper without touching the ball, using only body feints and misdirection. And at 14, he began to feature regularly for Watford's under-18s.To continue improving, Sancho needed to be challenged, and nobody was more aware of that than the player himself. Lancaster would often set up uneven teams for training games, testing his players in matches of nine against seven or 10 against six. Sancho always wanted to be on the side with fewer players. And when the coach reversed the usual dynamic one time - insisting the winners, rather than the losers, were to do punishment sprints - Sancho was just as determined to be victorious as ever and led his team through the forfeit.Manchester City had been tracking Sancho's progress since he was 13. In March 2015, the month Sancho turned 15, City swooped. Under the rules which govern all elite academies in England, the teenager was signed for an initial compensation fee of just £66,000.Opinion of Sancho, strange as it seems with hindsight, was divided among scouts at this stage. Some felt he lacked the athleticism to make it at the highest level; others likened his dribbling style to England legend Paul Gascoigne. ""He was able to beat players with body movements, swerve, momentum and intelligence,"" one scout told BBC Sport. ""When you can do that, you don't have to be super-quick. If a bit of pace comes, it's a bonus.""Figures close to the deal insist, despite reports to the contrary, City's interest was not rivalled. For Sancho's part, he was certain going to City was the right next step in his development. He is described as being ""very single-minded"" in his ambition to move north, and the switch happened quickly.""He just left,"" Lancaster remembers. ""I didn't even know he'd gone.""The St Andrews floodlights illuminate the dusk of a mid-spring Monday evening as Sancho lines up to face Birmingham City in his Manchester City debut. He wears black boots - as dictated by club policy for all players below under-18 level - and the same button-collar, purple shirt as his team-mates. Yet, starting as a central striker, he instantly stands out. City demolish their hosts 8-3. Sancho zips into dangerous positions, weaves through crowds of defenders and scores five.A talent-loaded under-16 side coached by former City striker Gareth Taylor went unbeaten throughout Sancho's first full season with the club, and he was instrumental in a run to the FA Youth Cup final as an under-18 in 2017. There was a healthy competitive spirit among this gifted crop. In the under-16s, Sancho played predominantly on the left wing, and would never want to be outshone by Luke Bolton on the opposite flank.During a pre-season session on one of the outdoor pitches at City's impressive academy facility, Sancho was among 20 players being put through their paces by coach Jason Wilcox. The players - including Brahim Diaz, now at Real Madrid, and Rabbi Matondo, who has since joined Schalke - were completing the bleep test. As the intensity of the 20-metre shuttle runs increased, the group dwindled, dropout by exhausted dropout, until just two remained. Sancho and Phil Foden looked across at each other, still running hard. ""Let's stop together,"" they agreed.Among such high-quality peers, Sancho's determination to impress only grew. He was ""obsessed with winning player of the tournament everywhere we went"", one member of City's academy staff recalls. ""There were moments in training where he'd do things and you'd wonder how he did it - and he'd be able to reproduce it in games,"" says another.In the summer of 2017, City offered Sancho a first professional contract - worth a reported £30,000 a week - and manager Pep Guardiola was ready to take the young winger on the senior side's pre-season tour. But Sancho weighed up his chances of breaking into the most expensively assembled squad in world football against a more frictionless route to first-team football on offer at Borussia Dortmund. He rejected City's offer and moved to Germany in a deal worth in the region of £10m.At Dortmund, a detailed plan for his integration was drawn up. He would combine training with the first team with additional sessions and matches with the club's second string - led by Jan Siewert, who went on to manage Huddersfield Town in the Premier league - and the under-19s.""It was clear when he came that he needed an optimal relationship between load and recovery, because he was not used to men's football,"" Siewert says. ""The club had to build him up quite carefully. In 2017 when he came, he had just three games with me. We started him with 55 minutes, then 65 and, at the end, 75. And within the week, he played with the under-19s team.""The good thing was he came and didn't think he was anybody superior in my team - he just wanted to train and work hard.""Sancho had been named player of the tournament as England reached the final of the European Under-17 Championship in May 2017. He was directly involved in 10 of England's 15 goals before defeat by Spain on penalties. When the Under-20 World Cup came around in September, he was desperate to help the Young Lions go one better.Sancho scored twice against Chile in England's opener but it was decided he should return to his club after the group stage. While he was disappointed to leave his team-mates - who went on to hammer Spain 5-2 in the final - behind, Sancho understood he had outgrown that level of competition and his development was better served back in Germany.""Before the game, he sent a video message to his guys, and England won,"" Siewert says. ""He committed fully to the work. I think at that time he realised it was his career and the way he performed in my team led him to the first team.""The transfer to Dortmund saw Sancho leave behind his mother and sisters in London, but his father, Sean, moved with him. Sancho's close relationship with his dad, who used to inspire his young son with videos of John Barnes, is cited as a positive, grounding influence by everyone who has worked with the Dortmund player.Those who know him best insist Sancho has retained his humility during his rapid rise to stardom. He is still the same harmlessly cheeky, football-loving kid from Kennington. Signed shirts are dispensed on request to old friends, and last summer he visited his old primary school to talk to students, preaching the gospel of hard work and self-belief. When returning from the Nations League finals in Portugal last June, Sancho jumped straight into a taxi and headed to Islington, north London. He was carrying with him a signed Dortmund shirt and was en route to surprise a friend who had supported him during his days in the Watford academy.Now one of the first names on the Dortmund teamsheet - when he is on time, at least - and an England regular, Sancho's decision to try his luck in Germany has been vindicated. He has become the youngest player to reach 15 Bundesliga goals, the first player born this millennium to play for England and is one of the most consistent assist providers in Europe.It is impossible to predict how things would have worked out had he stayed at City, but it is instructive that he has played more than nine times as many minutes in the Bundesliga as Foden has in the Premier League.When Sancho saw an obstructed pathway, he decided to create his own. And several English youngsters have followed his lead in going abroad in search of opportunity - including childhood friend Nelson, who spent last season on loan at Hoffenheim.""It doesn't matter if he's walking out on Hackney Marshes or Wembley in front of 80,000 people - it's football, it's fun,"" Lancaster says. ""What you've seen of him is nothing compared to what's to come.""That laid back, confident 14-year-old discussing his football dreams alone with his coach in a small school office could not have imagined he would achieve them all by the age of 19. Sancho's story is one of opportunities seized, his success is a triumph of will as much as talent."

sport	Karim Benzema: Is Real Madrid player the most underrated striker in Europe?	'A record to rival Europe's best'What makes Benzema so effective - and popular?France exile now seems permanent	"""He is one of the most underrated players in the world.""On Tuesday, the pitch at the Bernabeu will be full of star players, from Kylian Mbappe to Eden Hazard and Neymar to Edinson Cavani - plus possibly Gareth Bale - when Real Madrid host Paris St-Germain in the Champions League.However, that pre-game assessment by PSG boss Thomas Tuchel was not about any of those much-hyped superstars.It was about Real striker Karim Benzema.In 2009, Cristiano Ronaldo joined Real for a then world-record £80m fee from Manchester United and Benzema was approached to replace him at Old Trafford.The France forward rejected the move and instead the two became team-mates as he too joined the Spanish giants from Lyon for £30m.A decade on, having been described as ""a tad overrated"" by ex-England striker Gary Lineker, how has Benzema outlasted Ronaldo and many others at the Bernabeu and is his talent - and longevity - overlooked?At a time when Ronaldo and Barcelona's Lionel Messi have taken the sport to new levels with their goalscoring figures as they battled for supremacy, Benzema's own records have flown under the radar.Real know victory over PSG will guarantee a place in the knockout stages of the Champions League and will hope to gain revenge for the 3-0 defeat in the reverse fixture.But it was in their previous European game - a 6-0 thrashing of Galatasaray - in which Benzema, according to boss Zinedine Zidane, did something ""amazing"".His two goals meant he became only the second player after Messi to score in 15 consecutive Champions League campaigns - even Ronaldo has not yet achieved the feat as he failed to score in the group stage for United in the 2005-06 season.Reaching the landmark of 50 goals saw him overtake Real's legendary striker Alfredo di Stefano in Europe, while only the two usual suspects - Ronaldo and Messi - and Robert Lewandowski (59) have scored more than Benzema in the Champions League since 2009.Just three days later, a double against Eibar in La Liga took him to sixth on the all-time list of Real scorers, overtaking another legend in Ferenc Puskas, and with 234 strikes he also became the highest-scoring Frenchman at a foreign club - surpassing Thierry Henry's record at Arsenal.Benzema has won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys, three Uefa Super Cups and four Fifa Club World Cups in his time at the club.Manuel Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Rafael Benitez, Zidane (twice), Julen Lopetegui and Santiago Solari have all come and gone while he has stayed constant.On the pitch he has seen off competition from the likes of Gonzalo Higuain and Alvaro Morata, while big-money summer signing Luka Jovic cannot get a look in, netting just once this campaign.Benzema, instead, continues to lead the Real line and is La Liga's top scorer with 10 goals this season; his total of 25 strikes in 2019 is bettered only by Messi in Spain.A senior club source reportedly said in April, ""they have been criticising him for 10 years and he is the best"", while in September Benzema topped a Marca poll of most underrated players.""I think the lack of recognition for his talents does get to him,"" says BBC World Service Sport's John Bennett. ""Back in January, L'Equipe published their shortlist of 15 strikers for its 2018 World XI.""Benzema was nowhere to be seen and he took to social media, writing 'hey L'Equipe, my friends. Am I maybe 16th?'. Sadly off-field controversies will probably mean he never gets the credit he deserves, certainly in France.""As well as finding the net on a regular basis, Benzema has also been a constant source of goals for his Real team-mates since joining in 2009.During that period, only Messi (140), Ronaldo (96) and Luis Suarez (84) have set up more goals in Europe's top five leagues than the 76 Benzema has.""Benzema has been extremely popular with managers and with fellow players at Real Madrid for getting the best out of his team-mates,"" adds Bennett.""You don't get many top strikers who are known for being unselfish but Benzema is one of them. He is a real team player.""The Frenchman played a huge part in Ronaldo's success at the Bernabeu, giving him more assists in La Liga than any other Real Madrid player.""His goalscoring record also stands up to scrutiny. Yes there have been lean times but he scored 30 goals last season in all competitions, a number he only bettered in his second season at Real Madrid.""Benzema works harder than he is given credit for, on and off the pitch. You don't reach his levels of consistency without incredible fitness and without living your life right off the pitch.""Despite his record at club level putting him among Europe's elite, he remains conspicuous by his absence from the France squad.Benzema has netted more league goals than compatriots Antoine Griezmann and Alexandre Lacazette, as well as Olivier Giroud, who played all seven games at the 2018 World Cup but failed to score.He has not played for the national team since a sex tape scandal in 2015, a case that was later dropped, but he missed Euro 2016 and the World Cup triumph two years later.During this month's international break the president of the French Football Federation Noel Le Graet suggested there was no way back by saying although Benzema is ""a very good player"", the ""adventure is over"".Bennett adds: ""His final France game was in October 2015 but his name still comes up during every international break, with many pundits in the country rueing the fact he can no longer play for the team.""It is worth remembering he was criticised towards the end of his time in a France shirt for not playing as well for his country as he was for his club but few would argue that if it wasn't for the scandal he would be starting ahead of Giroud.""He would also have a World Cup winner's medal in his trophy cabinet."""
sport	British Figure Skating Championships - a guide to the action	Short and free programmes, figure skating and ice dance - the definitionsThe main events in Sheffield	The 2019 British Figure Skating Championships are taking place in Sheffield this weekend.There are four separate national senior titles being competed for - men's, women's, pairs and ice dance.The competitors will look to follow in the skate marks of GB legends Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean (champions 1979-84), John Curry (1971, 1973-76) and Robin Cousins (1977-80).The event will be streamed on the BBC website, app and connected TV.Competitors take part in a short and free programme in each event. The short programme is more technical and requires the performance of certain selected moves.The free programme allows more flexibility to showcase their creative strengths within a longer routine.The scores of both routines are combined to give competitors an overall result.Ice dance features couples skating to contemporary music and having to stay within two arms' lengths and perform complicated - often synchronised - moves. There are no jumps in ice dance.Marks are deducted for falls, interruptions, failing to synchronise with the music and creativity.Pairs, by contrast, are choreographed to classical music and judged on the skaters' ability to perform lifts, side-by-side jumps and throws.The majority of the action in the senior competitions takes place over the weekend, with the two components of the four main categories taking place in the last two days of competition in Sheffield.Men'sSheffield's own Peter Hallam will be looking to home advantage to go one better than last year, when he won silver, and he will be buoyed by his win in the Tayside Trophy in August.The man he has to beat is 2018 champion Graham Newberry, who won his first title in 2017 and whose father Christian was crowned British champion 30 years ago.Entries: James Horrocks, Graham Newberry, Peter Hallam, Harry Mattick, Elliott Thompson.Women'sDundee's Natasha McKay has won gold for the past three years and won the most recent of her five international tournaments at the Tayside Trophy.McKay's main contender, fellow Scot Karly Robertson, has just turned 30 and was 18 when she first won the British title in 2007. She added a second title in 2014 and has finished second 10 times since that first win.Entries: Genevieve Somerville, Victoria McMahon, Kristen Spours, Danielle Harrison, Katie Powell, Nina Povey, Bethany Powell, Natasha McKay, Karly Robertson.Pairs:Zoe Jones and Chris Boyadji have dominated the event for the past three years, winning it each year. Jones won the individual title in her early 20s and Boyadji has won the British pairs title five times in the last six years. They are the only listed entrants for this event.Ice Dance:The strong favourites will be Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson, who competed for GB at this year's European Championships and World Championships, coming 16th and 13th respectively. British champions two of the last three years, the pair are gaining a reputation internationally and won bronze in the Skate Canada Grand Prix event last month.Lilah's 17-year-old sister Sasha will be aiming for a fourth title in the junior event and a third with partner George Waddell.Last year's runners-up, Robynne Tweedale & Joseph Buckland, have European-level experience and have been in the mix for the past three seasons.Entries: Eleanor Hirst & Anthony Currie, Lilah Fear & Lewis Gibson, Shannon Jahrling & Luke Russell, Jodie Russell & Aaron Freeman, Rebecca Clarke & Frank Roselli, Robynne Tweedale & Joseph Buckland, Jessica Marjot & Jan Nordman.

sport	Dave Ryding: Can British skier end GB's wait for a World Cup win?		"""If a guy is beating you week in, week out, you start to feel it is an impossible task.""Dave Ryding is Britain's top alpine skier. After a decade of having to settle for second best, life just got ""easier"".The retirement of the great Austrian Marcel Hirscher brings to an end a career that has brought two Olympic golds, 11 World Championship medals and a record eight successive World Cup titles.For Ryding, it presents an opportunity.Despite global success in other skiing disciplines including freestyle and telemark, Britain has never had anyone win at an Alpine Ski World Cup event.Ryding has come close, with two second places in World Cup races - at Kitzbuhel in 2017 and in Oslo last season.His time is now. This Sunday, he races in the season's first Alpine Ski World Cup slalom event at Levi, in Finland.""When Marcel was racing, you did feel you were aiming for second at best - so the fact he is no longer racing does make it easier for everyone,"" Ryding tells BBC Sport.""My aim is to be on the podium at every race this season and my ultimate goal is to win one. It's time to step up now and take more risks.""The 32-year-old Lancastrian was leading the slalom in Levi after the first run two seasons ago but hit a rut in the second run and crashed out. This weekend sees the season start in the northern Finland ski resort.""It was a bitter pill to swallow as I was so close to a first World Cup win and it did take me a while to get over it,"" he says.""But I like the hill at Levi, so let's see how this weekend goes.""Ryding has been on the World Cup scene for a decade, improving his ranking each year to now sit in the top 10.He was a relatively late starter, trying skiing for the first time on a dry slope at Pendle Ski Club in Lancashire aged six, and first competing on snow aged 12.""I did suffer from imposter syndrome at the beginning of my career as I was not expected to be any good coming from dry slopes compared to those from traditional alpine nations who had grown up on the snow,"" he says.""But year by year I have worked hard and proved I could compete with the best.""Ryding will be 35 when the Beijing Winter Olympics come around in 2022.It will be his fourth Games, and he will be aiming to better his ninth-place finish in Pyeongchang.""In the last two Games, the slalom gold medallists were 34 and 35, so I'll be at my peak,"" he says.""Because I started skiing later I haven't had the wear and tear on my body a lot of other skiers have had. There are skiers in their 20s who have skied more times than me.""I've always had a good fitness programme and as I get older, I know the importance of doing my recovery and stretching.""Ryding, an avid supporter of Liverpool FC, is committed to this Olympic cycle and will make a decision on his future once that has finished.He is already preparing for a life off the slopes by opening a cafe in Tarleton, near Preston, with his fiancee, Dutch former skier Mandy Dirkzwager.""I wanted a taste of what the real world was like and also wanted to do something outside of skiing to keep my mind fresh,"" he says.This summer he took an extended break from the snow and his first session back on skis was one run by his father Carl at an indoor snowcentre in Manchester.""I hadn't been on skis for 10 weeks over the summer which is the longest break I've had,"" he said.""As soon as I was back skiing, I loved it and realised how much I love the sport.""Ryding was mixing it with children who are aiming to emulate his achievements in the future, so were any starstruck?""I was just getting stuck into the training so didn't really notice but I hope some were,"" Ryding said.""I would have been at their age if an Olympian came to my training session!"""

He lives and breathes football,"" Adams tells BBC Sport Wales.""You have to make a lot of sacrifices and he has done that - football is his entire life.""He will spend his whole life analysing and observing football. He is that type of individual. I am sure that will work well with Mourinho.""Adams taught Sacramento during his days at the University of Glamorgan - now the University of South Wales - where he did a degree in football coaching and performance and then a Masters.""He wanted to study football but there was no specific qualification in Portugal at degree level,"" Adams explains.""He had ambitions to be a coach but his parents didn't want him to come. He is a very bright, intelligent lad. I got talking to him on an open day and his parents eventually allowed him to come.""Sacramento began doing some coaching in Cardiff City's academy while still an undergraduate.Next, through the university's links to the Football Association of Wales, he did analysis work for then Wales manager Gary Speed before landing a role as head of opposition analysis at Monaco.Sacramento moved to Lille in 2017 and was assistant coach there until Mourinho came calling.""I think the link with Mourinho is that he uses a methodology called tactical periodisation,"" says Adams.""It is basically about integrating physical training with technical and tactical work. Rui Faria worked with him on that.""Joao knows that methodology - he did a lot of research into that area when he was in Wales - and I think that's why he has been appointed at Tottenham.""Former principal lecturer Adams has had spells coaching at Swansea City and Middlesbrough and was named FAW Trust technical director - the post previously held by Osian Roberts - in October.He remains in regular contact with Sacramento, who spent time in Swansea during Adams' stint at the Liberty Stadium.""It's great to see Joao moving to Tottenham because it's very difficult having not played at the highest level to get a job at the highest level,"" Adams says.""It's a nice story - to see that if you study and have that level of ambition, you can get to the top."""
sport	Bolton Wanderers: English Football League to appeal against 'lenient' punishment	What did Bolton do?	"The English Football League will appeal against the ""lenient"" suspended points deduction given to Bolton Wanderers over unfulfilled fixtures.Bolton had a five-point deduction suspended for 18 months after failing to fulfil fixtures against Brentford last season and Doncaster this term.The EFL said it is ""disappointed by the conclusions reached by the independent disciplinary commission"".Bolton were fined a total of £70,000, with half also suspended for 18 months.""Given the potential for postponements to have a significant impact on competition integrity and, following receipt of advice overnight on the reasons provided, the League will appeal the outcome in the strongest possible sense,"" added an EFL statement.The commission, appointed by the EFL to rule on disciplinary matters independently from the organisation, met last Thursday to discuss the case.""We are naturally very disappointed by this outcome as we had hoped a line had been drawn and we'd be able to move on,"" said Bolton chairman Sharon Brittan in a statement.""We will vehemently defend any appeal.""In their own statement, Doncaster said they were ""obviously disappointed"" with the sanctions handed to Bolton and that it would be ""prudent"" to await the outcome of the appeal ""before taking further action"".Bolton, who were relegated from the Championship last season amid financial problems, started this season in League One with a 12-point deduction and only moved into positive points on Saturday.Their players went on strike over unpaid wages as last season came to an end and refused to play their game against Brentford on 27 April.The fixture was rearranged for 7 May, after the conclusion of the final round of league games, but was cancelled when cash-strapped Bolton were given a prohibition notice on their ground after the club could not guarantee there would be enough safety personnel at the game.The Trotters called off their fifth game of this season against Doncaster on 20 August at just 28 hours' notice, citing welfare concerns for their players.Bolton had been fielding a side largely made up of youth players at that time - they had just three senior outfield players in their previous game - and the fixture would have been the third for the club in the space of seven days.Wanderers were taken over by Football Ventures (Whites) Limited on 28 August but are still bottom of League One on one point, 12 away from safety and four off 23rd-placed Southend United.Bolton manager Keith Hill told the BBC that no further points deduction meant his side had a chance to stay up in League One - a division which now has three relegation places rather than four after neighbours Bury were expelled after their own financial issues.""I'm really pleased for the new owners,"" said Hill, who was appointed three days after Football Ventures (Whites) Limited completed its takeover on 28 August.""For us to not receive further punishment is testament to their belief. We can certainly stay in the league and we're going to give it our best shot.""It gives us a clear pathway now knowing what we need to do. The impossible dream is now a reality."""

sport	Fantasy football tips: Transfer and team guide for gameweek 13	Let the dust settleMane wins points against PalaceIt's… Jamie VardyA forgotten gem?Other things to consider	Just when you thought the international break would pass without incident, along come Tottenham to chuck a great big cat among the Premier League pigeons.Mauricio Pochettino is out and Jose Mourinho is in, but what impact will that have on fantasy football?Will Lucas Moura come in from the cold? Can Jose put a spring back in Christian Eriksen's step? And which defensive combination will the 'Special One' pick?We're here to help you through all the tough calls ahead of gameweek 13.Mourinho's Manchester United were far from spectacular, but they did provide the odd clean sheet - a quality that has been sorely lacking at Tottenham this season.More pragmatic than his predecessor, the Portuguese is likely to make Spurs tougher to beat, making the likes of Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Danny Rose more attractive than they have previously been.Our advice is to hang fire until you see what kind of selections Jose makes in his first few games before taking the plunge.Further forward, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min remain assets regardless but keep an eye on Eriksen and Dele Alli for signs of life as well as Erik Lamela and Moura, should they suddenly find favour under the new boss.Yes, we know, suggesting you pick the second-highest scoring player in the game hardly constitutes an expert tip. But on the off chance that you don't yet have Sadio Mane in your side, allow us to gently suggest that this is the week to make it so.On Saturday, Liverpool face Crystal Palace - an opponent for whom Mane has a real affection (or vendetta, depending on your viewpoint). He has scored in each of his last four Premier League games against Roy Hodgson's side.His broader record of seven goals in nine Premier League games against Palace is his best goalscoring record against any English top-flight opponent.Plus, he's the second highest scoring player in the game. Did we mention that already?Leicester's Jamie Vardy has scored in his last four Premier League games, netting six goals in total. He last scored in more consecutive Premier League games during his record run of 11 in August-November 2015.He couldn't, could he?One thing is for sure, you don't want to have ignored him or shipped him out if he does. But then, why on earth would you do that? Or indeed get rid of any Leicester players at the moment?An away game at Brighton this weekend is followed by fixtures against Everton (h), Watford (h), Aston Villa (a) and Norwich (h).So Ben Chilwell, Ricardo Pereira and James Maddison are worth a look. If you want a more left-field choice, how about Harvey Barnes? He's starting regularly and looking a threat every time.Fantasy football is a lot like high fashion - everyone is after the latest season's hot item. In 2019, everyone is crawling over themselves to get hold of a Sheffield United midfielder mistakenly listed as a defender.However, the canny shopper can still find value in previous years' most desirable garments. Currently stuffed halfway along the coat rail of Wolverhampton's TK Maxx is one Matt Doherty - a sleek little number that ripped up the catwalks in 2018.Injury meant the wing-back struggled to recapture his top-flight debut season form at the start of this campaign, but he is starting to threaten serious points again.He has started Wolves' last three games - his longest run in the side in 2019-20 - and while he hasn't scored or assisted in that time he has had seven shots and created three chances.His 20 touches in the opposition box is the highest of any defender in the league since 1 October and his expected goals of 0.98 is the fourth highest.He is also part of a Wolves side that has not conceded more than once since mid-September and this Saturday faces a Bournemouth side that have scored just twice in their last five.Callum Wilson is on a five-game drought and Joshua King is injured.

We will continue to take strong action against anyone who we identify has engaged in racist or discriminatory abuse, either online or at our matches.""In response to the findings, anti-discrimination group Kick it Out said the rise in discrimination was a ""challenge for all clubs, at all levels, across the country"".""Reporting mechanisms, such as club procedures and our Kick It Out app, as well as the communications around these, are gradually improving. So, an increase in reporting figures is to be expected,"" said the body in a statement.""We continue to urge anyone who is a victim or witness of abuse to report it. We encourage clubs to continue building on the good work they have already done in creating effective reporting mechanisms.""Currently, discrimination, diversity and inclusion data is fragmented across clubs, governing bodies, charities and law enforcement. Working together as a football community, we need to create more robust and comprehensive data to gain a more accurate picture of the problems and create more targeted solutions."""

""If I'm honest, it shouldn't be a moment - it should be something that hopefully becomes the norm.""It's absolutely momentous for those women. We want to see women playing in these big stadiums and we want to see these big crowds coming.""Hopefully it won't just be an occasion - it will be the norm for women's football.""The attendance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium far surpassed the 31,213 that watched the Manchester derby on the season's opening weekend - and was more than seven times higher than the record of 5,265 which stood prior to this term.The north London derby, which Arsenal won 2-0 thanks to goals in the final 25 minutes from Kim Little and Vivianne Miedema, was the marquee game of the Football Association's inaugural women's football weekend.""It was an amazing occasion, a special occasion,"" said Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro. ""Credit to those planning it for playing on a day when there are not any Premier League games.""With good planning and good organisation, there are the opportunities for us to get even bigger crowds.""It was great to be part of something and you can really start to the see the ascendancy of where the game is going.""To have the passion, to have the rivalry, to have that tribalism, it was fantastic.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceLiverpool manager Vicky Jepson described the match at Anfield as a ""big celebration"" - despite her side losing 1-0 after Lucy Graham's strike on the stroke of half-time.""It was fantastic,"" said Jepson.

""I felt like there were 50,000 people there.""It's a good weekend for women's football.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceAs well as two attendance records being broken, the WSL had two different leaders on Sunday afternoon as Manchester City replaced Chelsea at the summit for the briefest of spells.City's stay at the top looked like it might be more permanent an hour into Chelsea's game at home to Manchester United, with the newly-promoted visitors holding the Blues to a stalemate.However, Maren Mjelde's contentious penalty, after Millie Turner was judged to have fouled Fran Kirby, put Chelsea back on top although they needed Ann-Katrin Berger's fine late save from Ella Toone to preserve victory.City had earlier thrashed West Ham United 5-0 in the lunchtime kick-off, Tessa Wullaert's second-half strike adding to first-half efforts from Ellen White, Lauren Hemp and a double from Georgia Stanway, who was sent off late on.Chelsea remain a point above both City and Arsenal.Brighton beat Birmingham 3-0 to record their first WSL victory of the season, leaving Bristol City - who came from 2-0 and 3-1 down to draw 3-3 at Reading - and bottom side Liverpool as the only two sides without a league win.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before.

But he's an old man who I do not believe is able to really improve us and to move us forward.""

I thought we played some decent football in the first half, but I could see their goal coming.""It was a good goal by them, but I wasn't happy with the way we let them through us, so that was a bit disappointing.""But it was great that the lads got their first goals for the country, the debutants all did well in the game, so I'm really pleased."""

The club like what they have seen and heard about me, and to be honest it was a role I couldn't turn down,"" Feeney continued.""I'm not scared of the challenge at all. I've a chance to manage a team that is very well respected in Bulgaria, has a good youth system and where Dimitar Berbatov played as a youngster.""The language is obviously something I'll have to think about, but most of the playing squad speak English so I don't see that being too much of a problem.""I can't wait to get out there and get started.

You just can't say anything to players as it is all taken personally. They can't accept criticism.""It starts in the academies, where players are spoilt. When I was at Newport I took players on loan from Chelsea on £6,000 a week and everything was done for them.""There is no cleaning boots or cleaning dressing rooms - it's all about what wash bag they have or what Mercedes they have.""Feeney, 38, finished his playing career in 2015 after spells at a host of clubs, including Bournemouth, Cardiff City, Swansea City and Luton Town.He scored five goals in 46 international appearances and insisted that any rows in the Northern Ireland camp during his playing days would not have been allowed to escalate to a player getting dropped for a match.""The players would have got together and gone to sort it out ourselves,"" said Feeney when asked what the Northern Ireland players would have done if they heard of a club rivalry spilling over.""We had our fights, though, but that's football and there was always a mutual respect there.""My playing style was all 'huff, puff, go' and that was how I trained. If I caught someone then I expect them to come through me next time. That was football.""Returning to the modern-day academies at English and Scottish clubs, Feeney said the differences in methods from when he was an aspiring young player to today is huge.""I was brought up at Leeds, where our youth coaches were Eddie Gray and Paul Hart. Our room had to be cleaned for a 9am inspection every morning,"" he explained.""We had to clean boots and the professionals' kits. If they had have told us to run to Glasgow we would have done it without asking a question.""I think the academy system in England is gone. It is all too nice for the players now. We were buzzing to get beans and toast after training, but now players just have their shower, get into their £30,000 car and go home."""

Its aim was to increase the number of Asians at grassroots level in both a playing and coaching capacity in the hope and belief that they filter up the pyramid on a more regular basis.In the highest echelons of the game, that has not yet happened.By the end of the 2018-19 season, only four British footballers of South Asian descent (that includes Pakistani, Indian or Bangladeshi) have played in the Premier League - Neil Taylor, Michael Chopra, Hamza Choudhury and Zesh Rehman.Danny Batth looked like he would join them, but left Wolverhampton Wanderers for Stoke City in January without playing a top-flight game.According to the Professional Footballers' Association, there are just 12 players of South Asian heritage across the Premier League and the English Football League.Taff Rahman is a Bangladesh-born football coach, who holds a Uefa A Licence, is an FA tutor, and has coached at Tottenham Hotspur's academy and with England's youth teams. He also recently helped Guyana to qualify for the Gold Cup for the first time in his role as assistant coach.""There aren't many British South Asian (BSA) coaches in the professional game, especially those with long-term industry knowledge, so BSA youngsters have not really had any prominent figures to look up to,"" he says.""There is nobody at the moment who can be that beacon of light.""There are a few BSA youngsters in the academy system and we need them to come through into those clubs' first teams, and make a name for themselves in the Premier League and in the EFL.""But the Premier League has become so big and is home to most of the top players, so it is difficult enough to make it in the first place.""That assessment is borne out by the stats.There were eight BSA players with professional contracts in English football when BBC Sport first investigated the issue in October 2013.Today, according to the Professional Footballers' Association, there are 12, as well as five scholars who have come through clubs' academies as of last season.""If you haven't got South Asian kids in the system, then you are reducing their chances of playing at the top level,"" Rahman says.""It is about increasing participation across the whole system and looking for this pathway to flourish.""Around 7% of the British population is of South Asian descent - about 3.5 million people.Should the FA be doing more to encourage the younger elements of that group to try to forge a career in professional football?An FA spokesman told BBC Sport that it is planning to appoint an ""Asian champion"" to the governing body's board and has produced a film which features BSA role models in referee Lisa Rashid, England Women's deaf futsal player Lucindha Lawson, Charlton Women's manager Riteesh Mishra and Swansea City forward Yan Dhanda.Before the 2019-20 season, the FA appointed a ""board champion"" in a bid to raise awareness of Asian inclusion at the top of the organisation.It is also creating and facilitating a strategic Asian inclusion guidance group and, together with the PFA, mentors Asian players currently in the system, while also creating a protocol where all new FA and county FA roles are advertised directly to Asian communities.The FA spokesman said: ""Late last year, we delivered eight community forums across the country's eight most diverse counties, engaging with more than 500 people from Asian communities.""The feedback from those communities and wider partners has informed much of our work going forward.""Over the next few seasons, the FA is also working towards more Asian inclusion in English football.There are plans to support Asian fan groups with key partners such as the Football Supporters' Federation. This is likely to include Asian fan events with the FSF and the England Supporters' Travel Club.""Stakeholders have been doing the work, but a lot more could be done to support the South Asian community when it comes to trying to involve them in professional football,"" Rahman explains.""People talk about how the Afro-Caribbean community, for example, is more assimilated into British life, but the South Asian community is becoming integrated like never before.""Could Islamophobia be a factor in the lack of South Asian professionals at British football's highest level? Rahman is cautious in his response.""There is discrimination against Muslim people, but that is just the way the world is,"" he says.""You look at foreign Muslim players in the Premier League like Mohamed Salah, N'Golo Kante and Sadio Mane, and they have highlighted the way of life from a Muslim perspective.""They are great models and younger people of all backgrounds see that."""
sport	Sanjay Bhandari: Discrimination in football may 'get worse before it gets better'	Discrimination has undergone 'upward spike''Social media companies are engaged'	"Discrimination in football may ""get worse before it gets better"", according to Sanjay Bhandari, the new chairman of anti-racism charity Kick It Out.There have been several high-profile racism incidents this season, with players being abused both on social media and in stadiums.Bhandari, who is a former lawyer, says the problem is reflective of society.He told BBC sport that he expects the situation to deteriorate because of a potential recession.But he outlined how he would be conducting a strategic review and ""a three-month listening tour"" to discover how Kick It Out best tackles discrimination after replacing founder and former chair Lord Herman Ouseley, who was in the role for 26 years.The 51-year-old revealed he was racially abused on social media within minutes of news of his appointment being made public last month.But after claims by former trustee Garth Crooks that a former player should have been appointed, Bhandari said he was ""the right fit"" for the role after being ""inside football for 45 years"".The Manchester United fan, who has worked as an equality expert with the Premier League for four years, wants more money to help the charity's cause.In his opening speech, he said that trying to serve the whole football industry with an annual budget of about £800,000 and 18 staff was ""not sustainable"".This season several Premier League players have suffered racist abuse on social media and last month there was criticism of Uefa's punishment of Bulgaria, who were fined £65,000 and ordered to play one game behind closed doors after fans aimed monkey chants at England players during a Euro 2020 qualifier.An FA Cup tie between Haringey Borough and Yeovil Town was abandoned after players suffered racist abuse. And in Europe there have been several incidents, including Brazilian player Taison being reduced to tears after being sent off for reacting to racist chants while playing for Shakhtar Donetsk.""Over a 30- or 40-year period it's declined, but undoubtedly in the last couple of years we've seen an upward spike in reporting of racism and other forms of discrimination,"" Bhandari told BBC Sport.""In the future, I anticipate there is more demand for that to increase in the sense that economic conditions, maybe with a recession on the horizon, also tends to lead to increase in discrimination so it may get worse before it gets better.""The big difference with football is that it can be a mirror but it can also be a propeller. Football can be used as a cohesive force to change social attitudes.""Bhandari also outlined how social media was an ""amplifier"" of abuse.Several Premier League managers, including Manchester United's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Chelsea's Frank Lampard, have called on social media companies to do more to tackle abuse.Bhandari said conversations with Facebook and Twitter were ongoing and said: ""They want to do something about it. They are engaged.""But he said Uefa could have improved its handling of England players being abused against Bulgaria, when the three-step process was not followed despite England's 6-0 win being stopped twice.""The protocol has been place for 10 years, we just want to see it executed more consistently,"" Bhandari added. ""Maybe there was a missed opportunity in the Bulgaria game to go through the whole of that process.""I can understand why players might want to walk off, we would support that if that's what they wanted to do.""As for the punishment handed to Bulgaria - labelled ""embarrassing"" by Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster - Bhandari questioned whether the fines could be used for educational purposes: ""I think that's a more interesting use of the money.""He also announced three new members of the Kick It Out board, describing it as ""diverse, passionate and enthusiastic"". Chris Paouros, co-chair of Tottenham's LGBT supporters group; Cindy Butts, who holds several legal positions on boards; and Kevin Miles, the chief executive of the Football Supporters Association, have joined an eight-person team.And Bhandari also claimed Uefa's disciplinary panel, which issued the punishment to Bulgaria, would benefit from greater diversity.""More diversity in leadership positions or boards will always help make better decisions."""
sport	Charlie Webster column: 'If it hadn't been for football, we wouldn't have spoken about abuse'		"Charlie Webster is a broadcaster and writer, a campaigner on social issues, and is a keen Ironman and triathlon competitor. You can hear her chatting about the EFL with Adrian Chiles on BBC Radio 5 Live on Chiles on Friday from 10:00 BST.""If it wasn't for football, I wouldn't be here. Terraces were my safe space. Nobody could hurt me there. It was 90 minutes of respite before I had to go back and face what was waiting for me at home.""That's a male friend of mine speaking. We were both abused as children, and recently discussed how football could open up a conversation about the issue.My friend says he was always ""macho"" about the abuse he was subjected to by his late father, hiding his past because masculine stereotypes meant he was scared of being seen as weak.""If I said to my football friends I was the Pope, they would believe me more than if I told them I was abused,"" he said. ""They'd think something was wrong with me.""If it hadn't had been for football, we would never have had this conversation.We were originally talking about what was going on behind the scenes at our clubs and found ourselves going from overlapping centre-backs to what we had been through as children.A few years ago, he had seen me on the pitch at QPR - a club keen to engage with anti-domestic abuse causes. I ran to 40 clubs, covering 250 miles in seven days, to engage the football world in talking about domestic abuse, and raise money for the charity Women's Aid. Because of that, he knew I was a 'safe' person to talk to about what had happened to him.When I first came up with the idea of running to football grounds, I remember quite a few people saying to me that I would never get the clubs talking about domestic abuse. It's such a weird statement. Why not? If anything, isn't that an insult to football? What does that say about what they think a football club represents and who they represent?They were wrong.Every football club I approached backed the campaign. Manchester United legend Gary Neville ran out of Old Trafford with me, Liverpool greats John Barnes and Jamie Carragher came on the pitch at Anfield with me at half-time, and all the West Ham team donated at their game. Even Pelé - a three-time World Cup winner - sent a message of support.Can football provide that forum for us to have these conversations?People don't like talking about domestic abuse, but that's only because it's not talked about - it is seen as something for victims to be ashamed of. By keeping it voiceless, we help that happen.It's something that is so rife in our communities, yet at the same time very well hidden. If we silence it, it makes it much harder for victims to speak out and easier for perpetrators to get away with it again and again and again.We have heard horrific accounts from former footballers Chris Unsworth, Steve Walters and Andy Woodward - and many others - about being sexually abused by people in the game.There's also research that suggests domestic abuse cases increase during big football tournaments.But football can be a safe environment in which people can talk about what's going on in their lives. It is a meeting place, an escape; people are unified by a shirt. And, because of that, football can reach out.It can also change the perception of domestic abuse. It isn't something that just happens to girls and women - it happens to boys and men too.And when women can still be blamed when they are victims of domestic abuse, imagine how hard we make it for men to speak up and get help.I have met many people - boys, girls, men and women - who have suffered terrible abuse.A middle-aged Liverpool fan, who had to seek refuge from his abusive girlfriend, summed up the response when he tried to get help.""They looked at me like I was a joke and said I needed to 'man up',"" he said. ""I wanted to kill myself. I thought men didn't suffer domestic abuse, but she was destroying me.""Another man I know in football was turning up for work with black eyes. People jokily said: ""Is your wife hitting you? You best sort that out.""He laughed it off, scared of what would happen if they found out it was true - his wife was hitting him, and much worse.Masculine stereotypes don't do men or women any favours.We are starting to slowly open up conversations in football around mental health, but we also need to see that development around domestic abuse.For every three victims of domestic abuse, two will be female and one will be male. One in four women and one in six men suffer from domestic abuse in their lifetime.My QPR-supporting friend says if somebody in football - his safe place - had spoken out about domestic abuse, it would have saved him 20 years of misery and isolation in his own head. He wouldn't have had to wear his mask for so long.I do wonder if I'll get stick for writing about domestic abuse in the context of football.But our football clubs are at the heart of our communities, so isn't this one of the best places to start a conversation, to stand with every fan to eradicate it?Domestic abuse doesn't discriminate. Football has a voice and gives us all the ability to share it. Sooner or later we have to stop kicking the can down the road.If you or someone you know has been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available at bbc.co.uk/actionline"
sport	Brian Mawhinney: Tributes as former Football League chairman dies aged 79		"Tributes have been paid to former Football League chairman Brian Mawhinney who has died aged 79.The Belfast-born Conservative peer led the league, now known as the EFL, for seven years from 2003.Lord Mawhinney was awarded life membership of the organisation in 2012.""Everyone associated with the EFL is saddened to hear of the loss of Lord Mawhinney, a hugely respected and influential figure in our recent past,"" said EFL chair Rick Parry.He said Mawhinney had ""a significant impact on the wider game"".In a statement, his family said the ""much-loved husband, father and grandfather and a friend to many"" died on Saturday after a long illness.""His death brings an end to a life dedicated to public service and rooted in an unwavering Christian faith,"" the statement said.The former chairman of the Conservative Party joined the House of Lords in 2005 after standing down as MP for North West Cambridgeshire.He had a Commons career that lasted more than 25 years, and served as transport secretary under prime minister John Major.In football, he oversaw a league rebranding, the introduction of a fit and proper persons test for club owners and sanctions for clubs entering administration.""Lord Mawhinney was awarded a life membership in 2012 for the significant contribution he made to the league during his seven years at the helm, during which, he made a number of important introductions as part of a substantive programme of governance reforms,"" said Parry.""He was also the driving force behind the league's first solidarity arrangement with the Premier League, the formation of the Football League Trust and a significant rebranding to support subsequent commercial development.""Club owners, their respective teams and staff at the EFL remember Lord Mawhinney's time at the league fondly and our collective thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad and difficult time.""Mawhinney was also patron of Peterborough and the League One side paid their own tribute.""Brian was a tremendous ambassador for this football club and his love and knowledge of the game was always a great help to Peterborough United, a football club he loved,"" said chief executive Bob Symns.Under Mawhinney's Football League leadership, in 2004 Divisions One, Two and Three became the Championship, League One and League Two.A fit and proper persons test for prospective club directors followed - and was also later adopted by the Premier League.Then in 2004-05 new rules were brought in which introduced points penalties and other sanctions for clubs entering administration - a move which proved controversial for fans of some clubs, and made Mawhinney a divisive figure for many of them.Clubs were also forced to publish their spending on agents' fees and ""dual representation"" - where agents represent both a player and a club during a transfer - was banned.Mawhinney, a devoted Christian and former General Synod member, also oversaw the introduction of rules forcing clubs to disclose the identities of their owners following troubling periods for clubs including Leeds United and Notts County.He stepped down from the role in 2010, when Greg Clarke - who now heads the Football Association - took over the position.In his farewell letter Mawhinney called for clubs falling into administration to be relegated and also warned that clubs needed to better control players' wages and agents' fees.In 2012 the League rewarded Mawhinney for his ""exceptional contribution during a decade of service to the world's original league football competition"" with a life membership of the organisation."

The affected persons are currently being treated and are responding to treatment,"" the club said in a statement.""We wish to use this medium to appeal to the Federal Government as well as football regulatory bodies Nigerian Football Federation(NFF) and the League Management Company (LMC) to further intensify security efforts to ensure the safety of teams who often have no choice than to travel long distances by road, especially clubs owned by Private investors who are made to invest their hard earned money in the growth and development of Nigerian football,"" the statement added.The privately run FC Ifeanyi Ubah became an official partner of English side West Ham in 2016.Nicknamed 'The Anambra Warriors', they are currently in mid-table in the country's top flight.As the country's economic problems have worsened, clubs have been forced to cut their travel expenses, making hazardous road journeys unavoidable for most clubs.Back in March 2015, five Kano Pillars players were shot by gunmen in an attack on the club's entourage as they travelled to Owerri for the start of the Nigerian Premier League season.Ten months later, the bus of two-time African champions Enyimba was attacked by armed robbers as they travelled to a pre-season tournament.Clubs in the Nigerian top tier, including Ikorodu and Akwa United have also been involved in road accidents en route to away matches."

sport	SPIP corruption case against Nigeria Football Federation dropped		"The Special Presidential Investigation Panel (SPIP) has dropped its corruption case against five officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), including president Amaju Pinnick.The case, which was made up of 16 charges, was dismissed at the Abuja High Court on Tuesday following the dissolution of the SPIP in September.Charges ranged from failure to declare their assets, the alleged disappearance of US$8.4 million paid by Fifa to Nigeria for participation in the 2014 World Cup and through to fictitious international friendly matches.Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the end of the SPIP following allegations of corruption against its own chairman Okoi Obono-Obla.Pinnick's case was taken over in May by the country's Attorney General (AGF) after alleging 'victimisation' in the SPIP case.The SPIP's investigation centred on Pinnick along with NFF vice presidents Seyi Akinwunmi and Shehu Dikko as well as general secretary Mohammed Sanusi and executive committee member Ahmed Yusuf.""The clean bill is a confirmation of the position of the NFF on all swirling allegations of corruption against its officials,"" the NFF published in a statement.""Nigeria's supreme football -governing body has always insisted that its leaders were being victimized by persons who lost elections through the ballot and were seeking other means to upturn things at Glass House (NFF headquarters), or disgruntled individuals simply on a mission of vendetta.""Despite Tuesday's development two other bodies are continuing its investigations into the NFF.The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) still has two corruption cases against the federation while the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission's (ICPC) seized properties in September as part of yet another probe.The ICPC is yet to bring a formal case against the federation or any of its member but BBC Sport understands that the investigations are looking at allegations of how sponsorship money generated from the second tier of the country's game was spent.All five top officials have always denied any wrongdoing."
sport	Fantasy football tips: Transfer and team guide for gameweek 12	Ederson or Alisson? Sterling or Salah? Firmino or Aguero?Best of the rest...Other things to considerThe Statman cleans up	"The highlight of this gameweek's Premier League fixtures is undoubtedly the match-up between the top two as unbeaten leaders Liverpool welcome reigning champions Manchester City to Anfield.For fantasy football managers, though, this fixture presents a conundrum.With most fantasy sides likely packed to the limit with players from both sides, who do you pick? Is either side going to manage a clean sheet? And which players are likely to get the goals?BBC Sport digs into this fixture (and some of the rest) to try and find some solutions and also tip our cap to Statman Dave of the Fantasy 606 podcast for his bumper gameweek 11 points haul.It is the weekend's big fixture - Liverpool v Manchester City, first v second, last season's runners-up v last season's champions. But who do you back to bring home fantasy points?You'll probably remember that this much-hyped fixture produced a pretty cagey 0-0 draw last season, but the odds are stacked against that this time round. Liverpool have conceded in each of their last five at Anfield, City have only failed to score in six of their 62 Premier League away games under Pep Guardiola and, with Aymeric Laporte injured, the Blues' defence is far from settled.""I think there's going to be goals,"" says Statman Dave. ""Stack your attack and midfield. Keep Sterling, Salah, Mane and De Bruyne in there. A Nicolas Otamendi or Virgil van Dijk is a bit risky.""If you're going to have defenders from either side, probably best to cover yourself with either Andy Robertson or Trent Alexander-Arnold, both of whom impact at the other end of the field.If you're weighing up who to pick up front, maybe this will help: Man City striker Sergio Aguero has made seven Premier League appearances at Anfield without scoring, while Liverpool's Roberto Firmino has had a hand in seven goals in his eight Premier League games against Man City.If you haven't already, you might want to gravitate towards Sadio Mane, who has been the standout fantasy player from either side of late. He scored and assisted at Aston Villa last weekend, he takes shots (11 in the past four games), creates chances (nine in the past four) and has the extra motivation of Guardiola suggesting (before backtracking) he might dive now and again.One final heads-up - David Silva is a doubt with a muscle injury.Last weekend, Jamie Vardy became the first player to score 10 Premier League goals this season. He has scored eight goals in his eight Premier League starts against Arsenal, who he faces this gameweek. It's a no-brainer to have him in your team this week.Sheffield United have been the surprise defensive package so far this season (John Lundstram, we love you), but you may want to check out Watford and Bournemouth as well.In their last four games each, the Cherries have three clean sheets, and the Hornets two. With the former at Newcastle and the latter at Norwich, you may want to consider goalkeepers Aaron Ramsdale and Ben Foster and defenders like Nathan Ake, Daryl Janmaat and Adam Smith (the last two are dirt cheap).He has had his doubters, but last week Statman Dave of the Fantasy 606 podcast gave them something to chew on with a whopping 97 points, thanks to a host of clean sheets in a back five and captaining Mane.Speaking of clean sheets, Dave is backing Norwich, Chelsea and maybe Leicester this week."

sport	Serie A: Italian Football Federation requests five substitutions for league		Serie A could introduce five substitutions a match, after a request was sent by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) to football's lawmakers.The move is backed by Italy's top-flight clubs who want more choice, with teams already allowed to name 12 substitutes on the bench.The five changes would be made over three stoppages, to reduce the number of breaks in play.Serie C already allow five substitutes.FIGC president Gabriele Gravina has sent the request to the International Football Association Board (Ifab).Champions League and Europa League games permit a fourth substitute in extra-time and it will also be allowed at the 2020 European Championship.The Football Association announced in 2018 that it would permit an extra substitute in the latter stages of the FA Cup, from the quarter-finals onwards, while the Football League has permitted a fourth substitute in extra-time in all EFL Cup ties since 2017.

sport	England's Women's World Cup run inspires growth in football participation	Analysis - England still playing catch up	"England's run to the semi-finals at the 2019 Women's World Cup inspired a growth in participation across all levels, according to Football Association figures.The FA says 2.63m women aged 16 and over in England now play football.Since the tournament in France, where the Lionesses finished fourth, 850,000 more women have committed to the sport.""The growth we've experienced is proof of the 'see it, play it' mantra,"" the FA's Louise Gear said.""In the Lionesses we're fortunate to have a wonderful group of role models performing at the highest level of the game, who inspire females of all ages to have the confidence to get out and give football a try; be it for fitness, competition or fun.""The FA's head of women's development added that the learning from the summer will ""shape our future strategy and with Tokyo in 2020 and a home Women's Euro 2021"".Find out how to get into football with our special guide.From September, of the 2.63m adults playing in England, 23% play 11-a-side or small-sided football competitively. The remaining 2.03m take part casually, playing small-sided games but not in a league.Last season, the FA had 1,831 affiliated women's teams and 4,073 affiliated girls' teams. Those figures contributed to a global Fifa study, released in the summer, which found that there were 120,557 female players playing organised football in England.A record total of 28.1m people watched the Women's World Cup, which was won by the United States when they beat the Netherlands 2-0 in the final in Lyon.The Lionesses are also set to play in front of a record-breaking Wembley crowd when they face Germany on 9 November.BBC Sport's Tom GarryAfter attracting huge television audiences in the summer, the FA will naturally be pleased that the Lionesses appear to be inspiring more people to get out and play the game.However, the challenge now is to try and encourage more of those 2.63m to take part in a small-sided or 11-a-side league.Currently, more than 2m of them do not.Fifa's participation study found that the United States, Canada, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and France all had more registered female players than England, which will be a concern for some.But England has also seen growth in the number of female referees and coaches, and can now boast the highest number of female coaches in Europe."
sport	Racism in football: Watford's Troy Deeney says 'one-strike' policy needed		"Racist abuse must be tackled with a ""one-strike"" policy rather than Uefa's three-step protocol, says Watford captain Troy Deeney.The European governing body's rules state that a game can only be abandoned if fans have been warned twice before.""We're teaching kids now that you're getting three strikes and you're out,"" said striker Deeney, 31.Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Deeney said he had been racially abused at stadiums and on ""every post"" on social media.""There will be at least six to 10 comments I have to take down,"" the Englishman added.""It's more on pictures of your kids, pictures of your partner. People are putting 'you black such and such', 'you monkey emoji', this, that and the other, or bananas and stuff like that.""It's very difficult to ignore it.""Deeney said after Watford's FA Cup semi-final win over Wolves in April he had to turn off comments on his social media accounts because the ""barrage of abuse"" was ""non-stop"".""It's at that point when you go: 'What am I going to do? Am I going to stand and argue or am I going to make a stand?'"" he added.""I'm very aware there are a lot of kids who watch what we do, and if we don't change that they're going to expect it to be normal.""The recent incidents of racism in football include England players being abused by fans during a Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia on 15 October.The match was stopped twice by the referee under Uefa's existing protocol but England chose to play on.""Is that a good way of tackling the problem?"" Deeney said of Uefa's system. ""Are we going to say now that it's OK to do it three times?""Bulgaria were fined £65,000 and ordered to play two matches behind closed doors - one suspended for two years - for the abuse.Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out said it was ""disheartened but not surprised"" and Deeney thinks tougher punishments are needed because fines of that size will not lead to nations ""acting properly in terms of handling it"".Deeney is part of Watford's ""We"" campaign, which is attempting to tackle racism in football and gives supporters a way to help identify abusers on social media."

""There were a lot of people who weren't happy with his appointment.""I always said from day one, the one thing he had over Brendan Rodgers' unbelievable run as Celtic manager was that Neil Lennon has proven with a Celtic squad of similar style that he got big results in Europe.""The victory in Rome came on the seventh anniversary of Celtic's 2-1 Champions League win over Barcelona - Commons having come on as a second-half substitute.""Neil Lennon was brought in for one thing - to keep the ship going forward but ultimately to get big results in Europe and he's proven that not only in Rome but I thought he was very unlucky not to get more than a draw in Rennes as well,"" he said.While Celtic top their group and have secured qualification with two games to spare, Rangers sit second in their section behind Young Boys on goal difference.The Ibrox side are undefeated at Ibrox in European competition since Steven Gerrard was appointed manager and have kept 15 clean sheets, scoring 42 goals with only 17 against.""The one thing that Steven Gerrard brings is an entourage of people interested in how he is doing,"" Commons added.

But I'm quite clear with what I think I want to try.""Ljungberg, who spent nine years as a player at Arsenal and was one of the club's record-breaking 'Invincibles', will take charge of the Gunners for the first time at Norwich on Sunday.Arsenal have also announced that former captain Per Mertesacker - now the Gunners' academy manager - will form part of Ljungberg's coaching staff ""in the short-term"".Asked if he wanted to become the club's next permanent manager, he said: ""For the moment it's for the future of the football club.""I'm here to help the club as much as I possibly can and try to get a good atmosphere around the club and with the supporters and that's what I'm focusing on at the moment and then we'll see.""Ljungberg, who won two Premier League titles with Arsenal before joining West Ham in 2007, started his coaching career with the club's under-15s, before being named Wolfsburg assistant manager in 2017.He returned to Arsenal in 2018 as under-23s coach before being promoted to the first-team set-up.""I like entertaining football but of course at the same time you can't concede goals,"" he said. ""That's a tricky balance to find.""For me, happy footballers play the best football. That's a part I learnt as a player, there is a time to work hard but at the same time we need to enjoy what we're doing.""He added it was a ""great, great honour"" to be named Gunners boss.""I am confident, otherwise I wouldn't have taken it when they asked me to help,"" he said.""I really feel that this club can all be brought together and put some smiles on people's faces again.""Ex-Arsenal player Gilberto Silva has been linked with a return to the club to join former team-mate Ljungberg's coaching staff, but said he had not spoken to the Swede.""At the moment, there is nothing,"" Silva told BBC World Service. ""For us ex-Arsenal players, always when [there's] talk about Arsenal it's very emotional, it's very touching. The moment now for me is supporting him from outside.""I'm happy for him. It's not an easy job for at the moment, but he knows the guys.""They [the players] are the only people that can change the situation - I hope that Fred can help them win games and get the confidence back."""
sport	Euro 2020: Social media reaction to final tournament draw	The 'Group of F'England v Croatia all over againWelsh optimism	"There have been enough major football tournament draws in the age of social media for us to know how this plays out.It starts with agonising over the permutations, moves on to wondering which football legend you'll end up thanking for giving your team a favourable draw, and ends with everyone thinking they ""have a chance"".Euro 2020 will be a tournament like no other - 51 matches, across 12 host nations - and it brings with it a pretty abstract format. Not that anyone noticed...OK, maybe they did.But when it did get going, it sure packed a punch.Defending champions? Check. Last two World Cup winners? Check?Little doubt, then, about the toughest group.""This is a group of death,"" said Germany boss Joachim Low. We'll just stick with 'Group of F' if it's OK with you, Joachim?Given four of the tournament's six third-place teams qualify for the knockout stage, all three may yet progress.The fourth team joining them in Group F won't be known until the end of the play-offs in March. A penny for their thoughts...We already knew England would be in Group D, and playing all three group games at Wembley.We should probably have known they would be handed a rematch of their 2018 World Cup semi-final (don't even mention Euro 2008 qualifying) by being paired with Croatia.In the Czech Republic they also face a side they met in Euro 2020 qualifying - and one of Scotland, Israel, Serbia or Norway.So, how's the England captain feeling?Supporters were pretty pleased too...With home advantage and an exciting young side, England will be fancied to top Group D. Their reward if they do? A nice, straightforward knockout match with the runner-up from the 'Group of F'.The nature of Saturday's draw meant Wales knew they would be in either Group A or B.The latter contained two hosts in Russia and Denmark, plus Belgium, Fifa's highest-ranked nation. Instead, Ryan Giggs' side face Italy, Switzerland and Turkey.That good feeling extended to Wales defender Chris Mepham...So, that was the draw. Now we've only got 195 days to wait until the fun really starts with Italy v Turkey in the opening game."

sport	Scottish clubs in Europe: From unholy mess to the Holy Grail	The mess in Malmo & Pedro in a hedgeOminous starts to outstanding displaysHow have they done it?Extra Champions League place?	Three years ago, Scottish football was in freefall in European terms.Champions League participation was just a dream for Celtic at that stage, while those who ventured into Europa League qualification were knocked out quicker than you could say 'coefficient'.Speaking of which, Scotland's was a paltry 25th in the rankings, behind the heavyweights of Israel, Belarus and Cyprus. The landscape was a grim sight.However, something cataclysmic is in danger of taking place. After mesmeric runs and a glut of scalps by both Celtic and Rangers, Scotland are soaring in 15th place and currently heading for an extra Champions League spot in 2021-22.It has gone from an unholy mess to touching distance of the Holy Grail.There were a series of calamities that dragged Scotland to that grim position in 2016, with the finger pointed in various directions.The previous summer was a gloomy affair. Ronny Deila's Celtic were breached four times by Malmo on the way to a 4-3 aggregate Champions League play-off loss, before a fruitless Europa League campaign.Kairat ousted Aberdeen. Romania's Astra Giurgiu did for Inverness Caledonian Thistle. St Johnstone? Embarrassed by Alashkert of Armenia.As the Brendan Rodgers era swept in and Celtic went on to achieve Champions League qualification in consecutive seasons, matters improved, but only slightly.Heavy defeats by Barcelona, Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich were meted out, while Rangers' reintroduction to Europe didn't as much go with a bang but a nuclear explosion.In the picturesque city of Luxembourg, they suffered what some claimed was the worst European defeat by any Scottish club - and that's some tag.Progres Niederkorn knocked Rangers out of Europe and left manager Pedro Caixinha in a hedge remonstrating with furious punters post match.It is said that a week is a long time in politics. In Scottish football, even a fleeting European campaign can seem like a decade.Even this summer, signs of the breaking of a new dawn took a while to emerge. Kilmarnock had waited 18 years to be back in Europe but it took just a week for them to get turfed out by Welsh part-timers Connah's Quay Nomads.Aberdeen, now regulars in European competition, were hammered 4-0 by Croatia's Rijeka, the second leg being played out at a dispirited and half-empty Pittodrie.The carrying of the European can fell to Celtic and Rangers. Neil Lennon's champions stumbled, falling with an almighty thud at the feet of Cluj to tumble from Champions League qualifying.Rangers, meanwhile, were continuing to appear formidable under Steven Gerrard, exorcising the ghost of Niederkorn past to make the Europa League group stages along with their city rivals.What has happened since has been spell-binding stuff from both. Ten games played, six wins, just a single defeat, while both top their respective groups.Big names have been tamed by the Scottish pair, too. Porto, Feyenoord, Lazio and Rennes have all been accounted for. Celtic's qualification for the last 32 was achieved with gusto, Rangers', barring a calamity, is surely in the post with a home tie against Young Boys to come.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSetting up smartly in Europe. Under Rodgers, Celtic were a formidable force in the league. More silver than Long John's family tree was gathered by the Northern Irishman, yet the criticism of not adapting his expansive style enough in Europe was levelled on more than one occasion.Across 12 group stages games in two seasons, 34 goals were haemorrhaged. Only seven scored.Under Lennon's guidance, it has been a different story. The caveat is that we are talking Europa League and not Champions League, but it's clear the Celtic manager's team has a rigidity, discipline and structure suited to the European game. Just four goals conceded in this group stage, and 10 scored.For Rangers, Gerrard's results in Europe continue to be a revelation. The former Liverpool captain, who was a rookie manager at the fledgling stage of Rangers' exploits last season, has amassed an incredible record. In 27 games, he's won 13, and lost three - none of those defeats at Ibrox.They were also through to the last 32 for around 25 minutes on Thursday. In the electric atmosphere of De Kuip in Rotterdam, Rangers somehow turned the game around to have Feyenoord on the ropes, only to be pegged back. Again Gerrard got the best of his group.Now for the complicated bit. As things stand, that extra Champions League place will be Scotland's if they can keep a firm hold on that 15th spot in the coefficient ranking table.You would not bet against them doing so, either. With two teams still in continental competition and at least one guaranteed to be playing after Christmas, there are still plenty of coefficient points to be claimed.To help matters, Cyprus and Greece, the two nations immediately on Scotland's tail, only have one club left each. Looking upwards, the Czech Republic in 14th are not too far out of reach either.Progress has indeed been made. Scottish football knows one swallow does not make a summer, but perhaps, just perhaps, the winter of European football discontent may finally be thawing.
sport	Fantasy football tips: Transfer and team guide for gameweek 11	The next Pulisic?Keep the faith?Other things to consider	"Well hello there, Christian Pulisic.Chelsea's £58m signing rocked up to the Premier League party in style last weekend, bagging a hat-trick to reward those loyal fantasy football players who kept faith over all those weeks of seeing him scrape the odd point.He was joined in the treble club by Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy, who both scored three as Leicester thrashed Southampton 9-0.But who is going to be the star this coming weekend? BBC Sport tries to dig into gameweek 11 to help you out.Fantasy football managers are largely a reactive bunch. A player scores highly one week and managers flock to transfer him in, in the hope that he'll repeat the trick but knowing deep down that they may have missed the boat.Yet such was the quality shown by Pulisic last weekend that you can probably expect more healthy points returns in coming weeks, and Ayoze Perez has every chance of chipping in (although perhaps not quite as spectacularly as at Southampton) throughout the season.But who might be the next man to net you double figures?How about Gabriel Jesus? We all know he's got points in him (an assist and a goal in his past two games is a good start), but you're never 100% sure when he's going to go goal crazy. Well this weekend City host Southampton, who know a thing or two about conceding goals.Or maybe Anthony Martial? He scored once at Norwich, and would have scored two more but for Tim Krul's heroics. This weekend, the forward goes to Bournemouth with Manchester United looking to continue a fine record - he has had a hand in 16 goals in his past 20 league starts.Other options? What about Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who is on an uncharacteristic run of three league games without a goal, having previously scored seven times in seven matches? Surely he is due a goal? Or maybe Neal Maupay, whose Brighton team host Norwich, the side with the second worst defensive record?Owning Liverpool and Manchester United defenders is a frustrating business.They are some of the highest-priced in the game and should deliver clean sheets but so rarely have this season.Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson are unsellable as they also offer attacking points, but you may want to hold fire before shipping out Virgil van Dijk, Harry Maguire or Aaron Wan-Bissaka.The two big rivals remain the best in the division for expected goals against in 2019-20 - United at 9.05 and Liverpool at 9.7. By that metric, the clean sheets should come sooner rather than later.The other sides with the best xG against? Leicester (10.62), Burnley (10.96), Man City (11.61) and Chelsea (11.93).Speaking of Leicester, Statman Dave has named Ben Chilwell as his tip of the week on the Fantasy 606 podcast.""Against Southampton he created five chances and got two assists,"" he says. ""Under Brendan Rodgers he has five assists - only Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson have more in the Premier League as defenders in that time. He will also play every week.""Coming back to xG (and we appreciate it is not everyone's cup of tea), Newcastle's 'expected goals for' total currently stands at a league low 6.67, which is more than four worse off than Sheffield United. Possibly useful information if you're still expectantly clinging on to Joelinton."
sport	NFL: When American football came to London in World War Two	Pub chat sparks an ideaOne game - two sets of rulesUS calls up NFL stars for rematchFighting takes its toll	"American football has been one of the fastest growing sports in Britain over the past decade. Its cult following goes back further to the 1980s.Such has been the growth that since 2007 there have been 27 regular season NFL games held in London, including two this autumn at the multi-purpose Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with another to follow at Wembley on Sunday when the Jacksonville Jaguars face the Houston Texans.But 75 years ago, with D-Day looming, 50,000 people watched an American football game featuring NFL and Canadian Football League (CFL) stars at a London stadium.The venue was White City and twice in 1944 it was the stage for gridiron encounters between forces teams from Canada and the United States.In winter, 1943 a Canadian army major was sitting in an Aldershot pub with a group of fellow officers.Denis Whitaker had seen a lot of action during World War Two since he enlisted three years earlier. Before the war he was a top quarterback for the Hamilton Tigers in the CFL.Maj Whitaker was part of the Dieppe raid in 1942 and had seen many men killed in that costly assault.Troops were feeling the pressure of intensive training in the ""miserable"" cold winter, for what would be the invasion of France.""I started talking to a fellow next to me, who turned out to be a lieutenant in the American Army Recreational Services,"" Whitaker told his stepdaughter, Martie Whitaker, many years later.""He mentioned that he was pretty interested in football and had just brought over six complete sets of equipment for football teams.""I knew a number of Canadians serving in Britain who had played pro or college football, so several beers later I found myself talking this fellow into lending us some uniforms and putting together a USA v Canada match.""Whitaker, who would later be promoted to brigadier general, was a natural leader.""At that time in the war not very much was happening,"" said his daughter, Gail Thompson.""They were waiting, waiting, waiting, so this was a good way for them to take their minds off the war for a brief period.""Whitaker convinced Canadian Lt Gen Ken Stuart that the game would be a morale booster for the units and a date for the match - dubbed the Tea Bowl in a nod to the troops' British hosts - was set for 13 February 1944.The BBC provided the outside broadcast engineering for the American Forces Network's radio coverage of the game.Programmes included a list of rules to help the British spectators understand what they were witnessing on the field.The Tea Bowl was played in front of 30,000 people and spitfires flew overhead, on the lookout for the German Luftwaffe.Playing American rules in the first half, neither side scored.But the switch to Canadian rules at half-time brought points in the second half.Canada scored five minutes into the third quarter when Capt Ken Turnbull pounced on a fumble. Whitaker kicked the conversion.The score was tied five minutes later when Cpl Ben Detterman caught a pass, eluded three defenders and ran 35 yards for the touchdown.Touchdowns from Lt Orville Burke, quarterback for the Toronto Argonauts, and Maj Jeff Nicklin, running back for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, sealed a 16-6 win for Canada.When asked about the game in April 1996, Turnbull said: ""It was terrific. We got out of the army for two months and had fun.""The esprit de corps was terrific, they were all damned good fellows and we were serious about winning.""Smarting from their loss, the Americans demanded a rematch.The Coffee Bowl was played on 19 March 1944 and 50,000 spectators filled White City Stadium to witness a US team with NFL players.The star of the second game was Sgt Tommy Thompson, quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, who was drafted into the American side.Joe Horrigan, executive director of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, describes Thompson as being a ""very good"" quarterback.Thompson was nominated on numerous occasions for the Hall of Fame, but failed to be voted in.He won two championships with the Eagles in 1948 and 1949. His family donated his championship ring from 1949 to the Hall of Fame.""Tommy Thompson was one of these guys that was, what you would call, a real throwback in pro football,"" said Horrigan.""He was the tough quarterback that we now see re-emerging that can run, who could throw and he did all with a visual impairment.""He was legally blind in one eye, which almost sounds like you're trying to be funny that the quarterback was blind. But he literally was legally blind in one eye.""Thompson's niece, Sharon Early, said that her uncle was blinded as a child. He and his sister were throwing stones at one another and she caught him in the eye.His disability didn't stop him. He led the Americans to a 16-0 win over a Canada side missing Nicklin, who chose not to play because he felt the risk was too great before the forthcoming invasion of Normandy.Whitaker did feature despite having added duties after being promoted from major to lieutenant colonel between the two games.The number of ringers that the US recruited did not go unnoticed by their opposition.""I came face-to-face with this guy with a deep suntan,"" remembered Capt George Hees, a former Toronto Argonaut in the CFL.""Remember, we're in England and this is March. They'd brought this guy in from Hawaii, so we lost. But the first game? We beat [them].""Two of the players from the Tea Bowl never made it home.In March 1945, just weeks before the end of the war, Nicklin and his group of paratroopers undertook a mission along the Rhine.After jumping out of his plane, his parachute got tangled in a tree near a placement of German guns and he was shot dead.Hank Living, a CFL player for the Sarnia Imperials, had a premonition before his death.Sarnia historian, Tom Slater, explained: ""He had this fear, because of his size, that if his plane were to go down he wouldn't be able to escape out of the hatch.""Inevitably that is exactly what happened. Their plane had gone on a bombing mission to Germany, it was attacked and went down.""Eyewitnesses reported that there were no parachutes seen coming out of the aircraft and it went straight into the ground.""There were 19 NFL players, one coach and one administrator, that died in WW2 during military service.One who lost his life, Lt Jack Lummus, who played for the New York Giants, was awarded the Medal of Honor, America's highest military honour, for ""conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty"" in action against Japanese forces on Iwo Jima on 8 March 1945.One other NFL player and a man who became one of American football's leading administrators were also awarded the Medal of Honor during WW2.Lt Maurice Britt, of the Detroit Lions, learned he had been honoured for his bravery at Mignano, Italy, in November 1943, when he almost singlehandedly beat back a German counter-attack on his position, while on a hospital ship after losing his right arm at Anzio a few months later.And US Marine Corps pilot Capt Joe Foss was cited for bravery in air combat after being credited with shooting down 26 Japanese aircraft during the Guadalcanal campaign.Foss went on to become commissioner of the American Football League, which competed with the National Football League before eventually merging with it in 1966.Horrigan added: ""There were stellar performances by these players on the field, but more importantly stellar performances on the battlefield as well."""
sport	Fifa announce plans to raise $1bn for Africa		"Football's world governing body has announced plans to raise $1bn dollars to build at least one stadium meeting Fifa standards in each African country.Fifa president Gianni Infantino was talking in Lubumbashi during the 80th anniversary celebrations of DR Congo side TP Mazembe.He insisted that Fifa wants African football to shine and will work with the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and other stakeholders to improve refereeing, infrastructure and competitions on the continent.""We want to bring it (Africa) to the highest of heights and show the world the outstanding talent and amazingly gifted players your continent possesses,"" he said.""To do this, we want to implement a three pillar approach: refereeing, infrastructure and competitions, in close cooperation with Caf, all of its 54 member associations across Africa and other stakeholders.""I am positive that we will make African football reach the top level where it should be because the quality and potential are definitely here.""One of the plans is for Fifa to create a professional and elite group of African referees who will be independent of administration and political bodies.This follows on from the decision taken in the last executive committee meeting of Caf where a decision to implement reforms in the refereeing sector was approved.On infrastructure, Infantino said Fifa would mobilize companies and entrepreneurs to raise around $1bn with the objective of building at least one stadium that complies with Fifa's standards in each African country.He said Fifa will focus on developing new and better competitions to generate more revenue so that the African clubs can retain talented players.Infantino hinted at the possibility of creating an African League that would see the best clubs from the continent play against each other, without giving further details or outlining how the plan might impact the Champions League.He also talked about plans to organize regional competitions and youth tournaments to further help the development of young players in Africa.Infantino is touring along with his general-secretary-turned-African-delegate Fatma Samoura, Caf president Ahmad Ahmad and African legend Samuel Eto'o among other people.He then took part in a commemorative match that featured Eto'o, Zambian legend Kalusha Bwalya and TP Mazembe owner Moise Katumbi."

sport	Quitting work to watch football - the dream life of a superfan?	No job, no home, no plansZizou, Shearer and St James' ParkBack to work	"She quit her job, had no home and made no plans, but six months later, Jessica Malone has travelled to 60 football matches in 13 countries on three continents.The American, who even named her dog after Zinedine Zidane and has a particular fondness for Newcastle United, has visited 44 stadiums since packing in her job in April to watch football.The 33-year-old used air miles to travel around Europe, staying in youth hostels, before flying over to South America and Central America to watch some of the world's biggest games.Malone, who worked for an environmental consultancy firm for 10 years, handed in her two-week notice in April after personal circumstances left her wondering what to do next.She ""hadn't planned to quit"", but with the Women's World Cup in France around the corner, she decided to pack up her bags early.""It was unexpected. I had actually been living at a job site for six months with all my belongings in storage,"" says Malone. ""I didn't have a place to live so when I quit I hadn't put all my travel plans together but just knew I had to leave and figure it out later.""I thought about the number one thing I wanted to do and that was seeing Lionel Messi play. I had certain stadiums and teams in mind that I thought, if I don't see them play during this time in my life, when will I do it?""For the next two months, Malone travelled to Spain, France, Italy and Hungary and visited some of Europe's biggest stadiums including Barcelona's Nou Camp and AC Milan's San Siro.Her dream came true when she watched Messi come off the bench to score the winning goal against Levante, which secured Barcelona their 26th La Liga title at the end of April, before witnessing his side beat Liverpool 3-0 in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final four days later.Malone says she thought Barcelona had the Champions League semi-final ""in the bag"", adding: ""In hindsight that was completely surreal!""Watching Messi play was incredible. Everything goes through him. I have watched so many football games but to actually see him play was magical.""Malone has been to some of the biggest grounds in England, including Old Trafford, Anfield, Wembley, Emirates, Stamford Bridge and Etihad Stadium.But Newcastle United's St James' Park is her favourite.""I absolutely loved it! I saw Newcastle's Premier League win over Manchester United and it was incredible. I love older stadiums so that one was really special. I had been looking forward to getting to it for quite some time.""Malone's love for Newcastle stems from the 1998-99 season, when Alan Shearer ended the campaign as the club's top scorer with 21 goals. Newcastle finished a disappointing 13th but were runners-up in the FA Cup.""I don't have a favourite club team so I always try to support the lesser-known ones in America. Newcastle don't have a big following here in the States,"" she says.""I had been to Watford v Newcastle in December and the away fans spent the entire game singing so I just thought, I need to go to a home game with these people!""It was back in 1998 that Malone's love for football began. The US men's national team lost all three group games at the World Cup but Malone, who was ""obsessed with the Spice Girls"", got attached to the England team, which included Shearer.""I remember watching the game against Argentina [when England lost on penalties] and feeling so anxious and devastated for no reason because I had ties to neither team! I loved that whole World Cup and I named my dog Zizou after Zinedine Zidane.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceAfter exploring Europe, with visits to Ajax's Johan Cruyff Arena and the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Malone flew to Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.It was a bold move as a solo, female traveller, but Malone says she ""spent a lot of time planning"" each trip.""Because I'm unemployed, I had time to do full research on this stuff,"" she says. ""I love daytime kick-offs but in Europe they were often later. I try to be careful. I don't wear anything flashy and I don't really drink when I go to games by myself.""Malone is often quizzed about why she watches football, which she says can get ""exhausting"".""When I went to Russia for the World Cup I was asked at a fan festival why I was there. They would ask whether I had a boyfriend or a husband and I had to explain I was just there by myself like everyone else.""But there are so many women at the South American and Central American games that are hugely passionate so people don't even ask.""Malone's trip came to an end on Wednesday with her final game - the second leg of the Copa Libertadores semi-final between old Argentine rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors.""It's a game I never thought I'd get near to going to! It's crazy that the dates and timings worked out well,"" says Malone. ""I started job searching again in October and it's time to go back to work.""I feel like I have done what I needed to do."""

I love where I'm at, I'm at a great club and we are in a real good place at this point in time.""Kearney parted company with St Mirren at the end of June after guiding the Paisley club to a play-off win over Dundee United and was appointed Coleraine boss the following week.While he acknowledges he is happy being in charge of the Irish Premiership club, the former Ballymena United and Linfield player concedes that he would consider another opportunity to manage in a full-time capacity should the opportunity ever arise.""I am very proud of what I was able to do during the year I was in Scotland under the circumstances,"" added the 41-year-old.""Am I craving to go back across? No I'm not. Have I itchy feet to get away from Coleraine? No I don't. Could I manage Coleraine for the next 10 or 15 years? I absolutely could.""But from a career point of view I would never say never about what could happen. Having said that when you go to England or Scotland you are in a merry-go-round in terms of longevity.Media playback is not supported on this device""I enjoyed my time over there and I know I can do the job and I know I can function in full-time football. I have the skill set to do that but at this moment in time my only focus is three points this Saturday.""For me it's just about keeping the head down. I don't have an agent, I don't tout myself about, so it's very much business as usual.""From a manager's point of view I'm 41 and the majority of managers go into their 60s. From that perspective I have a huge amount of time left and I'll always keep an open mind to everything in life and football.""Coleraine lie top of the Premiership and are unbeaten in the 14 top-flight matches they have played so far, including home and away victories over pre-season fancied title favourites Linfield and Crusaders.""We have a lot of players who were there in my previous time in charge, plus some new players and it has all gelled together very quickly.""Everyone has bought in to what we are trying to do, we have a real togetherness, we're a tight knit group and everyone knows they are a big part of it.""We are a third of the way through the season so you don't start to think about titles until March or April. It's been a good start and that's all it has been.""It's important now that we kick on for this next third. It's about individual goals and collective goals and getting a level of consistency - that's what we aspire to.""We'll leave it to other people to talk about titles - that's not something we discuss as a squad - our job is to put points on the board.""Kearney was speaking on the day Coleraine announced plans to regenerate the pitch, grandstands, training pitch and surrounding areas at the Showgrounds.The club held a redevelopment information evening in its social club last week, at which chairman Colin McKendry told fans that the upgrades were required so that the club ""doesn't fall behind their rivals"".""The new project would see a 2,000 all-seater grandstand, which would be covered to provide shelter, as well offices being on the top tier, with light engineering units at the bottom,"" Coleraine said in a statement.""This new stand would increase capacity for UEFA games, with extra fixtures expected to be a formality when the UEFA Conference League commences in 2021.""The club would like this new stand to be developed and ready to go in three to five years but it could be quicker if money is available through the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL).""Earlier this year the club revealed plans to install a new 4G surface, which will cost in the region of £450,000 to £480,000, for the start of next season.The club also said that the Jack Doherty Grandstand is in total need of refurbishment, saying that they would like to extend the entire stand and replace the present changing facilities and Social Club.""As a result of this refurbishment, there would be a minimum of four changing rooms, a new medical room which is a UEFA requirement and a new social club/café that overlooks the pitch,"" the statement added.Coleraine also said they have plans to replace the current training pitch at the back of the Away End Stand and install three 4G small-sided game pitches, with floodlights, changing facilities, community rooms and a cafe."

sport	Fantasy football tips: Transfer and team guide for gameweek 10	Spurred on?Blades sharp at the backGross and GylfiOther things to consider	"We're heading into the 10th round of games in the Premier League this weekend, which is a nice, round juncture at which to fully assess your fantasy efforts.So how have you been getting on? Oh, that bad, eh?Well, never mind, for BBC Sport and the Fantasy 606 podcast are here to help with some tips on transfers and team selections that will hopefully get you back on track for the long trudge towards Christmas.Considering Tottenham's recent league results, you would be forgiven for having already ditched Mauricio Pochettino's men in search of something more consistent.This weekend's trip to leaders Liverpool does not immediately stand out as a reason to bring them back in.However, having struggled against Brighton and Watford in recent weeks, a test-your-mettle visit to the home of the runaway table-toppers, in which they won't shoulder the burden of expected victory, could well be just the game Spurs need, especially after their confidence-boosting 5-0 Champions League win over Red Star Belgrade on Tuesday.It was the Reds who beat Tottenham in last season's Champions League final, so revenge will be a motivating factor.Harry Kane (five goals and two assists against Liverpool in nine appearances) and Son Heung-min are obvious candidates for your team. ""The goals are there, but the only issue with Kane is the ankle he injured if Liverpool get physical with him,"" says Statman Dave of the Fantasy 606 podcast.You might also be tempted by the often overlooked Erik Lamela, who was excellent against Red Star.Longer term, could Davinson Sanchez, Ben Davies and Juan Foyth make that much-maligned defence a bit tougher?Speaking of being stubborn at the back, Spurs could do a lot worse than seek to emulate Sheffield United.They are up to ninth in the table, built primarily upon the division's joint-best defence.This weekend, they take an unbeaten away record to West Ham, who are yet to fully fire up front and have won just one of their past seven home meetings with the Blades.There are plenty of Sheffield United defenders to choose from, but John Lundstram (a midfielder listed as a defender and ""the main man"" according to Statman Dave) is the prime candidate. You might also want to dabble with one of those overlapping centre-backs - Chris Basham and Jack O'Connell.This weekend sees Brighton host Everton, showcasing a clash between the Premier League's most prolific set-piece chance creators.Since the start of the 2017-18 season, no two players have created more chances from set-plays than the 69 fashioned by both Pascal Gross and Gylfi Sigurdsson.With the former having set up Adam Webster's goal for the Seagulls against Aston Villa last weekend, and the latter scoring a belter in the Toffees' win over West Ham, they come into the game in points-scoring form."

sport	Heading should be banned in under-14s football - Lenny Johnrose	Concussion substitutions move a step closer	"Football should ban heading for under-14 children, says former player Lenny Johnrose, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in March 2017.New research says former professional footballers are three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than those in the general population.Former midfielder Johnrose says it ""sickens"" him that there are no heading bans as there are in the United States.The Football Association says there is no evidence to support a ban.It says: ""Heading is actually significantly less common in children's games. Our analysis shows that on average there are only around 1.5 headers per game in youth football.""In the US, children aged 11 and under are not allowed to head the ball in football matches.Dr Willie Stewart, who led the landmark study which compared deaths of 7,676 ex-players to 23,000 from the general population, added: ""Until somebody can prove this is no risk to the young, we must assume the risk is there.""The study also found that ""risk ranged from a five-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease, through an approximately four-fold increase in motor neurone disease, to a two-fold Parkinson's disease in former professional footballers compared to population controls"".Johnrose, 48, who played for Bury and Burnley, said: ""At least in America they have done something straight away. We're taking chances with people's lives and it does sicken me.""I'm going to spend the next few weeks, months, however long it takes, speaking to as many authorities as I can to try and get them to do something about it. I don't see the point in taking that risk.""It's not even a big loss to say, 'At your age, 14 and under, you're not heading the ball'. It won't cause any harm or damage to anybody.""The research has also led FA chairman Greg Clarke to call for concussion substitutions to be introduced ""as quickly as possible"".The game's law-making body, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), discussed new protocols in a meeting in Zurich on Tuesday and said it would set up an expert group to ""focus on this important topic in the coming months"".That move was welcomed by world players' union Fifpro. It said it had asked for the laws of the game to be changed for the past six years.It wants a 10-minute window to assess players who may have concussion, allowing a substitute to come onto the pitch in their place.""We would fully endorse any changes in the laws of the game that would facilitate this necessary 10-minutes window, such as the use of a temporary substitute during this period,"" it said.Any recommended changes to the laws of the game would have to be approved at Ifab's annual general meeting, in Belfast on 29 February.FA chairman Clarke said: ""One of the things we're pushing on, and I've spoken to Fifa and Uefa about this, is to introduce concussion substitutes as quickly as possible.""If anyone has a head injury, you don't just want to have a doctor looking at them quickly and saying 'you're OK' or 'you're not OK' - you can send someone else on to play while that player is assessed to make sure we move away from time pressure on doctors to make really important health decisions.""Johnrose has called for permanent substitutions for any player who has suffered a head injury during a match, rather than a potential short-term concussion replacement.He added: ""The football industry is so focused on finance that we completely shelve our responsibilities to people's welfare.""The squads are big enough anyway, why have a concussion sub so you can assess the guy and put him back on? Sport is a bit weird. One strike [and come off)], don't take any chances."""
sport	Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Why has the Swedish striker invested in Hammarby?	Who are Hammarby?What's in it for Ibrahimovic?	"No public figure in Sweden has a greater ability to steer the domestic and international news agenda than Zlatan Ibrahimovic, so when the country's record goalscorer released an 11-second video clip on Tuesday in which his name was unveiled on the back of a Hammarby shirt, the shockwaves were instant.In Sweden, journalists and fans alike scrambled to try and figure out the meaning: Was Ibrahimovic, the best paid player in Major League Soccer, really coming to humble Hammarby?International onlookers had a more straightforward question: Who are Hammarby?Less than a day later it was revealed that Ibrahimovic had not joined the Stockholm side as a player - he insists that he will never return to the Allsvenskan - but had instead purchased a quarter of their shares.To an outsider it may not seem like an obvious choice. In reality, Ibrahimovic's move looks incredibly savvy and suggests he or whoever is advising him has been paying attention.When the 38-year-old told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet on Wednesday that Hammarby are the club with ""the greatest potential to become the biggest in Scandinavia"" he wasn't exaggerating.While Gothenburg and Malmo have an international reputation with the silverware to back it up, Hammarby have only won one league title in their history, and a lack of European credentials mean they have received little exposure outside of Sweden.Potential is exactly what Ibrahimovic is buying, and he has moved in at a perfect moment. Last season, Hammarby were only one point away from winning the Swedish title on the last day of the campaign, their consolation prize of a European place for the first time since 2007 still of huge significance.Of equal importance is the way they pulled this upswing off, playing thrilling, relentlessly attacking football that saw them finish top scorers in Sweden by a 19-goal margin in 2019.Key to that is an analytics department that is revolutionary by Allsvenskan standards, and a coaching staff with an international flavour that includes Valencia hero Joachim Bjorklund as assistant. Hammarby have a philosophy that is ahead of the curve in Sweden.Then there is the fanbase, their greatest asset of all. There are many claims to the title ""club of the people"" but in Stockholm, Hammarby's claim is strongest.Despite their sparse trophy cabinet, and despite enduring tough years down in the second division as recently as 2014, the green and whites have a diehard support that always turns up, through thick and thin.In the second tier, selling out their 30,000 capacity stadium became a point of pride, and that loyalty has only gone from strength to strength since.Hammarby regularly top Sweden's attendance table and 2019 was no different. Hearing the sold-out crowd sing their pre-match anthem Just idag ar jag stark (Today I'm strong) is a goosebumps-raising experience for anyone lucky enough to witness it.As for what Hammarby gain from their new backer, direct financial input is likely to be limited but you only needed to look at the club's homepage to see the instant international exposure he brings, a rare English language post on Wednesday explaining the deal.His profile and ability to open doors to potential new sponsors should create a chance for Hammarby to increase revenue, while his worldwide reputation could also help them to attract more talent who would otherwise have been unaware of the club.Take an enviable connection between fans and club, plus a style of football that is easy on the eye and designed to be effective in Europe, then combine it with brand Zlatan's international reach, and something big could be about to happen in the Swedish capital.Hammarby are on the crest of a wave and Ibrahimovic can help them ride it, so there is palpable excitement in Stockholm.In southern Sweden on the other hand, there is a palpable sense of betrayal.Malmo supporters had hoped that when Ibrahimovic returned to Sweden it would be with the club that raised him. Instead, Malmo are left looking at a giant statue of their former hero outside their ground, while he prepares for life off the pitch by investing in one of their rivals.Ibrahimovic's playing days aren't quite over yet, and he is still expected to play his last couple of seasons in Serie A, but the door has now definitively been closed on his boyhood club, while a new one opens for a post-playing future further north."

sport	Motherwell 4-0 St Johnstone: Home side heap more misery on Tommy Wright's side	Perfect day for MotherwellMan of the match - Jermaine Hylton'Poor' despite thumping win - reactionMotherwellSt JohnstoneFull TimeGoal!SubstitutionSubstitutionSubstitutionGoal!BookingSubstitutionSubstitutionSubstitution	"Motherwell responded to successive defeats as they heaped more misery on bottom-of-the-table St Johnstone.After losses to Celtic and Hibernian, Stephen Robinson's side were clinical as they thumped the visitors at Fir Park and got back to winning ways.Devante Cole, Peter Hartley and Jake Carroll all scored after set-pieces caused problems in the Perth defence.And Christy Manzinga scored late on on his Motherwell debut after coming off the bench to put a seal on the win.St Johnstone had chances with Matty Kennedy, in particular, going close.But, after an encouraging run of seven points from 12, Tommy Wright's side stay at the foot of the Scottish Premiership on goal difference.Meanwhile Motherwell kept third place within their sights ahead of Wednesday's visit to St Mirren, while St Johnstone travel to Kilmarnock.In the beautiful, crisp winter sunshine, you could not help but hope the perfect day would give rise to the perfect game of football. But it was more hope than expectation - the previous match between the sides in Perth had been something of a football carbuncle.The first 15 minutes promised little. A bleak expanse of nothingness. St Johnstone looked the more likely, but there was nothing much worth scribbling about.Then came the Motherwell chances. First Christopher Long sclaffed a low shot wide from close range, before whistling an effort the wrong side of a post from further out after good work from Liam Grimshaw.Jermaine Hylton also fired wide from 20 yards, before turning provider as the hosts took the lead. Hylton turned Anthony Ralston inside out before delivering a fine cross to the back post, where Cole rose highest to nod home.Motherwell took confidence from that as St Johnstone offered little by way of response and early in the second half it was 2-0. Hartley met a corner with a meaty header, which flew into the net.The inexperienced St Johnstone defence sorely needed an experienced leader. Manager Wright has made bringing in an ""older, wiser"" head a priority for the January window.The visitors tried to respond. Kennedy should have done better one-on-one with the goalkeeper but he fired into the side netting. A header from Ali McCann sailed high over the bar, then a long-range strike from the promising central midfielder missed the target by inches.Motherwell remained a threat and extended their lead when Declan Gallagher's header came back off a post and Carroll hit home the rebound.And they rounded off a very good day with a calmly taken goal from substitute Manzinga, who rolled the ball past Zander Clark.In contrast, it was a truly disheartening day for St Johnstone, who could now face further defensive issues as Wallace Duffy hobbled off with an injury in the closing stages.It was a great team display from Motherwell, but the 26-year-old looked hungry throughout and came up with the assist for the vital opening goal.Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: ""I thought we were poor at times - a little bit flat - but there was some super defending and, at the other end, we were brave and our deliveries were good.""We didn't play as well as I feel we should do, but I've got to be happy because we were strong in both boxes. Everyone was maybe just a step off it, but everyone kept going. We were clinical.""St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""The game can be summed up by [the fact] they put seven headers in our box and won every one. We didn't deal with any of them and that's what has cost us.""Motherwell will not get four easier goals and I've had to stand here too many weeks and say that. They've got to realise they've got to stand up and do their jobs. No-one is given a go at anybody when we concede. We're almost too nice.""Match ends, Motherwell 4, St. Johnstone 0.Second Half ends, Motherwell 4, St. Johnstone 0.Corner, St. Johnstone. Conceded by Liam Grimshaw.Goal! Motherwell 4, St. Johnstone 0.

sport	Dementia in football: Dawn Astle 'staggered' by head trauma research	'Football should care and remember'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceFormer footballers who have suffered from dementia ""must not be a statistic"", says a prominent campaigner after research showed a link between the sport and the disease.Dawn Astle pushed for research after the death of her father - ex-England striker Jeff Astle - in 2002.Experts have found ex-players are more than three times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age range in the general population.Astle is ""staggered"" by the findings.""There will be no celebrations,"" she said. ""It doesn't bring my dad back, it won't bring any other dads and husbands back. We knew dad could not be the only one. We just wanted that question answered.""Astle died with what a coroner described as an ""industrial injury"".Since the former West Brom striker passed away at the age of 59, the families of dozens of other ex-footballers, including several from England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad, have come forward to reveal their stories of dealing with dementia and related illnesses.Monday's publication of research conducted at Glasgow University involved comparing the deaths of 7,676 ex-players to 23,000 from the general population.The sample was taken from men who played professional football in Scotland between 1900 and 1976.Dr Willie Stewart said that ""risk ranged from a five-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease, through an approximately four-fold increase in motor neurone disease, to a two-fold increase in Parkinson's disease in former professional footballers compared to population controls"".The link between contact sport participation and neurodegenerative disease has been subject to debate in recent years, but until this study, it was not clear whether there was any evidence of an increase in neurodegenerative disease rate in former footballers.Astle continued: ""My overall feeling is that I am staggered even though my own research and instinct was always that there was a serious problem.""We just wanted to see that football cared enough to find out the scale of the problem, to do the right thing and be there for these people when they need them most. Whatever they do, it must be across all parts of the game.""You can't assume it is not in grassroots and there is no evidence it is generational or that it was the old leather ball. And these players who have suffered dementia must not be a statistic - they must never be forgotten. They remain in the consciousness of the game."""

sport	Dementia in football: Scottish team doctor urges temporary subs for concussion		"Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe co-author of research into dementia in football says he is ""hopeful"" the sport will bring in rugby-style temporary substitutions for concussion.The proposal will be discussed by the International Football Association Board on Wednesday in Zurich.Glasgow University research found ex- footballers were three and a half times more likely to die of dementia.Dr John MacLean, Scottish FA chief medical consultant, also urged steps to reduce ""heading load on young players"".MacLean is part of the Uefa medical committee which has put forward the temporary substitutions proposal.Under current protocol, games are stopped for three minutes to allow assessment of suspected concussion by medical staff. If further treatment is required, the player has to leave the field.MacLean is a ""massive advocate"" of head injury substitutions.""That is going to the International Board and I would be hopeful in the relatively near future the laws of the game will be changed to include that,"" MacLean told BBC Scotland.""That will allow hopefully a 10-minute period with a free substitution, as rugby does, that gives the medical staff the opportunity to assess that player in the quiet of the dressing room, without the manager or referee trying to hound the medical team off the pitch.""Only 10% of concussions and head injuries involved loss of consciousness, so it's a relatively small percentage.""Any player who has been knocked out should be removed from the game, no matter what age.""MacLean, who also serves as Scotland's national teams doctor, admits more research is required into the effects of heading the ball.""Until we know the real place of heading, it would be wrong of us to say let's wait for another 10 years until this study is done,"" he added.""Through work with the Scottish FA and Uefa, what we have started to do is put together some sensible guidelines.

sport	Racism 'creeping back' in Scottish football, says Kevin Harper		"Racism is ""creeping back"" in Scottish football, says Kevin Harper.And the Albion Rovers manager is calling for the game's ruling bodies to impose tougher penalties.His comments follow figures from Show Racism the Red Card revealing over a third of young people have witnessed or experienced racism while playing football in the past academic year.""I'd say it's more prevalent now than it was five years ago,"" former Hibs striker Harper, 43, told BBC Scotland.""I look back on my career. There was racism when I started, there was racism in the middle and there was racism when I stopped playing.""It was a little bit different then. There wasn't as many black or ethnic players involved. The authorities didn't really know how to deal with it and tried to sweep it under the carpet.""I've not had it (abuse) in the dugout but, if I get to the very top, then, unfortunately, I have no doubt that I will get it.""We see it creeping back in. The powers at be across football have to put in place stricter sanctions.""This week, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the ""football family and governments"" need to ""wage war on the racists"" after the abuse of England players by home fans in Bulgaria.And Lazio's stadium will be partly closed for their Europa League game against Celtic next month as punishment for repeat racist behaviour by their supporters.Last month, Hearts issued indefinite bans to two supporters for racist and sectarian taunts during a match against Hamilton.""We can't keep giving people a slap on the wrist, saying that's okay we've banned them for life,"" said former Scotland under-21 cap Harper. ""For me that's just box ticking. How do you prove a person you've banned for life isn't in your stadium?""I think there an attitude of 'I don't want to say anything about it'. People are maybe scared to approach a steward, worried about what happens the next time they are at a game.""At the football, some fans seem to think they can spend £20-£30 on a ticket and say whatever they like. Whereas if you were walking down the street, at no point would anybody say 'yes you can give me £30 and you can call me whatever you want for 90 minutes'.""There is a minority that are still racist in their chanting. I think Scotland has to take a stand and say 'this is how we are going to tackle it'. Be a flag bearer for changing people's thoughts on racism in all walks of life.""Jordan Allison of the education charity Show Racism the Red Card told BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""We worked with 3,700 young people last year and 34% said they had witnessed or experienced racism in football at schools, grassroots level and the football academies.""More needs to be done on educating kids on what racism actually is and how to report it."""

sport	Leicester helicopter crash: A tragedy that stunned football - told by those who were there		"Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's helicopter took off from the centre circle. It was a routine sight. Leicester City's 61-year-old Thai owner would often fly out from the pitch after home games.Srivaddhanaprabha, known by fans as Vichai, had bought Leicester in 2010 for £39m when they were in the Championship. He helped clear the club's debts, and the Foxes returned to England's top flight four years later. They then beat odds of 5,000-1 to claim the Premier League title in 2015-16. It was one of sport's most remarkable success stories.On Saturday, 27 October 2018, Leicester played at home to West Ham. A 17:30 BST kick-off, the match finished in a 1-1 draw. At around 20:30, Vichai's helicopter took off. It crashed seconds later, coming down just outside the stadium.All five people on board were killed.This is the story of a tragedy that stunned football - told by four firefighters who were dispatched to the scene.The memories are as clear as if it happened yesterday.Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service's white watch reported for duty at 19:00 BST.The watch manager was running late as he had been to the King Power Stadium to see his beloved Leicester City play against West Ham. Wilfred Ndidi had scored late for the home side to secure a 1-1 draw. Attention had turned to a farewell presentation for a colleague about to leave the station. Routine jobs were being done. A briefing, a cup of tea, equipment checked.At around 20:30, the bells sounded. As with every incident received at the Central Fire and Rescue station on Lancaster Road, whoever is nearest the printer is the first to find out what the call is for, which fire engines will be attending and the personnel required.""Because we are one mile from the stadium, we got mobilised. The bells were going, the blue lights flashing,"" said Dave Tennant.""When it was announced what the incident was, we pretty much knew automatically who it was and what was involved,"" said Nick Lack. ""A lot of the watch are great Leicester fans. The initial realisation of what had taken place was pretty impactful.""Nearly everyone in Leicester knew how the club's owner left games. Tennant used to point the helicopter out to his three-year-old son from his house in Wigston, on the outskirts of the city, four miles away.""It is vivid in my mind,"" he said. ""I used to sit in the back garden with my son and say 'there is Leicester City flying'.""Sometimes we are sent out to jobs and what you are initially told is happening doesn't turn out to be 100% accurate. We heard it was a helicopter crash but we had to treat it like any other job.""That night, I was in charge of the second appliance. We were told there had been multiple calls, which is a good indication the reported incident has actually happened and that there were people on board the helicopter.""The King Power Stadium was the address we had. But the stadium itself is vast. As we approached, I clocked the smoke on the left-hand side. I remember the driver saying 'whereabouts, any idea?' I remember saying 'left, left, go left'. There were still people walking. The police were there.""The crews were on the scene within minutes of the helicopter crashing.At that point, there was no thought of who was involved. This is when training takes over, as Joe Robinson recalls: ""You just go into work mode. It was an obvious scene. There was fire to deal with. It was a helicopter.""It is hard to describe your feelings at that point. It is a cliche but it is something we get used to. People in other lines of work get used to certain things in their day and for us, it is not normal, but we learn to deal with it.""And we are there to save everybody - it doesn't matter whether it is the chairman of a football club or a homeless person. We are there to rescue someone or make the situation better. In the moment it is a helicopter crash with people on it.""The bigger picture came afterwards with all the media coverage. That is when it sinks in.""""I had friends who are Leicester fans, sending me messages asking me if I was there and if I could tell them anything,"" said Tennant. ""There is nothing you can say until the names are released. The families need to hear information first from the right channels.""As the situation changed and reinforcements arrived, control of the situation was handed over.A sense of loss took over for Robinson. ""We are here to make things better,"" he said. ""When something isn't better… it doesn't feel like you have failed but when there is a loss of life, it is not far off.""I am not a football fan, so the attachment to football is not there for me. I understood everything Vichai did for the city and the club and it is sad he is not with us any more. But we are very quick to think of one person and not the other four who were on board. They had families as well.""It is just a sad situation. We have been to incidents time and time again since. You can't carry that burden around with you. You just can't. There is not enough room for it.""Another member of the crew, Russ, was not working that night. He had been to the game though. And he could see the effect the event had on his mates when he returned for duty.""You could visibly see it had been hard work; seeing it on the news all the time, the profile of it, the exposure to it all. It had stirred emotions in a lot of people. The member of our team who was supposed to be leaving that night came back for a little bit to spend time with the watch, because he needed to be around everyone else who had experienced the same thing.""The service were very good at getting in touch and telling us there were things available if we wanted them. But there is nothing better than talking among yourselves.""The group decided to bring some kind of closure to their experience by doing the Leicester Half Marathon earlier this month.Their plans had to be altered when the race was cancelled because of poor weather. With money pledged for the Vichai Foundation and the Firefighters Charity, Leicester City came to their aid by allowing them to run round the pitch - 63 times - to fulfil their promise.""This time last year I was training for the London Marathon,"" said Tennant.""It is weird, but it is something that sticks in my mind. The training was horrible. I did some really long runs, really boring. This particular time, I finished late at night and I knew Leicester had been playing. I was catching my breath at the end of the run and the helicopter came over. You can see the lights, you know it is a helicopter and you think 'I know who that is'.""That was the last time I heard it.""I guess that is why it just feels personal. It was a completely different night."""
sport	Peter Leven: Scottish coach on moving to Belarus & meeting Maradona	'I'd never heard of Brest before'Belarusian ultras & a demanding president'I only met Maradona once''My daughter asks why I can't work in Asda'	"""The first thing I did was Google 'Brest'... and it came up with a city in France.""When Peter Leven left his role as Kilmarnock's assistant manager, not many would have expected the 36-year-old Scot's next career move to be to Belarus.But just over two years on, the former Kilmarnock, MK Dons and Oxford player has helped write a new chapter in Belarusian football history, playing a part in Dynamo Brest's first league title win.Here, Leven tells BBC Scotland why he went, what's next, and how greatness has been achieved at the club chaired by Diego Maradona.After three seasons at Kilmarnock in the mid-2000s, Leven returned to Rugby Park in June 2015 as assistant to Gary Locke before also serving under Lee Clark and Lee McCulloch during his two-year stint.When the latter left in October 2017, Leven went too and it was a conversation with an old friend - former Celtic and Scotland defender Stephen McManus - that made him realise getting back into work might mean stepping out the comfort zone.""He mentioned how everyone is going for the same jobs in Scotland and England, and he was right,"" Leven recalls. ""I needed to do something completely different from everybody else.""My agent had a connection with a Ukrainian agent, and he asked if I would like to go to Brest. I had never heard of them before so the first thing I did was Google 'Brest' and it came up a city in France.""Once I worked it out, I went over for a few days and it looked like a club that were going places. The owner wanted European coaches in and there were already two Spaniards in the academy.""The idea was to go over for a year, learn the culture and the language then move up to the first team, but within three months I was involved with them.""Leven was involved in the final nine games of the 2017-18 campaign, with Dynamo picking up five wins and two draws to finish the season in sixth place.That was enough to prolong his stay, with pre-season trips to Dubai, Turkey and Spain laying the foundations for an unlikely league title success.""In Dubai we played two Chinese Super League teams, so the club president came into the changing room to say we had to beat them for his business. I'm thinking, 'this is only pre-season!'.""But those demands would be met in stunning fashion. Brest beat BATE Borisov in the season's Super Cup curtain-raiser, before denying the perennial champions a 14th consecutive league title.They suffered just one defeat, breaking all kinds of club records and accumulating 72 points - a 20-point increase from the previous campaign.The decisive win came on Sunday - a 1-0 victory at home against FC Vitebsk - after the pressure had been cranked up following draws in the previous two games. Not that the Brest ultras were anxious during in the closing stages...""The referee added on four minutes injury time, so the ultras unveiled a banner saying 'Champions Brest 2019',"" says Leven.""I'm thinking, 'there's four minutes left, if the opposition score we've not won the league!' But as soon as the final whistle went all the fans ran on the pitch, it was crazy!""Securing the league title means there will be Champions League football in Brest next season. However, similarly to the Scottish Premiership winners, the Belarusian title holders will start in the first qualifying round, meaning there is a chance Leven might have to face a team from home.""I've actually thought about it [the prospect of playing Rangers or Celtic in Europe]. I think we would do OK,"" he says. ""We would give both of them a game, especially at home. It would be amazing for the club to get recognised in Europe.""If Dynamo Brest were looking to enhance their profile, they certainly achieved that last summer by announcing Diego Maradona as the club's chairman.A parade in the city followed as one of the game's most recognised and controversial figures was given a chance to greet fans that lined the streets to see him.""I've met him once. He's the same as what you see on screen. He lives his life every day. He dances, he cuddles and he's so enthusiastic about football,"" says Leven.""He came for a week last year, got paraded about in a Hummer and left. We've never seen him since!""Leven's time at Brest has come with struggles, though. Learning a new language and adapting to a different culture has proved difficult for the Scot.And with no English schools in the city, it means that the only time spent with his family are occasional trip home. Leven's eight-year-old daughter struggles to understand why he has to work more than 1,400 miles away from home.""My daughter cries. She asks why I can't come home and work in Asda instead,"" says Leven. ""It's tough at times, but winning the two trophies is for them. The next place I go I want to make sure my family can come with me. That's the next move I think.""I just want people to look at me and think 'fair play', because I've took a risk. It's been mentally challenging, but I've just tried to take the blinkers off and experience what's out there."""

sport	Where does your club rank for engaging with their fans?		"Every relationship has its ups and downs, but what if there was a better way of measuring how clubs engage with their fans?One supporter has developed a method to judge how each of English football's professional clubs rank in terms of fan engagement.The Fan Engagement Index awarded points to clubs who were in England's top four divisions last season, based on how they communicate with supporters, how fans help with the club's governance and the transparency of supporter meetings.It found that League Two Exeter City topped the table, with Norwich City the only Premier League team ranked in the top 10.Leicester City are the next best-placed Premier League side in 15th, with Manchester City (37th) the highest-ranked side from last season's final top six.They are above Liverpool (39th), Arsenal (47th), Manchester United (49th), Tottenham (51st) and Chelsea (73rd).The lowest-ranked current top-flight team is Sheffield United (82nd) with Swindon Town bottom of the 92 clubs surveyed.Kevin Rye, who has previously worked with Supporters Direct and now works as a fan engagement consultant, says he compiled the list as a way of bringing better accountability to how clubs engage with fans, clarifying what good engagement actually is and sharing best practice.""The reason Norwich City do well is because they have hard-wired fan engagement into the way they run the club,"" Rye told BBC Sport. ""That's why clubs perform well, because they weave it into everything they do.""One of the reasons why clubs fall down is because they don't have a direct relationship with the most active supporter organisation, which in most cases is a supporter's trust. Some of the scoring could also be down to a lack of information available, which tells its own story. That's about transparency.""I hope this gives some principles and structure to fan engagement and opens up the conversations between fans and clubs, bringing the two together.""Each club was given a score for their dialogue (D) with fans, their governance (G) and making their communication transparent (T).For those who registered an equal score, more weight was given to the dialogue rating. Rye suggests that three clubs - Port Vale, Gillingham and Swindon Town - did not carry out any regular communication with their fans.The research, which Rye says is based on publicly-available data, also suggested that 13 clubs did not have a supporters' trust or an independent supporters' group.In a statement the EFL said: ""Clearly defined lines of discussion between clubs and supporters are integral to the long-term health of the game and the EFL strongly supports the principal that clubs should have regular and open dialogue with its fans.""This approach is embedded in EFL clubs through their customer charters which sets out their commitment to their fanbase, stakeholders and the wider community, including minimum requirements for structured dialogue with fans. This includes holding at least two meetings or forums per season.""In addition, the role of Supporter Liaison Officers (SLOs) ensures clubs appoint a dedicated person to act as the point of contact for supporters and it should also be noted that many clubs are going that extra mile to ensure supporters remain at the heart of a club's identity.""Exeter City and Norwich City scored well because they are two of eight clubs to do three types of face-to-face dialogue: fans forums, one-to-one relationships with supporters' trusts and fans' liaison meetings.Asked if the list showed that Premier League clubs were being more complacent regarding their fans, Rye added: ""There's a baked-in complacency in English football. In any circumstance, fans keep walking through the gates.""Premier League clubs are in some senses bigger organisations compared with other clubs, but look at Leicester City who are 20 points off the top 10. If they can do it, and they recently won the Premier League title and are second now, why can't anyone else do it?""Portsmouth are another good example. They have managed to go from a fan-owned club to a privately-owned club and their model has barely changed in the way they engage with their fans.""The reason is about leadership and the decisions at the top ... it was clearly decided that 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.""It's the same reason Reading have been engaging with their fans even though their owners have changed. Consistency is important. A culture takes time to build."""
sport	Catalan Football Federation suspends matches after separatist leaders jailed		"The Catalan Football Federation has suspended all matches in the region on Monday after nine Catalan separatist leaders were jailed.Spain's Supreme Court sentenced the leaders for sedition over their role in an independence referendum in 2017.The federation says the suspension is to show solidarity with the leaders and their families and covers all of its official football and futsal matches.It does not include La Liga or the Spanish national team.Catalonia is a semi-autonomous region in north-east Spain and in a referendum on 1 October 2017, declared illegal by Spain's Constitutional Court, about 90% of Catalan votes cast backed independence, but turnout was 43%.Prosecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion.Monday's ruling comes after four months of hearings.Catalonia-based Barcelona said ""prison is not the solution"" and the conflict must be resolved with ""political dialogue"".The Spanish champions added: ""Now more than ever, the club asks all political leaders to lead a process of dialogue and negotiation to resolve this conflict, which should also allow for the release of convicted civic and political leaders.""FC Barcelona also expresses all its support and solidarity to the families of those who are deprived of their freedom.""In March 2018, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was fined by the Football Association for wearing a yellow ribbon, a symbol of support for independence in his native Catalonia."
sport	Jose Mourinho says he had no contact with Arsenal before Unai Emery sacking		"Jose Mourinho says he did not have any contact with Arsenal about replacing Unai Emery before taking over as Tottenham's new manager.Mourinho, 56, was reported to have met Arsenal's head of football Raul Sanllehi earlier this month as Emery's position began to come under threat.Emery was sacked on Friday, nine days after Mourinho became Spurs boss.""When it was written that I was in a meeting with Mr Sanllehi, it was not true,"" Mourinho said.With Emery then still in his position at Emirates Stadium, the Portuguese manager took over at Arsenal's arch-rivals Tottenham following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino.Former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Mourinho signed a contract with Spurs until the end of the 2022-23 season.Argentine Pochettino has been among the names linked with replacing Emery and Mourinho says he is already looking forward to playing against Arsenal again - whoever is in charge.Spurs will host the Gunners at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in late April.""I look forward to playing against Arsenal. I want to play against Arsenal.

sport	Euro 2020 draw: 'Favourable draw but black cloud on horizon for England'	Take Croatia lightly at your peril	England's Euro 2020 finals draw is packed with advantages - but it also came with a potentially painful sting in the tail for manager Gareth Southgate's aspirations to win a first major tournament in 54 years.Southgate will want to take England one step further than the run to the World Cup semi-final in Russia in 2018 - and playing every group game at Wembley gives them the perfect platform.England will face Moscow conquerors and sometime bogey side Croatia in their first Group D game at Wembley on 14 June before facing the Czech Republic and the winner of a play-off path that includes Scotland, Israel, Norway and Serbia.This, on the surface, looks a favourable and manageable draw - but there may just be a large black cloud on England's horizon.Southgate and the FA, preparing for those big Wembley games that will grip the nation, will be delighted to miss some of Europe's big football beasts in the group but it may only be a temporary reprieve.If England emerge from Group D as winners, and they will be favourites, they will face the sort of opponents that have so often been their undoing and downfall when the pressure has been on in the past.In this eventuality, they will face the runners-up in Group F, which means their last 16 opponents in Dublin could be World Cup holders France, current European champions Portugal or the old foe Germany.The very names hold uncomfortable memories for England and will provide the acid test of Southgate's claim that they are moving closer to that elite group.England have struggled with the class acts of European international football before as proved by Croatia in Russia and the emerging Netherlands at the inaugural Uefa Nations League in Portugal last June.All opponents will be wary of the damage England's superb attack, built around Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling, can do but they will also relish facing that vulnerable rearguard, especially if they have the quality of France, Germany and a Portugal team still inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo, who won that Uefa Nations League in their own country.England have been presented with the time-honoured tournament dilemma that it would actually be better to finish second in their group but Southgate will know that such manipulation is impossible and victory in the opening game against the dangerous Croats is essential to set the nation's mood and the momentum of his team.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe group itself has its hazards, none more than Croatia, who may be past the peak that took them to the World Cup Final in 2018 where they lost to France, but who have a knack of pulling together as a united force at tournament time.Croatia remain sixth in the Fifa rankings, two places behind England, and still have the inspirational Luka Modric to call on. Like the team itself, Modric may be past his best but take Croatia lightly at your peril.They have risen to the occasion against England in the past, not just in Russia but also infamously at a rain-lashed Wembley in November 2007 when - even though they had already qualified - they won 3-2 to end Steve McLaren's hopes of reaching Euro 2008 and his time as manager.England's post-World Cup meetings with Croatia ended in a goalless draw behind closed doors in Rijeka in 2018 before Southgate's men recorded a 2-1 win at Wembley last November, although the visitors led with only 12 minutes left.Croatia will not be daunted by the Wembley stage. They have shown they can rise to it and England must beware.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAs for the Czech Republic, England and Southgate have had a very recent reminder of what they can do, although they will also have grim and contrasting memories of their last visit to Wembley, where this group game will be played.They inflicted England's only loss in their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign, a fully deserved 2-1 win in Prague in October, although Raheem Sterling's hat-trick saw the Czechs on the wrong end of a 5-0 rout at Wembley in March 2019.Even the final team in England's group, decided via the play-offs, has the mouth-watering prospect of a possible meeting with Scotland, who will vie with Israel, Norway and Serbia for the right to fight it out at Euro 2020.England's draw is full of the usual intrigue and the manner of their qualification, along with growing confidence and comfort at this level plus the convenience of all group games at Wembley, means Southgate will have every right to be optimistic.Just one look beyond that group, which England actually should win despite maybe harbouring that secret preference for finishing second, will see some very large bumps in the road as Southgate tries to navigate a path to Euro 2020 glory.
sport	Racism in football: Football bodies have 'productive' Twitter meeting		"The Football Association, Premier League and EFL have had a ""productive and positive"" meeting with Twitter after online racist abuse of players.Manchester United's Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, plus Chelsea's Tammy Abraham and Kurt Zouma, have all been targeted on social media platforms.Managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Frank Lampard have called on companies to do more to stop the abuse.The meeting examined specific issues around ""unacceptable behaviour"".An FA statement said: ""The meeting was productive and positive, and gave both the football authorities and Twitter an opportunity to examine some of the specific issues around this unacceptable behaviour both online and offline.""All parties agreed to take these constructive discussions forward.""Earlier this month Twitter said it had ""taken action"" on ""more than 700 examples of hateful conduct"" in the two weeks after several Premier League players were abused.""This vile content has no place on our service,"" it said in a statement.

sport	Fantasy football tips: Can the Canaries? Sign Alisson? Axe De Gea?	Ditch De Gea, sign Alisson?Follow the form?Time to can the Canaries?Replace Canaries with Cherries?	Right, yet another international break is over. A glorious escape from the stress of fantasy football - or a painful couple of weeks without FPL in your life, depending on your point of view.With no Premier League game until Saturday lunchtime, you have plenty of time to get your team sorted this week.So who should you be looking at?Despite Manchester United's struggles this season, David de Gea is the fifth highest scoring goalkeeper in fantasy football. However, a hamstring injury while on international duty with Spain makes him a doubt for Sunday's game against Liverpool.If you have a spare £200,000 of fantasy football money, then you could always replace him with Liverpool's Alisson, who is back in training following a calf injury and could return against United.Or a good budget goalkeeping option is £4.4m Paulo Gazzaniga, who is likely to be Spurs' first-choice keeper for about three months following an injury to Hugo Lloris.Three players with good weeks before the international break have caught the eye.Brighton's 19-year-old striker Aaron Connolly, who scored twice against Tottenham on his first Premier League start, could get a run in the team and at £4.5m looks a potential bargain.But it is hard to look past midfielder Adama Traore. The Wolves wide man is a talented dribbler who has always missed an end product. But after a goal drought of over a year, his double - away to champions Manchester City - makes him look a steal at £5m.He has been playing at right wing-back but moved up front against City for the final 22 minutes and must be a good bet to be deployed in a more attacking role again. Three of Wolves' next four opponents are the three teams directly above the relegation zone.Arsenal defender David Luiz scored the only goal and kept a clean sheet against Bournemouth last time out. His £5.8m value is one to consider as Arsenal do not face a 'big six' side again until 14 December - a run of eight games.Most people had at least one Norwich player in their team following their prolific start to the season. But striker Teemu Pukki's 49 points in five games have been followed by just five points in the next three.Midfielders Todd Cantwell and Emiliano Buendia are on similar runs of form, with the Canaries only scoring one goal in the past three games.However, a word of warning - Pukki scored twice for Finland against Armenia last time out, and Norwich had more shots in their recent 5-1 defeat by Aston Villa (13) than they did in any other game this season.On the other hand though, Pukki has only attempted one shot in his past two Canaries games.So in summary, maybe give him one more chance? Unless...It might be a good time to back Norwich's opponents, Bournemouth. The Canaries have conceded at least twice in each of their past six Premier League games.Bournemouth's next two matches are against the Premier League's bottom two sides - Norwich and Watford. Those two have conceded 41 goals in 16 games combined.Two words - Callum Wilson.Wilson has scored five goals in his last five Premier League games - and yet his value is lower at the time of writing (£7.9m) than it was at the start of the season. Add to that he has scored five goals in his six Premier League home games against promoted sides.All prices correct on Thursday at 22:00 BST
sport	Norwich sporting director Stuart Webber on the tricks of football recruitment	'Scouting has changed a lot'Modern methods, similar resultsNavigating difficult deals	"Teemu Pukki has made a blistering start to life in the Premier League - even surprising the man who signed him after several years of research.""Did we expect 29 goals in a Championship-winning season? No that would be a lie. We don't try to pretend we're magical geniuses,"" Norwich City sporting director Stuart Webber told BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast.Having played a key role in taking Raheem Sterling to Liverpool, as well as uncovering the players that helped send both Huddersfield Town and Norwich to the Premier League, Webber is well versed in the tricks of player recruitment.""What people get caught up on is the idea of one person spotting or finding a player. It's much bigger than that,"" said Webber, appointed as Norwich's first sporting director in April 2017.""Scouting has changed a lot, even since I started. If you look at the use of data now it's incredible what you can do.""Webber, 35, was headhunted by Liverpool as director of recruitment from Wrexham in 2009 and recalls the thorough process undertaken in monitoring the progress of current England and Manchester City forward Sterling.""I was fortunate enough to be a part of signing Raheem Sterling at Liverpool. We watched him constantly for 12 months in different environments - in the Queens Park Rangers youth teams and with England.""I remember watching him play away in Belgium. He was a substitute, the pitch was frozen - it's still the coldest night of my life in football - and he came on and set up a goal.""It's about gathering the information with your own eyes and reporting it accordingly.""More recently, Webber's meticulous approach saw striker Pukki sign from Celtic on a free transfer in June 2018 - before the Finnish international went on to terrorise Championship defences.The arrival of Pukki at Norwich took ""years of work"" according to Webber - although he admitted he had wanted to sign the player much sooner.""I first came across Pukki when he was at Schalke and I was at Wolves. I told our manager at the time, Stale Solbakken, that we could get him for about £1.2m and Stale liked the idea - but he got sacked two days later.""Teemu then went to Celtic and we followed him over a period of time. When we saw he was coming out of contract, we looked at the goals he had scored and the chances we were creating and thought it could really work.""He was watched for about five years, so we knew the type of player he was and how he would fit into how we play football.""Adapting to more modern methods have also brought reward for Webber and Norwich.Currently, only Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne boasts more assists than Canaries midfielder Emiliano Buendia in the Premier League this term.But when Norwich discovered him, Getafe's Argentine was playing on loan at struggling Spanish second tier side Cultural Leonesa.""If you look at now, we signed Buendia from the Spanish second division after he was flagged to us by the data,"" Webber said.""The analysts flagged him because of the chances he was creating. His team were not scoring but we felt he would fit the way we play perfectly and we would score if he created those chances for us.""His assists when we signed him were not high but his expected assists and number of big chances created were unbelievable high, we felt, for a 20-year-old.""Despite Leonesa eventually being relegated, Webber - who follows action from across Europe closely - would not be dissuaded from signing Buendia, a footballer he likens to former Norwich midfielder James Maddison.And, although statistics and data hold an increasing influence in such decisions, sometimes a player just stands out.""There is no better feeling than when you see a player for the first time who just grabs you,"" added Webber.""The scouts showed me clips of Buendia for 20 minutes. Three minutes in they had my attention.""I watched five games of him back to back that night. It was a dream to see how he played football.""Negotiations, however, are often not all plain sailing.While attempting to secure Buendia, Webber travelled to meet the Getafe president with a budget significantly short of the La Liga side's initial evaluation.Plotting his route to a favourable outcome, the Norwich sporting director took the bold decision to walk out of the meeting.""You have different negotiations. Some are friendly - this one was awkward. It went back and to. In the end I just got up and said I was leaving.""I just left the room. You could tell this would be a fight and we needed to fight back. All the foreign clubs think English clubs have stupid money - some do - but at Norwich we didn't.""I knew they were desperate to do this deal. We could afford to leave it, we really wanted the player but it wasn't life or death. I went back home to Norwich and after a couple of days passed Getafe wanted to speak again.""I drove to the airport but on my way I rang to tell the agent I was going to turn around. The president was much nicer, he knew I wouldn't be coming back again and we did the deal pretty quick, on the terms that we wanted."""

sport	Bulgaria v England racism: Bulgarian Football Union president Borislav Mihaylov resigns	What happened during the game?	"The president of the Bulgaria Football Union, Borislav Mihaylov, has resigned.Bulgaria Prime Minister Boyko Borissov called for him to quit on Tuesday after the racist abuse of England players in the Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia.Monday's match, which England won 6-0, was stopped twice because of racist behaviour by home fans, which included Nazi salutes and monkey chants.The BFU said the move ""is a consequence of the recent tensions"" but did not mention racism in their statement.The statement said the tensions had created ""an environment that is detrimental to Bulgarian football and the Bulgarian Football Union"".It added that ""Mihaylov expresses his firm readiness to continue helping in the development of Bulgarian football in every possible way"".Earlier on Tuesday, the Bulgaria prime minister ""strongly condemned"" the fans' behaviour and called for Mihaylov to resign ""immediately"".""After yesterday's shameful loss of the Bulgarian National Team and given the bad results of our football, I ordered to end any relationship with BFU, including financial, until the withdrawal of Borislav Mihaylov from the post,"" he added.Before the match, Mihaylov had complained to Uefa about ""unjust branding"" after the build-up was overshadowed by fears England's players could be subjected to abuse.The Vasil Levski Stadium was already subject to a partial closure for the match after Bulgaria were sanctioned for racist behaviour during Euro 2020 qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic.Mihaylov, a former Reading goalkeeper, played at three World Cups for Bulgaria and has been member of Uefa's executive committee since 2011.Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the ""football family and governments"" need to ""wage war on the racists"", after the abuse of England players.Uefa told BBC Sport any action in response to Monday's events would have to follow on from a disciplinary committee, which in turn has to wait for a referee's report.Anti-discriminatory body Fare has called for Bulgaria to be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign.After making a pass in the first half, England defender Tyrone Mings glanced over his shoulder and could be heard calling towards the touchline: ""Did you hear that?""Shortly afterwards, in the 28th minute, the game was stopped.Striker Harry Kane was in conversation with referee Ivan Bebek on the halfway line while a stadium announcement was made to condemn racist abuse and warn fans that the game could be abandoned if it continued. At the same time, England manager Southgate was talking to a number of his players.The game resumed but was stopped again just before half-time. Southgate and several England players were in discussion with match officials before the game was restarted for a second time.A group of Bulgaria supporters wearing black hooded tops - some wearing bandanas covering their faces - started to leave the stadium after the game was halted for a second time. BBC Radio 5 Live reported that some made racist gestures while heading towards the exits.After six minutes of time added at the end of the first half because of the delay, Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov was seen in a heated debate with a section of home supporters near the tunnel while the rest of the players headed for the dressing rooms for half-time.In line with Uefa protocol, England had the option to walk off the pitch but they continued to play the full 90 minutes."

But I just kept working hard and adapting was important for me. Now you can see on the pitch as a team that we're doing very well.""I don't worry about the criticism. I only focus on my football.

It depends on the team and how well they can do it in the Europa League campaign. If we continue to work like this and perform even better defensively then I'm positive we can do something in the Europa League."""

sport	Euro 2020: Everything you need to know about next summer's tournament	Who has qualified?Where is it?Why are the games all over Europe?Where are the home nations going to be playing?Can I still get tickets?Will there be fan parks?Isn't this all terrible for the environment?Who are the favourites?	"Twenty-four teams, 51 matches in 12 cities from Bilbao to Baku - Euro 2020 promises to be a finals like no other.Gone is the usual country-wide party in a host nation as Uefa splits the festivities across a continent instead - but where are the games being played, why, and can you still get tickets?Group A: Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, WalesGroup B: Belgium, Russia, Denmark, FinlandGroup C: Ukraine, Netherlands, Austria, Path D/A*Group D: England, Croatia, Czech Republic, Path C**Group E: Spain, Poland, Sweden, Path B***Group F: Germany, France, Portugal, Path A/D*These 16 teams will compete in the play-offs, with four qualifying:*Iceland/Romania/Bulgaria/Hungary / Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Belarus**Scotland, Israel, Norway, Serbia***Slovakia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Northern Ireland, Republic of IrelandLike the World Cup, the Euros are usually spent in one (sometimes two) countries every four summers, giving fans the chance to soak up some culture, plenty of sun and a last-16 defeat.For the 2020 edition, Uefa decided that more is more. Twelve host nations have been selected, with group games spread across four time zones and nearly 4,000 miles. Stick some new tyres on the car or get ready to do some inter-railing...Host cities/stadiums:1. Glasgow (Hampden Park, capacity 51,000). Three group games, one last-16 game.2. Dublin (Dublin Arena, 51,000). Three group games, one last-16 game.3. London (Wembley, 90,000). Final and both semi-finals, one last-16 game, three group games.4. Bilbao (San Mames, 53,000). Three group games, one last-16 game.5. Amsterdam (Johan Cruyff Arena, 54,000). Three group games, one last-16 game.6. Copenhagen (Parken Stadium, 38,000). Three group games, one last-16 game.7. Munich (Football Arena Munich, 70,000). Three group games, one quarter-final.8. Rome (Stadio Olimpico, 68,000). Three group games, one quarter-final.9. Budapest (Puskas Arena, 68,000). Three group games, one last-16 game.10. St Petersburg (Krestovsky Stadium, 61,000). Three group games, one quarter-final.11. Bucharest (Arena Nationala, 54,000). Three group games, one last-16 game.12. Baku (Olympic Stadium, 69,000). Three group games, one quarter-final.Yes, Bucharest and Budapest are similar names, aren't they? No, we won't do a story when you book to go the wrong one.Wembley has seven games because it picked up a number of matches which were originally allocated to Brussels. Half of the host nations are staging a senior men's major international tournament for the first time: Azerbaijan, Denmark, Republic of Ireland, Hungary, Romania and Scotland.A frankly excellent question.Officially, the reason is 2020 marks the 60th anniversary of the first European Championship in 1960. Is a 60th anniversary even a thing?Pragmatically, it has been suggested that the tournament has been broken up to spread the cost of hosting it. France managed the job perfectly well in 2016 but interest in hosting 2020 was a bit thin on the ground.The only bids for the finals came from Turkey, a joint effort from Ireland, Scotland and Wales and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan. That's despite total tournament revenue in 2016 of 1.93bn euros - up 34% on Euro 2012.After that Uefa announced the decision to take the tournament on the road.Then Uefa president Michel Platini said: ""If you need to build airports or 10 stadiums in a country, this would be rather easy because it would be one stadium per host city.""No stadiums were built specifically for the tournament in the end, although Hungary's Puskas Arena is new, opening earlier this month.The top two teams in each group go through to the last 16, along with the four best third-placed finishers.World Cup semi-finalists England are the top seeds in Group D and will play all three of their group games at Wembley. If they win the group they would head to Dublin for the last 16 - probably against Germany, France or Portugal. If they are runners-up they head to Copenhagen, if they finish third and qualify it could be Bilbao, Glasgow or Budapest.Wales, who have qualified for their third major tournament, will play against Switzerland and Turkey in Baku and then Italy in Rome.Scotland and Northern Ireland - plus the Republic of Ireland - are all in the play-offs, which will be held on 26 and 31 March.Scotland need to get past Israel at home and then Norway or Serbia away to qualify. Northern Ireland could host the Republic in the final if the neighbours win away to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovakia respectively in the semis.Yes. Sort of.This summer 19.3 million requests were submitted for the 1.5 million tickets that were made available. According to Uefa, there were 1.9 million tickets requested for the final at Wembley alone - 22 times the capacity of the stadium.That means plenty of disappointed fans across Europe, who are now part of the Uefa 'Fans First' programme, meaning they get the first shout on the next tranche.The next opportunity to apply for tickets will be in December - but not all fans will be able to buy them. These tickets will be made available through national associations such as the Football Association.Tickets for 44 of the 51 matches are available for under 50 euros (£43), but the cheapest seats for the final at Wembley are 95 euros (£82), all the way up to an eye-watering 945 euros (£812).A huge success in host cities at major tournaments over the past 15 years or so, official fan parks give those supporters in host cities without a match ticket somewhere safe and suitable to watch the games in huge numbers.Uefa is promising huge screens, festivals, community events, street activations and pop-up concerts in host cities throughout the tournament.Some cities have revealed where these 'fan villages' will be held (Munich's is at the old Olympic Stadium, Budapest revellers head to Heroes' Square) but most are yet to be confirmed. Follow the noise.Times they are a-changing. In a world where Coldplay are cancelling world tours because of the environmental damage they cause and the carbon footprint of flying is increasingly on the agenda (Ajax announced they would travel to Lille this season by train rather than by plane), perhaps sending football teams, staff, media and fans across a continent isn't the wisest idea?Uefa has paired two host cities per group in a bid to keep distances down, and while some are fairly manageable (there's about 400 miles of road between London and Glasgow, and Budapest and Munich, for example) the sides joining Italy in Group A are looking at a 2,500-mile trip each way to Baku from the Italian capital.Italy are playing all of their group games in Rome, but the winners of that group then travel to Wembley for the last-16 match - a four-day train journey from Azerbaijan...So a lot of travelling. But Uefa is addressing the concerns, planting 50,000 trees in each of the 12 host cities and hoping to offset its estimate of 405,000 tonnes of carbon produced by fans and Uefa staff travelling to games.President Aleksander Ceferin said: ""The nature of the tournament means there are many benefits over a traditional one. In addition to being able to take the matches to more diverse communities across Europe, there is no need either to build a host of new stadia or the transport links that they need, which carry a huge environmental cost in concrete and other resources.""But it also has a cost - with increased travel for fans to watch their teams play. Uefa takes its responsibilities on this seriously and it is right that we offset the carbon emissions that causes.""It feels pretty wide open. Will no side having 'home' advantage play a part?The bookmakers in the UK have World Cup holders France as favourites, ahead of England (who could play all but two of their games at Wembley on the way to a potential final), Belgium, Germany and Spain.If France boss Didier Deschamps lifts the trophy he would become the first person to win the World Cup and European Championship both as player and manager.Holders Portugal, with Cristiano Ronaldo now up to 99 international goals, are 12-1 shot. Ronaldo holds the record for most games (21), most goals (nine, joint with Platini) and most tournaments with at least one goal (four) at the European Championship.The Portuguese forward is also the European player with the most appearances at major tournaments, World Cup and Euros combined (38, joint with former Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger)."

sport	Racism in football: Uefa punish Lazio with partial stadium closure for fan behaviour		"Lazio's stadium will be partly closed for their Europa League game against Celtic next month as punishment for racist behaviour by their fans.It is the first sanction announced by Uefa since European football's governing body said the ""football family"" must ""wage war on the racists"".Partial stadium closure is the minimum punishment Uefa can impose.Lazio have been fined 20,000 euros (£17,300) and will suffer full stadium closure if they reoffend within a year.The sanctions relate to incidents during Lazio's 2-1 win over French side Rennes in a Europa League group match on 3 October.That game was already subject to a partial stadium closure for the racist behaviour of the Serie A side's fans in a Europa League last-32 game against Sevilla in February.On Tuesday, Uefa defended its record of taking action against racism in the wake of England's Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria, which was suspended twice because of monkey chants and Nazi salutes by home supporters.Lazio had released a statement prior to Uefa publishing its ruling, protesting against the ""deeply damaging"" penalty.They said the decision ""seems not to have taken into account the clear condemnation from the club against the odious racist behaviour of a few irresponsible people"".The statement added that Lazio ""reaffirms its intention to pursue in penal and civil courts those responsible for unacceptable behaviour"".The Italian side host Celtic in their next European game on 7 November."
sport	Dementia in football: Ex-players three and a half times more likely to die of condition	'This is only the start of our understanding'	"Former professional footballers are three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age range in the general population, according to new research.Experts at Glasgow University have been investigating fears that heading the ball could be linked to brain injuries.The study began after claims that former West Brom striker Jeff Astle died because of repeated head trauma.It compared deaths of 7,676 ex-players to 23,000 from the general population.The sample was taken from men who played professional football in Scotland, and were born between 1900 and 1976.The long-awaited study was commissioned by the Football Association and the Professional Footballers' Association after delays in initial research had angered Astle's family.It began in January last year and was led by consultant neuropathologist Dr Willie Stewart, who said that ""risk ranged from a five-fold increase in Alzheimer's disease, through an approximately four-fold increase in motor neurone disease, to a two-fold Parkinson's disease in former professional footballers compared to population controls"".Although footballers had higher risk of death from neurodegenerative disease, they were less likely to die of other common diseases, such as heart disease and some cancers, including lung cancer.Dr Stewart said: ""This is the largest study to date looking in this detail at the incidence of neurodegenerative disease in any sport, not just professional footballers.""Our data show that while former footballers had higher dementia rates, they had lower rates of death due to other major diseases.""As such, while every effort must be made to identify the factors contributing to the increased risk of neurodegenerative disease to allow this risk to be reduced, there are also wider potential health benefits of playing football to be considered.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe link between contact sport participation and neurodegenerative disease has been subject to debate in recent years, but until this study, it was not clear whether there was any evidence of an increase in neurodegenerative disease rate in former footballers.Former England international Astle developed dementia and died in 2002 at the age of 59. The inquest into his death found heading heavy leather footballs repeatedly had contributed to trauma to his brain.But research by the FA and the PFA was later dropped because of what were said to be technical flaws.Astle's family has campaigned for the football authorities to launch a comprehensive research programme.His daughter Dawn said she was ""relieved"" the study eventually went ahead, and her father's case was highlighted by former England captain Alan Shearer in a BBC documentary Alan Shearer: Dementia, Football and Me.Speaking about the findings of the Field (Football's Influence on Lifelong Health and Dementia Risk) research, various stakeholders said more research was needed.FA chairman Greg Clarke said: ""The whole game must recognise this is only the start of our understanding and there are many questions that still need to be answered.""It is important the global football family now unites to find the answers and provide a greater understanding of this complex issue. The FA is committed to doing all it can to make that happen.""PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor added: ""Research must continue to answer more specific questions about what needs to be done to identify and reduce risk factors.""""It is important world football takes a lead on this to ensure the appropriate action to such a complex matter,"" said Scottish FA president Rod Petrie.Scottish FA chief executive Ian Maxwell added that the organisation ""will also consider any implications for the grassroots game"".Brain injury charity Headway said further research should focus on modern lightweight footballs.""We welcome the work done by Dr Stewart and his team, but this study was always going to leave a lot of questions unanswered.""We have known for some time there is a link between the cumulative effect of repeated blows to the head - such as those suffered by boxers - and degenerative neurological conditions such as dementia.""The fact this long-awaited study has now identified a link in former footballers will no doubt lead to questions about how this will impact the modern game.""It is vital this research is now built upon, with a particular focus on the relative risks of heading lightweight modern footballs."""

They'll return to Belgium on Monday but will take a little bit of Goodison Park with them.Football tourism is a booming industry and there is currently no hotter destination than the Premier League.The most recent study of the economic and social impact of England's top-flight, conducted by EY for the 2016-17 season, showed 686,000 people came to the country for the purpose of visiting one of its clubs and spent £555m during their stay - numbers that will surely only be boosted by English sides' recent European success.Having this year confirmed the Premier League's power as a driver of inbound tourism via its own study, it is no surprise to find VisitBritain's website prominently offering visitors the chance to plan a football pilgrimage.For most, the trip is a labour of love.Every week, hundreds of official supporters' group members travel to England - some regulars, others embracing the rare opportunity to see their side in the flesh.Most groups will have an arrangement with their Premier League club for a set amount of tickets over the year to share among their members, with some larger groups possessing a small number of season tickets.They are the loyalists - committed overseas fans, who possess all of the knowledge and fervour of their English peers, just not the geographical fortune.They also stand in stark contradiction to the stereotype of overseas fans with a half and half scarf wrapped round their neck and no true affinity in their heart.There's Ryan Hayman, chairman of the 1,500-strong Boston Spurs, who helps cater for Tottenham fans across New England and whose own five expensive and lengthy journeys to England have included seeing his side beat Leicester 5-4, face north London rivals Arsenal and witness the opening of the new White Hart Lane in person.The New York Blues, whose founding members have been attending Chelsea games since before 1990, had one of its 250 members at every home game last season.""We have had members support them on the Continent from Baku to Moscow, Barcelona to Munich, as well as throughout England, from title-clinching goals at West Brom to providing many people with their first London experience,"" they told BBC Sport.There's Thanos Oktoratos, secretary of the Greek official supporters branch for Manchester United in Athens, his fellow Red Devil, Dr Souyma Dasgupta of the Kolkata club, Jeffrey Werner, secretary of Arsenal America, the Zhengzhou Cityzens, Aussie Hammers, IndoEvertonians and many, many more.The South Africa branch of the Manchester United supporters' club have four season tickets but have arranged for larger parties to attend the final game of the season since 1998.Secretary Ethel Sleith told BBC Sport: ""A few years ago I had a call from a man whose father had been on the club trip just a few weeks prior.""He told me that his father had died suddenly, and thanked me for affording him the opportunity of fulfilling his dream.""There are a multitude of other reasons people are drawn to Premier League games - the speed, excitement and atmosphere or the fact games are now entertainment events akin to going to the theatre or a concert.Some are driven less by their passion for a club and more by their affinity or admiration for a specific player - something Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus have benefitted from through the desire to witness Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the greatest players of their (and possibly any) generation.Two other Belgians, Edgar and Thomas, made their way over for the Everton v Man City game, but their reason was a lot more specific - their compatriot Kevin de Bruyne.""We both follow City because of Kevin, and before that Vincent Kompany as well,"" explains Thomas. ""There is a lot of pride back in Belgium about how well they are doing. We are a small country and at the moment we have some very good players in the Premier League.""""I am a big diehard fan of City since Vincent Kompany came here,"" adds Edgar. ""We don't really have a Belgian team that we support as football at home is not as entertaining as the Premier League. The atmosphere here is great.""Premier League clubs are wise to the global popularity of their product and the opportunities in front of them.England's top division is broadcast to 212 territories and an audience in the billions.What we currently have is a battle for territory amongst the league's top sides as illustrated by the destination of the 'big six' on their pre-season tours: Arsenal and Liverpool (United States), Chelsea (Japan), Manchester City (China and Japan), Manchester United (Australia, Singapore and China) and Tottenham (Singapore and China).Within this, there are areas of particular appeal to certain clubs.Tottenham are savvy to their increased status in South Korea, having appointed a brand management company in 2016 to help them capitalise on their growing popularity in the country as a result of their forward Son Heung-min.But the most ambitious are after the world.Manchester City's parent company, the City Football Group, have seven clubs and 12 offices in key markets across the world, as part of a plan to transport the club from Greater Manchester to the globe - a process referred to by sports business consultants as ""glocalisation"".Authenticity is a key word. City have nine international websites and social media accounts in 13 languages, including Thai, Indonesian, Mandarin, Spanish and Portuguese, which they are ""constantly temperature checking"" to make them relevant to their intended market, in part through locally based content producers.Like many clubs, they also stage fan engagement activities around the world, including match day screenings, pre-season tours, friendlies and community projects. The club are currently midway through a global tour, visiting 12 countries with the six pieces of silverware they won last season, and hosting fan events featuring ex-players Paul Dickov, Micah Richards and Shaun Wright-Phillips.And it is not just the clubs coining it in.Independent merchandise sellers at grounds have been quick to respond to the desires of overseas fans, including the increased stocking of those divisive half and half scarves.""I've been doing this for 15 years and there's definitely been an increase in football fans from overseas,"" Graham Anderson, a seller outside Goodison Park, tells BBC Sport.""Whether it is Everton or Liverpool at home they come to see the city - that's a big sell for them - and even if they are not going to watch the actual game they come to check out the stalls and soak up the atmosphere.""They come from all over. We get lots from Iceland and America while badges and the scarves are popular with fans from China and Japan.""We don't get the locals buying the half and half scarves and they do cause quite a bit of upset among fans but I find the overseas fans like to buy them to mark the game they've come to see. It's not always easy or affordable to travel over so they want to mark it.""So why is the notion of the ""football tourist"" such an anathema to some fans?The big issue is that demand for tickets often outstrips supply at Premier League clubs, even those with the biggest grounds. Loyal fans fear they will be forced out by casual visitors, who possess no real connection to the club but possess deeper pockets and a bucket list to tick off.Liverpool is a club with a strong global following, based in a city that attracts many tourists, some of whom will be drawn to Anfield less out of love or loyalty and more the chance to say they had sampled its famed atmosphere.""For me, one of Liverpool's greatest strengths comes from not just having a global fanbase, but how much effort those fans expend in engaging in the local culture and matchday customs,"" Paul Machin, host of Redmen TV, told BBC Sport.""Any issue with 'Football Tourism' comes from people who are perhaps on a holiday to Liverpool, have no affinity with the club or interest in the matchday culture and treat a day at the match as a line on a tick list of things to do, like visiting the Beatle Story, or going on a Ferry Across the Mersey.""When hardcore fans (whether local or otherwise) are not able to get to games, yet casual tourists (who often can afford to pay well over the odds) get those seats, it causes friction.""For clubs, it is about balance - catering for as many people as possible, spreading the word and selling shirts but respecting and rewarding their loyal base.Lizzi Doyle, another Liverpool fan and producer of the Anfield Wrap podcast, told BBC Sport: ""On one part, Liverpool is one of the biggest clubs in the world and that comes with global supporters.""It's because of these supporters that we are as renowned as we are, and I love seeing the pre-season tours in America, Asia and Australia, with fully sold out stadiums. It makes me prouder to be from Liverpool and supporting this wonderful club.""Clubs have a big responsibility to local and match-going fans and it has to go beyond money and needs to be about loyalty in this ever-changing world of modern football.""They are the lifeblood. If it weren't for their dads, grandfathers, great grandmothers, etc, introducing this way of life to them, Anfield wouldn't have the famous atmosphere it does now, which attracts overseas fans and makes us the global club we are.""We couldn't be Liverpool FC without either sets of fans.""Additional reporting by Chris Bevan and Gary Rose."

To pull on the green shirt of Northern Ireland filled me with bursting pride.""Having made his debut in June 2005, McAuley's finest moment in a Northern Ireland shirt came when he scored the first goal in his country's 2-0 win over Ukraine at the Euro 2016 finals in France.His back-post header from an Oliver Norwood free-kick in Lyon helped Michael O'Neill's side go on to qualify for the knock-out stages in what was their first major finals in 30 years.After three years in the youth and reserve ranks at Linfield, the Larne-born defender joined Belfast rivals Crusaders before moving on to Coleraine.He won an Irish Cup with the Bannsiders and in 2004 earned a move into full-time football with Lincoln City.His career continued to rise when Leicester City signed him in 2006 and he joined Ipswich Town two years later before signing for West Bromwich Albion in 2011.He made 203 appearances during seven years at the Baggies, scoring 15 goals, before finishing his career at Rangers, the club he supported as a boy.""It's been a dream, a privilege and an honour to represent so many great clubs and work under managers and coaches who helped mould my career,"" McAuley continued.""From Lincoln to Leicester, to Ipswich and then West Brom, I fulfilled my ambition of playing in the Premier League.""Now I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife Fran, my son Bobby and daughter Alexis, and enjoying some of the things I've missed out on down the years."""

It wasn't even remotely the quality, the expectation and value system that we expect of Rangers.""So I gave [women's football manager] Amy McDonald assurances that we want to see Rangers women's team being the best team in Scotland and we want them competing in Europe.""Rangers reached the Scottish Cup final in 2009 and 2010 and were runners up in the SWPL in 2014, but have yet to win a major title.However King hopes he can lay the foundations for future league titles and European participation before standing down next year.""We've given them a mandate in terms of player recruitment.

"Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt's so high that in winter it becomes a ski run and so remote that the pre-match journey has to be done by two cable cars.It's remarkable the Ottmar Hitzfeld Stadium even exists at all.The pitch is perched 2,000 metres above sea level, surrounded by peaks twice that high, in the Swiss Alps close to the resort of Zermatt.""It is the most beautiful place you can play football,"" says FC Gspon defender Diego Abgottspon, who has played here for 18 years.""You see the mountains, the glaciers, the trees - it is fantastic.""FC Gspon are an amateur team who play in the Swiss Mountain League and they proudly call their home ground the highest football stadium in Europe.The village of Gspon - inaccessible by road - is made up of around 70 wooden chalets and in winter becomes a small ski resort. The air is thin and breathing can be more difficult than at your usual football ground.""We are used to it,"" says Abgottspon, who plays for the club around being a ski instructor turned salesman.""For the opponents it is harder. If we are 5-0 down at half-time we know we can come back and win.""We are a team that is extremely strong in our home town.""The artificial pitch, smaller than your standard size because of the unsurprising lack of flat land, was built in 2009, 35 years after the club was formed.The reasons for wanting to play here are clear, but it is not without its downsides.A large net spans one side of the pitch and while it stops the ball disappearing down the mountainside most of the time, accidents can happen.The estimation is the club has lost 1,000 balls in 40 years.""Most of the time the balls travel about 100 metres down the hill - sometimes they're 200 or 300 metres further down,"" says defender Alfons Brigger.""Sometimes there are games when you won't lose any balls or maybe one, then there are others when 10 balls go out and before our next training we have to go down there and look for them.""It's quite annoying.""From October onwards the pitch is covered by thick snow - that is until the worst kind of pre-season training begins in late spring.""We have to clear the pitch because up here it doesn't melt so good,"" Brigger says. ""We have to put it all to the side of the pitch. That is the players' job.""Normally there is half a metre on the pitch and we have to get it all off.""It is really annoying and hard work.""Crowds at FC Gspon games range from as low as three or four in extreme weather to 40 or 50 in the height of summer, with spectators coming from Gspon or Staldenried, the larger, more developed village at the start of the five-minute cable ride below.""Every time it is good weather it is really special to play here,"" says captain and midfielder Sebastian Furrer.""My father also played here. I used to come up and watch him play and it is nice to be able to play where he played. It is a very special place.""The stadium is named after German former Switzerland and Bayern Munich manager Ottmar Hitzfeld, who took the ceremonial opening kick-off when it hosted the inaugural European Mountain Village Championship in 2008.The tournament runs alongside the conventional European Championship every four years, with ""mountain teams"" representing nations from across the continent, and will return to Gspon in 2020.Almost all who visit leave stunned by the ground's beauty.""It is your hometown and it makes you proud that a lot of people think it is beautiful,"" Brigger says.

""Fifa can then enforce such bans at a worldwide level.""The UK government has written to Uefa to demand more action.""There were times, not long ago, when the football family thought that the scourge of racism was a distant memory. The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent.""The rise of nationalism across the continent has fuelled some unacceptable behaviour and some have taken it upon themselves to think that a football crowd is the right place to give voice to their appalling views.""As a governing body, I know we are not going to win any popularity contests. But some of the views expressed about Uefa's approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark.""Uefa, in close cooperation with the Fare network (Football Against Racism Europe), instituted the three-stage protocol for identifying and tackling racist behaviour during games.""Uefa's sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches. The minimum sanction is a partial closure of the stadium - a move which costs the hosts at least hundreds of thousands in lost revenue and attaches a stigma to their supporters.""Uefa is the only football body to ban a player for ten matches for racist behaviour - the most severe punishment level in the game. Believe me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football. We cannot afford to be content with this; we must always strive to strengthen our resolve.""More broadly, the football family - everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans - needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.""Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments too need to do more in this area. Only by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.""Uefa also charged Bulgaria with throwing objects and showing replays on a giant screen.England were also charged with providing an insufficient number of stewards. No date has been set for a hearing.Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov said after the match that he ""did not hear"" any racist chanting.The Vasil Levski Stadium was already partially closed for the match after Bulgaria were sanctioned for racist behaviour during qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic.After making a pass in the first half, Mings glanced over his shoulder and could be heard calling towards the touchline: ""Did you hear that?""The game was stopped in the 28th minute and a stadium announcement was made to condemn racist abuse and warn fans that the game could be abandoned if it continued.The game resumed but was stopped again just before half-time.

sport	Fantasy football tips: Is Aubameyang the man for gameweek eight?	Aubameyang to pick off the CherriesBack Vardy for Rodgers' Anfield return?What to do about De Bruyne?Back West Ham?Other things to consider...	"Flying high? Or just one more bad week away from throwing in the towel for another season?With another international break just around the corner, it's perhaps time to keep cool and avoid any rash decisions before two weeks of inevitable fantasy football contemplation and re-evaluation.So, is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the man? Who should you back for Brendan Rodgers' Anfield return? And what to do about Kevin de Bruyne?Here, BBC Sport tries to help you pick your team for gameweek eight.Pep Guardiola's infamous rotation tendencies caused more chaos for fantasy managers last weekend, as the Premier League's top scorer Sergio Aguero took his turn on the bench.It's an issue that is set to repeatedly sting us throughout the season - so where else might we turn to if the unpredictability all gets too much?Step forward, Aubameyang.Arsenal have a 100% home record against Sunday's opponents Bournemouth - while Eddie Howe's visitors have been hit for five in each of their past three visits to London by Crystal Palace, Arsenal and Tottenham.Even more ominous for a Cherries side yet to keep a Premier League clean sheet in 2019-20 is that Aubameyang loves playing on Sundays.Like, he seriously loves Sundays.While his record of eight goals in his last six Premier League games played on a Sunday is impressive enough, incredibly, 26 of his 39 Premier League goals to date have come on that day. That's the highest ratio of goals scored on that day in the competition's history (among players with at least 20 goals).Five goals in his last four in the league, paired with Arsenal's rather favourable upcoming fixtures, make Aubameyang - on paper, of course - an excellent alternative for the armband.Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Fantasy 606 podcast, Statman Dave said: ""This season Kevin de Bruyne is getting the points but he isn't guaranteed to start every week. Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero have scored 38% of City's Premier League goals under Pep Guardiola, so you need to have one of them or both - but they play fewer minutes compared to Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Aubameyang and Harry Kane. To win the Golden Boot you need those minutes.Chris Sutton added: ""The Man City thing is frustrating. It will be interesting to see if De Bruyne is available for the weekend but it appears that one of Sterling, De Bruyne or Aguero gets rested. My dilemma is Kane or Aubameyang, a Virgil van Dijk hat-trick or John McGinn, who is on fire.""Brendan Rodgers' Leicester City were mightily impressive in their thumping win over Newcastle last time out. But can they continue that form as Rodgers visits Anfield for the first time since his sacking in October 2015?Jamie Vardy is among the Foxes' assets in high demand following that display - despite immediately coming up against the league leaders - and there appears to be at least a sprinkle of method in that madness.In addition to his prolific 14 goals in 17 appearances under Rodgers, a meeting with Liverpool certainly draws the best from Vardy. His seven top-flight goals against the Reds is a record bettered only by Andrew Cole (11) and Thierry Henry (8) in the competition.In fact, the challenge posed by the 'top six' sides more generally is one he relishes. Only Aguero (118) has a better minutes per goal ratio against the 'big six' in the league than Vardy (150) since the start of 2010-11.That might have something to do with Vardy's expected goals (xG) data - which suggests he, along with Aubameyang, only needs to be handed half a chance to convert.Admittedly, it's a bold call to invest in a striker facing a side still boasting a 100% record this term, unbeaten in their last 43 home league games, and on the second longest unbeaten run in top-flight history.But risk equals reward, right? Besides, it was Leicester who ended Liverpool's previous best unbeaten run of 63 in 1980, which is totally relevant.Not Kevin. Anybody but Kevin.Just when you think it's safe to relax in this game, you are quickly reminded otherwise.The current highest points scorer in the Premier League's official version, Manchester City's Belgian playmaker has only failed to deliver attacking returns once this season - and that came when he was benched in City's shock 3-2 defeat by Norwich. Coincidence?But a groin injury sustained in his side's victory over Everton last weekend kept De Bruyne out of City's midweek 2-0 Champions League win against Dinamo Zagreb - and Guardiola admitted he's unsure whether he will return in time for Wolves on Sunday.""We will see for Sunday. Right now, I don't know. Maybe he can get fit. We will see. After the international break he will be ready,"" said Guardiola.So, in a worst-case scenario, who should you select to replace him if you choose to do so?No other midfielder can compete with De Bruyne's nine assists - indeed his team-mates David Silva and Riyad Mahrez are his closest midfield competitors with five each.In terms of chances created from midfield, Everton's Gylfi Sigurdsson leads the chase - although he has made just one assist so far.Perhaps the greatest prospect of a short-term De Bruyne fix is Norwich's Emiliano Buendia, who sits tied third for chances created but crucially has registered four assists compared to the two of Jack Grealish and Manuel Lanzini - and just one for Pascal Gross.Other notable midfield creators include Burnley's Dwight McNeil, Tottenham's Heung-min Son and West Ham's Felipe Anderson - all of whom have three assists in their seven games so far.Searching desperately for a differential to make up ground in your mini-leagues?Selected by less than 4% in the Premier League's version of the game and a cut-price option, it might be time to bring in Andriy Yarmolenko.Following their opening defeat by Manchester City, West Ham are unbeaten in six league games and Yarmolenko has been prominent with three goals in his last four.With a promising run of fixtures up until the end of November too, expect a rush to buy the Ukrainian if he adds his fourth of the campaign against Crystal Palace.Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, three clean sheets in four games also calls for a look at the likes of Aaron Cresswell - who has complimented his shut-outs with two strikes in successive games to scoop plenty of bonus points. A true fantasy football dream.Need further persuading to add West Ham assets?Manuel Pellegrini has won all four of his previous home Premier League games against Palace, by an aggregate score of 11-2.All information is correct at 22:00 BST on Thursday night"

""There are sites elsewhere that we're really, really loathed to explore.""But if that's the future of the football club and what's in the best interests of giving these fans what they deserve - a 21st-century stadium - then we have to look at it.""We really want to stay at Fratton Park and hopefully we can galvanise support with our plans and build for the future."""
sport	Dario Gradi retires from Crewe Alexandra director of football and board roles	Crewe's rise under Gradi	"Dario Gradi has retired from his position as director of football and from his role on the board of League Two side Crewe Alexandra.The 78-year-old took charge of 1,359 games during three spells as manager between 1983 and 2007, guiding Crewe to four promotions, including twice guiding them into the second tier.Gradi was suspended in 2016 pending a Football Association investigation into child sex abuse allegations. He denied any wrongdoing and appealed against the ban.His suspension related to claims that he ""smoothed over"" a complaint of sexual assault against Chelsea chief scout Eddie Heath in the 1970s, when Gradi was assistant manager.He has also always denied having any knowledge of the crimes of convicted paedophile Barry Bennell, who is serving a 31-year sentence for abusing boys while a coach at Crewe in the 1980s, when Gradi was manager of the club.After spells in charge of Wimbledon and Crystal Palace, Milan-born Gradi joined Crewe in June 1983, with the club in the Fourth Division.He led them up the football pyramid, winning promotion to the second tier in both 1997 and 2003, and guiding them to 11th place in the Championship in 1998 - the highest finish in the club's history.That year, Gradi was awarded an MBE for his services to football and he was honoured by the Football League in 2011 for his 'Outstanding Contribution To League Football'.He was responsible for launching the careers of a number of players who went on to play in the top flight and earn international caps, including Neil Lennon, Seth Johnson, Rob Jones, Danny Murphy, David Platt, Robbie Savage and Geoff Thomas.""[We] would like to thank Dario for his outstanding 36 years of service,"" said a Crewe statement.""We are pleased to know that he would be happy to continue to assist the club's senior coaching staff."""

sport	Robert Lewandowski: Is Bayern Munich striker on course to break Lionel Messi's record?	Could Lewandowski break Messi's record?What has changed this season? 'A new Lewandowski'	"Robert Lewandowski has had a brilliant start to the season, scoring the quickest quadruple in Champions League history and more Bundesliga goals than five of its clubs.The Bayern Munich striker took 14 minutes and 31 seconds to score four goals against Red Star Belgrade on Tuesday, taking his impressive tally for the season to 27 goals in 20 appearances.The Poland international scored in 13 consecutive matches in all competitions for the German champions from August to October, failing to find the net only twice since the German Super Cup final defeat by his former club Borussia Dortmund on 3 August.He is the top scorer in Europe's top five leagues, with his nearest competitor 10 goals behind.He said after this week's quadruple he is ""addicted to scoring goals"" - and now the 31-year-old will have his eye on Lionel Messi's record for most goals in a single season.It is not even December and Lewandowski is well on his way to beating his previous best in a single season - the 43 he managed for Bayern in 2016-17.But his form this term means he may well have his sights set on Barcelona captain Messi's record tally of 73, set in 2011-12.He has more goals at this stage than the five-times Ballon d'Or winner did that year - 27 compared to Messi's 25.The Argentine went on to make 60 appearances as Barca won the Copa del Rey and the Club World Cup, despite falling short to Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid in La Liga and being knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea in the semi-final.Bayern still have 22 league games to play, with potentially six matches remaining in the German Cup and another eight in the Champions League, should they reach the final of both competitions.That would take Lewandowski's tally to 56 matches.So, to equal Messi's record, he just needs the small matter of 46 goals in a potential 36 games - that's a rate of 1.28 goals per game. His current scoring rate? 1.35.""He shoots on goal more than any other player in Europe,"" European football expert Guillem Balague told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily Podcast.""Obviously he will score with Bayern, especially when he is the main force, and his goal tally is unbelievable - but it still won't reach the record of 73 for Messi.""Here's how Lewandowski's record this season compares with Europe's other leading scorers:Defending champions Bayern are third in the Bundesliga after a mixed start to the season, which included the sacking of manager Niko Kovac.But Lewandowski's performances have been remarkably consistent and German football journalist Raphael Honigstein says the Pole - whose attitude was questioned in previous seasons as reports linked him with a ""dream"" move to Real Madrid - has now ""completely bought into the side"".""It is quite unbelievable, especially if you consider this is a Bayern Munich team that hasn't been playing well for most of the season,"" Honigstein said.""Whoever you speak to at Bayern says this is a new Lewandowski. This is no longer a guy that sits on his own looking at his phone and maybe dreaming of a move to Real Madrid and putting pressure on the club to release him.""He stays behind to train with some of the young strikers and helps them with their finishing. He helps players on the pitch, he no longer shakes his head when a cross doesn't come his way and he must be one of the very few strikers who have started scoring more goals by being less selfish, and it's a remarkable transformation.""I do not think there is an argument against him being the best number nine in Europe right now. The closest he has as a real competitor is Harry Kane.""Those comments are echoed by Balague, who says the striker's new contract at Bayern has helped him to focus on his career in Germany.""I'm sure it is to do with focus,"" Balague added. ""For a long time he has pushed to try and get into Real Madrid. He even changed his agent.""We spoke to him last season and he seems still very engaged in trying to improve. He is 31 now, he was 30 last year, and he was talking about still working hard and things he would like to react to better.""He reacted badly to mistakes in the past, but they do not mean anything to him now, and they are just obstacles to beat."""

"A World Cup Golden Boot winner with 130 Premier League goals, the PFA Young Player of the Year averaging a goal or assist every 103 minutes in the top flight and one of European football's brightest young talents.Is there a better front three in world football at the moment than Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho?""They're as exciting as anything,"" was manager Gareth Southgate's assessment of England's attacking options after beating Bulgaria last month.Kane, Sterling and Sancho have scored or assisted 120 goals between them in the Premier League, Bundesliga and for England since the start of last season. Can anyone else in the world piece together a better three-man strikeforce?Chart shows combined goals and assists in league games and internationals for three chosen players per country from the start of the 2018-19 season to Tuesday, 8 October 2019.This is not an exact science, with team selections and formations making a direct comparison tricky. But we've picked a front three for each nation in the top 10 of the Fifa rankings and you can vote at the bottom for the best.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSouthgate took England to the World Cup semi-finals last summer playing a back three with Kane and Sterling up front. But he has since changed to a front three, with Borussia Dortmund's Sancho replacing Manchester United's Marcus Rashford for the 5-3 win against Kosovo, their most recent game. Those three now appear to be the manager's first-choice attack.No other team in Europe can beat England's haul of 19 goals in Euro 2020 qualifying going into this week's internationals - they are level with Belgium and France.Sterling has outscored Kane for club and country over the past 14 months - with eight goals for England in his last nine appearances. His 12 goal involvements (goals and assists) are the most since the start of last season for any player we looked at across the top 10 countries in the world.Sancho scored twice against Kosovo - his first international goals - and is by far the most creative player available to Southgate. His 19 league assists are nearly double the next best - Sterling - while his 132 completed dribbles put him 37 clear of the Manchester City man.Kane (26), Sterling (24) and Sancho (19) all have age on their side as well. At an average age of 23 years and 198 days they are the youngest trio - by around two years - of any of the strikeforces we looked at.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBelgium are the number-one ranked side in the world so it's perhaps no surprise that their attacking options are rich and varied. Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne has played on the right of their front three at times - but he's being discounted as he prefers to play deeper and does when everyone is fit.Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens and Romelu Lukaku have started the most internationals since the start of last season so they get the nod for us.Hazard has had his injury problems since leaving Chelsea last summer but he remains a world-class attacker - no other player we looked at has created more chances since the start of last season. Lukaku may have endured a poor final season at Manchester United - and he doesn't create much for those around him - but he knows where the goal is.He averages a goal every 58 minutes for Belgium over the past 14 months. No other player on our long list has scored more international goals in that period than his nine.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWorld Cup holders and ranked number two in the world - France may have the best strength in depth in world football at the moment. Somewhere in the offices of L'Equipe someone may have put Monaco striker Wissam Ben Yedder in their version of this piece ahead of Olivier Giroud et voila - France would be top of the shop when it comes to the stats.But Giroud - despite barely playing for Chelsea in the Premier League - remains first choice for Les Bleus, starting 11 internationals since August 2018. In fact, of all the forwards we looked at only team-mate Antoine Griezmann and Brazil's Roberto Firmino have started more in that time.Paris St-Germain's Kylian Mbappe shone at the World Cup and remains a phenomenal talent. Not even Lionel Messi can match his league record of a goal every 77 minutes.Media playback is not supported on this deviceLove him or loathe him, Neymar remains the main man for Brazil when fit. He missed a lot of games last season with a foot injury but still weighed in with nearly a goal per game for Paris St-Germain in the French league, and he won his 100th international cap against Senegal on Thursday. He has 61 goals for his country - only behind Ronaldo and Pele on the all-time list. Since the start of last season he has seven assists for Brazil - more than any other forward we analysed for these top 10 nations.Who should play alongside Neymar? Liverpool's own Roberto Firmino has started 15 times for Brazil in the past 14 months, with Gabriel Jesus of Manchester City and Richarlison of Everton sharing the third spot most often. Jesus gets the nod for us as he has scored eight goals in that time compared to Richarlison's six. Hard lines.Media playback is not supported on this deviceHe may be 34 but Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 93 goals for Portugal and shows no sign of slowing down.Portugal have tended to play the two Silvas either side of Ronaldo - Manchester City's Bernardo and AC Milan's Andre - over the past 12 months. Andre Silva may have been packed off on loan to clubs in Spain and Germany but remains a key man for his country. He's actually played more games for Portugal than Ronaldo since the start of last season.Bernardo Silva is more of a midfielder but often plays wide right of a front three and has five assists in his past 10 caps.Atletico Madrid paid £113m for teenager Joao Felix this summer and he started Portugal's last match - but he has yet to score for his country in three appearances.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWe are shoehorning a bit here - Uruguay played a pretty rigid 4-4-2 in the Copa America this summer with Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani a regimented pairing. Those two and former Middlesbrough man Cristhian Stuani are the go-to men but are all 32 years old - suggesting a bit of a rebuild is in order.Old but gold - the trio remain lethal at league level. Cavani is Paris St-Germain's all-time leading goalscorer and his shots on target to goals record is frankly ridiculous in Ligue 1. They go in the stands or in the net.Suarez remains a focal point for Barcelona and is the creative one of this trio. On top of the chances he lays on at the Nou Camp, the former Liverpool man has created more chances for Uruguay (13) than the other two combined.Spain's attack is in a state of transition. Arsenal midfielder Dani Ceballos started in a front three last month against Romania while Suso, Mikel Oyarzabal and Isco have all played in attack in recent matches.We've gone with goalscorers who have started at least five internationals in the last year - Atletico Madrid's Alvaro Morata, Rodrigo of Valencia and Iago Aspas of Celta Vigo. Aspas and Rodrigo started both games against England in last year's Nations League.Media playback is not supported on this deviceProblems here - Croatia only really play one up front and former Leicester man Andrej Kramaric is out with an injury at the moment. Bruno Petkovic is the next cab off the rank - he's scored twice in five appearances for the World Cup finalists recently. However, as he plays in his homeland for Dinamo Zagreb - not in one of Europe's 'big' leagues - we don't have detailed data for his league achievements, though he has scored 20 goals in 43 games for club and country.Another team facing a transitional period up front, with 33-year-old Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez not in the current squad but starters at summer's Copa America. Falcao is injured at the moment as well.Duvan Zapata was outstanding for Atalanta last season and deserves his place in our trio.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAnd then there is Messi.The great one continues to be an enigma on the international stage, playing in the Copa America this year alongside Sergio Aguero and Paulo Dybala but suspended since he was sent off against Chile. He's already retired from the international scene once.Look at his numbers for Barcelona though - 37 goals, 91 shots on target, 97 chances created. Despite often dropping deep to get on the ball he had more shots on target in the league than any other player we looked at, and only Hazard created more chances. Mbappe (34) was the only other man to score more than 30 league goals in the same period.Dybala misses out on our selection because a) he's only scored six league goals for Juventus in 35 appearances, and b) Lautaro Martinez has scored nine goals in 10 starts for his country.You've seen the data, and no doubt disagree with some of our selections.Time to vote.If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote."

sport	Rangers: Alfredo Morelos 'was hurting own people' - Steven Gerrard		"Striker Alfredo Morelos has recognised last season's poor disciplinary record was ""hurting his own people"", says Rangers boss Steven Gerrard.Despite netting 31 goals, the striker was sent off five times, albeit one red card was rescinded.This term, the Colombian has not been dismissed, while his prolific form has continued with 24 goals in 28 games.""Alfredo needs to keep doing what he is doing,"" Gerrard said after Morelos' double in a 2-2 draw with Feyenoord.""He has realised over the summer and maybe even the back end of last year, that the only people he is hurting is his own people with his disciplinary record.""He is the one who is behaving and performing at the moment and long may it continue because he can go on and break many more records if he continues to do that.""Two fine Morelos headers earned Rangers a point in Rotterdam that moved them top of Europa League Group G and within touching distance of the last 32 for the first time since 2010-11.In netting at De Kuip, the Colombia forward became the first Rangers player to score in four consecutive European games.And his continental tally of 13 is one above the previous best by a Scotland-based player, set by Henrik Larsson during Celtic's run to the Uefa Cup final in 2003.""Alfredo is very much a person who is... I don't know, how do you describe him? He is a difficult one to work out but what you can say and you can't take away from him is that he loves playing football,"" Gerrard said of the 23-year-old.""You can't get him off the training ground and he hates getting rested, hates coming off the pitch and that gives me confidence that he will continue to be a top player for many years.""If you love the game the way he does, it wouldn't surprise me if he goes on to become a regular for Colombia, continues to get international goals and scores many goals here or wherever else he goes."""
sport	Euro 2020: Temporary concussion subs could be introduced for next year's finals		"Temporary concussion substitutions could be introduced for the first time at the Euro 2020 finals.The proposal to replace players if they are suspected of being concussed is on the agenda for the International Football Association Board's (Ifab) annual business meeting next Tuesday.It comes after new research found former professional footballers suffer disproportionately from brain disease.A similar protocol has already been introduced in rugby union.The proposal will also be on the agenda for Ifab's annual general meeting (AGM) in February, which is where law changes could be made before a potential roll-out for Euro 2020.""The board will also continue the debate, which started during the advisory panel meeting in October, on concussion assessment - and management [of concussion] during matches at different levels of the game will be discussed,"" a statement read.Ifab is in the process of appointing a group of medical and legal experts to look into the viability of the proposal, which would give players more time to be assessed by team doctors.That group is yet to be formed - but its view on the proposal, which the players' union Fifpro is strongly in favour of, could be crucial to what Ifab decides at its AGM next year.Experts at Glasgow University found that ex-professional footballers are three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age range in the general population.The study began after claims that former West Brom striker Jeff Astle died because of repeated head trauma.The co-author of the research, Dr John MacLean, said he is ""hopeful"" that football will bring in rugby-style temporary concussion substitutions.Rugby union uses a system that allows team medics to withdraw an injured player from the pitch if they show signs of being concussed.While the injured player is off the pitch, rugby teams are able to temporarily replace them, a change which can be reversed if the substituted player is able to return to the field of play."

sport	Fantasy football tips: transfers and team selections for gameweek seven	Spurs to bounce back from Colchester?Get McGinn!How long to stick with under-performing midfielders?Other things to consider...	"Manchester City's 8-0 win over Watford last weekend was a reason to celebrate for many fans, not least those who follow Pep Guardiola's side.But won't someone spare a thought for those who captained Raheem Sterling in their fantasy football team?There will be plenty of them - sticking the little 'c' next to his name in anticipation of a big result and a rich points haul - only to find the England winger on the bench watching his team-mates fill their boots.Still it could be worse, you could have triple captained him. That would have hurt.If you're still reeling from this or just need a few hints and tips, then read on as BBC Sport tries to help you pick your team for gameweek seven.It has not been a good week for Tottenham.Mauricio Pochettino's side followed up their 2-1 league defeat at Leicester by suffered a humbling Carabao Cup penalty shootout exit at Colchester on Tuesday, after which the Argentine said he needs time to overcome the ""different agendas in the squad"".Not great to hear if you are a fantasy football manager leaning heavily on Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min or Harry Kane.Kane was missing entirely from the squad at Colchester, while Eriksen and Son came on in an attempt to win the tie in the 90 minutes, but you can be pretty certain that all three will feature in this Saturday's home Premier League game against Southampton.Tottenham's last home game brought a handsome 4-0 win over Palace and, with the players challenged to prove themselves after Tuesday's performance, there is good reason to back them.For the record, Kane has scored with eight of his 12 shots on target for Spurs against Southampton in the Premier League, scoring in each of his past five appearances against them (a run that has brought him seven goals in total).At the start of the season, there were a whole slew of decently priced midfielders with potential, including Aston Villa's John McGinn (originally valued at £5.5m in Fantasy Premier League).If you went for the Scotland international, you have been richly rewarded in the form of two assists and two goals, the latest of which came in the 3-2 defeat at Arsenal last Sunday.His price has only snuck up by £100,000, so he's still very affordable, and with games against Burnley (h), Norwich (a) and Brighton (h) coming up, he could well have more to offer in the near future.Incidentally, all 12 Premier League goals in games between Aston Villa and Burnley have been scored by British players. It is the only fixture to have been played this century to see as many as 12 goals exclusively from Britons.Jesus, you're cut. Eriksen, Alli, Moura, you're all cut. Ozil, gone. Zaha, sorry, cut.We don't all find it as easy as Homer Simpson to cut players from our team. Just think of the regret when they suddenly turn up to the party.To help you out, we've selected a handful of attacking players who you may be clinging on to but who are not delivering the goods. Perhaps it will help you decide whether to stick or twist?"

sport	Robbie Savage signs for Stockport Town in 10th tier		"This could be the most surprising signing of the season.Former Wales international Robbie Savage is set to return to playing after signing for non-league side Stockport Town in the 10th tier of English football.The 45-year-old last played for Derby in the Championship, retiring after his final game against Reading in May 2011 to pursue a career in the media.Savage, who made 623 professional appearances, came through the ranks at Manchester United and spent five years at Premier League side Leicester City, where he won the League Cup in 2000.The tough-tackling midfielder also played for Crewe, Birmingham and Blackburn, and won 39 caps for his country in a 15-year playing career.Speaking about the move on BBC Radio 5 Live 606, Savage, who is also involved with the club's owners Pro Football Academy, said he wants to help young players to get back into football after they have been released by a club.""It's not a PR stunt, it's me trying to help youngsters progress in the game,"" Savage said, after signing for the North West Counties Football League (NWCFL) First Division South side.""I want to try and give a bit of what I went through in my career with rejection, rehabilitation and the mental side of football.""I am not going to run games, I will need legs around me. My son had to go out and buy me some boots today - it's a great opportunity for me.""He then joked: ""What a great opportunity for youngsters to play with a legend like me.""Savage, who also revealed he will study for his Uefa B coaching licence, is expected to be named in the squad to face Oswestry Town on Monday.Manager Adam Jones said he is trying to ""find a blend of hungry young lads and experience"" and that there is no-one ""better placed"" than Savage.""So when he said he'd be interested in putting his boots on it was a no-brainer for me,"" Jones added.NWCFL referees could be in for a busy time with Savage's return as his tally of 89 yellow cards is the seventh highest in Premier League history."

""It's just differences, the number of games, the logistics of travelling and some of the finances are different as well.""There are some really good clubs, players, coaches and managers [in Scotland] and sometimes we don't do enough to embrace that and promote it. Coming back has emphasised that.""Having seen off St Johnstone, Motherwell and St Mirren in their past three matches, Hibs sit sixth in the Premiership and host fifth-placed Kilmarnock, three points above them, on Saturday.Ross expects striker Florian Kamberi, withdrawn during Tuesday's 2-1 victory in Paisley with a back complaint, will be fit to feature.Veteran defenders Darren McGregor and David Gray have returned to full training following long-term injury absences."

It might not please everyone, but I have to have the moral courage to look after the players.""We have amateur players who are giving their all, they're training for nine months and they don't deserve to lose the county semi-final and the chance to play in the final that way.""Lamh Dhearg forward and former Antrim star Paddy Cunningham was about to attempt to put his club 11-10 ahead in the shootout when McCavana walked on to the pitch after consulting both managers.""I heard someone in the background going 'Paddy wait, Paddy wait,' and I actually thought it was one of the Portglenone players,"" Cunningham told the Antrim GAA website.""Ciaran stepped in. He's been a wonderful chairman since he's been in and he summed it up well - it would have been difficult for any team to lose a county semi-final over free-kicks.""Portglenone scored the game's only goal when Niall McKeever pounced on slack Lamh Dhearg defending to fist the ball into the net from close range.Trailing by three points at the break, the Belfast club edged ahead before Conal Delargy kicked a fine point to force extra-time.After three further points apiece, with Cunningham kicking the pick of the bunch, the game proceeded to free-kicks.A second replay will now be arranged to see who faces holders Cargin in the decider."
sport	Best Fifa Football Awards 2019: Things you might have missed	Ronaldo and Messi's voting habitsWhere was Ronaldo?Dirty Leeds - not any moreWho did the home nations vote for?Man City not at the partyA fitting end to Milan Fashion Week	"The Best Fifa Football Awards were full of sophistication, elegance and swankiness in Milan's Teatro alla Scala.Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp came up trumps in the best men's player and best men's coach categories.United States forward Megan Rapinoe won the best women's player, with her international boss Jill Ellis claiming the women's coach award.But there was plenty going on away from the actual handing out of the prizes, from the tactics of voting beforehand to a high-profile no-show and one or two remarkable outfits.With more than 400 managers, players and media representatives voting for the best men's player (each selecting a first, second and third choice), Cristiano Ronaldo remarkably found common ground with Mauritania captain Abdoul Ba and his Eswatini counterpart Dlamini Banele.How, you may ask? Well, they were the only three people to select Netherlands defender Matthijs de Ligt as their first pick for player of the year.Was it a case of tactical voting from Ronaldo, who managed to exclude winner Lionel Messi from his top three? Or just a show of solidarity for his current Juventus team-mate?In the 2018 voting Ronaldo also omitted his old rival Messi, instead favouring former Real Madrid colleague Raphael Varane.Messi did include Ronaldo as his second pick behind Sadio Mane. The other main candidate for the men's player award, Virgil van Dijk, went with Messi ahead of his Liverpool team-mates Mohamed Salah and Mane.Speaking of Ronaldo...There was a strange moment when the Fifa Fifpro Men's Team of the Year was announced.Ten names were read out, in formation. Ten players - all present on the stage - lined up. And then the hosts moved on to the next prize.The absentee? Ronaldo, whose name was not called out but whose inclusion was confirmed by Fifa's official website.So why was the Portugal captain not there? Juventus travel to Brescia on Tuesday, just 24 hours after the glitzy ceremony and manager Maurzio Sarri has suggested Ronaldo might not feature because of muscle fatigue.Juve team-mate De Ligt did make the 60-mile journey to Milan, which is a neat stopping-off point given its location between Turin and Brescia.Messi is also due to be in action on Tuesday, a home game for Barcelona against Villarreal. His 90-minute flight home to Spain would have taken longer then Ronaldo's drive back to Turin.Whatever the reason for his absence, Ronaldo was happy enough on Tuesday evening, posting this Instagram message just as the ceremony was reaching its conclusion.""Patience and persistence are two characteristics that differentiate the professional from the amateur,"" he wrote.""Everything that is big today has started small. You can't do everything, but do everything you can to make your dreams come true. And keep in mind that after night always comes dawn.""In a year when a member of manager Marcelo Bielsa's staff was caught spying outside Derby County's training ground, a fair play award for Leeds seemed distinctly unlikely.But the Championship club and their 64-year-old manager - who called a news conference to explain his spying in meticulous detail - were rewarded following the Argentine's intervention during their game against Aston Villa at the end of last season.Mateusz Klich had scored for Leeds while Villa's Jonathan Kodjia was down seeking medical attention, with Villa's players stopping in the expectation the ball would be kicked out.Bielsa ordered his players to allow Villa to equalise immediately.The unlikely turn of events certainly surprised former England defender Micah Richards. ""That's got to be a joke!"" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live.England manager Gareth Southgate and his captain Harry Kane were almost at one with their selections. Both plumped for Messi, Ronaldo and Virgil Van Dijk, although the Tottenham forward Kane picked Van Dijk second.Scotland head coach Steve Clarke went with Van Dijk, Kylian Mbappe and Sadio Mane, with his captain Andy Robertson selecting Liverpool team-mate Van Dijk ahead of Frenkie de Jong and Mane.Wales boss Ryan Giggs went for Ronaldo, Messi and Van Dijk, while former captain Ashley Williams opted for Van Dijk, Eden Hazard and De Jong.Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill picked Van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Messi, and captain Steven Davis went for Messi, Van Dijk and Mane.While Manchester City became the first English club to win a domestic treble in 2018-19, they barely registered a mention at the awards ceremony.They had eight players shortlisted for the Fifa Fifpro Men's World11 but Raheem Sterling, Sergio Aguero and Bernardo Silva were all overlooked.So too was manager Pep Guardiola, who lost out in the best men's coach category to Klopp.Apparently recording the second-highest points tally in Premier League history - 98 - and winning three major trophies just isn't quite enough.Aside from ballet and laser light shows, there were also some remarkable outfits on display. Perfect timing given the ceremony took place on the final day of Milan Fashion Week..."

""In Italy, the situation hasn't improved.""Fiorentina's Brazilian wing-back Dalbert told the referee he had been the target of racist chanting and the Serie A match, which finished 2-2, was temporarily suspended.An announcement was read out over the public address system and the game continued.Last week, Cagliari were cleared of racist chanting towards Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku in a Serie A match.That was the third time Cagliari have been investigated for alleged racist abuse in the past two years. Previous cases involved Moise Kean, the Italy forward now at Everton, and France midfielder Blaise Matuidi, Kean's then Juventus team-mate - but no action was taken on either occasion.""Racism is combated with education, condemnation and discussion,"" added Infantino.""You need to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums. You need, as in England, the certainty of the penalty. You can't be afraid to condemn racists, we need to combat them until they stop."""
sport	Arsenal sack Unai Emery: Spanish boss wishes he could have achieved better results		"Unai Emery says he wishes he could have achieved ""better results"" for Arsenal, after being sacked by the Premier League club on Friday.The 48-year-old, who replaced Arsene Wenger in May 2018, lost his job after their longest winless run for 27 years.Arsenal are eighth in the Premier League, eight points off the top four.""Not a single day has gone by without me stopping to think about how lucky I have been to work for this club,"" Emery said in a letter to Arsenal fans.Arsenal said the decision to sack Emery had been ""taken due to results and performances not being at the level required"".The Gunners lost 2-1 at home to German side Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday.Their seven-game run is their worst without a victory since February 1992, when they were winless in eight games under George Graham.""It has been an honour to be the Arsenal head coach,"" said Spaniard Emery, who previously led Paris St-Germain to the French league title and won three Europa Leagues with Sevilla.""To all the fans, I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for helping me to understand and feel the greatness of Arsenal.""To all of you who have supported us from every corner of the globe, all of you who have come to the Emirates, all of you who have waited in the rain and cold just to greet me after a game, I would have liked nothing more than to have achieved better results for you.""Arsenal finished fifth in Emery's first season in charge at Emirates Stadium after he replaced the long-serving Wenger.The Gunners spent more than £130m in the summer after signing winger Nicolas Pepe, centre-back David Luiz, left-back Kieran Tierney, striker Gabriel Martinelli and defender William Saliba, who will join next summer, while also bringing in midfielder Dani Ceballos on loan from Real Madrid.After losing just one of their opening 11 matches, their form dipped and led to Emery facing increasing criticism and pressure.Arsenal's last Premier League victory was a 1-0 win over Bournemouth.On Saturday, they were fortunate to secure a 2-2 draw - their sixth of the season - at home to Southampton, with Alexandre Lacazette scoring an injury-time equaliser.""It has been a year and a half full of emotions, of great moments and some other more bitter ones,"" added Emery.""I want to tell all of you that I have worked with passion, with commitment and with effort."""

He knows exactly about his performance, he has a career behind him, he has been a very good player in big teams so of course he cannot be happy in the moment, but it is what has happened and he must try to improve."""
sport	The remarkable Mr Vokrri: Kosovo's football rise		"All day the word ""miracle"" kept coming up. Maybe these thousands of people spilling out into Pristina's streets have just seen another.It was September 2016 when Kosovo played their first competitive international football match.On Saturday, they extended an unbeaten run to 15 games with possibly their most significant result yet - a 2-1 home victory over the Czech Republic. It is the longest such run in Europe.Kosovo already have a very good chance of reaching Euro 2020. And their next qualifier is against England on Tuesday (19:45 BST). They are relishing the prospect.This country of about 1.8 million people campaigned for eight years before being admitted as Fifa and Uefa members in 2016. The process began immediately after its declaration of independence from Serbia in February 2008. Some countries - including Serbia - still do not recognise its right to exist.That such a young and troubled nation from the heart of the Balkans should shine on football's biggest stages was not the dream of only one man. But there is one figure who is revered here above all others - and his story helps explain the origins of this special team.He was crucial to Kosovo's campaign for recognition as a football nation, and is a hero in his country. After his death last year at the age of 57, the national team's home ground was renamed in his honour: The Fadil Vokrri Stadium.Like so many people here, Vokrri's life was marked by the war that still raged in this region only just over 20 years ago. By the bitter cycle of vengeance and counter-vengeance, and the tensions between ethnic Albanians and Serbs that still exist today.And yet Vokrri was one of very few - perhaps the only one - able to communicate across the deep divides that cost so many lives. Football was his language.When Vokrri was made president of the Football Federation of Kosovo he was starting from scratch. His offices were two rooms in a Pristina apartment block; two desks and two computers. It was 16 February 2008. Kosovo declared its independence the next day.Vokrri was in charge of an association with no money, he had a national team that didn't have the right to play any official matches, in an isolated nation with little infrastructure.What he did have was his reputation. He was the greatest footballer Kosovo produced - though that title may be challenged soon by the exciting new generation of talent that is emerging.He was charming, charismatic and convincing. He and general secretary Errol Salihu were the campaigners the country needed.""When we talked at home at this time, at the very beginning my father was thinking the process would be easy,"" says Vokrri's eldest son Gramoz, 33.""Now we are recognised as a country, it will be fast, he thought. He soon realised it would be anything but easy, but he didn't mind it that way.""Gramoz lives in Pristina now. When he was old enough, he would often accompany his father and help with his work. Like his dad, he is well known in Kosovo's capital. Conversation is interrupted every five minutes as allies and acquaintances stop to say hello. Many stay much longer. Among them are government officials, football agents, and former generals in the Kosovo Liberation Army.""My father never made a political declaration in his life and only focused on football. Football is higher than everything else - that was his vision,"" he says.""It allowed my father to help achieve our goal - of entering Uefa and Fifa.""Vokrri was an adventurous forward with two good feet. If he wasn't the most prolific goalscorer perhaps his flair and determination made amends. He was loved by the fans. They recognised in him one of their own - even when he wasn't.He grew up in Podujeva, a small city which today lies close to Kosovo's northern border with Serbia. Back then, just like the rest of Kosovo, it was part of Yugoslavia. He was born in 1960. During his childhood, Yugoslavia was a communist country made up of diverse nationalities, languages and religions, all more or less held together by its charismatic leader Josip Broz Tito.It was an age when Kosovar Albanians like Vokrri were rarely celebrated. They seldom became symbols of Yugoslav pride. But this talent was impossible to ignore.Vokrri was the first to play for Yugoslavia - and he would be the only one. His debut came in a 6-1 defeat by Scotland and scored the goal, the first of six in 12 caps between 1984 and 1987.He had started out at Llapi, his hometown club, before moving to Pristina. In 1986 he went on to Partizan Belgrade and stayed for three years - ""the most beautiful"" of his career, he said.They won the league title in 1987 and the cup in 1989. In between, Italian giants Juventus came calling - but Vokrri was forced to turn them down. He hadn't completed the then-compulsory two years' military service, and so couldn't go abroad. He completed his duties while playing for Partizan, fulfilling light tasks during the week in between matches.But leave the country he would, for reasons that were spiralling out of anyone's control.Many historians place President Tito's death as the key point in the collapse of Yugoslavia. They say he left behind a power vacuum which would be filled by resurgent rival nationalist factions.Born in 1986, Gramoz was the first of Vokrri and his wife Edita's three children. By 1989, the family had decided they could stay in Yugoslavia no longer. Vokrri settled on the idea of leaving for France. In the summer, he signed for Nimes.""At this time, everyone in Yugoslavia knew that war would happen,"" Gramoz says. ""They just didn't know when or where it would start.""Years of suffering would define the next decade. During the 1990s, Yugoslavia was plunged into a bloody conflict in which as many as 140,000 people were killed.From this fighting emerged the separate modern territories of today: Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the recently renamed North Macedonia. Kosovo was the last to declare itself an independent nation.Lulzim Berisha was 20 when he took up arms. He joined the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). It was 1998.For the previous six years he had been in Pristina, still living under Yugoslav rule but playing football in what was an unofficial Kosovan top flight set up after the establishment of a separatist shadow republic there.Matches were held on rough pitches in remote, rural locations. Fans would gather on sloping hillsides to watch. Serbian police would stop the players on the way and detain them for hours. But always somehow they managed to get word up the road for the opposition to wait. After the match, players would wash their muddy bodies in a nearby river.This football league stopped when heavy fighting began in 1998.""I decided to join the KLA because of my country,"" says Berisha. ""I had no military experience but I saw many bad things happening here. That was the reason.""There was now open conflict between Kosovo's independence fighters the KLA and Serbian police in the region. It led to a brutal crackdown. Civilians were driven from their homes. There were killings, atrocities and forced expulsions at the hands of Serb forces.The key turning point in the war came in 1999. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) had already intervened in Bosnia and it did so again in Kosovo. A 78-day bombing campaign forced Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw troops and allow international peacekeepers in. Milosevic's government collapsed a year later. He would later be held at the United Nations (UN) war crimes tribunal for genocide and other war crimes carried out in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia. In 2006, he was found dead in his cell aged 64, before his trial could be completed.After Serb forces left Kosovo in 1999, the territory remained under UN rule for nine years. About 850,000 people had fled the fighting. An estimated 13,500 people were killed or went missing, according to the Humanitarian Law Centre (HLC). The HLC, with offices in Pristina and Belgrade, continues to work on documenting the human cost of Yugoslavia's wars - including the civilian victims of Nato's bombardment.As peace returned to the region, so did many of Kosovo's refugees. Children were named after then UK prime minister Tony Blair - rendered in Albanian as one single first name: Tonibler. There is enormous gratitude in Kosovo to the countries that intervened. Nowhere is it more obvious than on Bill Clinton Boulevard in Pristina, where a giant image of the former US president looks out across the traffic below.Now 41, Berisha uses few words to describe his life as a soldier and the violence he witnessed.Today he is one of the main personalities behind the Kosovo national team's biggest fan club: Dardanet. The name means ""the Dardanians"" - the people of an ancient kingdom that ruled here.Dardanet have just opened a new cafe bar that serves as their headquarters. Opposite an old tile factory whose chimneys rise high into the sky, the call to prayer from a local mosque carries over lively conversation between the animated chain-smokers gesturing in their outside seats. The other fuels are dark black espresso coffee and conversation about football of any kind. Serie A is no longer the most passionately discussed. That would be the Premier League.Lulzim sucks sharply on his teeth as a staccato point at the end of each short sentence.""We want every kind of people to come to the stadium. Every game we give 100 tickets for free to female fans. We want families to come,"" he says.On the table next to us, a reel of tickets for the England match in Southampton is unfurled with glee. They arrived that morning. The visas to travel are through too. Lulzim explains there will be a match against an English fan club, England Fans FC, in Hounslow on Monday, before Tuesday's Euro 2020 qualifier at St Mary's.Inside, the walls are packed high with framed photos of Kosovo players, new and old. Vokrri's image is everywhere. They describe themselves as ""Children of Vokrri"". He has become an icon for the fan club. They produce banners, T-shirts and online posts that carry his image under messages such as: ""Looking down on us.""""Vokrri is a legend,"" says Berisha. ""He is our hero. For everything he did. For the people.""But pride of place in the fan club bar belongs to the match shirt worn by Valon Berisha when he scored Kosovo's first goal in official competition. That was a 1-1 draw in Finland, a 2018 World Cup qualifier played in September 2016.It was the culmination of many years' hard work. Not so long afterwards, it looked like things would only go downhill.Vokrri returned to Kosovo from France about five years after the war ended. With him at the helm, football's world governing body Fifa turned down Kosovo's first attempts towards membership in 2008. At that point the country had only been recognised by 51 of the UN's 193 member nations. It seemed a majority would be required.Instead, they continued to play unofficial matches against unrecognised states: Northern Cyprus, a team representing Monaco, a team representing the Sami people of north Norway, Sweden, Russia and Finland.The players at this time were drawn almost exclusively from the domestic pool. People who had been forced to flee their homes only a few years ago, or who had taken up arms and fought.There was another way. One that was still tantalisingly out of reach.""In 2012, when Switzerland played a match against Albania, 15 of the players on the pitch were eligible to represent Kosovo,"" Gramoz says.""My father was at the game, watching with Sepp Blatter, then the Fifa president. Mr Blatter said to my dad: 'How are you enjoying the match?'""He replied: 'It's like watching Kosovo A versus Kosovo B.'""The major step forward came in 2014, when Fifa allowed Kosovo to play friendly matches against its member nations - as long as certain conditions were met. There was still significant opposition from Serbia.Mitrovica was the location for Kosovo's first recognised friendly match. This city, with local Albanian and Serbian populations divided in two by the Ibar river, still requires the presence of Nato troops today, 20 years on from their arrival as a peacekeeping force. Oliver Ivanovic, a prominent politician seen as a moderate Kosovo Serb leader, was shot dead outside his party offices there in January 2018.Albania goalkeeper Samir Ujkani chose to accept a call-up, as did Finland international Lum Rexhepi, Norway's Ardian Gashi and Switzerland's Albert Bunjaku. The opposition were Haiti. It finished 0-0.""For us, it was a big, big victory,"" says Gramoz.""It was a clear message from Fifa. The moment they allowed us to play friendly matches we took that to mean: 'Don't stop, you will enter as full members - but we need time to prepare people.'""Even if we didn't have the right to play our national anthem, it's OK. We play football. That was the most important thing.""First of all friendly games. After that, our delegation was invited to a Uefa congress for the first time. My father went to the Ballon d'Or ceremony. We had indications that the work was going well.""In May 2016, all the determined efforts, all the canvassing and campaigning done by Vokrri and Eroll Salihu finally came to fruition. Kosovo were admitted as full members, first of Uefa, then of Fifa.""The whole country stopped. Everything,"" says Gramoz. ""After independence, it was the biggest thing that's happened in Kosovo.""People started throwing fireworks, pouring out into the streets. It was like we won the World Cup.""At the Uefa vote, there were 28 in favour and 24 against, plus two invalid votes. Serbian Football Federation president Tomislav Karadzic said the result would ""create tumult in the region and open a Pandora's box throughout Europe"". It challenged the ruling at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Uefa's decision was upheld.Now Kosovo had an official national team, it could take part in the upcoming qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup. But what would the team look like?In June 2016, at the European Championship in France, Albania and Switzerland met again.Among the Swiss side were Arsenal's Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri, now of Liverpool. Xhaka's elder brother, Taulant, played for Albania. Each of these - and several more - might have decided to switch allegiances and join the new Kosovo team.Uefa said it would consider applications to do so on a case-by-case basis. The Swiss FA released a statement complaining that Kosovo was unsettling its players. Gramoz believes Uefa's strategy was a concession to those member nations worried about losing talent.""Uefa and Fifa never said publicly that they all had the right to play - even though every application was successful,"" he says. ""It was very diplomatic.""Xhaka and Shaqiri - perhaps the two best known eligible players - decided to stay with Switzerland. For those who did make the switch, the process did not go as smoothly as planned.Five hours before kick-off in Kosovo's first competitive match, the team was still awaiting clearance for six players - including one of their most promising, Valon Berisha, who had already played 19 times for Norway.It was 5 September 2016. Eventually the clearance came through. Berisha played and scored the equaliser in a 1-1 draw in Turku on Finland's west coast. It was an encouraging start, and a hugely emotional moment for players, fans and the country.But Kosovo were beaten heavily in their next qualifier, 6-0 by Croatia - one of several home ties played in the Albanian city Shkoder. The national stadium in Pristina needed work to meet the required standards.The draw in their first match against Finland would be their only point of the campaign. Kosovo finished bottom of their group, suffering nine consecutive defeats.They had got a tough draw and, back then, perhaps it felt like just taking to the field was a victory.Now the picture is very different indeed.The day before Saturday's game there is a thunderstorm in Pristina that flashes back against the black night sky, recalling a very different time from not so long ago. Peace lives here now. Even when the rain does fall it doesn't bother the children chasing each other along the city's central street, no matter the risk to their ice creams.Down below, the stadium's floodlights are lit. Kosovo are playing the Czech Republic the next day. Something very strange is about to happen.The following morning, reports surface about arrests the police have made. Eight Czech fans were allegedly found with a drone, a Serbian flag and a banner reading ""Kosovo is Serbia"". It seems a revenge stunt was planned.In 2014, a drone flew over the Belgrade ground hosting a match between Serbia and Albania. It was carrying a banner labelling Kosovo part of ""Greater Albania"". There was outrage. A mass brawl broke out on the pitch, fans streamed in from the stands and lashed out at players. The match was abandoned and Albania were eventually awarded a 3-0 default win.Shortly after news of the arrests breaks, the Dardanet fan group responds. ""We invite prudence and restraint,"" they say. ""Any potential incident could harm Kosovo.""There is instead a happy ending.Media playback is not supported on this deviceGoing into the match, Kosovo are unbeaten in 14 games. Their last defeat was in October 2017. Six of those matches came in the inaugural Uefa Nations League, where performances have already guaranteed them a place in the play-offs for a spot at the Euro 2020 finals.Georgia, North Macedonia and Belarus are the three other teams likely to contest Kosovo's section of the play-offs. Only one of those countries recognises Kosovo - its southern neighbour North Macedonia.Uefa currently keeps Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina apart from Kosovo for security reasons, but all other countries must play them. Uefa will allow a team to request their home fixture be played on neutral territory - as happened when Ukraine and Kosovo met in Poland in a World Cup qualifier in October 2016.As for what happens should Kosovo reach Euro 2020, four of the 12 nations hosting games in next year's tournament - Azerbaijan, Romania, Russia and Spain - do not recognize Kosovo's independence either.And it is beginning to look like they will make it. They might even end up qualifying automatically.Come kick-off time, the Fadil Vokrri Stadium is packed. Tickets apparently sold out completely in 15 minutes.Men in uniform are watching the sky through binoculars from the top of a high building opposite. There are no drones in sight. On the other side, a group of children have outdone them, perched atop an unfinished tower block that stands a good 10 storeys tall. The bent steel tips of its exposed reinforced concrete stretch higher above them still.The Czechs take the lead. Arijanet Muric, the Nottingham Forest keeper on loan from Manchester City, is beaten by Patrick Schick's delicate finish inside the box.But the home fans rally their team. Their passion is raw and irresistible, and it runs through the Kosovo side and harries them forward. There are rash challenges, hurried touches at the vital moment. There is the bravery to persist, the drive to force their opponents back again and again.Kosovo's 68-year-old Swiss manager Bernard Challandes - appointed by Vokrri in March 2018 - is the only calm presence around. The whole ground is constantly carried away, including everybody who isn't Czech in the press box.Even when Vedat Muriqi gets the equaliser before half-time, Challandes keeps his cool. But when Mergim Vojvoda stabs the home team in front from a short corner there is a volcanic chain reaction of emotions: joy, pride, delight. Challandes cannot resist. The substitutes are up from the bench. The injured players who travelled to be with their team leap forward too - only a little more carefully.With the final whistle approaching, the Czech Republic fashion four good chances in about three minutes. In extremely polite English totally at odds with the situation, the Kosovan journalist next to me says: ""Phew, that was close.""Five minutes of added time. Superstition kicks in. Fenerbahce striker Muriqi - a huge presence - hauls his team up the pitch, protecting possession like he has been for what seems an eternity. Challandes is gesturing wildly now, like everyone else.And then the stadium erupts. The players hug each other. Challandes is under a mountain of tracksuited bodies. There is a long and reflective lap of victory. England are next. They cannot wait.The Dardanet members wave their banners and sing their songs. The Children of Vokrri will go home very happy tonight - eventually.When Vokrri died last June, having suffered a heart attack, his burial was marked by a special state ceremony in Pristina.""Some Serbian officials came to his funeral, including the former FA president Tomislav Karadzic. It's very rare to make a visit like that,"" Gramoz says.""Afterwards, Partizan Belgrade invited me to visit them. I went to Belgrade, and they showed me huge respect. They didn't care if I was Albanian, they told me I was part of their family, because of my father.""This is why I think, especially here in this case between Kosovo and Serbia, we should use sports and football to promote relations between the countries.""It will be a great victory for our national team the day when a Kosovan Serb lines up with us on the pitch.""Gramoz is perhaps like his father in that he likes to dream. But football can do powerful things. Here it has already done so much.Media playback is not supported on this device"

sport	Fantasy football tips: Lose Van Dijk? Who should replace Mount?	Ditch Van Dijk and switch to three at the back?Champions League toil and troubleFriday night food for thoughtBack City's slickers to get back in the grooveOther things to consider...	"Still with us? Then well done. We'll assume that means you haven't already sacked off fantasy football and have come through the first month with a vaguely competitive team.That, or you have already used your wildcard and are in last-chance-saloon territory.Either way, here we are - week six. So who to pick? Who to drop? Who to set as captain?We at BBC Sport and BBC Radio 5 Live's Fantasy 606 podcast try our best to provide the answers...Much like skinny jeans and running around parks chasing computer-generated Pokemons, football is full of fads.The craze in the Premier League right now is playing out from the back. When it works, you get better quality service to attacking players; when it doesn't, it usually ends up with egg on a defender's face (looking at you, Nicolas Otamendi).The bad news for fantasy football managers is that defenders are struggling to bag the big points so far this season. Of the top 15 scoring players after five weeks, 10 are strikers and five are midfielders.Consequently, if you haven't already done so, now may well be the time to switch to three at the back.Liverpool kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League last season with 21 but this time have managed just one in five games. Virgil van Dijk is undoubtedly an absolute beast in real life but in the world of fantasy football he is simply not keeping the clean sheets while providing enough of an attacking threat.Almost half of managers in Fantasy Premier League (49.9%) have him in their team - but now may be the time to part ways.Alternatives? Trent Alexander-Arnold is the best option from the Reds given his tendency to be involved in their attacks. He has two assists from five matches so far this season.Elsewhere, Everton's Lucas Digne appears offer good value this weekend. No defender has had more shots than Digne in the Premier League (eight), while he has chipped in with two assists in five games.Those stats, and being up against a Sheffield United defence that has kept one clean sheet this season, make him a good option as part of a three-man defence.The final place? Serge Aurier returned to the Tottenham line-up in the 4-0 win against Crystal Palace last weekend and helped himself to an assist.He was rested for the Champions League in midweek so should be raring to go this weekend. Spurs are at Leicester City - admittedly a tricky fixture - but with Southampton, Brighton and Watford to follow he could be a good longer-term option.Ah the Champions League - brilliant midweek football treat; terrible fantasy football team tormentor.The competition both makes it difficult to predict a manager's line-up for the games preceding it and provides a risk of picks being injured while playing in it.Hands up if you brought Kevin de Bruyne in for last weekend's game against Norwich? Gutted.Hands up if you brought in Mason Mount for this week? Gutted.The Chelsea forward has been in brilliant form for the Blues so far this season, but limped out of their Champions League defeat by Valencia on Tuesday with an ankle injury.""It is a big shame because Mason Mount has been a very good point scorer,"" said Statman Dave on the Fantasy 606 Podcast.""In terms of shots in the Premier League, only James Maddison as a midfielder has had the same amount as him with 16. Not only that, but one of the reasons Tammy Abraham has been so good this season is Mason Mount. The way he can drop off and turn a ball forward it makes him almost a double loss.""For this week, I will leave Mason in and bench him, see how bad the injury is and maybe take him out next week.""With Liverpool up this weekend for Chelsea, it is a tough fixture for them anyway, making it perhaps not a bad time to look at alternatives for Mount.One option to consider is Emiliano Buendia. The creative midfielder has four assists from five games for Norwich this season and was arguably man of the match in the Canaries' impressive 3-2 win against Manchester City last time out.Norwich are at Burnley this weekend and Buendia represents potentially good value for money.""I'd love to get Buendia in my team,"" Statman Dave added. ""He is a wonderful player and how he feeds Teemu Pukki is really nice - but I already have two Norwich players in my team in Pukki and Todd Cantwell. If you haven't got a Norwich player in, Buendia is a good option though.""It seems like a lot of teams have hard runs, bar Norwich.""Those sneaky Friday night games - destroyer of many a forgetful fantasy football manager's plans for their team.The good news is, you are reading this so that means you haven't forgotten that we have a Friday night fixture.Southampton and Bournemouth kick off the weekend's action (20:00 BST) and it is certainly a fixture that should not be overlooked when considering potential transfers.Callum Wilson has been on fire for the Cherries, contributing either a goal or assist in every game so far this season, and with home games against West Ham and Norwich, and an away trip to a defensively suspect Arsenal on the horizon, now could be a good time to bring in the forward.It is hard to see beyond a Manchester City player for the captaincy this week. Pep Guardiola's side face lowly Watford and will be desperate to put on a show of strength after their defeat at Norwich.They breezed to a comfortable 3-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League in midweek and are partial to a goal or five against Watford. Back in May they thrashed them 6-0 in the FA Cup final and have scored 20 goals against them in their last five meetings.Sergio Aguero has scored in every fantasy football week so far this season and will be a good bet to keep up that scoring run against the Hornets.Raheem Sterling, meanwhile, has had a bit of a lean period recently after an explosive start to the season but with seven goals against Watford in their five previous meetings, it is a toss up between him and Aguero for who would be a good shout for the armband."

Then we don't play football' will appear on scoreboards.An extra minute will be added on to injury time in the first-half.The abuse of Moreira was condemned by many Dutch international footballers including Lyon forward Memphis Depay, while Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum said the incident ""really hit me on a personal level"".During the Netherlands' 5-0 over Estonia on Tuesday, Wijnaldum and team-mate Frenkie de Jong pointed to the colour of their skin after the Liverpool star scored the first of his three goals.Den Bosch have apologised to Moreira for declaring the striker mistook ""crow sounds"" for racist abuse during the Dutch second division match.The referee brought the players off after half an hour as a result of the abuse from a section of the home fans.Dutch football authorities have opened an investigation after the incident."
sport	Tokyo 2020: Russia's Olympic Committee confident athletes will compete under own flag		"Russia's Olympic Committee says it will do ""everything in its power"" for Russian athletes to compete under their own flag at Tokyo 2020 despite facing a potential ban from the Games.A World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) committee recommended on Monday that Russia be given a four-year ban from hosting and competing in major international events.It comes after the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant over inconsistencies in anti-doping data.""All our clean athletes, those who were not involved or are not suspected of doping, will take part in the Games as part of our Olympic team,"" said Stanislav Pozdnyakov, president of Russia's Olympic Committee (ROC).""And we will do everything in our power for our team to compete in Tokyo under the Russian flag.""Wada's compliance review committee (CRC) has recommended the Russian flag must not be flown at major events during the proposed four-year ban.Some Russian athletes without a history of doping who can prove they are not implicated by the inconsistencies in the data from the Moscow laboratory may be allowed to compete as neutrals.A total of 168 Russian athletes competed as neutrals at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned for state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Games in Sochi.Wada's executive committee will make a final decision on the recommendations on 9 December.The CRC also recommended that officials from the ROC and the Russian Paralympic Committee are not allowed to attend major sports events during the four years.In reply, Pozdnyakov, who won five Olympic fencing medals, said: ""We consider the measures proposed by the committee to be excessive, inappropriate and wrong.""Even if a four-year ban from sporting events comes into effect, Russia will be allowed to compete at Euro 2020 because European football's governing body Uefa is not defined as a 'major event organisation' in regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches."
sport	Gary Lineker tells football parents to 'shut up' and let children play		"Former England captain Gary Lineker says some parents are ""instilling fear"" into children who play grassroots football.Speaking to the BBC's Don't Tell Me The Score podcast, the Match of the Day presenter urged parents to ""shut up and let them play"".""I'm standing on the sidelines listening to parents shouting,"" said Lineker.""And 99.9% of what they say is wrong, damaging their children.""In November last year, the Football Association began a campaign to improve grassroots football by influencing the behaviour of new parents, volunteers, coaches and players aged between seven and 18.England manager Gareth Southgate gave his support on how football can ""develop young children into people"".Lineker, who scored 48 goals in 80 games for England from 1984 to 1992, said the attitude of some parents is damaging to their children because the football is ""too important to them"".""I've seen parents wander on to the pitch,"" he said. ""One picked up his child by the scruff of the neck and shouted 'if you play like that you'll never make the grade'.""I'm thinking 'mate, he'll never make the grade anyway, so just chill, let him enjoy his football'.""The truth is they'll reach the level they'll reach anyway. If you play football or any sport with fear, you will perform less well.""Former Leicester, Everton, Barcelona and Tottenham striker Lineker warned of the dangers of children losing their love of sport if they are pushed too hard.""What else in life can give you the massive adrenaline rush of sport?"" he said. ""There's nothing like it.""Sport is real-life drama. I know it's too important to us and we overreact in a way, but imagine being without it, without that emotion."""

sport	Maidstone United: The demise and rise of an expelled Football League club	Where was the inquest?New beginnings and finding Chris Smalling'Fans kept our heart beating'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceHomeless, two players on the books and no league to play in.This is the story of Maidstone United, the last club before Bury to be expelled from the English Football League. For the past 27 years they have been trying to return to the pinnacle of their football existence.But this is not a club that sees itself as a football tragedy - not with more than 20 trophies and eight promotions won since 1992 and an England international among its alumni.""It is a tragic episode in our story. That is what it is, because the story is still going,"" said John Still, Maidstone's head of football who returned to the club last season after 30 years away.Still says there was no ""romanticism"" in the reunion, despite them being back in the fifth tier last term, the level he left the club at in 1989 having been the boss that took them to the old Fourth Division.He simply felt his former club had run out of ""momentum"" - the sort that gets a team from Kent County League Fourth Division to the top tier of the non-league system. The 69-year-old, however, was not able to guide them to safety last season as they were relegated to the sixth tier.""For me to try to play even a small part in one day getting the club back would be fantastic,"" Still told BBC Sport. ""Our dream, 100%, is to again be a Football League club.""Maidstone were a Football League side for just three seasons and never played a game in their home town.The day after the first-ever round of Premier League fixtures - a weekend that ushered a lucrative new era for the English game - the Stones resigned their place in the league.Debts of £650,000 for a club that was ground-sharing in Dartford - having sold their home in Maidstone in the late 1980s and then failed with 47 planning applications to build their own ground - saw them unable to start life in the Third Division in 1992.The then 95-year-old club was not even the first to go out of business that year, as Aldershot went bust a season earlier.Like scenes in Bury almost three decades later, there was a sense of disbelief that a club could go under when a football gold rush was being enjoyed by others nearby.""When I first came to Maidstone it was a vibrant football club, so it was difficult to understand how a club of that size, a big non-league side at the time, with all its desire and drive found itself unable to fulfil its financial commitments,"" said Still.""I can't believe in this day and age a club can again allow that to happen.""On Thursday the future of Bury will be discussed at an English Football League meeting, with efforts being made to reinstate the club to League Two next season.The original Maidstone United, however, ceased to exist and instead a new club - linked to youth outfit Maidstone Invicta - was reformed in football's ""wilderness"" 10 tiers down in the league pyramid.Bill Williams, 77, was there as manager when the old club was condemned, helped in its resurrection and now serves as chief executive.""It was a dreadful time for the club, the supporters and the town as a whole,"" Williams told BBC Sport.For Bury, that ""dreadful"" pain prompted local MPs to petition for the Shakers to be allowed back into the EFL, while the league has commissioned an independent review of the entire saga and the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee is holding a hearing about how clubs are safeguarded.Asked if the reaction was the same when Maidstone were the second club to suffer a similar fate in the space of six months in 1992, Williams said: ""No. There was nothing like how people are coming from all directions to solve Bury's problems.""But they should be looking for a solution for clubs in dire straits - something, somewhere along the line that helps and should not be taken advantage of.""First of all, it is for all clubs to manage themselves correctly, but then the league needs to make sure they manage the clubs correctly.""It was amazingly bad management when we went out of business, and we shouldn't have - I never had a good feeling about our budgets as we were losing £500,000 a year.""We have learned how to manage a football club here because we were obviously hurt badly.""It took Maidstone 24 years to return to the town after the disastrous ground sale, moving into their Gallagher Stadium home in 2012.Before that, they survived and even thrived as football nomads - at first winning games on village greens before soon going on to collect titles on parks in nearby towns.While they were not the best of times, they were among some of the happiest.Along the way, they even helped bring through Manchester United defender Chris Smalling. In doing so, the club replicated feats of old Maidstone with European Cup-winning former England international David Sadler going from Maidstone to the Red Devils four decades earlier.""Playing on village greens was awful, but we have had some wonderful times,"" said Williams.""We are fortunate that the football club always had a good following in the town. That really played a huge part in bringing us back up the leagues because even when we went out of business we were still getting 300 or 400 people watching us 10 leagues down.""Williams talks of needing to have ""a plan and the land"" in trying to build the club.He also readily acknowledges that their greatest triumphs - building a stadium and beating Stevenage in the first round of the FA Cup in 2014 while still a seventh-tier side - were made possible by owners Oliver Ash and Terry Casey, who got involved when the club were again in financial trouble in 2010.""You need luck and we have had ours with Oliver Ash and Terry Casey,"" said Williams.Having those with ""money to throw in"" is vital, Still agrees, but for as much as he sees the demise and rise of the club as a tale of football economics, he feels they are a side who only survived thanks to the passion, commitment and vision of those who supported them.""A football club with supporters is a living thing - the people who have vowed to take this on have to be the heartbeat of the club,"" added Still."

sport	Fantasy football tips: Liverpool, Manuel Lanzini, Sheffield United, Watford	Liverpool players... obviouslyManuel the magnificent?Sheffield United shutout?Are Watford back in the game?Some other thoughts	"How was the international break for you? Serene?Well, you can forget those sleep-filled, blissful nights because the Premier League is back to reawaken all your fantasy football anxieties.Where are the clean sheets coming this weekend? Are there any reasonably priced midfielders to draft in? And can Crystal Palace just get a penalty already because what's the point of Luka Milivojevic otherwise?If these and other gripping questions are keeping you up past midnight, read on for some helpful hints and tips for week five.Liverpool put four unanswered goals past Newcastle at Anfield last season. They netted two the season before. It is a fixture with a proud history of goals, including those two famous 4-3 home wins of the mid-90s.Liverpool are unbeaten in their past 23 Premier League home games against the Magpies (W19 D4), scoring in all of those matches (58 goals) and keeping 12 clean sheets. In total, the Reds have netted 98 times against Newcastle in the Premier League.Newcastle will strive to make it tough for Jurgen Klopp's side, as they managed to do so effectively at Spurs last month, but any fantasy football manager worth their salt will have spied this fixture and grown greedy at its potential rewards.So, this is your weekly reminder that Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino are useful.And if you've not got Trent Alexander-Arnold in your side yet, you may want to rectify that quickly. The full-back has created five more goalscoring chances (14) than any other defender this season, and has had the joint-fifth most shots (five).You can't win the lottery if you don't buy a ticket.Chris Sutton on the Fantasy 606 podcast: ""My all-Liverpool defence is perfect. Newcastle at home, there you go. Says it all. Clean sheets and a couple of assists.""Too long; didn't read - stock up on Liverpool players, especially the front three if you can afford them. TAA is a good bet in your defence.If Manuel Lanzini keeps himself fit, he is a potential points goldmine, and a reasonably priced one at that (just £6.5m in Fantasy Premier League).Fortunately - for West Ham and, potentially, for you - the Argentine looks to be in decent shape this campaign, playing in all four games so far having managed just 10 appearances at the end of last season following a cruciate ligament injury.Lanzini has created 14 chances for team-mates in the Premier League this season - of midfielders only Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne (16) has created more.He's very much looking the part for a Hammers side starting to kick into gear following the opening-day mauling by the reigning champions.On Monday, they travel to face an Aston Villa side who have faced a Premier League-high 77 shots so far this season.tl;dr - get Lanzini in.Sheffield United have faced 42 shots in their four games so far this season - this is the joint-sixth lowest in the division.Meanwhile, their opponents this weekend, Southampton, have produced 25 shots from inside the box this season - the joint-fourth fewest.Could this all add up to a Blades clean sheet? It certainly might be worth a gamble.But if you do decide to plump for a Blades defender, which one should you go for? This might help you decide...The smart play, though, could be to pick up John Lundstram, who is playing in midfield but listed as a defender in many fantasy games.tl;dr - Sheffield United defenders are worth having this weekend.Watford are bottom of the table with just one point, only two goals in the plus column and yet to keep a clean sheet - if you banked on any of their players in your initial fantasy team they are surely long gone by now.But is the second coming of Quique Sanchez Flores enough to make you reconsider drafting Hornets players back in?Many felt the Spaniard was harshly jettisoned from Vicarage Road over three years ago after a reasonable season in the top flight.One of his perceived strengths is sorting out a defence, so the likes of Kiko Femenia and Craigs Cathcart and Dawson now look more attractive propositions. You might want to steer clear of Jose Holebas, though, if judging by some of the headlines after Sanchez Flores left the club last time.Another thing to factor in before you go all Hornets happy is that their next five league fixtures don't make pretty reading: Arsenal (h), Man City (a), Wolves (a), Sheff Utd (h), Tottenham (a).Statman Dave on the Fantasy 606 podcast: ""I would wait and see with Watford, Gerard Deulofeu is the big one and if Troy Deeney can play like he did under Flores last time he may be worth a look too.""tl;dr - don't get seduced by a new manager, hold off on Watford players for now.All information is correct at 22:00 BST on Thursday night"

sport	Best Fifa Football Awards: Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo or Virgil van Dijk?	Lionel MessiCristiano RonaldoVirgil van Dijk	"Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk make up the shortlist for the Best Men's Player award at the Best Fifa Football Awards on Monday - but who should win it?Just how do you distinguish between three great players, each with a list of accolades as long as your arm?We've asked Spanish football writer Andy West, Italian football expert Mina Rzouki and BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty to make their case for each of the candidates.So who do you agree with? Take our vote here and select your winner. Highlights of the Fifa Football Awards are on BBC One at 23:10 BST on Monday (00:15 BST on Tuesday in Northern Ireland).If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote.Spanish football writer Andy West:Knowing that Lionel Messi is the best player in the world comes with just one condition: having eyes, and using them to watch football.If you actually watch him - and you are being even vaguely objective - you will see that Messi is head and shoulders above everybody else. The skill gap is not even close.Watch him, and you will see the goals. You will see the dribbles. The supernatural defence-splitting passes, the faultless first touch, the 360-degree spatial awareness, the uncanny ability to escape multiple markers, the unselfish game awareness. You will see all those things, and you will be forced to admit: yes, Messi is the best. By far.If you don't trust your eyes to reach that conclusion, maybe the stats will help. You probably already know that Messi scored more league goals than anyone else in Europe in 2018-19 (36, ahead of Kylian Mbappe's 33). But Messi's all-round magnificence is reflected in the fact that he was also among Europe's top performers in assists (fifth), chances created in open play (third), dribbles completed (fourth), passes into the final third (second) and shots against the woodwork (first). He is a striker, playmaker and winger all rolled into one.Those individual exploits led to silverware, too, with Messi inspiring Barcelona to a comfortably-earned league title, finishing 11 points ahead of Atletico Madrid.He also excelled in the Champions League, easily topping the competition's scoring charts (12). And before you throw Anfield in his face, note that Messi created more chances and had more shots on target than any other player in that dramatic second leg (including Liverpool players). It's hardly his fault his team-mates forgot how to finish or defend.Messi's problem, and the only reason the 'deserving' winner of awards like this is even discussed, is that we take him for granted.When we see - to cite a game a larger-than-normal number of UK-based fans will have witnessed - the incredible performance he produced at Wembley last October to destroy a helpless Tottenham defence, we shrug our shoulders and say: ""Well, that's Messi."" If another player reached that level just once, we would be in raptures. With Messi, it's normal.But the fact that he delivers displays of such mind-boggling brilliance 25 or 30 times a season should not just be brushed aside. We should appreciate him while we can, and revel in his unmatched splendour rather than reason that it's somebody else's turn to be acknowledged as the best. There is no other best. The best is Messi.And if you're still not convinced, take heed of an informed opinion from a man who played against him last season: ""Messi is still the best player in the world and I think he deserves it [the award] as long as he is playing.""Whose words were they? None other than Virgil van Dijk's.Even the other main contender for the award thinks Messi should win it.Italian football expert Mina Rzouki:Let's be honest, Ronaldo didn't outscore Lionel Messi nor did he help Juventus win the Champions League last season as Virgil van Dijk managed with Liverpool. Three players outscored the Portuguese Icon in Serie A and for the first time under Massimiliano Allegri's tutelage, Juventus didn't win the Coppa Italia.So why should Ronaldo win the Fifa player of the year?While his critics have plenty to point to when calculating why Ronaldo may not have lived up to the very high expectations the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has set for himself, it should also be noted just how much of a difference he made when playing for his country and new club.Unlike Van Dijk and Messi, Ronaldo chose a new challenge, playing in a new league with new team-mates and a new system. Under the guidance of a pragmatic coach, Ronaldo was tasked with proving value - and he did just that. He was named as the most valuable player in the league, helping Juventus to not only win the Supercoppa but the Scudetto, too, by being the club's top scorer and their inspiration moving forward.How many would boast similar statistics when changing leagues and clubs?It was Ronaldo who scored in the Supercoppa final against Milan to secure the win, Ronaldo who sealed the extraordinary comeback win against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League and Ronaldo who rallied the troops to secure vital points against the likes of Napoli and Inter, Juve's challengers for the title.As for Portugal, manager Fernando Santos confessed to running out of adjectives when it came to describing the player, settling on simply and aptly labelling him as 'a footballing genius'.Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to secure Portugal's presence in the inaugural Nations League's final, while the country's eventual win against the Netherlands was the player's 30th title in football.For both country and club, Ronaldo has made the difference, winning every final he played last season. He is the player his team-mates have looked to, not only to inspire them on the pitch but also to motivate them off it.BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty:Virgil van Dijk's best work may not be as eye-catching or spectacular as Lionel Messi's or Cristiano Ronaldo's - unless you have watched Liverpool on a regular basis for the last 12 months.Van Dijk's peerless defending, which makes him the best in the world in his position, stretches back to almost the moment he arrived at Liverpool from Southampton for £75m in January 2018.He instantly transformed a previously vulnerable Liverpool defence to the extent they reached the Champions League Final at the end of that season, although even he was powerless to cure the flaws of hapless goalkeeper Loris Karius that played a major part in their 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in Kiev.Throw his career forward and we now have a player being ranked alongside the greatest central defenders Liverpool have ever had - even the likes of Alan Hansen - and who is simply irreplaceable in manager Jurgen Klopp's plans.And we also have a player whose presence, calmness, leadership - and the occasional goal such as when he scored a crucial header in the Champions League last 16 second-leg win away to Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena last season - allowed Liverpool to make up for that bitter disappointment against Real Madrid by claiming European club football's biggest trophy for the sixth time against Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid in June.Van Dijk's level consistency is such that when Arsenal's Nicolas Pepe got the better of him in an individual joust in Liverpool's 3-1 win at Anfield on 24 August, it was the first time anyone had dribbled past him in a 50-match sequence stretching back to March 2018.It is a truly remarkable statistic and testimony to just how good Van Dijk is and why I believe he will be a worthy recipient of the Best Fifa Award.There was almost an air of incredulity when he made the first error of serious consequence anyone could recall with confidence when his loose backpass enabled Fernando Llorente to seal Napoli's 2-0 win against Liverpool in their first Champions League group game.Yes, Messi and Ronaldo have sustained incredible longevity and levels of greatness we may not witness again for a generation, but in the last 12 months the transformative effect of Van Dijk on Liverpool means no-one should complain if he is the winner.Van Dijk is magnificent in the air, has the ability to overpower attackers with his physical presence, has a finely-honed sense of danger and his range of long and short passing gives Liverpool an extra dimension to their offensive game.Quite simply he is the complete defender. He has played a large part in making Liverpool the team they are.He is the central plank in a team that has won the Champions League, is playing a part in Ronald Koeman's rival of the Netherlands national side, and is coveted by every club in the world.Van Dijk, in my opinion, should win this prestigious award."
sport	Homophobia in French football: Why is it happening?		"Warning: This article contains language some readers may find offensive.It was a minute that has changed the face of French football.Referee Mehdi Mokhtari stopped play in the Ligue 2 game at Nancy on 16 August not for a foul, but for homophobic abuse from the home fans, which rang around the Stade Marcel Picot on the half-hour mark.The target was not that evening's opponents, Le Mans, but rather Metz, who are Nancy's Ligue 1 neighbours in the Lorraine region.A stadium announcement for supporters to stop using the chant - ""les Messins, les messins, c'est des pedes"", which translates as ""people from Metz, people from Metz, they're faggots"" - went unheeded.So Mokhtari took action, stopping the game for some 60 seconds.""It's a first,"" France's Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu posted on social media. ""And the last, I hope.""Her wish has not been granted.To date, 18 matches are being investigated by the LFP, the French Football League. A number of games have been interrupted, including the Nice-Marseille match on 28 August and the Brest-Reims encounter four days earlier. Some top-flight clubs, including Marseille and Lille, have been given a dressing down for the behaviour of their fans.Maracineanu is at the heart of the initiative. At a Paris St-Germain v Marseille game last April, she was horrified by insults aimed by PSG fans at their most bitter rivals.""It's simply inadmissible to hear the chants I heard,"" she said. ""I don't see why we would allow ourselves to do things in a stadium that we wouldn't do elsewhere.""Consequently, referees were instructed to halt games this season should such incidents occur. ""Everything that is happening now was planned a long time before the minister spoke,"" said Bertrand Lambert, president of the anti-homophobia association PanamBoyz & Girlz, but he acknowledged Maracineanu's words were ""an electric shock"".They certainly got the ball rolling, but French football is fractured over which direction it gets kicked next.""Why are we being singled out now when we've been singing it for 20 years?"" said Jean-Michel Goncalves, a leading Nancy supporters' association figure. ""We've got nothing against homosexuals. When we insult Metz, it's more about tradition."" Nathalie Boy de la Tour, the LFP president, did not condone the songs, but struck a chord with fans when she said: ""The majority don't think they're hurting anyone.""In a recent poll carried out for RTL, 61% of supporters echoed that view.France is not alone. In 2016, Cristiano Ronaldo - then at Real Madrid - was told to ""come out of the closet"" by some Barcelona fans. The new Diego Maradona film shows the Argentina legend teaching his young daughter to say a homophobic term to Napoli's Serie A rivals in the late 1980s, and Mexico fans achieved notoriety at the 2018 World Cup in Russia for calling opposition goalkeepers male prostitutes when they took goal-kicks.""To call your opponent homosexual is definitely along a spectrum of machismo, whereby your opponent is weaker - less masculine,"" Joshua Nadel, author of Futbol!: Why Soccer Matters in Latin America, told the Guardian.It may be part of football folklore in Latin language countries, but Maracineanu's reaction mirrors the sea change in social attitudes that make such chants no longer acceptable inside stadiums when they have long been frowned upon outside them.However, her clear vision of what is wrong loses focus when it comes to the question of how to put it right.""It's not up to me to find solutions,"" she said recently, but suggested in L'Equipe earlier this week that a list of homophobic words should be drawn up to give football authorities a clearer picture of what constitutes such abuse.""I'm not really at ease with this idea of a pre-defined list,"" countered Frederic Potier, Inter-ministerial Delegate for the Fight against Racism, anti-Semitism and anti-LGBT. ""Forbidding everything overnight would be stupid and would turn against us,"" added Yoann Lemaire, president of the Foot Ensemble (Football Together) association.Opinions are just as varied among those on the pitch.Nice midfielder Wylan Cyprien said it was ""ridiculous"" to stop matches ""for so little,"" claiming the chants were ""not aimed at gay people"". His boss, Patrick Vieira, thought referee Clement Turpin had been ""totally right"" to stop the match with Marseille, a view shared by OM captain Steve Mandanda, who said: ""You have to make a stand and then it stops.""The problem is the LFP's stand has been weak.The Piantoni stand at Nancy's ground was closed for one game, the only significant punishment to date.Should they go further and dock teams points?""I don't think so,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. ""Why do you want to punish players who are neither racist nor homophobic because there is one, 10, or 100 people who have racist or homophobic reactions in the stands?""With the onus on referees to stop matches without any clear guidelines, inconsistencies have been numerous and only fuelled fans' anger and confusion. A meeting of stakeholders called by the LFP to help clarify the situation was due to take place on Thursday, but was pushed back by supporters' groups, who want to consider the matter internally before widening the discussion.The general mood, however, is positive.""We need to soon have applicable rules that are applied everywhere and for everyone,"" said Lambert. ""But for that, we need to talk to each other, away from the cameras and without politics. I'm optimistic, we'll get there."""

sport	Fantasy football tips: Don't panic - fantasy football tips before gameweek two	Don't panicThe cost of SterlingTake a punt on the new boys?In with the Seagulls?Other things to consider...	'Why, oh why didn't I pick Raheem Sterling as my captain? What do you mean Wilfried Zaha started on the bench? How did I not see Brighton's performance against Watford coming?'We've only had one game week but already fantasy football managers are engaging in some high-level frustration and self-recrimination.However, before you take the nuclear option of an early wildcard, allow us to present some smaller-scale alterations that could get your team back on track for game week two.First and foremost...OK, so your decision to bank on Bernardo Silva and Sadio Mane backfired, Jan Vertonghen was a no-show and Nicolas Pepe and Moise Kean didn't get a half of football between them.But that's no reason to rip up all your plans and start again. One game week is no adequate sample on which to judge players, especially the first, when teams are still bedding in and so many late transfer-window signings are not yet up to speed.Faith in Pepe, Kean and Christian Pulisic is likely to be rewarded with points in the long term if their record at previous clubs is anything to go by (Pepe scored 11 in 22 Ligue 1 games, Kean got six in 13 in Serie A and Pulisic four goals and four assists in 20 Bundesliga matches).As is loyalty to Zaha, who was named on the bench for Palace's opener against Everton after his club refused to sanction a move to Goodison Park, but showed enough in a 25-minute cameo (eight touches in the Toffees box) to illustrate how much the Eagles need him.He is also particularly prolific on the road, having scored six goals in his past seven away Premier League games. He and his side are at newly-promoted Sheffield United on Sunday.Sterling's opening weekend hat-trick at West Ham - followed by the assertion from Pep Guardiola that the forward has reached a new level of clinical finishing and consistency - is the surest sign yet that not having him is an act of self-harm against your fantasy side.It's not as if the signs weren't there - Sterling's start, while particularly explosive, is in line with the kind of form that has seen him accrue 229 and 234 points respectively in the past two Fantasy Premier League seasons.He was involved in 29 goals last season (17 goals, 12 assists) and started a healthy 31 of Manchester City's 38 Premier League games.The issue with getting him in now is his price, which has already risen by a crucial £0.1m on FPL, making a like-for-like single transfer tougher, unless you have cash in reserve or are willing to transfer out Mohamed Salah (probably a bad idea).The other option is to cash in four points to make an extra trade, which might well be worth it when you consider that Sterling has been directly involved in six goals in his past six Man City games in all competitions against Saturday's opponents Tottenham (five goals, one assist). He has scored four in his past three matches against them at Etihad Stadium.It is so very easy to get seduced by the tantalising unknown prospect of an expensive foreign signing, but don't let big money pull the wool over your eyes, especially in a market as inflated as this.Ismaila Sarr may have arrived at Watford for a record fee, but how much do you actually know about him? Giovani lo Celso sounds good, but is he likely to hit the ground running?Allow us to at least give you an indication as to the pedigree of some of the most prominent deadline day signings...Arsenal's dogged pursuit of left-back Kieran Tierney suggests his time will come sooner rather than later, meaning the Gunners will have two potentially points-rich options at full-back, along with Ainsley Maitland-Niles on the right.Watford's horrific start to the season could see Sarr installed in the team sooner rather than later, while you would expect Lo Celso - arguably the pick of the above bunch for potential fantasy football returns - to have to earn his place in the Spurs side from the bench.Graham Potter's bow as Brighton boss was arguably the most surprising aspect of week one, with Albion outplaying Watford en route to a 3-0 victory.But again, we'd urge caution before deciding the Seagulls are the solution to all your problems, in the same way that it is probably a tad early to ditch Andy Robertson and bring in Erik Pieters on the strength of the latter's two assists on Saturday.Remember that two of Albion's goalscorers were substitutes (Florin Andone and Neal Maupay), who have a good chance of again starting on the bench with Potter perhaps loath to alter anything.With Potter using a 3-4-3 formation in the opener and preferring his side to play out from the back, week one assist-making centre-back Lewis Dunk is a possible option, as is wing-back Martin Montoya (the man on the other side, Solly March, is largely listed as a midfielder, thus denying him significant clean-sheet points).You might also want to consider that striker Glenn Murray has scored six Premier League goals against West Ham (who they face on Saturday) - more than against any other club - while Pascal Gross has assisted in each of his three top-flight appearances against the Hammers.Speaking of assists, here are the players who created the most chances in week one, interestingly topped by Chelsea pair Pedro and Mason Mount, suggesting you shouldn't be so quick to ditch Blues players after their 4-0 defeat at Manchester United.
sport	Caster Semenya joins South African football team JVW		"Two-time Olympic 800m gold medallist Caster Semenya has joined a South African women's football team.The 28-year-old is unable to compete without taking testosterone-reducing drugs following a rule change by the IAAF, athletics' governing body.It means she cannot defend her 800m World Championship title in Doha this month - though she is fighting the rule change through the courts.She is now training with Gauteng-based women's football club JVW.The three-time world champion, who announced in July that she would not be defending her 800m world title, cannot start playing for JVW until the 2020 season, having joined outside the South African transfer window.""I am looking forward to this new journey, I appreciate the love and support I already get from the team,"" Semenya told the club website.JVW FC, was formed in 2013 by current South Africa Women's captain, Janine van Wyk, aiming to ""identify, develop, improve and expose"" female footballers.The club is one of the top sides in the league for Gauteng province - the main women's football league in South Africa is split into nine provincial competitions.Club founder Van Wyk told the BBC that Semenya has ""not given up running at all"".She said: ""She's on a break at the moment which is why she has time on her hands to do something different.""She's had two training sessions with the team and you could see her football is there, but we still need obviously to work on her a little bit because it's very different to track and field.""She's made it really clear to me that she's not giving up running at all.""It's amazing for the football club. The recognition women's football in South Africa will get is massive.""To have her play in the league over here is incredible and I think young girls and her team-mates will draw a lot of inspiration from Caster.""Semenya is not the first athlete to switch to football - after retiring in 2017, Usain Bolt trained with Norwegian club Stromsgodset and Australian side Central Coast Mariners, but did not secure a contract.Semenya is also following in the footsteps of her former coach Maria Mutola, who also turned to football after athletics.The IAAF introduced its rule change because it argues female athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) - such as Semenya - have ""a competitive advantage"".Athletes must either take testosterone-reducing medication in order to compete in track events from 400m to the mile or change to another distance."
sport	Real racism lies with football authorities - Vincent Kompany		"The lack of diversity in football organisations is part of the problem in tackling racism, says former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany.The Belgian was speaking in the wake of compatriot Romelu Lukaku being racially abused by Cagliari fans while playing for Inter Milan at the weekend.Lukaku said the abuse showed the game was ""going backwards"".""Romelu is a victim of something disgraceful not just in football, but also in society,"" said Kompany.Speaking to Sky Sports News, the Anderlecht manager added: ""It goes back to who is expected to make a decision on these issues, and it's in these organisations that the problems lie.""The real racism lies in the fact none of these institutions have representatives that can actually understand what Romelu is going through.""You are dealing with a crowd of people and decision-makers who are telling him how he should think and feel about this when you have no decision-makers who are remotely in touch with what he has experienced in his life.""That's the real issue - if you go through the boards at Uefa or Fifa, the Italian League or the English League, there is a real lack of diversity.""If you don't have diversity in places of power like boardrooms then you can't have the right decisions in terms of sanctions - it's a simple as that.""Lukaku, who moved from Manchester United to Inter in the summer, was subjected to monkey chants as he scored a penalty for his side's winner in a 2-1 victory.A group of Inter Milan fans claim Cagliari supporters were showing Lukaku a form of ""respect"" and the the abuse was gamesmanship."

Our championship is far from being glamorous and the most glaring example is the poor performance of Cameroonian clubs in continental competitions,"" the Fecafoot president, Seidou Mbombo Njoya told BBC Sport.""Prior to every season there has to be a general assembly of the league (according to LPFC statutes) to assess the previous year but this hasn't been held lately.""Then there are the constant conflicts between league officials and club presidents.""The league can't account for state and Fecafoot money handed out to them and the two main sponsors of the domestic championships have left.""We feel things can be done better and that's what we're trying to change.""Semengue, an 84-year-old military general who was re-elected in July 2016 says he will contest the imposition of the new committee by Fecafoot.""Everything that has been done by Fecafoot is illegal"" he said at a press conference.He claims he has taken the matter before the Chamber of Conciliation and Arbitration of Cameroon's Olympic Committee and is willing to go to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.""Clubs have continued registering with us for the next season and we're going to continue working because whatever is going on now is a non-event for us,"" Semengue added.Despite the stand-off the new interim committee is expected to start work soon.""We have to hurry up because time's not on our side. We are brainstorming on the sort of competition we want because recently the tournament format has fluctuated and we want to do something professional"" Njoya added.""We are confident we can attract top sponsors to the championship to fund the teams and ensure that the players are well paid.""We want to avoid a damning situation where about 80 percent of clubs can't pay their players""""With the caretaker committee, we will pay minimum salaries directly to the players.""The clubs will have to pay the players too but all this is to ensure that players are well paid and can take care of their families.""They are the main actors in football and deserve to live decently""In the absence of Semengue the caretaker committee will be headed up by Fecafoot's first vice-president Alim Konate."

Since then, the 29-year-old has suffered debilitating headaches, light sensitivity and other problems with his vision.As well as video review, World Rugby has introduced independent medics, altered tackle laws and, in the professional game, implemented a standardised off-field head injury assessment so players who may be concussed can be temporarily substituted for examination.There is no such protocol in Scottish football.""Having a skilled pair of eyes with a screen scrolling back, looking for signs that somebody may have sustained a concussion or been knocked out is the biggest step forward that we've had in rugby,"" added Dr Hanson, who has also worked with the FA and Team GB and serves as sport and exercise medicine consultant with sportscotland.""Lots of football doctors are disadvantaged in that if they're talking to somebody or they glance at the floor and an incident happens, they haven't seen it.

""The awareness is really lacking in the game.""If you tear a hamstring, you hobble off and you know that's what happens.""Football is a long way behind other sports. Over here, rugby is where it maybe should be and they're still looking at it. Football almost hasn't really bothered about it. There's definitely a lot more football could do it."""

sport	Women's Football: Five questions for 'frustrated' England	Are England over their World Cup hangover?Does Williams signify a step forward?Can the newcomers take their chances?Will Neville's tactics still work?Are friendlies better than qualifying?	"Just 54 days after playing what Phil Neville called a ""nonsense"" third-place play-off at the World Cup, England face a new challenge as they begin their quest to conquer Euro 2021.Hosting the European Championship for the first time since 2005 means the Lionesses qualify automatically and will instead play friendly matches in the build-up - starting in Belgium on Thursday and Norway next Tuesday.The England manager is not a fan of non-competitive games, but says the 2020 Tokyo Olympics - for which he takes charge of the Great Britain team - will act as added motivation for his players.So what are the key challenges facing Neville as he prepares for a huge two years?Media playback is not supported on this deviceFor all the record TV audiences, the momentum gained and sceptics won over at the World Cup, England finished with a damp squib after missing out on a bronze medal to Sweden.Thursday's game against Belgium will be the first opportunity for the players to demonstrate that they are ""braver and tougher"" as Neville demanded in Brussels on Wednesday.He also said his players are not at the required standard to win a gold medal - a change in tack, as during the tournament he indicated that they had the credentials to win a major tournament for the first time.But the players will have no room for an 'off season' if they want to play at the Olympics, as Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish players will also be vying for places in his Great Britain squad.That should ensure there is no post-World Cup complacency. With new and old faces in the squad, Neville says the players will use the ""hurt and frustration"" from the summer as ""fuel"".The Lionesses squad has not seen wholesale changes from the World Cup, but those that have come in are intriguing nonetheless.Chief among them is England's record cap holder Fara Williams, not included when the squad was first announced, but called up once Chelsea forward Fran Kirby dropped out injured.Williams was not picked for the World Cup either, but Neville said before the tournament that her England career was not over. Former Reading team-mate Becky Jane, now at Liverpool, says the 35-year-old midfielder has been eagerly awaiting a recall.There is no doubt that Williams will bring her guile and experience to the squad, which lacked inventiveness in midfield at times during the World Cup. But she was not at her peak during her last major tournament at Euro 2017, not least in the semi-final defeat by hosts and eventual winners the Netherlands.However, she showed with Reading last season that she is still one of the Women's Super League's top performers - and Neville said: ""Fara wants to be picked for footballing ability and I will only pick her on that.""Neville's selection of Chelsea forward Beth England and Manchester City defender Aoife Mannion is more of a nod to the future.The head coach says they have been picked for their strength of character as much as for their football ability, which he says is increasingly important for England.""They bring character, they never moan, train hard and do the extra bits,"" Neville said.Neville said England and Mannion, who has represented her country at every youth level, would have been ""frustrated"" by their lack of chances after a ""fantastic 12 months"".The Chelsea forward had a sterling end to last season, scoring 12 goals in 12 WSL starts. Her inclusion comes in place of the injured Ellen White, who was England's top scorer at the World Cup.Mannion's path to a centre-back berth has been blocked by Steph Houghton, Millie Bright, Abbie McManus and Leah Williamson, and has not been helped by a manager willing to rotate his central defenders.But after moving to Manchester City from Birmingham in July, she will be able to tap into the experience of new club-mate and England captain Houghton, while Chelsea's England could take advantage of the fact that White is set to miss out on the next ""two to three camps"" according to Neville.For the most part, Neville impressed at the World Cup, his first major tournament, but there were questions about some of his tactical decisions.His desire to play stylish football out from the back is ""non-negotiable"" and while it brought in new fans, it also carried an element of risk.At times, it did not suit England's defenders, and their attempts to move the ball forward quickly with short, sharp passing looked like a work in progress.Neville says he won't change his methods but admitted ""it might take 12 months"" for his style to fully take shape. Fortunately, with only friendly games to come, he can fine-tune his tactics rather than worrying about results too much.England have not lost a European Championship or World Cup qualifier since 2002 - when they were beaten by Germany and then in a play-off by France - denying them a place at the 2003 World Cup in the United States.In more recent years, qualification has been almost inevitable with some particularly one-sided games against European minnows. This time, England have a chance to organise friendlies of a more testing nature. In the build-up to the 2019 World Cup, the Lionesses lost to New Zealand and Canada, which provided plenty of food for thought.England drew and beat Belgium in qualifying for Euro 2017, while Norway will offer a stern test even if the Lionesses produced their best performance of the World Cup to beat them 3-0 in France.They also have a November date against Germany in front of what is set to be a record Wembley crowd.After that, England will hope to defend their SheBelieves Cup title next March, by which time the Olympics - and a massive 18 months for Neville and his players - will come firmly into view."

Women have to be allowed into football stadiums in Iran,"" he said.""Now is the moment to change things and Fifa is expecting positive developments starting in the next Iran home match in October.""Football fan Sahar Khodayari died this month when she set herself on fire while awaiting trial for trying to attend a match.Nicknamed 'Blue Girl', in reference to the colours worn by her favourite team Esteghlal of Tehran, she was arrested in March for trying to enter the stadium, reportedly disguised as a man.A group of female fans were permitted to attend the second leg of the Asian Champions League final in Tehran last November, but in June women were locked out of Iran's friendly with Syria at the Azadi Stadium in the Iranian capital - the venue for the World Cup qualifier on 10 October."
sport	Charlton Athletic 1-3 Sheffield Wednesday: Fletcher brace beats Addicks at The Valley	CharltonSheff WedFull TimeGoal!BookingBookingSubstitutionSubstitutionBookingGoal!Substitution	"Sheffield Wednesday striker Steven Fletcher scored twice as the Owls beat Charlton Athletic in front of the Addicks' prospective new owners at The Valley.Fletcher's superb 17th-minute header from Barry Bannan's cross gave Wednesday the lead, only for Macauley Bonne to level nine minutes later.But the Owls regained the lead when Fletcher scored from the penalty spot on 80 minutes after Jacob Murphy was adjudged to have been brought down by Addicks midfielder Erhun Oztumer.And Garry Monk's side sealed their first win in six games in the fourth minute of injury time when Adam Reach crossed for the unmarked Atdhe Nuhiu to head home at the far post.This was Charlton's first game since controversial Belgian owner Roland Duchatelet agreed to sell the club to East Street Investments on Friday.Prospective new chairman Matt Southall was present at The Valley to witness first-hand the extent of injury-hit Charlton's immediate problems as Lee Bowyer's weakened side stretched their winless run to seven games.With only five players to choose from on the bench after Ben Purrington was forced to pull out, some Charlton players were also struck down by vomiting and diarrhoea. And the Addicks' injury crisis worsened further when they had to keep Oztumer on the pitch after he suffered what looked like a hamstring strain.After the upsurge in mood in south-east London following the news of Duchatelet's impending departure, the afternoon got off to a bad start for the home fans.Following a neat exchange of passes with Morgan Fox, Bannan curled over a superbly weighted in-swinging left-foot cross from close to the left flank and Fletcher nipped in just ahead of his marker Naby Sarr to steer home a deft header just inside Dillon Phillips' left upright.But, just nine minutes later, the Addicks levelled out of the blue. Recalled teenager Alfie Doughty surged down the left flank to find Bonne with a low cross and the striker's half-hit left-foot shot took a deflection off Tom Lees to wrong-foot Owls keeper Cameron Dawson for his sixth goal in 11 games.It took until 10 minutes from time for the Owls to go back in front from the spot. Murphy went down as he knocked the ball past the labouring Oztumer, the penalty was awarded and Fletcher stroked his eighth goal of the season into the bottom left-hand corner.Scotland midfielder Bannan then proved the architect again when he picked out Nuhiu to wrap up the scoring with the simplest of headers deep into added time, extending Charlton's winless streak to seven matches.Charlton manager Lee Bowyer:""It was a tough day. We've got enough injuries, but then to chuck in a few illnesses as well doesn't help. It was a bit of everything. Sickness, diarrhoea, not good.""Ben Purrington was down to start, but he was ill just before we got on the coach, so we had to send him home. Then once we got here and put the team sheet in, Albie Morgan was being sick just before the game. We couldn't do anything about that. We just had to see how he went. Then again at half-time he was sick. That's why we took him off. He couldn't move in the end.""I hate losing. That's quite obvious to see but I've just said to the players: 'Hold your heads up high. You should be proud of putting on a great team performance. They can't give any more that what they are giving out there. We were in the ,game right up until the 80th minute.""On the potential takeover:""I've spoken to the potential new owners and it was a positive conversation. If they do get the green light from the EFL, it's going to be good news for the football club.""They have said that there is money to spend in January and that me and the staff are going to get proper contracts.""It sounds good, so we need to start planning for January. It'll be nice to be able to strengthen the squad if we can.""Sheffield Wednesday manager Garry Monk:""I'm pleased for the players because we've had a lot of frustration recently, when we've played as well as that, we haven't taken our chances and we've made costly mistakes.""But we wanted to show that we still had the belief and character to respond even though we've had a tricky period when we haven't won games when we've deserved to.""We've taken leads in games and something has gone against us, but I saw the belief in the players.""We could easily have felt sorry for ourselves when they equalised, but we didn't and we showed a great response. It was a deserved win.""Match ends, Charlton Athletic 1, Sheffield Wednesday 3.Second Half ends, Charlton Athletic 1, Sheffield Wednesday 3.Goal! Charlton Athletic 1, Sheffield Wednesday 3.

sport	'Racism rot is deep' in Italian football, says anti-discriminatory body Fare	'No basic understanding of racism'	"Italian football authorities and their disciplinary systems to combat racism are ""not fit for purpose"", says the chief of anti-discriminatory body Fare.The claim has been made after Cagliari were cleared of racist chanting towards Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku in a Serie A match.Lukaku was subjected to monkey chants by Cagliari fans when he scored a penalty for his side in a 2-1 win.""The rot is deep,"" Fare executive director Piara Powar told BBC Sport.""We believe the Italian authorities and the disciplinary system is simply not fit for purpose.""Whether it is the FIGC [Italian Football Federation] or Serie A, they have failed to protect countless players from racism over the past year and have no meaningful response to the endemic racism in stadiums.""There are no visible campaigns, no progressive fan leaders, as well as apathy and prejudice among the media.""No-one is taking the issue seriously - no-one apart from the players, the victims themselves, and a few allies who have been courageous enough to stand up.""Serie A insisted it was ""seriously and constantly engaged in activities against racism"".It added: ""I can confirm our maximum effort to fight racism. We did a lot in the past and we'll do [a lot] in the future as we announced some days ago a campaign about this that we will develop in the next month.""The FIGC has been contacted for a response.The Fare Network, an organisation trying to fight inequality in football, says it has contacted the Italian FA to try to work with it and is awaiting a reply.In the meantime, Fare's work to combat racism in Italy involves working with a government agency, non-government organisations and other parts of society in the country.Belgium international Lukaku said the abuse he suffered showed the game was ""going backwards"" and he hoped ""the football federations all over the world react strongly on all cases of discrimination"".The report into the incident conceded that chants, shouts and whistles were directed at Lukaku by Cagliari fans, but said they were not sufficient in ""size and perception"" to merit punishing the club and its supporters.Anti-racism charity Kick It Out said: ""This is a cowardly decision from Serie A and the Italian FA, in response to disgusting racist abuse aimed at Romelu Lukaku.""We can only assume that the Italian authorities do not care that they are effectively endorsing this behaviour.""As they refuse to take action against repeated racist abuse by the same group of supporters, it's about time Uefa stepped in and showed some leadership.""This is the third time Calgliari have been investigated for alleged racist abuse in the past two years after cases involving Moise Kean, the Italy forward now at Everton, and his then Juventus team-mate, France international Blaise Matuidi, but no action was taken over any of the incidents.A group of Inter Milan fans claimed Cagliari supporters were showing Lukaku a form of ""respect"" when they aimed monkey chants at him.A statement from Inter fan group Curva Nord said ""Italian fans are not racist"" and the abuse was gamesmanship.""It shows you that there is no basic understanding of what racism is and why what they do to black players is racist,"" said Fare Eastern Europe development officer Pavel Klymenko.""There has to be a lot of educational efforts put in.""This lack of understanding runs very deep. It is not just the ultras, it is the whole system of Italian football and consequently the society."""

So the domestic league has taken a bit of a battering at the moment.""The congestion means that Hunt is thinking of splitting up his squad so they can try to compete on both fronts.Wits begin their Confederation Cup Group C campaign at home to visiting Horoya of Guinea on Sunday before then facing a long trek to Mali to play Djoliba.With the trip expected to take 28 hours each way, Hunt is considering some drastic action.""I'm thinking of how to do it for next week's game [away to Djoliba]: I'm going to leave five-six big hitters, my best players, here - and go there with a weakened side,"" he admitted.""I've got to do it for that game and see how far we can get. I've got to make those decisions for the team and the club.""I can't let our domestic form drop off. I still haven't made my mind up but I'm more than likely to leave five of my best players out.""Wits, who finished third in last season's Premier Soccer League, are currently fifth in the table, 15 points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs but with those four games in hand.Hunt knows only too well that the change of dates for the final Confederation Cup group matches could cause further problems for his club.""It's last minute - it's pretty upsetting because we were ok, but now with another three games behind we're going to be seven games [back],"" he added.""We're not a big club, we're a small small club - we're punching above our weight but I don't want to take the strain where it affects us domestically because the domestic league is our bread and butter.""Nonetheless, Hunt admitted that he loved the thrill of competing at African level.Wits narrowly lost to continental giants Al Ahly in the first round of the Champions League before dropping in to the Confederation Cup."

He'd cycle to training in the morning - 14 miles - and tell me to give him a 10-minute start in case he fell off. I'd overtake him driving in and every day, without fail, he'd give me the finger when I passed him and it was the same on the way home.""People get the wrong impression of him. They think he's all about the carry on but it was constant football in that house. He lives for it and I'm the same. It's in my head. People say we put too much into it and need an escape but the only time we'd switch our phones off was when we were playing golf.""A handful of years have passed and, while that shared compulsion remains, some things have changed significantly. Hughes has been considered unemployable since an appalling three-month stint that left Raith Rovers in League One, while Rice has emerged from his considerable shadow to take his first head coach's job with Hamilton Academical.Now 10 months into his tenure, Rice is finding his own identity away from the double act that characterised his lengthy coaching career. He says it's ""criminal for Yogi to be sitting in the house"" and has asked him a couple of times to come in to Hamilton to do sessions without success. But without him by his side, what kind of manager is he?It turns out, the 56-year-old Rice is an obsessive who doesn't sleep well so is bunkered down in his sparse office at quarter to seven each morning, cradling a coffee and plotting the day ahead. A couple of times a week, he will leave just after lunch to head to Liverpool or Manchester to watch English under-23 sides, getting home after midnight before returning to his office ""before the crack of dawn"" to do it all over again.Friends say he takes football too seriously. That he needs to lighten up and get a hobby. To stop huffing and blaming himself when Hamilton lose and worrying about the next game when they win. Rice waves away their concerns. He's too busy watching football, reading voraciously about other sports, fretting about the players he doesn't pick, and agonising about ruining kids' dreams.That, he says, has been his biggest challenge. The media duties and dealing with the board have been a source of angst, too, but those don't compare with the torment of telling a teenager that his time at Hamilton is up.""I worry about those kids,"" says Rice, who thrived at Hibernian after being released by Celtic and went on to sign for Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough before returning home with Falkirk. ""Am I destroying their dream? Should I be doing more for them? I find that a weight on my shoulders.""When I was 17, somebody gave me a chance but too many kids get discarded too early. If I walk into any pub in Scotland, I'll be the 15th best player in there. But the 14 who are better have never done anything. It's all about sacrifices and making the most of your chances. And I don't want my kids here to be one of those guys standing at the bar.""Rice had been offered opportunities to step up before, but was never interested. He doesn't like the title of 'manager' for a start. He's a coach. He loves being on the grass - ""or the astro, as it is here"".But a long association with Hamilton owner Ronnie MacDonald and director of football Allan McGonigal - plus the club's determination to restore their reputation as somewhere young players could thrive, and the nagging feeling that the chance might not come again - convinced him to accept the challenge.Hamilton were 11th in the Scottish Premiership at the time, but Rice helped them edge up a place and ensure a sixth successive season in the top flight. This term, the focus has been on lowering the age of the side - so much so that the club have fielded six of the seven youngest starting XIs in the division this season.""They are inexperienced, but they are in the team because they are good players,"" he says of the likes of Lewis Smith, Ross Cunningham and Ronan Hughes.""I think we should have more points than we've got because we've lost quite a few leads recently, but they'll learn. Their energy and enthusiasm lifts me and every day I can't wait to get into my work and it's the same for the older boys in the squad."""

I have to say thank you to my outstanding club Liverpool FC.""To the owners thank you, they gave me an incredible team. I have to thank my team - as a coach you can only be as good as your team is. I'm really proud of being manager of such an incredible bunch of players.""In accepting the award, Klopp announced that he is joining the Common Goal initiative set up by Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata. It means the Reds boss will donate 1% of his salary to the charity, which pledges to ""generate social change and improve lives"".Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson was also a winner as he took the best goalkeeper prize ahead of Manchester City's Ederson and Barcelona's Marc-Andre ter Stegen. As well as success in the Champions League, Alisson was first choice for Brazil as they lifted the Copa America on home soil.Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa won the fair play award after he ordered his team to allow Aston Villa to score an uncontested equaliser during their 1-1 draw in their Championship match in April.Bielsa's side had gone ahead controversially when the Villa players stopped as they expected the ball to be kicked out of play when Jonathan Kodjia was injured, before the Argentine intervened.Eighteen-year-old Daniel Zsori won the Puskas award for the best goal with his spectacular 93rd-minute overhead kick for Debrecen against Ferencvaros, just after he came on as a substitute for his Hungarian league debut in February.His strike beat Messi's chip from the edge of the penalty area against Real Betis and Juan Quintero's powerful 30-yard free-kick for River Plate against Racing Club.Three players who featured in last season's Premier League were included in the Fifa Fifpro Team of the Year, but none from champions Manchester City.Alisson and Van Dijk were included, as was forward Eden Hazard, who was at Chelsea in 2018-19 before joining Real Madrid in the summer.Seven City players were included in the 55-man shortlist - goalkeeper Ederson, defenders Aymeric Laporte and Kyle Walker, midfielders Bernardo Silva and Kevin de Bruyne and forwards Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero - but none of them made the final 11.Tottenham trio Christian Eriksen, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min all missed out, as did Manchester United pair David de Gea and Paul Pogba, as well as Chelsea's N'Golo Kante.Liverpool had two players selected but five others - Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andrew Robertson, Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah - were overlooked.Goalkeeper - Alisson (Liverpool/Brazil)Defenders - Matthijs de Ligt (Ajax and Juventus/Netherlands), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid/Spain), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool/Netherlands), Marcelo (Real Madrid/Brazil).Midfielders - Luka Modric (Real Madrid/Croatia), Frenkie de Jong (Ajax and Barcelona/Netherlands), Eden Hazard (Chelsea and Real Madrid/Belgium)Forwards - Kylian Mbappe (Paris St-Germain/France), Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus/Portugal), Lionel Messi (Barcelona/Argentina)"

That performance was without Odsonne [Edouard], so it shows how well we can play.""Sometimes you have important players missing, and that sums up the group at the minute, they're really in a good place.""Lennon opted for a striker-less formation against Rennes that featured winger Lewis Morgan as a lone striker, supported by Ryan Christie and James Forrest.Prior to the game, Morgan had scored just once for Celtic, but the former St Mirren winger broke the deadlock in the 21st minute amid an impressive performance.""Lewis comes in and he's a testament to being a really good professional,"" said Lennon of the 23-year-old.""Waiting his time, staying on top of his conditioning and he goes out and plays brilliantly like that.""We're all really pleased for Lewis, we knew he could do it. He's a really fit lad and he's getting stronger physically. He just needs to believe in himself the way we all do.""It was a great goal he scored, it was a striker's goal, a great finish. His all round game tonight was excellent.""Former Scotland forward James McFadden on SportsoundNormally in the past, you look at Celtic and Rangers going into domestic games and blowing teams away by playing a certain style of football, but they'd go into Europe and something would change. Nothing has changed with these two sides in Europe this year. That's about players thinking on their feet and it's very difficult to deal with that.Former Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart on SportsoundIt doesn't matter who you're playing against. When you play at that pace and you're playing one-twos around the box you can be the best defence in the world but it's almost impossible to defend against. If you have the ability to do that in an attacking sense you can cut open any side."

""You can never, ever, ever be afraid to play football.""Everton's third home loss of the current campaign saw them slip to 15th place, while Norwich, who were bottom of the Premier League at kick-off, moved up to 18th.A number of fans sang ""sacked in the morning"" at the end of the game but Silva insists he can only focus on performances.Media playback is not supported on this device""I think it is not the main thing to talk about the situation. It is not the moment to talk about individual positions,"" Silva said.""We have to look what is best for us as a club and for myself and the players as well - but always the club has to be at the top.""If you are really disappointed with the afternoon I can imagine they [fans] are as well and they have the reaction to the manager and the players.""When you lose a match, the first person they look to is the manager. Football is like that.""The message is I respect what is their feeling, for sure. It is not the first time they felt the way they felt this afternoon.""Gylfi Sigurdsson had several chances as the hosts improved for a spell in the second half, but the Everton's captain could only shoot straight at Krul with the best of them.Sigurdsson also seemed well-placed for a chance from a free-kick late in the game, but Lucas Digne stepped up instead and could only fire in a weak effort that Krul saved comfortably.Cantwell scored early in the second half, and substitute Srbeny sealed the Canaries' first three points since they beat champions Manchester City on 14 September with a goal in stoppage time.Oriel Hernandez had gone close for Norwich before the break when he forced Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford into an excellent low save.Four points from a possible six just before the international break would have given Everton fans hope that a corner had been turned after an inconsistent start to the season.Silva's side looked confident in the opening stages against Norwich, but as the game wore on an edginess in the stands seemed to transfer to the pitch, and by full-time that frustration was evident for players and supporters.Norwich sat deep, but Everton did not have the enough ideas to open them up, either in open play or at any of their seven corners.Of their 18 shots, Everton only managed seven on target, although Cantwell's opener for Norwich roused them, with Sigurdsson trying his luck on three occasions within a few minutes.But with their next three games against Leicester, Liverpool and Chelsea coming inside the next two weeks, Silva admitted that this defeat against the side who were propping up the Premier League was a missed opportunity for progress.He added: ""We are trying to get consistency. We came from good results and we lost an opportunity today. The way we played this afternoon, we did not deserve to win.""It was frustrating. We share the fans' frustration.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceFrom the outset, Norwich did not play like a side on such a poor run, having more ideas and creativity than their hosts.Hernandez posed problems on the left flank, and the Cuban was only denied a goal when Pickford dropped low to his right to thwart Norwich's best chance of the first half.Cantwell, who was so crucial to Norwich's memorable win over Manchester City, had been recalled to the starting line-up and the 21-year-old gave Daniel Farke's side a lift with an energetic display.His goal came about thanks to an excellent knock-down from Kenny McLean that allowed Teemu Pukki to pick him out as he glided into the Everton area before placing the ball past Pickford.The Canaries looked comfortable after the first goal, despite the expected surge from Everton, and Srbeny had been on the pitch for only a few seconds when the German latched onto a rebound from the unlucky Sigurdsson inside the Everton area.Norwich now face Arsenal, Southampton and Sheffield United in quick succession, but if they can ensure that this kind of performance becomes the norm rather than exception then Farke's side could soon be out of the relegation zone.Norwich manager Daniel Farke speaking to Match of the Day: ""It was such a good away game, the dressing room was buzzing and we deserved the win.""I was very confident of getting something from the game. The first half was good but I went in knowing we could be leading and we had to go out and want to win it in the second half.""A win is always good for the spirit f the team. We have showed we have confidence and deserve to be at this level.""Norwich host Arsenal at Carrow Road on Sunday 1 December, starting at 14:00 GMT, while Everton travel to high-flying Leicester for a 16:30 kick-off on the same day.Match ends, Everton 0, Norwich City 2.Second Half ends, Everton 0, Norwich City 2.Attempt missed.

sport	Cost of the Game 19/20: Scottish football's cheapest away days	Premiership - HamiltonChampionship - Alloa & ArbroathLeague One - PeterheadLeague Two - Annan Athletic	A day-trip, sometimes to the other side of the country. A flick through the programme. A pie and a cup of tea. Followed by 90 minutes of high-octane football. But is an away day an affordable experience across Scotland's four divisions?BBC Scotland's Cost of the Game survey has discovered that the average price for a Scottish travelling fan this season is £24.26 for a single adult ticket, programme, pie and cup of tea. Transport costs obviously add to that.If you are not fussed about the extras, admission to a game can start at just £12 for adults at the likes of Annan Athletic, Cove Rangers, Edinburgh City and Elgin City - but can also rise all the way up to £52 for the Old Firm derby. But what away day gives you the most bang for your buck in each league?Hamilton Academical is the cheapest away day in the top flight, with £27.50 getting you admission, a programme, a pie and a tea. The latter two are the cheapest in the division at £1.50 each, and the programme is the second-cheapest printed version at £2.50.If you are bringing along kids, though, elsewhere may be more cost-effective. Hamilton do offer a cost-effective £38 season ticket for under 18s, but those travelling to the FYS Stadium for an away game will be charged £12.Motherwell and St Johnstone are among clubs with attractive deals for young fans, with the former charging £3 for all under 16s and the latter allowing under 13s in for free with an adult.Predictably, Rangers and Celtic are by far the steepest away days - the cheapest you can hope for to get a ticket, programme, pie and tea is £35.40 at Celtic Park and £37.80 at Ibrox.With both costing £23 for a ticket, programme, pie and tea, Alloa and Arbroath are tied for the cheapest away day in the second tier.Alloa's Recreation Park has a stunning view of the Ochil Hills behind the Railway End, while Arbroath's Gayfield Park's is positioned next to the sea, which makes for an interesting spectacle - not least since a wayward punt combined with lethal winds may carry the ball into the sea.The sum of £3 to warm yourself from the often-Baltic conditions at Arbroath with a tea and pie at half-time is not a bad deal, but if you prefer a hill-view and kids are tagging along, Alloa may be the place for you - they charge £4 admission for under 16s.Ayr and Queen of the South are not far behind at £23.60 and £24 for a cheap away day, but best avoiding Dundee if you want a cost-effective Championship day out. You will be at least £30.75 for a ticket, programme, pie and tea at Dens Park, which is more expensive than most Premiership grounds.In an act of sure to spark outrage, we have decided to crown the second-cheapest away day team in League One as the cheapest.A trip to Forfar Athletic may technically be the most cost-effective - and they have the accolade of the cheapest pie and tea in the country (just £1.25 and 90p respectively) - but they are also one of three SPFL teams that do not offer a programme, alongside Ross County and Brechin City.The next cheapest is Peterhead, who also do not offer a physical programme, but do offer a free online edition for every match - so they take the divisional honours at £17.50. As well as an attractive cost for away fans, the north-east club boast the cheapest season ticket in the league for home fans, and offers for young fans including free tickets for under 12s.If a physical programme makes or breaks the away day for you, taking in a match in the Coo Shed at Stranraer's Stair Park is not much more expensive at £19.50.All away days in League Two will cost £20 or less for your ticket, programme, pie and tea, and £18.31 on average. But at £16.60, Annan Athletic is the cheapest trip for your money - the only downside is that it is closer to Newcastle United than any other League Two club.If you are an Elgin City fan, that is more than a nine-hour round trip across over 500 miles by car. Or if you would walk 500 miles, it would take you about six days. If travel is not an issue though, Galabank is the place for a cheap away day, situated next to the River Annan.The club also boasts by far the best young adult single ticket price in the country with 18-21 year olds only paying £6 - and for home fans it is tied for the cheapest season book in the SPFL at just £150.There is another cheap away day at other side of the country, with Elgin costing just £17, and the new SPFL away day at recently promoted Cove Rangers is just a little more at £18.

He's been very professional and showed plenty of hunger in our quest to qualify for the European Championship.""The former Yugoslavia and Croatia star was appointed to the Bosnia position last year and had a promising start as his side topped their Uefa Nations League group after an unbeaten run which included away and home wins over Northern Ireland and a victory over Austria.However, his team's form dipped badly in the Euro 2020 qualifiers as Italy and Finland clinched secured spots in next year's finals.The Croatian resigned from the job after the Armenian defeat two months ago before being coaxed back into the role.He did attend last Friday's Euro 2020 play-offs draw and spoke of his optimism that home advantage would enable Bosnia-Herzegovina to account for Northern Ireland and set up another home game against either Slovakia or the Republic of Ireland in the final five days later.The winner of the play-off final will secure a place at the Euro 2020 finals."
sport	All-Ireland Football final replay: Dublin clinch historic five-in-a-row	Kingdom play part in breathtaking contestFitzsimons foul prevents Morley goalMurchan goal the crucial moment	Dublin footballers made GAA history at Croke Park as they became the first team to win five successive All-Ireland Senior titles in football or hurling.Kerry tested the Dubs to their limit in the first half of the replay as they twice fought back from four points down to level at 0-10 to 0-10 at half-time.But Eoin Murchan crucially netted for the Dubs 15 seconds after the restart.Stephen O'Brien had a Kerry goal chance but was denied by Stephen Cluxton as the Dubs clinched a 1-18 to 0-15 win.Cluxton was captaining Dublin to a sixth Sam Maguire Cup triumph as Kerry's hopes of adding to their record 37 titles were denied by a team most will regard as the greatest in gaelic football history.Mick O'Dwyer's famous Kerry football team missed out on a five-in-a-row in 1982 after a last-gasp goal Seamus Darby goal for Offaly and Peter Keane's largely young Kingdom squad were hoping to deny the Dubs something regarded as akin to GAA immortality.However, the view that Kerry had probably missed their chance after leading in injury-time during the drawn game was ultimately proved right as Dublin clinched the county's 29th All-Ireland Football title.Media playback is not supported on this deviceModern day intercounty gaelic football rightly comes in for severe criticism for the lack of entertainment amid the cautious approaches of many managements but Saturday's replay was a joy to behold as both teams attacked at pace when in possession.Goalscorer Murchan's late inclusion in the Dubs defence gave them an extra attacking option from the drawn encounter as he charged into opposition territory at regular intervals in the first half before notching the vital goal after the restart.The goal was indeed the crucial score as it gave Dublin a lead they never relinquished with the closest Kerry got thereafter one point down after 44 minutes following scores from David Clifford, the outstanding Paul Geaney and Sean O'Shea.Dublin responded with three unanswered points to move four up as with outstanding duo Ciaran Kilkenny and Paul Mannion [two] kicking the scores to maintain their superb displays after both had been subdued two weeks ago.Granted that period included O'Brien's missed 53rd-minute goal chance as he tried to beat Cluxton from close range after charging towards goal from the left edge of the large squad when perhaps a pass inside to the unmarked Geaney might have represented the better option.Both sides made late changes with wing-back Murcan's inclusion in place of Michael Darragh Macauley resulting in James McCarthy's switch to midfield while Diarmuid O'Connor replaced skipper Gavin White in the Kingdom line-up.Kilkenny and the speedy O'Callaghan were to the fore early as the Dubs notched five points from as many chances to move into a 0-5 to 0-1 lead after seven minutes.Jim Gavin's side still looked in control at 0-7 to 0-3 up after 15 minutes but two Clifford points helped the Kingdom reduce Dublin's lead to one by the 20th minute with Geaney becoming increasingly influential.Kerry's early tactic of lumping high balls into the Dublin defence hadn't proved effective but they soon switched to running at the Dublin defence and it enabled the Kingdom to have the better of the second quarter.Dublin defender Michael Fitzsimons was fortunate to avoid a black card when his side led 0-9 to 0-7 as he hauled down Tadhg Morley as the Kerry wing-back looked set to pull the trigger on the edge of the large square, with referee Conor Lane instead giving a tick to O'Callaghan in a clear case of mistaken identity.By half-time, Kerry were on terms after an O'Shea free and superb Geaney point tied the scoreline at 0-10 to 0-10.However, just as in Dublin's semi-final win Mayo, the moments after the restart were to prove crucial as Murchan won possession immediately from the throw-in before charging straight through the middle of the Kingdom defence and nonchalantly finishing past Shane Ryan with the outside of his right boot.An immediate further O'Callaghan point extended the Dubs lead to four and while Kerry cut the margin to one by the 44th minute, they were never able to get on terms.Having introduced Diarmuid Connolly for the injured Jack McCaffrey at half-time, Dublin's bench also saw players of the quality of Philly McMahon, Cormac Costello and Kevin McManamon introduced.Kingdom supporters will ruefully look back on O'Brien's missed goal chance and a number of second-half wides - including two David Moran misses - which brought their tally to 10.But Dublin, helped by their reinforcements, controlled the closing 15 minutes of action as Kerry's brave challenge finally ran out of legs, with Connolly having a late Dubs goal chance saved in injury-time.Dublin: S Cluxton; D Byrne (0-1), M Fitzsimons, J Cooper; J McCaffrey, J Small, E Murchan (1-0); B Fenton, J McCarthy (0-1); N Scully (0-1), C Kilkenny (0-5), B Howard; P Mannion (0-4), C O'Callaghan (0-3), D Rock (0-3, 1 f).

sport	Walsall 0-0 Stevenage	WalsallStevenageFull TimeBookingSubstitutionSubstitution	The woodwork denied Walsall a last-gasp winner as Stevenage climbed off the foot of the Football League with a hard-earned point at their fellow strugglers.Danny Guthrie's 20-yard free-kick crashed back off the crossbar deep into stoppage time as League Two's lowest-scoring sides battled out a goalless draw.A stalemate looked the likeliest outcome after a dire first half in which neither side managed a shot on target - with Stevenage's Jason Cowley and Walsall's Dan Scarr heading decent chances wide.But after Rory Holden's 63rd minute header from a Josh Gordon cross was superbly tipped over by Stevenage keeper Paul Farman, the game became an end-to-end affair.Walsall pressed for a winner as Gordon headed Holden's cross over from six yards.Stevenage thought they had snatched the points with six minutes left but Paul Digby's close-range header was somehow hooked off the line by Scarr.Farman then tipped a rasping Gordon strike wide but could only watch Guthrie's late strike hit the bar as Stevenage moved above Morecambe into 23rd while Walsall slipped a place to 22nd.Match report supplied by PA Media.Match ends, Walsall 0, Stevenage 0.Second Half ends, Walsall 0, Stevenage 0.Attempt blocked.

sport	Marco Silva: Everton boss fighting to save job after Norwich defeat		"Everton manager Marco Silva is fighting to save his job after Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by Norwich City.The loss increased concerns behind the scenes at Goodison Park and it is understood major shareholder Farhad Moshiri held talks with fellow directors, including chairman Bill Kenwright and director of football Marcel Brands, after the game to discuss the growing crisis.The 42-year-old Portuguese, who has been Everton manager since June 2018, also met with Moshiri and Brands.Moshiri and Brands are both keen to maintain stability and support Silva, despite a furious reaction from Everton supporters towards the end of the loss, with many joining in chants of ""you're getting sacked in the morning"" from the travelling contingent.It remains to be seen, however, whether their patience and support extends to Silva being in charge for next weekend's visit to second-placed Leicester City, which is then followed by a visit to Premier League leaders Liverpool in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.Former Everton manager David Moyes and Mark Hughes have been mentioned inside the club as potential interim solutions - but Moshiri and Brands' preferred option has always been to give Silva time.The toxic atmosphere inside Goodison Park on Saturday, with Everton fans turning on the manager, has now placed huge pressure on Silva, Moshiri and Brands.Everton lie in 15th place despite heavy investment from Moshiri and have now lost to all three newly-promoted clubs, including home defeats by Sheffield United and Norwich City.Everton face a tricky run over the next few weeks, with matches against Leicester in the league and Carabao Cup quarter-finals, plus league games against Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City.""It is not the moment to talk about individual positions,"" Silva, 42, said after the game. ""We have to look what is best for us as a club and for myself and the players as well - but always the club has to be at the top.""If you are really disappointed with the afternoon I can imagine they [fans] are as well and they have the reaction to the manager and the players.""When you lose a match, the first person they look to is the manager. Football is like that.""The message is I respect what is their feeling, for sure. It is not the first time they felt the way they felt this afternoon.""Asked if he would be speaking to Moshiri, the Portuguese added: ""It is possible. Normally we do that. I cannot say to you 100% sure but [it is] normally something we do.""Silva replaced Sam Allardyce at Goodison Park in May 2018 and has won 25 and lost 22 of his 58 games in charge.The former Hull City and Watford manager was brought in with the hope of his side playing more attractive football and was backed with almost £90m of new signings in the summer of 2018.The Toffees finished eighth last season in Silva's first campaign but, after spending more than £100m on new players in the summer, they have won just four league games this season."

We have a unique opportunity to use this game to actually change the world for better. I hope you take that to heart, do something, we have incredible power in this room.""Before handing the award to Rapinoe, Infantino himself said more would be done to stop racism in football. He said: ""This is not acceptable. We have to say this. We have to say no to racism.""In whatever form, no to racism in football, no to racism in society. But we can't just say it, we must fight it, kick it out of football and society once and for all.""Rapinoe, who plays for Reign FC in the National Women's Soccer League, added: ""Jill Ellis and the rest have put us in a great position. This was an incredible year for women's football. For those who just noticed you are a bit late to the party. It truly was incredible to be part of the World Cup - the enthusiasm we had was amazing.""Netherlands' Sari van Veenendaal, who plays for Atletico Madrid after moving from Arsenal in July, won the best women's goalkeeper award, ahead of Chile's Christiane Endler and Sweden's Hedvig Lindahl.Van Veenendaal was the only player from last season's Women's Premier League to be included in the Fifa Fifpro Women's Team of the Year, while European champions Lyon were represented by three players - Bronze, Wendie Renard and Amandine Henry.Americans Kelley O'Hara, Julie Ertz and Rose Lavelle joined Rapinoe and Morgan in the 11, while Brazilian Marta, who scored the 17th World Cup goal of her career in the summer - a record in men's or women's football - was also selected.Goalkeeper: Sari van Veenendaal (Arsenal and Atletico Madrid/Netherlands)Defenders: Lucy Bronze (Lyon/England), Wendie Renard (Lyon/France), Nilla Fischer (Wolfsburg and Linkopings/Sweden), Kelley O'Hara (Utah Royals/USA)Midfielders: Amandine Henry (Lyon/France), Julie Ertz (Chicago Red Stars/USA)Attacking midfielders: Marta (Orlando Pride/Brazil), Rose Lavelle (Washington Spirit/USA), Megan Rapinoe (Reign FC/USA)Striker: Alex Morgan (Orlando Pride/USA)BBC Sport has launched #ChangeTheGame to showcase female athletes in a way they never have been before.

sport	The Nigeria Football Federation is facing a further corruption probe		"Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the EFCC, is conducting a new investigation into the country's Football Federation (NFF), it has revealed.The latest investigation comes on the back of a separate case brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and an ongoing one by the Special Presidential Investigation Panel (SPIP).The latest wide-ranging investigation is looking into fraud allegations over how sponsorship money meant for the development of football in the country has allegedly gone missing.""What I can confirm is that officials of the Nigeria Football Federation are being investigated by the agency,"" EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren told BBC Sport.BBC Sport understands that the investigation into the NFF will look at allegations of wrongdoing before the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.The inquiry is focusing on money generated from the NFF's official sponsors, domestic league's television sponsorship and payments from a former kit supplier for all the national teams.It also focus on funds provided by federal and state government for friendly matches involving the Super Eagles and the alledged misappropriation of about US$2.7 million from the Financial Assistance Programme of football's world governing body, Fifa.The EFCC did not elaborate on who they were investigating, but confirmed top officials of the federation are part of the latest probe.The NFF president Pinnick told BBC Sport that he was aware of the latest EFCC investigation and was seeking further clarification before making a comment..In May, the NFF president Amaju Pinnick told the BBC that he and four other top officials were being ""victimised"" and denied any wrongdoing over the alleged misappropriation of funds case brought by the SPIP for the recovery of public property.Meanwhile, the NFF and EFCC are also awaiting a legal judgement on the second case at the Federal High Court in the capital Abuja.That corruption trial involved three NFF accounts staff - director of finance, Christopher Andekin; head of finance and accounts Jafaru Mamza and Rajan Zaka, a cashier.The trio have denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty at their trial for allegedly embezzling US$9.5 million being grants from Fifa and Caf for the development of football in Nigeria.The EFCC has since filed an amendment for Pinnick and his general secretary Muhamed Sanusi to be charged along with the trio already in court in Abuja.The matter has since been adjourned and no date has been fixed for ruling, with Pinnick and Sanusi again strenuously denied any wrongdoing."
sport	Tokyo 2020: Nigeria's women seek Olympic football return		Nigeria women's coach Thomas Dennerby has named 18 locally-based players in a 24-woman squad to face Algeria in their two-legged 2020 Olympic qualifier.The established six overseas players, including Asisat Oshoala, Ngozi Okobi, Ngozi Ebere, Rasheedat Ajibade, Francisca Ordega and Oshinachi Ohale are all included as the Super Falcons seek to return to the Games after missing the 2012 and 2016 editions.The entire local Super Falcons squad will play the first leg of the second-round qualifier on 28 August in Blida.They will be joined by the six foreign-based stars for the reverse fixture in Lagos on 3 September.Algeria beat Chad 3-1 on aggregate to reach this stage, while continental powerhouse Nigeria received a bye into the second round.The winners will face Mali or Ivory Coast in the third round of the African qualifiers for the Tokyo Games.The West Africans went out of the 2000 and 2008 Olympics football events at the group stage, but reached the quarter-finals of the Athens Games in 2004.Nine-time continental champions Nigeria are the only African team to have played in all of Fifa's eight Women's World Cup tournaments since 1991, but they have failed to translate their continental dominance on the world stage.Their best performance at the World Cup came when reaching the quarter-finals in 1999.Nigeria squad:Goalkeepers: Tochukwu Oluehi, Christy Ohiaeraku.Defenders: Oshinachi Ohale, Ngozi Ebere, Glory Ogbonna, Emenayo Ugochi, Margaret Etim, Ibe Adedemi, Blessing Edoho, Maryam Ibrahim.Midfielders: Ngozi Okobi, Osas Igbinovia, Amarachi Okoronkwo, Cecilia Nku, Regina Otu, Goodness Onyebuchi.Forwards: Asisat Oshoala, Rasheedat Ajibade, Francisca Ordega, Alice Ogebe, Nneka Joy Eke, Rafiat Sule, Ejalonibu Adejoke, Philip Lola.

sport	'Even stats need a good pre-season' - recounting the story of Northern Ireland football's numbers man	'If you look for long enough you'll see something'How a boyhood hobby became a businessReporting for international dutyNorthern Ireland, George Best and being the best	"He's reluctant to admit it, but Marshall Gillespie probably knows more about football in Northern Ireland than anyone else.If you read or hear an interesting statistic about the Irish League or the Northern Ireland international team, there is every chance the 57-year-old former nurse has produced it.Indeed, such is the trust people now have in the Enniskillen native, he could say almost anything and it would be accepted as true - something he put to the test recently during a Northern Ireland match.""I said to a few of the guys in the media area that it was the first time four Northern Ireland players were wearing orange boots in an international at Windsor Park,"" he explained.""'Really?' they asked. I told them I was joking, but they did look at me as if it was true. I know quite a bit but not something like that.""Friends have said to me in the past that I could say anything and people would believe it. Maybe so, but I'm very honest. I take the utmost care in putting my information together.""The key is doing the donkey work in the summer - a pre-season for stats if you will. I'll sit down for hours, study specific teams or players and then I'll have an idea of what to keep an eye out for.""When Irish Premiership leaders Crusaders lost to Coleraine on Saturday, many observers were aware that it was their first league defeat of the season.What most people didn't realise, however, was that it was the Crues' 650th loss in the top flight since they first entered senior football in 1949. Until, that is, Gillespie's tweet dropped.""I'd been sitting on that one for a while,"" he reflected.So, what's the process that leads to having knowledge about such milestones to hand as soon as they happen?""I have a spreadsheet for every team in the Premiership, with details of their results going back to day one. I update that on a Monday, then it's a case of studying the numbers for any significant patterns that are developing.""I suppose my brain has just become attuned to it. At times I find myself just staring at a screen but if you look for long enough you will soon see something. For example, the weekend before Crusaders' defeat, I tweeted that Kirk Millar scored Linfield's 7,000th goal when he hit the winner in the Blues' 1-0 win over Glentoran.""One of the weirder ones was last season when I tweeted that the last eight league goals that Linfield had scored against Crusaders were by players whose Christian name began with J.""And one of the tweets I'm most proud of was quite a straightforward one about Northern Ireland's record in Euro qualifiers under Michael O'Neill - ahead of the Germany game they had won 10 and drawn three of the 14 matches. Simple, but it got a lot of pick-up.""As a young football fan growing up in County Fermanagh, Gillespie developed a liking for football yearbooks.""I had a head for facts and figures - I could always maintain weird and wonderful information,"" explained Gillespie, who has lived in England since leaving Northern Ireland in 1987 to pursue a career in nursing.""I'd get an edition of the Rothmans Football Yearbook, pick out the Northern Ireland players from the lists and follow their careers, even youth internationals who maybe never went on to play for the senior side.""Such was the time Gillespie was devoting to researching and maintaining data on Northern Ireland football, he left his full-time nursing job in 1997 to focus on this new freelance career.""I always had the dream of doing an Irish League edition of the Rothmans Yearbook, which I did for the first time in 1990. I then started doing an Irish League preview column in the Belfast Telegraph, called 'The Statman', and it all took off from there.""It's so much easier now to gather stats online but back then I had to rely on my parents posting rolled up copies of the local papers across to me. I would also have to send handwritten letters to the club programme editors for specific information.""As well as supplying weekly statistics to a range of media outlets from his home near Portsmouth, where the father of two lives with his wife, a lot of Gillespie's working week is consumed with a role he carries out for the Irish FA.""I go through all divisions of the English and Scottish leagues - as well as the Irish League - and record a wide range of information on every player from Northern Ireland,"" he explained.""It all goes into a formatted spreadsheet which is sent to the Irish FA after every round of games. It started when Lawrie Sanchez was in charge - I produced the stats for him and then Nigel Worthington before doing what I do now for Michael O'Neill.""While members of the football media industry will have been long-aware of Gillespie's work, the advent of social media has brought him to the attention of more fans, managers and players.""People will message me to ask something and I will always help them if I can. I get players tweeting me at times too - when Jamie McGonigle left Coleraine I sent him all his statistics from his time with the club.""Being a football fan was what started Gillespie on this path. The grandfather remains as devoted as ever to supporting Northern Ireland, and it will come as little surprise that he has a statistic to prove it.""I've only missed one international in Belfast in the last 30 years, despite living in England. It was a 2-1 friendly loss to Sweden on 24 April 1996 - Gerard McMahon in the 84th minute with his only ever international goal,"" he remembers.""I've attended 148 internationals at Windsor Park and was at the win over Ukraine in the Euros with my son, which was just fantastic.""As Gillespie's Twitter followers may have guessed from his choice of profile image, George Best is a hero of his. He never met the former Manchester United star, but almost did.""My wife found his agent's contact details and, unbeknown to me, invited him to my 40th birthday party,"" he explained.""George never made the party, but a few months later I did get a signed letter from him wishing me happy birthday. That was the mark of the man. I've collected all sorts of memorabilia on him which I keep in my office.""And when it comes to the numbers game, is Gillespie the best in Northern Ireland football?""It's difficult to say, but I've been doing it diligently for 35 years. I don't think anyone has the information and stats that I have."""
sport	Neil Etheridge: Cardiff City energised by boss Neil Harris, says goalkeeper		"Goalkeeper Neil Etheridge says new manager Neil Harris has ""energised"" Cardiff City's players even though they were sorry to see Neil Warnock leave the club.The Bluebirds made it four points from two games under Harris thanks to Tuesday's 1-0 win over Stoke.Etheridge, 29, says the top six is a target for Cardiff as they look to adapt to their new manager's approach.""The game changes - we have to move forward,"" he said.""A lot of the players were sad to see Neil Warnock leave after he brought so many of us into the team, but that's football and we need to move on.""The new gaffer has a new style of play. He wants us to adapt to that style and I think we're going well for the time being. We got a point away from home and three at home, so it's a good start.""Warnock's three-year reign ended earlier this month with Cardiff 14th in the Championship following relegation from the Premier League last season.Cardiff fought back from 2-0 down to claim a draw at Charlton in Harris' first game in charge before Stoke were beaten in his maiden home fixture thanks to Leandro Bacuna's goal.""Tactically he's changed things slightly,"" Etheridge added.""The philosophy of mixing up the style of play has got through to us.""It's a clean slate for everyone. Players who aren't playing are disappointed but the gaffer has done really well to keep everyone energised and he's made it clear that everyone will play in the upcoming games over Christmas and the rest of the season.""The Stoke win lifted Cardiff to within four points of the play-off places, and Etheridge says the target for Harris' side is to give themselves a chance of returning to the top flight next May."
sport	Neymar, Icardi, Messi, Sarri - this week's big talking points in European football	What kind of reception will Neymar receive?'Icardi did not want to leave Inter''Only two more years of Messi at Barca?''Old dogs, new tricks'And finally...	"After the international break, domestic top-flight football returns to Europe's top leagues this weekend.Will Neymar make his first appearance of the season for Paris St-Germain? Is Mauro Icardi already unhappy at PSG just days after completing a loan move from Inter Milan?And could Lionel Messi really be nearing the end at Barcelona?BBC Sport takes a look at this week's big talking points in European football.Having turned out for Brazil during the international break, Neymar could make his first appearance of the season for Paris St-Germain on Saturday.The question is: having pushed for a move away, what sort of reception will the forward receive?Neymar, 27, suffered an injury to his ankle on international duty in the summer and has yet to play for PSG this season.Having been heavily linked with a return to Barcelona, PSG fans displayed a banner which read 'Neymar Go Away' in August.""Will he feature for PSG on Saturday against Strasbourg? The club want him to,"" French football expert Julien Laurens told Radio 5 Live Football Daily's European show.""What kind of reception will he get off the fans?""Spanish football expert Guillem Balague said he expected Barca, who sold Neymar to PSG for a world record fee of 222m euros (£200m) in 2017, to re-sign the player.""Maybe not in the winter but they will try again next summer,"" he added.It was supposed to be a fresh start for Icardi when the Argentina striker joined Paris St-Germain on a season-long loan from Inter Milan on 2 September.But according to reports, the 26-year-old's wife and agent, Wanda Nara, has described the move to France as the ""worst option"" for her personally as Icardi has left his family back in Italy.""It's the worst choice because she does television in Milan and the pair did not want to leave,"" said Italian football expert James Horncastle.""Icardi wanted to persuade boss Antonio Conte that he had a future at Inter but Conte is not a man for turning.""If you look at Icardi's track record, he was one of the all-time top scorers for Inter, he has been their captain, he has stayed with them when they haven't been a team that has been in the Champions League, when they haven't been a team competing for anything seriously in Italy.""He felt he was due recognition for that but the club were unwilling to overlook everything that happened last year when his wife, who is also his agent, repeatedly went on television and criticised team-mates, criticised the coaching.""Conte didn't want any of that. It doesn't matter how good the player is, he didn't want him.""Could Messi's days at Barcelona be numbered?Having helped the Catalan giants win 10 La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, the Argentine forward is part of the furniture at the Nou Camp.But the 32-year-old has yet to make an appearance this season because of a calf injury - and that has sparked talk that Messi might leave Barcelona when his current contract expires in 2021.""Messi will not be playing when he is 40,"" said Balague.""He's 32 and for the first time I have started hearing stories of people close to Messi saying 'what if he only has two more years at Barcelona?'. I went into panic - 'only two more years of Messi?'""At the end of each season he decides whether he is fit or not. He's got it in the back of his mind that he can perhaps play at the next World Cup.""His contract at Barcelona finishes in 2021. The extra year between the end of that contract and the World Cup... does he play in the elite risking his body and his mind?""Or does he step down and prepare himself for his last World Cup in 2022?""Juventus have wins against Parma and Napoli under their belts despite missing new boss Maurizio Sarri, who has been ill with pneumonia.The chain-smoking Italian, 60, could make his first appearance on the Juve bench on Saturday since leaving Chelsea in June when the champions of Italy face Fiorentina in Florence.""What's been really interesting so far, even though Sarri has not been in the dugout, is that he has picked more or less the same team as the former boss Massimiliano Allegri did,"" said Horncastle.""Sarri has got old dogs performing new tricks.""In a scene straight out of DIY SOS, Napoli have posted a video on Twitter showing their unfinished dressing rooms with scaffolding still in place, pots of paint on the floor, sinks missing and electrical sockets unfinished.Napoli boss Carlo Ancelotti said he is ""shocked"" by the state of the dressing rooms following renovation work at Stadio San Paolo.The Serie A side played their first two games of the season away from home but host Sampdoria on Saturday before holders Liverpool visit in the Champions League on Tuesday.""It's a disgrace that a club as big as Napoli, in the Champions League, have what is essentially a stadium that is unfit for purpose,"" added Horncastle.""This is a common problem in Italy.""Most of the stadiums are run by the council and I think with Ancelotti going public on the club's website with this is very much the club taking a stand against the mayor of the city."""

sport	Mark Sampson: Stevenage caretaker charged with using racist language by FA		"Stevenage caretaker boss Mark Sampson has been charged with using racist language by the Football Association.The ex-England Women manager, 37, had been subject to an FA investigation since September after an allegation by a former coach at the League Two club.At the time Stevenage said the allegations had ""no foundation"".Sampson was sacked by England in 2017 after evidence of ""inappropriate and unacceptable"" behaviour with female players in a previous role.Before his dismissal, Sampson had that year been cleared of wrongdoing following discrimination allegations made by England players, including then Chelsea and Lionesses striker Eniola Aluko.The FA then apologised to Aluko and England team-mate Drew Spence for Sampson's racially discriminatory remarks after an independent barrister ruled he made unacceptable ""ill-judged attempts at humour"" on two occasions.In January the FA reached a settlement with Sampson after an unfair dismissal case.Former Bristol Academy boss Sampson has been charged with an ""aggravated breach"" of FA rule E3 and has until 6 December to respond.According to PA Media, it is alleged the remark was aimed at a player during a conversation about transfer targets.Sampson replaced Dino Maamria at Stevenage in September, with club chairman Phil Wallace backing him to become their permanent manager despite the Hertfordshire side being bottom of the fourth tier."

""I don't read much of what is written. And now I have been involved for many years, where there have been many rumours every year.""I know a lot of people are interested in where I play.

sport	Football hate crime at matches in England and Wales rose by 47% last season	'Some clubs see football policing as escapable costs'	"Incidents of hate crime at football matches in England and Wales rose by 47% last season, according to new Home Office figures.In the 2018-19 season there were hate crime incidents - 79% of which related to race - at 193 matches, up from 131.Manchester City's Raheem Sterling and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were among Premier League players targeted.But football-related arrests dropped overall by 10% to 1,381 in 2018-19.The Home Office report said the rise in hate crime is likely to be partially down to improvements in recording incidents at matches.Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out described the figures as ""a serious concern"".The organisation added: ""It's encouraging to see that more people are comfortable reporting discrimination and we are working hard to make this as easy as possible for all to do, but it is undeniable that we are experiencing a rise in hateful behaviour across the game and wider society.""These figures should serve as a reminder for football - we must increase our efforts to send a clear message to any fan who discriminates at a match: you will be identified, arrested and face a football banning order.""In a statement, the Football Association said: ""We strongly condemn all forms of discrimination and encourage all fans and participants who believe that they have been the subject of, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report it through the appropriate channels.""Incidents of anti-social and discriminatory behaviour can be reported to the relevant club, matchday stadium security, the police, Kick It Out or directly to The FA.""We work closely with key stakeholders across the game, including the Leagues and Kick It Out, to make it clear that football is an inclusive game and that discrimination, in any form, will not be tolerated.""Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts, from the National Police Chief's Council, says the scale of the problem could be worse but there are not enough police present at matches to respond to and report incidents, particularly in the lower divisions.DCC Roberts has criticised some football clubs for cutting back on policing costs while simultaneously paying millions of pounds on transfers and wages.""There's a problem with policing numbers at lower-league matches in particular. Some Football League clubs see football policing as escapable costs,"" he said.""They're more than happy to pay extortionate fees to agents for sometimes average players in terms of salary and transfer fees but the policing bill seems to be one they think they can cut back on, and I think that's a false economy.""Home Office statistics show football disorder remains at concerning levels - over the past two seasons, incidents reported are at more than 1,000 fixtures, and worryingly, this is becoming the new normality.""With the absence of police officers to witness and respond, we are reliant on supporters and other agencies to report matters to us, so there could be a lot that goes unreported.""There is also a reluctance from the leagues to share safety officer's reports with us at a national level.""Government data from the Home Office also showed:It is the seventh consecutive year reported incidents of discrimination within football have increased, and the 581 total reports of hate crime is more than double the figure from five years ago.The 152 matches at which there was racist abuse was an increase of 51% on the previous year.England star Sterling, 24, has spoken out on social media, suggesting newspapers' portrayal of black players fed prejudice and aggressive behaviour.The Manchester City forward has been praised for being a role model and won last season's Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award.In a statement, Stoke said: ""The latest Home Office statistics do not make for pleasant reading, but to provide some context 62 of the 80 arrests were as a result of anti-social behaviour that occurred both during and after the Checkatrade Trophy fixture against Port Vale in December 2018.""Of the other 18 arrests, only five of those were made at home fixtures at the bet365 Stadium where, working in partnership with the police and authorities, we are continuing to do everything we can to try and eradicate anti-social behaviour from football."""
sport	Micah Richards on the dark side of football - 'it's a lonely place, I felt like a ghost'	You don't get taught how to deal with the end of your careerA teenage knee injury and the training run that started the downward slope'The end. No doctor ever told me I was done'I never fell out of love with football	"""You're a money grabber"", ""You don't respect the shirt"", ""You're a virus, you are killing this club"".Those were the kind of messages I was getting every day on social media during the final months of my time at Aston Villa, and of course they hurt.I would be wondering how anyone could say that about me if they knew where I had come from, how hard I had worked, and what I was like as a person.But when you are an injured footballer, especially when you are out for as long as I was, you find out all about the dark side of the game.I was in a lonely place for a long time, and I did not know how to get out of it.I am a pundit now, not a player, but when I was getting abused by Villa fans on Twitter and Instagram, I was still battling to save my career.Deep down, I probably knew it was already over, but for most of the two and a half years between my 295th and final game as a professional, against Wolves in October 2016, and the day I announced my retirement in July this year, I was living in denial.I would keep on waiting for each new manager to come in at Villa and say to me 'I'll give you a chance', but it got to a stage where that could never happen, because although I could train 100%, I was never able to play.I could run and I could jump - but I couldn't twist on my right knee, and it would not get any better. Whatever I tried, it did not make any difference.There were times while I was injured at Villa when I felt like I was a ghost.They told me to come in three times a week, then two. Then one. I would stay at home waiting for the club doctor to text and say when I was needed.I got looked after brilliantly by all the medical staff there and I know the intention was probably to help me out, to save me travelling in, but it left me a lot of time on my own to think.All I wanted to do, still, was play football but I was fighting thoughts that my knee was never going to be good enough to do that. The fans were getting frustrated with me. And of course you also start to think that the club don't really want you there.I was not seeing much of my team-mates at the time, because I wasn't training with them. But even when I did, I would never talk about my emotions or express my feelings, so anyone talking to me at the time never truly knew what was going on.As a player, you worry about a lot anyway, but all footballers put on a front. I have played with players who I think have been depressed, and I have seen people just go 'oh, they will be all right'.It is the same away from football. When you are a successful footballer, you get put on a pedestal. You are the person your friends and family look up to, and they do not know how to approach you when things are going wrong, even when you just need someone to reach out to you and ask you if you are all right.The perception is you are a man, you are an athlete, and you are extremely well paid. You are supposed to be doing great.I don't want to say I was depressed myself, because there are people I know who have had issues with their mental health and have suffered from depression and I don't think what I went through was on the same level.I always tried to stay positive, and keep a smile on my face... but I needed help.There was a time for a few months where I was coming into training just for a gym session on my own. Steve Bruce, the manager at the time, would sometimes see me and say to me ""I am worried about you"" but each time, me being me, I would tell him I was fine. I really wasn't.I would go into the gym and tell myself ""I am all right, I am all right, I am all right"" but actually I had no idea how to deal with what was happening to me, and my body.I am a very positive person, but you don't get taught how to deal with the end of your career. Never.I made so many challenges, I don't even know when I first damaged my right knee.But I know the problems with it that eventually forced me to retire started when I was still a teenager.It was the beginning of 2008. I was 19, playing for England and City and living the dream. I loved every minute of the ride at that time; it was amazing.Then I got some swelling there after a game. I played through the pain for a bit but then I had to go and get it scanned. The doctor said it was not too bad; the cartilage just needed shaving down.So I did that, had my first operation on it, and I was out for four months. But from there, instead of getting better, that knee just got gradually worse and worse.Even so, I could manage it and still play regularly - I was City's first-choice right-back when we won the Premier League in 2011-12.But, early in the 2012-13 season, in a game against Swansea, I hurt it again. I knew straight away it was bad because the knee was locked and I could not straighten it. I had torn my meniscus, so I had more surgery and I was out from October until April.From then on, I started getting other injuries because of my knee - my hamstring kept going. But I could manage it, and if I treated it correctly, and trained the right way, I could play.Fast forward a couple of years and when Tim Sherwood signed me for Villa in 2015, he was brilliant. He knew what I needed to do in training, and I played every game for him.But then he was sacked and Remi Garde came in.He told me that if I couldn't do what he asked me to do in training, he couldn't pick me. As Villa's captain, I understood that. I felt I had to do what he asked, and I would never say no to my manager in any case.So I said: ""OK, I'll do it."" I still remember that day - we ran for miles, around a kind of obstacle course. Obviously I was at the back, because my back was hanging off and my knee was very sore.I got through it and he said ""you did well"" but I was just thinking: ""You have made me do that and you don't know what damage has been done.""From that day on, the swelling started coming back on my knee whenever I did anything. I felt like I was on a downward slope and I didn't know how to stop it.Because he only played me once, in his first game in charge, people seem to think Steve Bruce did not give me a chance at Villa, but that's not true.Before he arrived, in October 2016, I had not been training much because of the swelling but I actually managed some proper sessions when he took charge and my knee was coping with them.A game is very different, though. I lasted 66 minutes against Wolves and my body was hurting when I came off. I sort of played it down as being fatigue because I had played so few minutes over the previous few months, but the next day, my knee had blown up, and it was bad.Steve was very good to me and said I needed to go somewhere I could play once a week and manage my knee correctly. I tried to get out, and I had offers, but Villa wanted money for me - and nobody wanted to pay.He did not give up on me until the following summer, though. In that pre-season of 2017-18, I pulled my hamstring in the first five minutes of our first friendly game and I think that is when he lost faith in me. He told me that I was running in a weird way because of my knee and that was impacting me with other injuries.I was back fit again after 10 days and able to play so I was telling him I was ready, but by that time everyone else in the squad was fitter than me and I kept getting little niggly knocks, so I was never fit.By the time Dean Smith took over, in October 2018, I had not trained for three or four months.Again, with him I was thinking 'new manager, new chance' so I went outside for a training session. I thought I did OK, but obviously my heart-rate was being monitored, and everything else.Everyone else was running 5km or 6km, but I only managed around 4km. Dean spoke to me honestly afterwards and said: ""Look, I'd love to give you a chance in the team but you are nowhere near as fit as I need you to be. You are miles away from having the numbers you need, and it is not going to happen.""I actually respected him more for telling me that. Although it wasn't what I wanted to hear, it was then that I knew my career was probably over.But no doctor ever told me that I was done. I kept getting told that my knee was in a really bad way, but also that there were other people who had managed to continue playing by looking after it the right way.Me being me, I always gave it a go. I guess I did not want my career to end, but this summer I had to be realistic about it.It would have been easier to take if I was just no good any more, but I had to realise that my knee was never going to allow me to do what I wanted.It was time to give up the fight, and I was ready for a new challenge.Now I am a pundit, I want to talk about this part of the game and the effect it has on you, give my perspective on what is happening to current players and share my own stories that people might not know.I can look at everything from the other side now. I am only 31, but I know all about the pitfalls of being a professional footballer - the ups, and the downs.I could sit here and look back and think I wish I had done this or that, because I definitely made some mistakes along the way, but I am actually very proud of what I achieved.I won 13 England caps, a Premier League title and and an FA Cup, plus I played more than 250 games for City, had a spell abroad and then played for Villa in the city where I was born.The past few years have been difficult and the end, when it came, was something of a relief but it is not as if I ever fell out of love with football, quite the opposite in fact.Throughout all of this, I was determined I would not become a negative presence at Villa, no matter what happened.Whatever Villa fans think of me - and they can question my ability and whether I was good enough, because sometimes when I played for them I wasn't - they can never question my professionalism, whether I was injured or not.Towards the end of the 2015-16 season, when we were relegated from the Premier League, Eric Black became caretaker-manager and I got dropped, but I was captain and I wanted to try to continue to be a positive influence on the dressing room.Eric called me in and told me my attitude was absolutely spot-on. He said he could not believe how good it was, really, because he had left me out of the team.I said to him: ""Well what do you expect from me? How do you think I got this far in my career? It is not by luck.""I told him I have had a good attitude right from the start, because I've had to. I grew up in a part of Leeds called Chapeltown where opportunities are not handed out very often.When I was a kid, I decided I was never going to let myself down and lose out on anything by having a bad attitude, and I have always stuck by that.Yes, things can get me down, but I will never deliberately disrupt an environment or have a negative effect on other people. It is not the way I was brought up, and I don't think it is fair. If you know me, you'll know that.When I look back on my career, I know things could have gone better but I know I always gave everything I could, and I am content with that.Now, as an ex-player, I am in a happy place again, which is the most important thing.I just feel so lucky that I am still involved in the game and, in my new role, I will hopefully be able to explain what life as a footballer is really like.Micah Richards was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan."
sport	Formula 1 2019 review: Warning! Contains Sebastian Vettel	The one when Seb lost itThree poles… or maybe twoTwo weeks later… Ferrari attack, as a pairA bittersweet Italian Grand PrixFerrari implode, and the others get a go on the podiumThe one where Mercedes made a mess of thingsThe one with the bromance	"Another season, another trophy in the cabinet for Lewis Hamilton. By winning his sixth world title, the 34-year-old became statistically the second most successful driver in F1, behind only Michael Schumacher.But while Mercedes were busy hoovering up points for both the drivers' and constructors' titles, the rest of the season's entertainment was happening elsewhere - and it often involved Sebastian Vettel.Even if 2019 brought him only one race win and one pole position, he got top marks for turning what could have been a tedious year of racing into a thriller. Here's why...As the pressure was mounting on the four-time world champion to stop the run of mistakes that had begun in the second half of 2018, team-mate Charles Leclerc was taking most of the points - and all of the glory.But then, in Canada in June, Vettel came back with a bang to dominate qualifying and secure his first pole in nearly a year - since the previous July's German Grand Prix.Had Vettel's losing curse been lifted? It seemed as if the F1 circus was rooting for him to win in Montreal.But then Hamilton applied pressure while chasing him down, and the mistakes returned. The German went off on to the grass approaching a chicane, then returned to the track aggressively enough to push Hamilton towards the wall. That caused the stewards to pick up their clipboards and issue him with a five-second penalty.Cue Vettel shouting: ""Where the hell else was I supposed to go? I had grass on my wheels. They are stealing the race from us.""That wasn't the end of it. Vettel took the chequered flag, but once he discovered he wasn't the race winner, he went into another rant.""No, no, no,"" he said over team radio. ""Not like that. You have to be an absolute blind man - you go on the grass, how are you supposed to control your car? This is the wrong world.""The German's outrage caused him to disrupt the usual podium celebrations, park his car by the FIA officials instead of in front of the 'number two' board in parc ferme, and storm off into the Ferrari garage. He was then forced by an FIA official to fulfil his podium duties.On the way, he swapped the 'number one' board in front of Hamilton's car for the 'number two' where his should have been. A bemused Hamilton, who must have felt for his rival, dragged him up to share the top step of the podium - once Vettel had finally arrived.Unsportsmanlike behaviour? Not a bit of it... fans enjoyed it so much Vettel was voted driver of the day. And Ferrari even joined in with the refusal to accept defeat, upholding their long tradition of flying a flag at the factory in Maranello following a race win.Another driver quite happy to dispute the stats this year is Max Verstappen. The loss of his pole position in Mexico in October was not the first time he's been stripped of a top-three place because of a penalty, but it is the one he appears to refuse to accept.He was handed a three-place grid penalty after failing to slow under yellow flags on his final qualifying lap when Valtteri Bottas crashed, and even admitted his mistake in the post-qualifying news conference with a nervous giggle.Then again, his eight career victories have nearly all come amid some form of drama. Take the one in Austria in June - Verstappen's first win of the year and his second at the team's home race.The Mercedes pair were out of contention for the win with engine cooling issues, and so a rivalry blossomed between Verstappen and Charles Leclerc. A gripping on-track battle saw Verstappen chase down the Ferrari and pass with just two laps remaining.Just as Hamilton had done to Vettel in Canada three weeks earlier, Verstappen forced a mistake and made Leclerc run wide. At least, that's one way of looking at it. Another, if you're in the Ferrari camp, is that Leclerc was pushed clean off the track.There was a long wait to discover if Verstappen would keep his race win. The verdict - that his victory stood - was not called until hours afterwards. The Dutchman called it ""hard racing"".Ferrari came back with bite at the British Grand Prix. Verstappen and Leclerc faced off in one of the most intense battles of the modern F1 age.It even extended to the pits as they stopped for new tyres. The race to get back on track as quickly as possible meant a side-by-side duel that the Silverstone pit lane just wasn't designed for.They battled hard but fairly, and Leclerc held off Verstappen until a safety car on lap 20 ended their fight.Enter Vettel to take up the challenge. But instead of taking the fight to Verstappen, he piled into him. The German put himself to the back of the field, and left the Red Bull driver to trail home in fifth.Vettel not only collected a 10-second penalty, but also another two superlicence points to add to those from the 2018 US Grand Prix, and the Canadian Grand Prix after the ""grass on my wheels"" incident. They wouldn't be the last.There are many rules for a Ferrari driver. But number one, at the front of the rule book in giant font, is: 'Don't mess up in front of the Tifosi.' Leclerc adhered to it. Vettel didn't.Leclerc produced the perfect pole-to-flag victory in September - with a controversially cut corner and an aggressive defensive move thrown in for good measure. He did all that at an F1 circuit steeped in history, fending off Hamilton to become the first Ferrari winner at Monza since Fernando Alonso in 2010. Scenes.But what of Vettel? Ah, well. First, he lost a place on lap one to the Renault of Nico Hulkenberg. Then it got worse.Under no pressure from anybody, the German lost control and spun at the Ascari chicane. Then it got worse still.Attempting to re-join the track, Vettel did something to horrify Ferrari fans and driving instructors alike. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre? Forget it. Seemingly without looking, Vettel returned to the track and crashed into Lance Stroll, who then had to swerve dangerously to avoid a collision with Pierre Gasly.It was a shocking move to come from a driver so experienced, and another jaw-dropping moment in an already dramatic race.Then it got even worse.The stewards slapped Vettel with a 10-second stop-go penalty, and added three more points to his over-crowded superlicence. Three more after that would mean a ban.So was that the end of Vettel's dramas for the season?Don't be silly.The internal power struggle to be number one at Ferrari reached breaking point at the Brazilian Grand Prix in November, with a crash and a double retirement.Leclerc had been beating Vettel repeatedly on and off the track all season - even when the pair played with remote control cars in the paddock.In the closing stages of the battle for third at Interlagos, Leclerc made a clean lunge down the inside of his team-mate at Turn One.Vettel wasn't happy. He really wasn't happy. He responded by deploying DRS to attack back on the approach to Turn Four.The duo went wheel-to-wheel down the straight, As Vettel was pulling away, he turned in on Leclerc and the cars made contact. The result: suspension damage for Leclerc, and race-ending punctures all round. The stewards ruled it a racing incident and took no further action.The feud had finally erupted - and history had repeated. The move emulated one Vettel had made on Mark Webber at the 2010 Turkish Grand Prix in their Red Bull days.It was heartbreaking for Ferrari, but a joy to see two midfield teams - Toro Rosso and McLaren - make it on the podium. It was a particularly sweet moment for Red Bull's most recent reject, as he won a drag race with Hamilton on the final straight across the line. For this was Pierre Gasly's moment.Gasly - demoted from Red Bull to Toro Rosso in August - and Carlos Sainz joined Max Verstappen on the podium to celebrate a race which won't be forgotten any time soon.What happens when it pours down during a race, and cars come a cropper on a corner covered - inexplicably - with soap?If you're Vettel, you deliver the perfect race by coming from last to second, while much of the field crashes or retires.Such was the strange scenario in Germany in July, one made even odder by a rare Mercedes foul-up. The team arrived wearing 1900s-style outfits to celebrate 125 years in motorsport. They left having been sucked into enacting a full-on tribute to Wacky Races.To think, after a disappointing French Grand Prix the previous month, that the F1 community had debated whether the sport was getting stale. Germany provided a race for the ages - and a few surprises.Take, for instance, the drivers to spin off. Bottas - sure. Hulkenberg - understandable. Leclerc - a bit of a shock. But Hamilton? The multiple world champion came to grief at a corner covered, by the looks of it, in soap suds. Had Dick Dastardly paid a secret visit to Hockenheim? No one seemed able to explain - or take any action.You wouldn't get that kind of drama in a game of Mario Kart.However, the most shocking moment of the race was when Racing Point took a gamble on slick tyres in the closing stages as the rain subsided, and Lance Stroll took the lead.All bets were off on who would eventually stand on the podium, and to add to his list of dramatic victories, Verstappen won, with another display of masterful driving. Daniil Kvyat collected some champagne on the third step next to Vettel.Away from Vettel's antics, there are many things to be taken from 2019.There's the bromance between Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz; the close midfield battle and resurgence of McLaren; the fall of Renault's performance; the ladder Williams and Haas continue to climb towards achieving competitive form; the Red Bull mid-season driver swaps leading to the discovery that their talent pool is dry; and the continuous discussions about the 2021 regulations.But what is for certain, is that Formula 1 in 2019 has provided moments of laughter, tears, frustration, boredom and disbelief.

sport	Formula 1: Charles Leclerc says Sebastian Vettel should not have made move	Pressure between the two	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceCharles Leclerc says Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel knows he should not have made the move that triggered their crash in the Brazilian Grand Prix.But Leclerc added that he shares some of the blame for the collision that took them both out of the last race.Leclerc said: ""Seb probably shouldn't have gone to the left and he knows it, and I could have done a better job of avoiding him going to the left.""What is important is everything is clear now and we move forward.""Leclerc said the pair will be ""less aggressive with each other"" on track following discussions with team boss Mattia Binotto in the days between Brazil and the season-closing race in Abu Dhabi this weekend.Leclerc said: ""We will be able to race. We are both very competitive and want to win.""We need to find the right compromise - we both race for the same team. We need to give each other a bit more space.""Leclerc was speaking in the official news conference in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Vettel was also due to attend but was allowed to arrive late at Yas Marina following the birth of his third child.Leclerc said that he and Vettel had spoken about the incident and agreed both could have done more to avoid it.The crash happened when Vettel was trying to re-take fourth place approaching Turn Four after Leclerc had passed him into Turn One with five laps to go.Vettel moved over on Leclerc and his left rear wheel hit Leclerc's front right, breaking his suspension and giving the German a puncture.Leclerc said: ""We called with Seb and we tried to understand both our situations.""We looked at it - and I particularly looked at it - to try to understand how we could have made things better.""The consequences were huge but the impact was very small, so that was a little bit unlucky. It was unfortunate but we will make sure it doesn't happen again.""The incident was the latest in a series of controversies between the two Ferrari drivers this season.Pressure has been building all year as Leclerc has emerged as a major force in F1 and threatened Vettel's primacy in the team and has more wins, poles and points than his four-time champion team-mate.In the early races of the season, there were a series of team orders calls, usually in Vettel's favour.These stopped happening as Leclerc established a general superiority through the mid-season and out-qualified Vettel nine races in a row.But from September tension has grown between the two as Vettel has re-found his form and begun to out-qualify Lelcerc again.At the Italian Grand Prix, Leclerc failed to carry out his side of an agreement in which each driver agreed to give the other a slipstream in qualifying, which angered Vettel.Ferrari that inadvertently managed to get Vettel ahead of Leclerc and into the lead in Singapore when simply trying to pass Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes, who was between the two Ferraris.And in the subsequent race in Russia, Vettel directly ignored a team order to let Leclerc back into the lead as part of a pre-arranged plan to ensure the two Ferraris were running one-two.Leclerc had qualified on pole, with Vettel third, and Leclerc agreed to give his team-mate a tow down to the first corner to ensure and let him past, to ensure he overtook Hamilton, who had qualified second.Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto has told the drivers the incident in Brazil was ""not acceptable"" and said the team ""know how to move forward""."

All the races will be available live and free-to-air on BBC online platforms.France's Jean-Eric Vergne has won the past two editions of the championship but faces a fresh challenge with German manufacturing giants Mercedes and Porsche joining a series that last year produced nine different winners from 13 races.""The opportunity of winning a third successive title makes that the objective of the team - but we'll be concentrating on the first race and then taking every race as it comes after that,"" the DS Techeetah driver said.""It gives me pleasure to represent France and get the Tricolor flag on to the podium, and especially for a constructor like DS that is up against the two new constructors this season in Mercedes and Porsche.""Formula E was launched back in 2014 with sustainability in mind, and organisers saying the aim was to ""reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible"".To achieve this, cars are powered by a battery that is made with 100% renewable fuel, and tyres that, as well as lasting an entire race, can also be recycled afterwards. Spectators are encouraged to use public transport to get to events, with no public car parking available.One drawback in the past was the sight of drivers having to swap cars mid-race because the battery could not last the distance, but the Gen 2 cars - introduced last year - are fitted with a battery that lasts the entirety of a race.With the car manufacturing world looking to switch to developing almost exclusively electric cars within the next couple of decades, Formula E provides them with the ideal arena to test new technology at a competitive level.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAnother unique feature of Formula E is the audience interaction with spectators playing a key role in the action during races.'Fan Boost' has been a feature of the past few seasons, with viewers able to vote using an app to determine which driver gets some extra power during a race.A more recent feature is 'Attack Mode', which gives competitors a speed boost after they drive through an allocated area on the track. Designed to introduce extra unpredictability into the racing, the use of this mode by a driver can have an effect on deciding the race.The resulting action has been unpredictable, especially last season, which saw several different winners from the field, many controversial on-track incidents and one race only decided a metre before the line.MercedesDrivers: Stoffel Vandoorne, Nyck de VriesFormer McLaren F1 driver Vandoorne is embarking on his second Formula E season after securing one pole and one podium in his maiden campaign with HWA Racelab.Dutch rookie De Vries moves into the series fresh from winning the 2019 Formula 2 Championship.PorscheDrivers: Andre Lotterer, Neel JaniPorsche are better known for endurance racing but have made the move into the electric series.

sport	Formula 1: Red Bull & Honda title contenders in 2020? Jolyon Palmer	Albon - good but can still do betterGasly superb since demotionSurely some regrets over losing Sainz	Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer is part of the BBC team and offers insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors.Only a hit from Lewis Hamilton put a taint on Red Bull's day at the Brazilian Grand Prix.As Alexander Albon was sent spinning out of second place behind team-mate Max Verstappen on the penultimate lap, it ruined the team's chance of a double podium, or perhaps even a one-two finish.Albon's misfortune, though, did promote former Red Bull driver Pierre Gasly - now back at Toro Rosso after his demotion mid-season - into second place. That gave Red Bull's junior team their second podium of the year, after Daniil Kvyat's third place in Germany, and engine partner Honda the biggest boost of all.Not only did Honda get a one-two, but they achieved the second place in the best manner possible for an engine manufacturer - a drag race to the line, against the formerly dominant Mercedes power.Gasly hung on around the outside against Hamilton on the flat-out sprint from Juncao corner to the finish line, against the odds, and claimed his first Formula 1 podium. In doing so, Gasly showed Honda are well and truly in the fight now.Of course it counted for very little in Brazil, but if Red Bull can do what they've so far failed to do in the hybrid era - start the following season as competitive as they finish the last - then the Verstappen/Red Bull/Honda package could be a force to be reckoned with in 2020.For Honda in particular, this was a moment that must have caused such joy. It was only four years ago that McLaren drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button publicly mocked them by ironically stepping out onto the Interlagos podium after yet another woeful qualifying display, to the amusement of fans and the bemusement of Honda.In truth, Honda were poor back in 2015. They took a lot of stick, but the unreliability and lack of performance were clear for all to see.Four years later, they are back with two drivers on the same podium, only with none of the mocking irony, just pure ecstatic emotion. A turnaround complete.Honda were dragged through the mud during the Alonso and McLaren years, but since teaming up with Toro Rosso last year, and now Red Bull in 2019, their performance improvements have been vast.I bet if you had told Alonso this would happen when he parted ways with the engine manufacturer at the end of 2017, he would have laughed in your face.So with the regulations staying stable for 2020, there should be every chance that Red Bull can challenge over the course of the season.Verstappen is driving absolutely at the top of his game right now. A year ago, he was already well on this trajectory, and displayed it by comfortably getting the better of then team-mate Daniel Ricciardo.Ricciardo is a top driver, proven by his seven career race wins. He won twice for Red Bull last year and took two pole positions as well.But aside from those pole positions, he actually out-qualified Verstappen only twice more all year, in Baku and in the Abu Dhabi season finale.This illustrates why some suggested last year that when Ricciardo signed for Renault he was running away from the Verstappen fight - the Dutchman out-paced Ricciardo in qualifying by a fraction under 0.2 seconds on average.Red Bull have had a headache in replacing him.They initially chose Gasly, but, after he struggled in the first half of the season, he was replaced by Albon, who it has now been confirmed will keep the seat in 2020.Albon has undoubtedly been stronger in the Red Bull than Gasly, and would have been on the podium in Brazil had it not been for Hamilton's overzealous passing attempt into Bico de Pato on the penultimate lap. But his qualifying deficit to Verstappen is 0.42secs - more than twice that of Ricciardo.Albon has been impressive in race conditions, to an extent. His race-craft has been particularly strong since he joined Red Bull, often charging from the back of the grid after a penalty to finish on the back of the main race, and he has made some sumptuous overtakes - including around the outside of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in Brazil.But at the moment he still seems unable to make any inroads into the 'A' race. While Verstappen took pole position and was heading to victory in Brazil, Albon qualified sixth and was heading for a finish there until Valtteri Bottas' Mercedes engine expired and mixed up the race.All the while Albon has been doing OK - but perhaps not quite progressing as well as Red Bull would have hoped after a strong opener in Belgium - Gasly has been sensational back in the Toro Rosso.Since being demoted after the summer break, Gasly has been in the points in five out of eight races, which would have been six without a late incident in Austin two weeks ago.He has out-qualified Kvyat in every race bar Mexico, where he lost out by 0.1secs. His average qualifying pace is now 0.3secs faster than the Russian and he has made it through into the top 10 qualifying shootout in the past four races.Had Gasly never been called up to Red Bull in the first place, he would seem a shoo-in for a 2020 berth at the team. Sadly for him, his dismal start to the season meant Albon was the obvious choice.But for Red Bull to be truly competitive in 2020, they will need two cars in the fight, which has never really happened since Ricciardo left at the end of last year.Time and time again, when the field is closely matched, we see races won or lost on strategy. In Hungary, Gasly was a lap behind Verstappen, and so too far back to stop Mercedes doing the extra pit stop that led to Hamilton attacking and eventually passing for the win.In Brazil, Albon was at least within a pit-stop distance of Hamilton for much of the race, meaning the Briton would have to pass him and lose out on track position if he pitted in his attack on Verstappen for the win. But in all honesty he was no true deterrent because he was too far back and would have been a sitting duck for Hamilton on fresh tyres anyway.Albon has definitely got some potential, and finishing on the podium in Brazil would have done him a world of good before he begins next season with the main team.Right now, though, there is still work for him to do on the whole if he is going to get himself into the main fight with the five other drivers from the big teams.With Kvyat and Gasly being quickly discarded by Red Bull, Albon will probably feel under some pressure, particularly with Gasly coming back into fine form in the Toro Rosso.But Red Bull themselves will be desperate for Albon to be a success in the main team. After two demotions from their past three promotions, there are question marks over their once formidable junior driver programme.The question marks about Red Bull's second driver are not helped by the superb form of their former employee Carlos Sainz, who also claimed his first F1 podium in Brazil following Hamilton's post-race penalty - and did so after starting dead last following an engine issue in qualifying.They won't admit it, but I'm sure there are many at Red Bull who are not only ruing the fact Ricciardo left, but also not taking Sainz in the first place as replacement for the Aussie.Sainz is comfortably best of the rest behind the top teams this season. He is in a battle with both Albon and Gasly for sixth in the championship, and must be favourite to finish there, despite the others being in the far superior Red Bull for half a season apiece.Sainz pushed Verstappen hard when they were together at Toro Rosso in 2015 and 2016. If only he was there doing that now, the Red Bull team would be a lot more formidable than the Verstappen show it currently is.But there is still a chance for Albon to prove Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko and the rest of the hierarchy right.After all, he is still a rookie for another race. And perhaps now having a future guaranteed - in the short term at least - can provide him a bit more comfort and confidence heading into a winter break that will be so critical to both him and the team if they are to be genuine 2020 challengers.
sport	Formula 1 launches a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030	How will Formula 1 do it?'You shouldn't be afraid to speak out for positive change'	"Formula 1 has launched a plan to become carbon neutral by 2030.The intention is to wipe out the carbon footprint of activity at race tracks, including road and air transport of staff and equipment to the events.F1 says it will ""move to ultra-efficient logistics and travel and 100% renewably powered offices, facilities and factories"" and offset emissions that cannot be cut.F1 said as a first step it would begin carbon-reduction projects immediately.It added that it will make all events ""sustainable"" by 2025, including eliminating single-use plastics and ensuring all waste is reused, recycled or composted.And in 2021, rules will demand that the petrol used in F1 has a biofuel content of at least 10%.The high-tech turbo hybrid power-units used to power F1 cars since 2014 are the most efficient car engines in the world in terms of the percentage of fuel energy that is converted into power, a measurement known as thermal efficiency.F1 engines have a thermal efficiency rating of 50%, whereas a road-car petrol engine is generally in the region of 30%.The current engines are in line to continue until the end of 2025, and F1 is to look at ways of ensuring that whatever specification of engine is used from 2026 takes another step forward in efficiency.The sport's owners added that they hoped to work with the automotive industry to apply the lessons of F1's engines to create ""the world's first net-zero carbon hybrid internal combustion engine"".In-depth conversations with road-car manufacturers on this area have not yet begun but they will focus on the development of synthetic fuels, which use carbon captured from the air, farm waste or biomass.F1 says it has come up with its plan to have a net-zero carbon footprint ""after 12 months of intense work with motorsport's governing body the FIA, sustainability experts, F1 teams, promoters and partners"".Instigating the plans will require the assistance of the teams, some of whom employ more than 1,000 people to design, develop, build and race the cars that take part in more than 20 grands prix a year.F1 says all have signed up to the project. And some have already started working towards this goal.World champions Mercedes, for example, say they have been powering their two F1 factories in the UK entirely by renewable energy since early October and that they are on target to have net-zero carbon emissions by the end of next year through a combination of reducing CO2 emissions and offsetting.Chase Carey, the chairman and chief executive of F1, said: ""Over its 70-year history, F1 has pioneered numerous technologies and innovations that have positively contributed to society and helped to combat carbon emissions.""From ground-breaking aerodynamics to improved brake designs, the progress led by F1 teams has benefited hundreds of millions of cars on the road today.""Few people know that the current F1 hybrid power unit is the most efficient in the world, delivering more power using less fuel, and hence CO2, than any other car.""We believe F1 can continue to be a leader for the auto industry and work with the energy and automotive sector to deliver the world's first net-zero carbon hybrid internal combustion engine that hugely reduces carbon emissions around the world.""FIA president Jean Todt said his organisation and F1 were ""committed to driving development and ensuring motorsport grows as a laboratory for environmentally beneficial innovations"".F1 plans to offset emissions through a combination of replanting trees and using the engineering knowhow in the sport to develop new technologies that can capture carbon from the atmosphere.It calculated the sport's total carbon emissions in 2018 as 256,551 tonnes, not including fans' transport to races, comprising:Elsewhere in F1, world champion Lewis Hamilton has become outspoken on global environmental issues, including extolling the virtues of a plant-based diet in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The six-time champion has pledged to ensure his life and business activities are carbon-neutral by the end of the year, is working with Mercedes to make relevant changes and after selling his private plane last year is reducing flying as much as possible.After being accused of hypocrisy because of his role in F1 and the number of flights he has to take as part of his job, Hamilton admitted the subject was ""not easy"" but added: ""That doesn't mean you should be afraid to speak out for positive change.""His position was backed by a number of his leading competitors, including four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel.The Ferrari driver said last month: ""It is very difficult for us to have acceptance from the outside because we don't have the smallest [carbon] footprint. The races are around the world and we do have to travel.""But I feel F1 should do more. It is a worldwide operating platform and we should send a more positive message."""

sport	Lewis Hamilton's 'most impressive season' in Formula 1	A promise to himself fulfilledThe unseen skills'He will not go quietly into the night'	"After clinching his sixth world title, Lewis Hamilton talked in abstract rather than concrete terms about the scale of his achievement.""I am working on a masterpiece,"" he said, ""and I haven't quite finished it yet. I am trying to understand. It takes a long time to master a craft and while I feel like I am mastering it, there is still more to master, still more to add to it, still more pieces of the puzzle to add.""There will be more ups and downs along the way, but I feel I have the best tools now to be able to deal with those.""Hamilton's achievement moves him ever closer to becoming the most successful Formula 1 driver of all time, as Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles is within reach next year.It comes towards the end of arguably Hamilton's most dominant year, but that in itself raises questions about how to assess where it stands in his career.Hamilton's 2019 has lacked the stand-out 'wow' moments so often associated with him, such as happened last year with his out-of-nowhere pole lap at Singapore, or his stunning race victory in Italy.On the other hand, he has been more seamless, more remorseless, more consistent than ever before.And inside his Mercedes team, they have no doubts about just how high a level Hamilton has reached this season.Mercedes chief engineer Andrew Shovlin says: ""It's perhaps not been his most spectacular season but in many ways it's been his most impressive season. Making mistakes, I can't really think of any things he's done wrong.""Technical director James Allison adds: ""He's just been a points machine, getting them wherever. He's won a lot of races.""[He's been] every bit as strong as last year, just not quite as flashy. It doesn't have that single stand-out appeal of the Singapore lap sort of plucked from nowhere, or the inch-perfect positioning of his car to force Vettel into a mistake in Monza. But go look at his Mexico race if you want to see a professional driver at the peak of his power.""In the past two weeks, Hamilton has produced two drives emblematic of a year in which the 34-year-old has arguably been more complete than ever before.There was the victory in Mexico Allison referred to, founded on the controlled way he managed his pace after the team made an early pit stop to jump him into the lead.And then in Austin on Sunday, he clinched the title with a race that mixed a clinically aggressive first lap, including a stunning overtaking move around the outside of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, and then a risky one-stop strategy in an attempt to win from a disadvantageous position that came so close to coming off, as he again managed his tyres with expertise.But those are just two of a series of top-drawer drives. What has impressed Allison most about Hamilton in 2019 has been ""just the metronomic consistency of his race performances all year. He and the car have not clicked in qualifying in quite the way he did with last year's car, but boy oh boy does he make it stick on a Sunday.""From the beginning of the season, he has been really strong. Despite the fact that Valtteri [Bottas, his team-mate] has had a more consistent and more competitive year, Lewis has built up a very big points advantage by being race after race after race the strongest out there.""The standard view of Hamilton is of a mercurial driver who hits incredible peaks, but also has weekends where, as his former team-mate Jenson Button has said, ""you wonder where he'd gone"". There have been none of those this year, just a relentless drive towards success.This change, it transpires, has come of an active choice Hamilton made before the season.""He said of himself to us that he was determined for 2019 to start the year with the strength he'd finished 2018,"" Allison says. ""That was his promise to himself, that he wasn't going to start weakly and then amaze everyone when he put the pedal down later in the year, because we have all seen that Lewis who switches on like a rocket in the second half of the season, that's happened more than once.""But he stated at the end of last year that he was going to be operating at his best from the start of this year and that's what he's done.""Shovlin adds: ""You notice it in the conversations with him, where previously the goal for every weekend was stick it on pole and win the race and when that wasn't achievable, that would often lead to over-trying.""And you notice it in the conversations you have in the office, where he is thinking a bit more of the long game.""When you look at the good drivers, and certainly the multiple world champions, there is quite a process where they sort of reinvent themselves a bit over the winter and come back stronger.""It's almost like when you get a new operating system for your phone, and it's not that different, but there are a few bug fixes and a few improvements and stuff, and you don't notice it until you go back three or four versions and you think: 'Wow, that's changed a lot.' And I think that's the case with good drivers and certainly the case with Lewis.""Every year, he has come back as this more complete driver. There is more that he is capable of. There are areas he starts trying to exploit to find performance.""The last few years a lot of that has all been out of the car - what he's looking at doing in terms of the work in the factory, and how hard he's developing that area. Also how he's dealing with races that don't go how he'd hoped they would go, how quickly he re-engages and gets back focused on the next race and those are all areas where he has just got better and better and better.""A lot of people like to have this image of what Lewis was like as a driver, it was all natural ability, not the working hard bit. But he has evolved enormously in his time with us, and he's one of the hardest working drivers I've seen.""So much has come from when he made a mistake, he was very critical of what he could have done better. But now he puts so much analysis into making sure he doesn't make the same mistake twice and 'how can I avoid mistakes, and where do these situations start to go away from me and start to go wrong?'""That's something that has led to this championship. He has really had it under control for a long, long time. And I think it's been perhaps the one he has played more than any other as the long game.""In the car, too, the breadth of Hamilton's abilities is often under-recognised. Yes, he's blisteringly fast, but there is an immense subtlety to his technical understanding of the car, and the range of skills he has to adjust to what it needs as it changes in real time.""One of the key things is you're trying to balance the workload on the front and rear axle,"" Shovlin says. ""So is it a race where we're hurting the front tyres; are we overheating the rears?""Lewis has a very good feel for which tyres he has to look after. Of the four, it might be one or two he has to look after, and he feels that very early in a stint. He's able to tune the car and how he drives to be able to do that. He thinks about how he's extracting the lap time around the circuit. Which of the corners are going to be hurting those tyres.""It's something every driver can do; it's just that Lewis can go so much further in terms of really getting that right and being successful. And then you've got mixed conditions and all of those things he deals well with.""Allison gives the example of the first sector of the lap at Barcelona, where the long, high-speed, right-hander of Turn Three punishes the left-front tyre, which therefore becomes the limiting factor in performance, over both a single lap and, especially, a race distance.""In that first sector there are some left-handers as well,"" Allison says, ""and Lewis will float round the right-handers and then hammer the lefts because the front left is getting hard used, and the front right is under-used.""So he can smash the front right and know that overall it is going to be OK because the front left is the limiting tyre. And his instinctive ability to feather one and hit the next and then feather the third is really impressive - remarkable.""Another example is how Hamilton manages what is known as 'lift-and-coast', when a driver has to lift off the throttle at the end of the straight before the normal braking point, allow the aerodynamics to slow the car, and then brake later than he would normally do, to save fuel or brakes or both.Allison refers to the telemetry graphs teams use to analyse performance, which feature lines along an axis that go up and down corresponding to the speed of the car.""If you imagine, the line would go up to the end of the straight, hit the brakes and there'd be a downward line (as the speed decreases). Instead, he's lifted off and then he'll hit the brakes.""When Lewis puts the brakes on, he always intercepts perfectly the line he would have been on if he'd carried on full beans to the end of the straight and then hit the brakes. He'll be exactly on that same line, as if he'd never done the lift-off, as if he was perfectly in that same braking moment.""It's really interesting to be able to hit that every single time exactly the same. And just the delicacy of his right foot. He doesn't break traction unless he wants to, and yet he can make the car fast without spinning up the wheels.""Ask Allison if there was one moment that stood out for him about Hamilton's season and he does not pick a victory, or a qualifying lap, but something that reveals the intense competitiveness driving the 34-year-old.""It would be nothing to do with his driving; it would be a character thing,"" Allison says. ""And that was Japan. We won the [constructors'] championship in Japan and for a whole series of reasons we took decisions that were right for the team and a tough pill to swallow for Lewis - securing the championship for the team in a way that was best for the team.""He swallowed it with good grace. So he didn't throw the dummy out of the pram in public. He didn't make a big scene about it. But the pain it caused him… For every normal mortal, you're looking at a bloke with an enormous lead in the championship, who is going to be champion.""For Lewis, the pain of finishing one position, maybe two positions, lower than he might have done as a result of other factors caused him a pain that I think would have been no less large than it would have been for the 19-20-year-old Lewis with everything to prove and no points on the table and a hunger to become champion.""The extent to which that distressed him just shows how much he cares about winning - with all his plaudits, with nothing to prove to anyone in the world, but for himself. He will not go quietly into the night without taking everything that's available when he gets behind the wheel of a car.""And if you want to understand why Lewis is the champion he is, just look how upset he was at that.""And by the way not upset with us - he could understand why we did it. Upset just because he could have had more points that race.""And for a normal, reasonable person, it would have been: 'Ah well, I'll get it done at the next race, or the one after that.'""But that isn't who he is. He's a champion and it matters to him so much that you can understand why he is as driven as he is - and why I think he will finish his days in a racing car as the most successful driver ever."""
sport	Formula 1: Toto Wolff to miss Brazil Grand Prix - his first since joining Mercedes		"Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff is to miss this week's Brazilian Grand Prix, the first time he has been absent from a race since joining them in 2013.Wolff said the team had ""hunger and desire for more achievements"" but that he was staying in Europe ""to focus on other open topics"".The most senior executive there will be technical director James Allison.But Wolff insists Mercedes want to end the Formula 1 season on a high despite already clinching both championships.""There's no sense of complacency. Everybody is still determined to keep on improving,"" he said.Wolff in his role as head of Mercedes Motorsport has a number of other pressing issues to deal with in addition to the running of the F1 team.These include ongoing negotiations with F1 over the new commercial and governance structures that will be put in place from 2021, following the announcement of new technical rules at the end of last month.Mercedes are also making their debut as a factory team in the all-electric Formula E series, the new season of which starts in Saudi Arabia the weekend after the Brazilian Grand Prix.Wolff, who will remain across developments in Sao Paulo this weekend from Europe, said that Mercedes' hunger for success remained undimmed after they celebrated their record-breaking sixth consecutive drivers' and constructors' championship double at their factories in Northamptonshire last week.""It's an inspiring group of people that fully lives up to the Mercedes aspiration of being the best,"" he said.""We have two races to go in the 2019 season and we want to end this season on a high.""Brazil brings back fond memories from last year when we were not only able to win the race but also secure the constructors' championship at Interlagos.""It's a very short track which makes qualifying particularly challenging as the margins are very small. We have generally not had the fastest car on Saturdays since the summer break, but we were able to take pole (at the last race) in Austin and will try to fight for a front row start again at Sao Paulo.""Lewis Hamilton, who clinched his sixth world title at the last race in the USA, has also said he is determined to keep up his strong performances in Brazil and the season finale in Abu Dhabi.Hamilton wants to end the season with two more wins, which would make it the most successful season of his career, and he is especially keen to improve his record in qualifying.Although he has out-qualified team-mate Valtteri Bottas 12 times in 19 races, Hamilton has only four pole positions to the Finn's five and he is keen to try to address that."
sport	Formula 1 rule changes: The Secret Aerodynamicist	What is the idea behind the new rules?Why is the wake so problematic?How can this problem be fixed?Would the new rules work?How are the teams approaching the rules?	Design offices in Formula 1 teams, such as the one I work in as a senior aerodynamics engineer, face a tricky balancing act at this time of year.There is still some work going into the last few end-of-season car upgrades, but the vast majority of our efforts are now on next year's car. It's a trade-off we've been playing with for some months now, actually.There is always the temptation to roll the dice and switch development to next year's car early on in the season, hoping to jump up the grid.But the flip side is that your current car might be out-developed by other teams and you find yourself losing out on prize money, only to underperform next year anyway.It's a gamble that has paid off for some in the past but has knocked other teams back for years.This year, that particular calculation is made all the more complicated by the major overhaul to the technical regulations being planned for 2021.Trying to decide how soon to start looking at the design for 2021 and how much resource to put on it has been difficult, especially when the proposed rules have continued to change and - depending on how the political situation develops in the sport - may not even be introduced at all.The big three teams are opposing the new rules and Ferrari have the nuclear option of vetoing them. In that event, any work we put in now could be a complete waste of time.The aim of the new regulations is to make it easier for one car to follow another car without losing performance, and therefore to get closer racing and more overtaking.At the moment, drivers find it very difficult to get close enough to a car in front to overtake it. Why is it so difficult and how might the new proposals help?Aerodynamics is often blamed for the difficulty in following another car. Ultimately, this all comes down to wake, which is what we call the churning, turbulent air which comes off the back of bluff bodies like a Formula 1 car.Because it is hard to see this air, it can be difficult for people to picture what is going on here. To get an idea, watch an oar being pulled through a river. You can see the swirling water dragged along behind it. This is the oar's wake and it's very similar to the air behind an F1 car.The reason F1 cars travel so fast around corners is because they are pushed down on to the track by aerodynamic downforce - this makes the tyres grip and stops the cars from skidding off the road at speeds that would put most cars backwards into a hedge.Downforce comes from generating suction or low pressure underneath the car, and to lower the pressure of air you have to increase its speed.But the ability of the car to create downforce is affected by the nature of the air that the car is passing through. Give it nice, smooth air - or 'clean', as we aerodynamicists sometimes call it - and the downforce-producing surfaces of the car work well. If the air is messy and turbulent - or 'dirty', as we say - they don't.After air has gone over an F1 car, it is swirling around and travelling in all directions. It's also been dragged along a bit in the direction of the car ahead. Effectively, it's not travelling towards the car behind as fast as it could be.Because of this, it's not possible to make this 'dirty' air travel under the car as fast as 'clean' air. So the car behind produces less downforce, which the driver will notice as a loss of grip.Wake is not just a problem for the car behind. The wake produced by some parts of your own car creates difficulties, too.An example of this would be the air disturbance created by the front tyres. This has a seriously negative effect on the parts further along the car that are designed to produce downforce. The result of this is that aerodynamicists want to push the wake from their front tyres as far out to the sides as possible to stop it from getting sucked under the floor of their own car.What happens to it after that is of little concern to us. It is, however, of concern to the owners of F1, because this air tends to get drawn back in, around a second behind, right on to any following car whose driver might be thinking about trying to overtake.This is where the new regulations come in. In order to try to reduce this problem and allow cars to follow much more closely, F1 has taken a two-fold approach.The first step is to tightly restrict what geometry we can design at the front of the car, particularly the front wings and in the areas around the front wheels.This will reduce our ability to push the tyre wake away from the car.The second is to allow for much more powerful diffusers - the curved part of the rear floor of the car, where the air underneath the car exits - and rear wings.This is intended to have the effect of scooping up the wake and throwing it over the top of any following car - creating an 'up-wash', as it is known.There is concern from some quarters that this extra up-wash itself will reduce the performance of the following car, particularly the front wing.This is one of the concerns the big teams have pointed out to F1 when criticising the rules - that the new cars will be afflicted by a catastrophic lack of front-end grip.However, the research conducted by F1's in-house aerodynamic department appears to suggest that this is outweighed by the increase in clean air delivered to the second car.There have also been noises from some teams suggesting that the lack of freedom will make the cars look more uniform and reduce the reward for doing a good job of design.From what I hear, though, F1's own aerodynamicists were still carrying out wind-tunnel testing very recently, and still finding lots of performance gains. In my opinion, the team of designers who do the best job will still produce the fastest car in 2021, even if the gaps between the cars might be smaller.Personally, I think it's no bad thing if the difference in lap time is reduced between a team who do a good job, and one that does a bad job.All that would mean is that good drivers are more likely to be rewarded for their efforts. A driver who is 0.2 seconds a lap quicker than a rival, in a car that is 0.1secs slower, could still win the race. If that gap is 0.5secs or more, as it is between F1's 'big three' and the rest of the field, the drivers can't make that difference.Of course, as is always the way in F1, everyone wants to protect their advantage.But I hear that the FIA and F1 have stuck to their original plans and that the regulations that will be voted on by the FIA world council on Thursday remain true to the original proposal. If they finally get approved, that will be the starter pistol for the development race.Having to work on three different cars at once, with two different sets of regulations, is a real stretch for the aero department, especially when resources are already tight.I hear from friends at other teams that everyone is approaching the unknown quantity of the 2021 rules differently.I know of at least one team that has had a 2021 model in their wind tunnel for some time. This might mean they are ahead of other teams, but, with the restrictions on wind-tunnel testing, they will have directly taken away from development they are allowed to do on this and next year's cars.The work they have done will also have been of only limited relevance given that the proposed regulations have changed a number of times over the last few months.Whether that shows and they slip backwards, or whether they get away with it, but get the jump on the competition for 2021 is the million-dollar question.I know other teams have taken a more conservative approach, preferring to wait until the rules are fixed to avoid wasting time and effort looking at the wrong thing. Will they already be too far behind in this two-year long development race to catch up? Only time will tell.Personally, I just want the rules confirmed so we can get stuck into the design work with confidence.As an aerodynamicist, it's always exciting when sweeping changes come in as you have to throw out everything you thought you knew and relearn it all again. There is a palpable sense of optimism and opportunity.Maybe, just maybe, we'll design the fastest car in the world in 2021.
sport	Formula 1: McLaren engineer Pat Fry to join Renault for 2020		"Experienced Formula 1 engineer Pat Fry is to join Renault in 2020.Fry, 55, who is a former Ferrari technical director, is on gardening leave having left McLaren this year.Renault have employed him in a role yet to be revealed as they strengthen their engineering department in their bid to become a race-winning team by 2021.It is their second staff change this week, following the return of Dirk de Beer to his previous role of head of aerodynamics after five years away.De Beer, who has worked for Ferrari and Williams since leaving what was then known as Lotus in 2013, replaces Peter Machin, who is leaving the team ""by mutual agreement"" following a season in which Renault have failed to achieve their objectives of moving closer to the top three teams.Fry led Ferrari's technical department from 2011 to 2013 before the team recruited James Allison - now at Mercedes - as technical director and Fry was moved to the role of director engineering, before being fired at the end of 2014, when Ferrari failed to win a race for the first time since 1993.He worked for the now-defunct Marussia team as a consultant before joining McLaren last season, where he played an instrumental role in the restructure that has seen their fortunes revived in 2019 after a dismal season last year.Renault took over the Lotus team at the end of 2015 and set themselves the target of becoming title contenders by 2021.That target is in danger of slipping after their upward progress stalled this season.Rather than consolidate their fourth place in the constructors' championship and move towards the top three teams - Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull - Renault have slipped behind their engine customers McLaren and are fighting a battle against Toro Rosso and Racing Point to retain fifth place over the final three races of the season.Renault F1 team principal Cyril Abiteboul said: ""This year has been marked by an amount of satisfaction but also some struggles. It's clear that this position of P4 that we had last year is going to be challenging to retain this year.""We've been focused on growing, but in parallel we need also to look for a bit stronger technical leadership and making the team stronger in that area where we were a bit lean at that level.""Renault are also facing the uncertainty of an internal review started by interim chief executive officer Clotilde Delbos into the car company's entire operations.Delbos - who has taken her position in the wake of the departure of former boss Carlos Ghosn following his arrest in Japan on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies - has made it clear that the review is not specifically targeting the F1 programme, but that everything is ""on the table"".Abiteboul has said he is ""optimistic"" that there will be a ""positive"" outcome for the F1 programme."
sport	Formula 1: New technical, sporting & financial rules for 2021 revealed	What is happening to the cars?What about the budget cap?What about the tyres?What about engines?	"Plans to revolutionise Formula 1 in 2021 have been revealed by the sport's bosses on the eve of the US Grand Prix.New technical, sporting and financial rules will be introduced to try to make racing closer and more dramatic.Jean Todt, president of governing body the FIA, said the rules had been unanimously approved by the World Council, F1's legislative body, on Thursday.Key changes are a new aerodynamic concept and a $175m (£135m) budget cap.The three leading teams - Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull - have opposed the new rules and believe they are fundamentally flawed.But Todt described it as ""a very special day for our sport"", adding: ""The goal is to have a closer championship and more unpredictable [racing] on track.""Ferrari had opposed the rules, and had the option to veto them within five days. But that prospect has now been removed after they voted for them in the World Council.In a statement the team said: ""What has been voted is a good starting point. We'll work together to improve them even further.""There will be a major change to the way F1 cars produce their performance from aerodynamic downforce.Under the new rules, cars will generate a far greater proportion of their overall downforce from under the car, and there will be a significant reduction in the number of external shapers around the bodywork.The idea is to reduce the effect of 'dirty air' from a car in front on one trying to follow behind.The FIA's head of single-seaters, Nikolas Tombazis, a former Ferrari chief designer, said that while in 2019 a car following within one car length of another retained only 55% of its total downforce, in 2021 that number should be 86%. At three car lengths, in 2019 it is 68% and in 2021 95%.Countering claims that the cars will all look the same under the 2021 rules, Tombazis said there were a number of areas where cars could be differentiated, including the nose, front wing, side pods, engine cover, brake ducts and rear wing.The cars will have less downforce than this year and will be about 25kg heavier, and they are expected to be about three seconds a lap slower.Brawn said: ""To put that into perspective, that is about the performance of a 2016 car.""He said he never understood the reasons for increasing the cars' performance in 2017. ""The cars are very quick now but they are not raceable,"" Brawn said.The FIA and F1 confirmed plans for a $175m budget cap had been accepted from 2021.But there will be a number of exemptions, including driver salaries, remuneration of the three best-paid executives and all marketing costs.Todt said: ""This is still a high figure, but we consider it a first step.""The cost cap is not as controversial as the technical regulations - all teams committed to it in July and nothing has changed since.The sanctions for breaching the financial regulations will be sporting penalties.F1 sporting boss Ross Brawn said: ""If you breach these, you will be losing your championship. There are serious penalties.""It is absolutely essential for the future of F1 that we control spending.""We tried to capture the areas that make a difference between teams, where they can gain a competitive advantage.""The F1 drivers have been saying for some time that one of the major causes of difficulty in racing is the tendency of the Pirelli tyres to overheat when pushed hard or when a car is following another.Pirelli has been given a new set of criteria around which to develop their tyres as they try to make them less heat-sensitive.Tombazis said: ""We are fully aware tyres are equally important for races. We have been researching this with Pirelli. There is a new target letter, setting out their key objectives. That is not part of the regulations. Pirelli are carrying out some research on the tyre constructions. There should see some gains for 2020 and 2021.""Cars have developed a lot more downforce in recent years and there has been progress from last year to this year and we feel there will be [further] progress.""Their contract requires Pirelli to do their best endeavour, so there are no penalties as such, but it is in everyone's interest to tackle it. Hopefully this will ease these concerns.""Brawn added: ""In fairness to Pirelli, they have had so many diverse inputs, they have struggled to have clarity on what they can focus on. We have changed the objectives. We are trying to give them more clarity on what F1 really needs and I think they have been responding quite well.""F1 will stick with the existing 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, despite initial plans to change them when new owners Liberty Media took over the sport at the start of 2017.Tombazis said these were ""the most efficient engines on the planet in terms of conversion of the energy that goes into them to power at the rear wheels, and we felt changing that would be a step backwards."""

We still feel we can achieve those goals this season.""Ex-Sweden international Ljungberg, 42, played for Arsenal from 1998-2007, winning two Premier League titles and three FA Cups with them.He returned to the club in an ambassadorial role in 2013 and after a brief spell on the coaching staff at VfL Wolfsburg in 2017 he rejoined the Gunners in 2018 as Under-23 coach, before being promoted to first-team assistant coach in June.Ljungberg's first match in charge will be at Norwich on Sunday, with Arsenal in ninth place, eight points off the top four.""First and foremost, Freddie has Arsenal DNA,"" Kroenke, son of Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke, said.""Obviously he was a player here for a number of years, the supporters know him very well and he's worked diligently behind the scenes for the past several years.""My message to Freddie and the players was let's get back to basics and most importantly let's get back to having some fun.""I think footballers are at their best when I see smiles on their faces and going out there and winning matches. That's a winning formula to me.""Emery was dismissed after 18 months at the helm following a winless spell of seven games, Arsenal's worst run without a victory since February 1992.""Like all of our fans and supporters around the globe, we've been concerned about our recent string of performances,"" Kroenke said.""We wanted to support Unai and his staff until we decided it was time to make a change and ultimately we came to that decision over the last several weeks as a group between myself, Raul, Vinai and [technical director] Edu."""
sport	Miami Grand Prix: Formula 1 race proposals hit setback after local opposition		"Formula 1's bid for a grand prix in Miami has hit another setback after local officials voted in favour of measures that could complicate plans.F1 owners Liberty Media reached an agreement in principle earlier this month to host the race at the stadium of the Miami Dolphins NFL team from 2021.On Tuesday, the Miami-Dade County commission backed two resolutions that would prohibit road closures and force a public hearing before the race could be approved.The current circuit plan features a new track layout looping around the Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium in central Miami.The first resolution prohibits road closures near residential neighbourhoods in Miami Gardens, meaning the proposed route would need to be changed.F1 already had a previous track proposal rejected, which went through downtown Miami over a bridge to Miami Port and back, following concerns about interruptions to business caused by the construction of the race track.The second measure said a further public hearing will be required before the race can receive formal approval.However, Miami-Dade County mayor Carlos Gimenez can veto the resolutions, and said the event would bring economic and business opportunities to the city.""It's a world class event, like having a Super Bowl here in Miami Dade County every year,"" he added.F1 bosses estimate the event would generate more than $400m (£310m) in revenue.Protestors have complained that the race will cause pollution and impact the quality of life of local residents.Miami Gardens mayor Oliver Gilbert spoke out against F1's plans at Tuesday's hearing, saying: ""We forget that there's a whole community of people who will be impacted by this.""I'm not against events at the stadium, but let's be clear - all events are not equal and all events are not welcome."""
sport	Formula 1: Ferrari want to operate in 'sharpest possible manner' for 2020		"Ferrari team principle Mattia Binotto says they are determined to sharpen up their race management over the final races of the season to ensure they are best placed for 2020.The team have let a number of wins slip this year, owing to a combination of driver, operational and strategy errors.Team boss Binotto said: ""We have started the last six races from pole position but have only gone on to win three and we want to do better than that.""""We are encouraged we have a package that can fight for wins at most tracks,"" he added.Ferrari started the year with a car that was competitive only on circuits dominated by long straights, which played to the standard-setting performance of their engine and did not expose the lack of grip from their chassis.But aerodynamic upgrades in recent races have closed the gap to Mercedes and Red Bull on cornering performance and Ferrari head to this weekend's US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, as the team to beat in Formula 1.Binotto added: ""It's a significant improvement on how we started the year and credit must go to all the people in Maranello and at the track, who have worked so hard to fight back from where we started.""We need to use the last three races of this season to further develop as a group and to operate in the sharpest possible manner in order to be better prepared for next year. It is a very tight field at the front and every detail matters if we want to win more often.""In Mexico last weekend, Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel started together on the front row but a too-early pit stop for Leclerc and then allowing themselves to be out-thought on strategy by Mercedes with Vettel left them second and fourth at the end of the race.Binotto said after the Mexican Grand Prix: ""Going to Austin, no doubt we have all the possibility to win. Let's try to start on pole and win and not start on pole and not win. I am pretty sure we can do it.""Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton is on the verge of tying up a sixth world title and will do so in Austin as long as he does not lose more than 22 points to team-mate Valtteri Bottas.The only possible scenario in which Hamilton will not clinch the title is if Bottas wins the race - and even then the Briton needs only to finish eighth to become champion.Hamilton has won five of the seven races held at the Circuit of the Americas since its debut on the F1 calendar in 2012 and it is one of his favourite tracks.Last year, Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen, Leclerc's predecessor in the team, won the race and Vettel and Leclerc both go to Austin believing they can beat Hamilton.Vettel said: ""The US GP in Austin is a very different proposition to the high-altitude of Mexico. The Circuit of the Americas is an exciting track, with a wide range of cornering speeds and lots of changes of direction. It's quite bumpy, particularly in the big braking zones so it's easy to lock wheels there.""The strategy choice is quite open, with both one and two-stop plans looking possible.""Last year's event was difficult because none of us got much useful running due to the poor weather on Friday.""The forecast for this year is dry but quite cool. It should be a good circuit for us but, as we saw last year, we can take nothing for granted and the competition is also strong."""

As such, the event resembles the short-lived Ceasar's Palace Grand Prix that was held twice in a car park of the casino in Las Vegas in 1981 and '82.In their statement, F1 commercial boss Sean Bratches and Tom Garfinkel, the chief executive of Hard Rock Stadium, emphasised the financial benefits to the city of the race.""With an estimate annual impact of more than $400m and 35,000 room nights, the F1 Miami Grand Prix will be an economic juggernaut for South Florida each year,"" the statement said.Residents have raised concerns about traffic, noise and pollution and are being backed by key commissioners from Miami-Dade council, which is due to vote on the plans in the coming weeks.Bratches has been focused on Miami as the ideal place to achieve F1's ambitions of holding a grand prix in what he calls ""destination cities"" in the US.The former ESPN executive is to leave his role in F1 at the end of this year, as reported by BBC Sport in August.F1 already has one race in the USA, the successful United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, which was founded in 2012, but Liberty is determined to expand the sport in its home market."
sport	Formula 1 rules: Six teams oppose 2021 F1 regulations proposal	What prompted the questionnaire?What are the proposed 2021 rules?What are the objections to the new rules?What happens next?	The majority of teams oppose the new technical regulations for 2021 being proposed by Formula 1, BBC Sport can reveal.Six of the 10 teams indicated in a questionnaire organised by Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull that they do not agree with the plans as they stand.Only Alfa Romeo, McLaren, Renault and Williams preferred the proposed new rules to the existing ones.And two of those four have subsequently proposed changes to the 2021 rules.The parties will meet on 16 October to discuss the issue further.There is a deadline of 31 October for the 2021 technical rules to be decided and so far there has been no indication from the FIA, motorsport's world governing body, or F1 that they will back down.If a compromise cannot be reached, Ferrari have the right to veto the 2021 rules package, but it is understood the Italian team would prefer for matters not to get to that stage.Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull sent the questionnaire around following a meeting at the Singapore Grand Prix last month at which the teams were shown the latest draft of the 2021 rules.According to senior figures, this introduced more severe restrictions on design freedom and led to a number of teams expressing concerns.At the meeting, FIA president Jean Todt said he did not want to impose a set of rules without agreement. The Frenchman asked for teams to indicate their positions on the various issues and suggestions for alternatives if there were any.The questionnaire asked about 10 questions, including whether teams preferred to press ahead with the proposed 2021 rules or stick with the existing regulations. In the case of the new rules, it also asked whether there should be more design freedom, and what teams felt about standardisation of parts.Only Alfa Romeo, McLaren and Renault immediately indicated they would choose the current 2021 proposal, while Williams did so a number of days later.The teams' responses were communicated to the FIA World Council, the sport's legislative body, by Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto on 4 October.Since then, there has been a meeting of the technical working group of the FIA and teams' leading engineers, at which Alfa Romeo and McLaren were among those to propose changes to the 2021 rules as they stand.F1, under the leadership of former Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn, has been working for more than two years on a new set of technical regulations, with the aim of closing up the field and creating better racing by making it easier to overtake.A budget cap has already been agreed, and has the support of the top teams, but discussions over the planned changes to the cars are ongoing.F1 wants to change the way cars produce aerodynamic downforce to make it easier for drivers to follow each other and therefore overtake, with the proposal being for a greater proportion of the overall downforce of the car to be produced by the underfloor instead of the front wing and various shapers around the upper bodywork.The idea is for the degree to which performance is affected by turbulent air from a car in front to be greatly reduced.F1 also wants to limit the design freedom available to teams in order to make it harder for those with more resources to create cars with such an advantage over the others.It is hoped this would end the two-tier nature of F1, which has a closely packed midfield well over a second a lap slower than the top three teams - Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull.The top teams have concerns about the existing rules for a number of reasons:Some of the smaller teams - as well as some within F1 - believe Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull are trying to protect their competitive advantage by keeping the rules the same. The top teams deny this is their motivation.The six teams who directly objected to the current 2021 proposal are the top teams and what some regard as their effective satellites - Toro Rosso are Red Bull's junior team, while Haas and Racing Point buy large numbers of parts from Ferrari and Mercedes respectively, and have a history of voting with their partners.Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull presented their own proposal for 2021 to the FIA and F1 on Thursday. This was based on the F1 proposal, taking what they consider the more positive aspects and adding scope for development to ensure the cars would not all look the same.Under the existing governance structure, the FIA and F1 can simply impose the rules on the teams.Todt has always preferred to run the sport with a conciliatory and collegiate approach, in contrast to the one often espoused by his predecessor, Max Mosley.And trying to impose the rules runs the risk of Ferrari using their veto - which would effectively force the FIA to stick with the existing regulations.But the risk for Ferrari is the understanding that if they exercise the veto, they will lose that right under new governance structures that have to be agreed before 2021.

sport	Japanese Grand Prix: Typhoon Hagibis hits as Mercedes eye Formula 1 history	Typhoon hits build-upHow do the teams stand on track?	"Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes are poised to make Formula 1 history at the typhoon-hit Japanese Grand Prix.After the decision to cancel all track activities on Saturday because of Typhoon Hagibis, qualifying is set to be run on Sunday morning at 10:00 local time (02:00 BST), with the race as scheduled at 14:10 (06:10).Hamilton and team-mate Valtteri Bottas could secure a world-record sixth consecutive drivers' and constructors' World Championship double for the Mercedes team.This would break the record of five straight title doubles set by the Ferrari with Michael Schumacher from 2000-2004.Hamilton cannot quite seal his sixth world drivers' championship in Japan, but if results go their way, Mercedes can clinch the constructors' title and ensure that no driver from another team can win the championship.Hamilton, who is 73 points ahead of Bottas and 107 clear of third-placed Charles Leclerc of Ferrari, needs to gain just five points on his rivals in Japan and at the subsequent race in Mexico in two weeks' time to win the championship.Typhoon Hagibis, the largest tropical storm of the year, pounded Suzuka on Saturday and there is great uncertainty going into raceday.The area around the track is set to miss the worst of the storm, which weakened in the day leading up to the race and was strongest near the capital Tokyo to the north west, where at least one person was killed and emergency evacuation orders have been issued in some areas around Yokohama.More than 1,600 domestic flights have been grounded and the services of the famous Shinkansen 'bullet' train cancelled on Saturday between Tokyo and Osaka.Suzuka, located in Mie Prefecture in the Kansai region on the south coast of Honshu island between Nagoya and Osaka, was subjected to winds of up to 92kmh (57mph) and 134mm of rain in 24 hours.Sunday is expected to be dry, although the strong winds will continue and there are predictions of gusts of up to 57kmh (35mph).The question mark over qualifying is largely the degree of damage that could be done to the track and its facilities and whether it will be possible to run cars by 10am on Sunday.Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel said after practice on Friday: ""The circuit will be a big question mark, the state it is going to be in, because there should be some rain and the wind also will play a role, but we can't say [how] now.""Teams and organisers have taken precautions to try to limit the damage caused by the typhoon, including dismantling equipment and raising it from the ground to prevent flood damage.There is also the question of the readiness of the F1 television 'broadcast centre', which had to be dismantled on Friday because it was was not strong enough to withstand the predicted winds. That will have to be reconstructed in time to film qualifying on Sunday morning - no easy task.Officials were also concerned about the risk of debris being strewn around the circuit by the storm winds, and how long it will take to clear that up by the limited team of marshals at the track.If qualifying cannot be run on Sunday morning - because the facilities are not ready or conditions are not suitable - the grid for the grand prix will be set from the results of Friday practice, when Bottas and Hamilton finished one-two and looked in a league of their own.Bottas was 0.1 seconds quicker than Hamilton, who was not as happy with his car set-up, while Red Bull's Max Verstappen was 0.281secs off the pace in third and Leclerc in the fastest Ferrari 0.356secs adrift. Ferrari's Vettel and Red Bull's Alexander Albon were fifth and sixth fastest, ahead of the McLaren of Carlos Sainz.Mercedes' advantage looked especially large on longer runs, when the teams practice on high fuel loads in preparation for the race.On these, Bottas and Hamilton were a second quicker on average on an equivalent run length than Leclerc. It was not possible to compare Mercedes to the runs of Verstappen and Vettel, because they ran different tyre programmes, similar to each other, with the Ferrari slightly quicker than the Red Bull.Ferrari's lack of pace was unexpected because although Hamilton and Mercedes dominated the first part of the season, with eight wins for the Briton in the first 12 races, and another two for Bottas, the Italian team have taken over as the leading force since the sport returned from its summer break.Since the Belgian Grand Prix at the end of August, Ferrari have won three of the four races and would have won all of them had it not been for a badly timed virtual safety car period in Russia two weeks ago.Vettel said Ferrari's pace in Japan was ""not too bad - not as bad as maybe you think"".Of Mercedes, the four-time world champion said: ""Maybe they did a step forward, maybe the track suits them. It was OK but we can improve. The conditions will be the biggest challenge.""Mercedes have brought a significant aerodynamic upgrade to Suzuka, with new parts around the leading edge of the car's side pods, and it seems to have made a significant difference to the car.Hamilton described his car as ""a work in progress"", while Bottas said: ""Felt good from the beginning, really happy with the car in general, still minor things with the balance to tweak but both short and long runs felt good. It always so much fun here driving these cars and especially when the car feels good it is even more.""It is only practice but I do still feel the gains we've made with the car. We can just push the car further than before. But still Sunday is going to be close.""But their rivals fear that Mercedes may be out of reach.Verstappen said he believed Mercedes were ""looking very strong"" and Leclerc added: ""It seems we are lacking pace this weekend, which is a bit of surprise because we were very strong in the last four races and we expected to be quite good here.""The balance is not that bad, actually. We are just lacking speed. There is a little bit in driving as well. I am not driving very well. But I still expect it to be hard to catch Mercedes in front.""Media playback is not supported on this device"

sport	Lewis Hamilton takes dominant Abu Dhabi pole position	Ferrari - seriously?	"Lewis Hamilton secured a superb pole position for the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.The world champion, who had not had a pole since the German Grand Prix in late July, beat Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas by 0.194 seconds.Red Bull's Max Verstappen was third, 0.360secs behind, as there was yet another foul-up at Ferrari.Charles Leclerc did not cross the line in time to start a final lap and seemed to blame team-mate Sebastian Vettel.Leclerc still managed to qualify fourth, ahead of Vettel, but the incident comes hot on the heels of the last race in Brazil where they crashed together, putting both cars out of the race.""We are not going to make it,"" Leclerc said over the radio, after being told earlier in the lap that they were tight on time. ""Seb is slowing down.""In this instance, though, it seems Vettel was not at fault and that the team simply let the cars out too late.Red Bull's Alexander Albon took sixth place, with Lando Norris best of the rest in seventh.Hamilton was thrilled to end his season with a pole - he has admitted the fact Bottas had one more than him up to this point was rankling with him.""Definitely a very good qualifying session for us,"" he said. ""It has not been the easiest for us this year but we have kept plugging away. The car is well suited to the track and it has been feeling good. Yesterday was difficult and I had to reset myself for today. The first lap felt special and the second one was an improvement.""I don't think my qualifying has been terrible but not up to my usual standard. It's my last qualifying session with this car and it has been a really incredible journey with it this year so to finish it with a pole is a really good feeling.""Bottas will not be able to challenge Hamilton in the race as he will start from the back of the grid because of a penalty for using too many engine parts.The race battle - if there is one - is likely to be between Hamilton and Verstappen, who will start on the front row alongside the Mercedes following Bottas' penalty.Verstappen said: ""We just seemed to lack a bit of grip compared to them. They are always really dominant on this track and we are just lacking a bit too much in that last sector. We have to be realistic and I think Mercedes is really quick but we will give it everything we have in the race.""This has been a season characterised by problems at Ferrari, whether errors by the drivers or team, that have handicapped their season.In the end, this one probably did not affect anything. Ferrari had not looked quick enough to challenge for pole, and Verstappen had also been ahead of Leclerc on the first runs in final qualifying.And the situation did not favour Vettel because although Leclerc did not get a chance to improve his time, and Vettel did, the German did not improve on his final lap and stayed 0.12secs behind his team-mate.In truth, the fault this time seemed to lie with the team for sending out Leclerc too late.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe two Ferraris were at the back of a queue of cars, with Hamilton leading Verstappen, Bottas, Albon, Vettel and Leclerc. All backed up trying to get the optimum starting position for their laps, it seems as if Leclerc was just the unfortunate victim of that.Team boss Mattia Binotto admitted the error, explaining that because Ferrari were lacking pace, they wanted to send the drivers out as late as possible so they could have the best track conditions.He said he knew there was a risk that they would not make it across the line in time, and that is indeed what happened.For the race, the Ferrari drivers have chosen a split strategy, Leclerc starting on medium tyres like the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers, while Vettel will start on the softs.Behind the big three, Norris ended an excellent rookie season with seventh on the grid, ahead of Renault's Daniel Ricciardo, the second McLaren of Carlos Sainz and the second Renault of Nico Hulkenberg.At the back, George Russell kept up his perfect qualifying record against Williams team-mate Robert Kubica, who he has out-qualified at every single race this year."

Ferrari supplies Alfa Romeo and Haas in addition to its own works team.Honda now supplies Red Bull and their junior team Toro Rosso."

sport	Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Mercedes aim to learn from mistakes in Brazil	'Roller coaster' of a season	"Mercedes say they are heading to this weekend's season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix ""with a point to prove"".Team boss Toto Wolff said the last race in Brazil was ""disappointing for us"".World champion Lewis Hamilton finished third but was demoted to seventh with a five-second penalty for colliding with Red Bull's Alexander Albon.Wolff, who did not attend the race in Brazil, said: ""We did not have the fastest car on track and we lost a lot of points owing to our own mistakes.""He added: ""We analysed what went wrong, both in terms of our reliability and our decisions during the race, to make sure we don't repeat them.""It was a good learning experience for the entire team and something that will make us stronger in the long run.""Wolff was referring to a race strategy that unfolded when Hamilton was brought in for a late change of tyres under a final safety car period following a crash between the two Ferrari drivers.The decision dropped Hamilton to fourth from second and was described by technical director James Allison, the de facto team boss in Brazil in Wolff's absence, as ""plain dumb"".Even before that, Allison said Mercedes had ""not had the shiniest of races up to that point"".Hamilton collided with Albon making an optimistic attempt to separate the rookie from second place on the penultimate lap.After recovering, Hamilton then just failed in an attempt to pass Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly in a race to the finish line on the final lap, and was given a five-second penalty for the Albon incident.Wolff said: ""The underperformance in Brazil means we head to Abu Dhabi with a point to prove.""Yas Marina has been a good circuit for us in the last years and we'll push hard to continue in the same way.""The race is one last opportunity for us to add another victory to the record of the W10 and it's one more chance to put on a great show for the fans before the winter break.""We're looking forward to the fight because we know that in Formula 1, you're only as good as your last result.""Wolff said the 2019 season - in which Mercedes have won 14 of 20 races so far, 10 for Hamilton and four for team-mate Valtteri Bottas - had been a ""real roller coaster"".The team have won a record-breaking sixth consecutive double of drivers' and constructors' championships, breaking the previous record held by Ferrari.But he said the deaths of FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting on the eve of the season, Mercedes non-executive director Niki Lauda in May and Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert in a high-speed crash at the Belgian Grand Prix had been hard to take.Wolff said: ""We've seen great on-track battles and we've loved the competition. We are very proud that we came out on top and managed to put the Mercedes name in the history books of F1 with our sixth consecutive double title.""On the other hand, it's been an incredibly hard year where we had to say goodbye to too many friends.""We were hit hard by the passing of Charlie, Niki and Anthoine, as well as important members from our team who we have tragically lost this year.""At Mercedes, Niki left a void that we will never be able to replace - as a source of inspiration, as a voice of reason, but most importantly as a great friend.

sport	Daniel Ricciardo: 'This season emphasised my love for Formula 1'	'Get me back to the front'Reputation intactWhy have Renault gone backwards?	"It has not been an easy year at Renault, but Daniel Ricciardo nevertheless says this season has ""emphasised his love"" for Formula 1.The Australian seven-time winner left Red Bull to join Renault on a two-year contract for 2019 and 2020 worth more than $50m (£40.2m), and his new team started the season with the ambition of closing on the top three teams.Instead, Renault have slipped backwards. But Ricciardo says he ""still feels good"" about the decision, has no regrets, and that he would like to continue with the team if they can show sufficient improvements next season.""Do I want to stay? Yes, because ideally we do get this to the next level,"" Ricciardo tells BBC Sport in an exclusive interview.""It was my massive intention to come here. My intention wasn't to have a two-year layover somewhere else. I know people might still think that, but I really want this to work. I feel like the hours I have put in this year have shown I have the drive to want to do so.""After comfortably finishing fourth in the constructors' championship last year, Renault are fifth with seven races left in 2019, one place behind McLaren, a customer of Renault's engines.The regression - and the contrast with the startling progress at McLaren - has led to disappointment and significant internal pressure, but Ricciardo says he was expecting a difficult season all along.""Definitely not to be negative, but regardless of even if we were coming sixth every weekend, I knew there were still bigger targets and that we were still not going to be where we want to be,"" he says.""Yes, we're at times further back than we expected and hoped, but I knew there would be work to be done and a lot of hours to put in. I feel like I was prepared for that.""Even though I feel like I have worked more hours and probably worked harder this year than in previous years, it has still been quite enjoyable because the environment is different - new people, new relationships.""If anything, it has reiterated what I want in the sport.""There have been some dark moments along the way, though, and the nadir was a weekend in Austria at the end of June when Renault were uncompetitive.""Austria, literally, I can tell you conversations going in my head during that race,"" Ricciardo says. ""I am literally driving around - I don't want to say not present - but my thoughts were: 'I don't want to be here.'""When I say that, I mean: 'I don't want to be in this position.' I was 14th or something and it was one of our worst weekends. But it wasn't a head-down defeat, it was: 'Get me back to the front - this is not where I should be. This is not where we should be.'""So a really bad weekend emphasised my passion and love for the sport and how much I wanted to get everyone back up to the front, including myself.""There have been some strong weekends, too, especially Canada, where Ricciardo qualified a brilliant fourth, splitting the Ferraris and ahead of both Red Bulls.""Through some of these struggles, it has been really quite positive for me this year, and it's really driven me to want more from it,"" he says. ""That's been cool.""And on an actual pure positive - Canada. We've had some lows but that high was for me like a pole position. There have been some moments that have lasted.""In five years at Red Bull, the team were never consistent frontrunners, but Ricciardo took seven victories, and established a reputation as one of the sport's most exciting drivers, in addition to being possibly its most likeable and amusing character.Most of his victories were outstanding, featuring drives through the field and audacious last-minute overtaking manoeuvres.Ricciardo has inevitably faded slightly from the limelight this year, but the move to Renault has done nothing to damage his reputation as a driver.He has comfortably out-paced his team-mate, German Nico Hulkenberg, who has out-qualified Ricciardo only four times in 14 races. This performance disparity will have made Renault's decision to release Hulkenberg and sign Frenchman Esteban Ocon for at least the next two years all the easier.And while Ricciardo would obviously prefer to be further up, he says he is enjoying the intensity of the midfield fight.""If anything, [qualifying] is tighter than last year,"" he says. ""The battle a lot of the time was just me and Max [Verstappen], where this year it's all the midfield. So that's definitely getting the blood flow going. I am enjoying the driving.""As for the car's performance, Renault think they know what has gone wrong this year.Their strong performance at tracks such as Canada, and the past two races in Belgium and Italy, all 'power circuits', have emphasised that the French manufacturer has finally made a good step forward with its engine after years of underperformance. The issue now is the car.Ricciardo says: ""It seems when I speak to the team, the base of the car, the fundamentals, the base direction, has limited us. So we developed it a little bit but it's reached, I don't want to say its peak, but it can't really be developed that much more with this philosophy.""So, as far as now looking at next year, it seems like they want to change the whole aerodynamic philosophy of the car. Instead of focusing on this part of the car, say the middle part, and trying to generate as much downforce in the middle, it's like, no, we need to focus on the front.""It seems like it might be more difficult at first, but in the bigger picture we'd be getting more downforce 'points', as we call it, from that.""This sounds very much like Renault have done what Ferrari have done this year - pursued an aerodynamic philosophy that looks better initially, but which limits overall downforce; in contrast to Mercedes, whose car was harder to get working initially, but is better in the end.For Ricciardo, then, a lot hangs on Renault getting that right. If they can make their new direction work, and take a big step forward, Ricciardo may well stay. If they can't, they fear he would leave.This was emphasised by Renault Sport managing director Cyril Abiteboul, when he said recently that signing Ocon ""wasn't just about 2020, but also 2021 and what's happening to his team-mate"".Does Ricciardo think Abiteboul suspects he might be looking for pastures new for 2021?""I definitely haven't made any decisions yet,"" Ricciardo says. ""I haven't had this discussion with Cyril. I don't want to speak for him, but he's frustrated with this year.""I think part of him feels like - I don't want to say [he feels] he's let us down, but we did expect to do better.""When we chatted last year, there were higher hopes for this year. We're confident next year is going to be a lot better, but he's thinking probably: 'If it doesn't go [better], why would Daniel want to stay?' That's probably where his head's at and that's probably where those comments come from.""It's him just being brutally honest with himself and wanting to do better and wanting the team to do better - to basically keep me and any other assets.""The contracts of most top drivers come up for renewal at the end of 2020. Along with Ricciardo, Sebastian Vettel at Ferrari, both Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas, and Red Bull's Max Verstappen are all on the market next year.""So next year, what would I need to see?"" he asks rhetorically. ""Obviously improvements - not just from one position to the next, but solid improvements that actually we could realistically fight for a podium at some point next year. That would be very encouraging and motivating for everyone.""I know we're still a long way off that but I still believe it's in reach. I don't think we're dreamers; we just have to clean up a few things. I still look back at Canada - if we can qualify fourth at the seventh race of the season, I still believe anything's possible with these guys."""

sport	Italian GP crash: Final practice delayed by Formula 3 Alex Peroni accident		Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel set the pace after Italian Grand Prix final practice had been delayed following a huge crash in the Formula 3 race.Alex Peroni's car was launched into the air by a kerb at the high-speed Parabolica corner and landed upside down on the barrier. He was unhurt.The delay was caused by race officials removing the kerb, intended to prevent drivers going faster by running wide.Vettel headed Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the session by 0.032 seconds.Just 0.103secs covered the top four, with Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas third and Charles Leclerc's Ferrari fourth, and 0.301secs separated the top six, in which Renault's Daniel Ricciardo was a surprise fifth ahead of World Championship leader Lewis Hamilton.Several drivers had lap times deleted during the session, which was cut back by 10 minutes, after running wide into the Parabolica run-off area following the removal of the kerb.In the F3 incident, Australian Peroni ran wide and clipped the leading edge of the kerb. His car was lifted into the air and it somersaulted and twisted a number of times before landing upside down on the tyre barrier and concrete wall behind it.Peroni was seen walking alongside the track and was taken to the medical centre as a precaution.The incident will be analysed by FIA officials, as a spotlight falls on whether so-called 'sausage kerbs' - similar to a narrow sleeping policeman - are appropriate ways of enforcing track limits at such fast corners.

sport	Formula 1's most unlikely mid-season driver switches	Michael Schumacher for Bertrand Gachot - Jordan, 1991Pedro de la Rosa for Juan Pablo Montoya - McLaren, 2006Max Verstappen for Daniil Kvyat - Red Bull, 2016Jos Verstappen for Jan Magnussen - Stewart, 1998Giancarlo Fisichella for Luca Badoer for Felipe Massa - Ferrari, 2009	"Formula 1 is on its mid-season holiday, but that did not stop Red Bull causing a shock by demoting Pierre Gasly to its junior team Toro Rosso - with Alexander Albon promoted to replace him.Gasly had only been driving for Red Bull since the start of the season but has managed no podium finishes, while team-mate Max Verstappen has won twice and been in the top five at every race in 2019 - and so the team have taken action.Albon, a 12-race rookie who has never finished in the top five, now has the toughest job in Formula 1 - trying to beat Verstappen.But the sport has a history of drivers being given unexpected chances. Some rise to the occasion, others do not. Here are some of the most bizarre mid-season driver changes.Why did it happen? In 1991, Jordan were left a driver short midway through the season after an incident eight months earlier. Bertrand Gachot was involved in a minor car accident with a taxi at London's Hyde Park Corner, then had an argument with the taxi driver, Eric Court.Gachot produced a can of CS gas - illegal at the time in Britain - and sprayed it in Court's face.The courtroom followed... Gachot claimed it was self defence, but was sentenced to six months in prison for actual bodily harm - later reduced to two months on appeal - with him missing the next few races while at HMP Brixton.Team boss Eddie Jordan decided a German with no previous Formula 1 experience would step in for Gachot at the Belgian Grand Prix. That man was Michael Schumacher, a 22-year-old, who had won the German Formula 3 title the previous year and was a member of Mercedes' junior programme.Did it work? Schumacher made an instant impact as he qualified seventh, 0.7secs quicker than experienced team-mate Andrea de Cesaris. Schumacher overtook Jean Alesi on the opening lap before a clutch issue saw the German out early on.But the first page of the Schumacher F1 story had been written, and he would become the most successful driver in the sport's history, winning a record seven world titles and 91 races.His time at Jordan only lasted one race as his impressive debut saw him snapped up by Benetton.Gachot? He returned to F1 for a further four years, but most of his races went the same way as his career at Jordan - unfinished.Why did it happen? Don't crash into your team-mate: It's the number one rule in Formula 1. But that's what Juan Pablo Montoya did in what proved to be his last Formula 1 race.Montoya smashed into the back of fellow McLaren driver Kimi Raikkonen at the United States Grand Prix, with both men out before one lap had been completed.The Colombian had caused a problem for McLaren in 2005, when he missed two races because of a mysterious injury, claiming he had been hurt playing tennis so was already on thin ice when he hit the Iceman.Montoya had already announced he would be leaving F1 at the end of the 2006 season to join IndyCar and a few days after the US Grand Prix, McLaren hurried him to the exit door, replacing him with Spanish test driver Pedro de la Rosa with eight races left.And what of that ""tennis"" injury? Only recently, speaking in an F1 podcast, did Montoya admit that he actually injured himself falling off a motocross bike. At the time, he was too scared to tell team boss Ron Dennis the truth.Did it work? It was not a calamity as De La Rosa finished in the points in five of eight races, including a second-placed finish in Hungary. His total of 19 points from eight races, compared with the 26 Montoya had scored from the opening 10 races.Why did it happen? Gasly's demotion has a precedent. Red Bull dropping one of their under-performing drivers and replacing him with someone from their junior team? It happened three years ago.Russian Daniil Kvyat, after one full season at Red Bull following his earlier elevation from Toro Rosso, claimed his first podium when he came third in China. However, not everyone was happy.Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel said Kvyat's driving was ""like a torpedo"" after a ""suicidal"" overtaking move and called the Russian a ""madman"".The pair collided again at the very next race - with Kvyat hitting Vettel twice in two corners - and this time Red Bull had seen enough, demoting Kvyat to Toro Rosso and replacing him with 18-year-old Max Verstappen.Did it work? Instantly. Verstappen became the youngest race winner - aged 18 years and 227 days - when he triumphed at the Spanish Grand Prix in his first Red Bull race.The Dutchman has since won a further six times, including twice this season. Kvyat was out of Formula 1 in 2018 before making a surprise return to Toro Rosso.Why did it happen? This is a tale of the F1 dads. Jan Magnussen, whose son Kevin now drives for Haas, was struggling for Stewart at the start of the 1998 season and had failed to finish in four of the opening seven races, not helped by taking out his team-mate Rubens Barrichello at the San Marino Grand Prix.In came Jos Verstappen, whose son Max was not even one year old at the time.Did it work? No. Jos Verstappen had six retirements and never finished higher than 12th in the remaining nine races.Why did it happen? Felipe Massa suffered a horrific incident during qualifying in Hungary when a flying suspension spring from another car hit his helmet, leaving him with a fractured skull and needing eye surgery.Ferrari needed to fill the vacant seat for seven races. With 40-year-old first choice Michael Schumacher unable to make a shock comeback because he was injured, the opportunity went to Luca Badoer, Ferrari's longest-serving test driver.Did it work? Definitely not. Badoer was so bad he lasted only two races. He had not driven in F1 for 10 years; in his first race back - the 2009 European Grand Prix - he qualified last, having been caught speeding four times in the pit lane during Friday's practice session. He then finished 17th out of 18 in the race.Badoer spun in qualifying in Belgium, and was last of the 14 drivers who finished the race, as Giancarlo Fisichella finished second in a Force India. So, inevitably, Fisichella got the call to replace Badoer.Did that work? Not really. Fisichella did not finish higher than ninth in five races and never raced in F1 again with Massa fit to start the 2010 season - much to Ferrari's relief."
sport	Anthoine Hubert Formula 2 death: Why the motorsport 'family' races on		"The accident that killed Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert on Saturday serves as a reminder of the unpalatable truth that motor racing can never be safe.It cast a pall, understandably, over the Belgian Grand Prix weekend.As safety has improved over the years, accidents such as this, and their terrible outcomes, have become increasingly rare. But any time a human being straps themselves into a projectile and races closely with other cars at speeds of well over 100mph, they are taking a very serious risk.This day would otherwise have been filled with talk of Ferrari's front-row lock-out, whether they could finally deliver a win this season, and so on, but people who work in Formula 1 know a bad accident when they see one, and the reaction to this one was instantaneous.World champion Lewis Hamilton was conducting television interviews at the time and was glancing, as F1 drivers do, at the start of the F2 race.As the accident unfolded in all its horrific violence, he said: ""Oh wow. Hope that kid's good. Wow. That's terrifying.""He rubbed his forehead, his face a mask of concern, and then walked off, not saying another word.At Red Bull, their new driver Alexander Albon was holding his news conference with the written media, the F2 race on a television screen behind him.Journalists inhaled in horror at what they were seeing. Albon turned around, watched what was happening, and said nothing. Then, after a minute or so, crossed his hands to indicate to his media handler that the session was over.Immediately, even though there was no confirmation of the seriousness of the accident, the paddock at Spa descended into silence. People's faces set. Work was undertaken with stoicism and silent contemplation. Motor racing is a hard, brutal business, in a number of ways, but the sport also considers itself a family, and it rarely feels closer than at times like this.These moments confront racing drivers in a very visceral and immediate sense with the dangers of the profession they chose because they love it. The risk they take is an inherent part of that love, however hard that might be for some to comprehend.Of course they don't want to be injured, or worse, but the very fact they can be adds an extra frisson to an activity that already rewards its participants with feelings that simply cannot be experienced anywhere else.The combination of balance, bravery, skill, judgement and excitement that comes from controlling a racing car on the very edge of adhesion at high speed, and trying to beat everyone else while doing it, is what makes racing drivers stand out from other people, and makes it different from most other sportsIt is also part of the appeal to the people who watch it. They don't want to see people hurt either, but they appreciate what the drivers are doing, what it requires of them, and what is at stake.Not for nothing did Hemingway say: ""There are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.""As Hamilton said: ""If a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe, you're hugely mistaken. All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough. Not from the fans nor some of the people actually working in the sport.""Anthoine is a hero as far as I'm concerned, for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams. I'm so sad that this has happened. Let's lift him up and remember him.""Hubert is the first person to die as a result of an accident in a race sanctioned by international governing body the FIA since F1 driver Jules Bianchi, who sustained terrible head injuries in a crash during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix and died the following July.The last driver killed in a major international motor race was Britain's Justin Wilson - hit on the head by debris during an IndyCar race at Pocono, Pennsylvania in August 2015.Since then, there have been a number of serious accidents, but no fatalities, which is a testament to the ongoing work around the world to improve safety.There will be a full investigation into this accident. It will be considered whether the 'halo' head-protection device, which was introduced last year as a direct result of Bianchi's accident, did its job as intended. The forces involved will be analysed. Lessons will be learned, and changes made. But in some cases, there is not much to be done. The human body can only take so much, which is why the risk of motorsport can never be entirely eradicated.Spa-Francorchamps, where this accident happened, is one of the world's greatest, most historic, fastest, most challenging and, yes, most dangerous race tracks. The drivers look forward to races there more than those at any but a mere handful of circuits around the world. But they don't do it lightly. They do it in full awareness of the risks they are taking.On Saturday night, over dinner with friends and colleagues, the 20 F1 drivers contemplated the loss of a man who some of them knew, some of them had raced against, and of whom some were only aware as someone who could very well, one day soon, be one of them.On Sunday, their usual pre-race preparations, were done with seriousness, sobriety and an iron determination to carry on with business as usual.Then at 3.10pm local time, they watched five red lights come on one by one and then go out, and within a few seconds they raced nose to tail, side by side at close to 200mph over the exact spot where, less than 24 hours earlier, a colleague paid the ultimate price.The sport they love brings them incredible highs and, as on Saturday, awful lows. The combination of all that is - whatever one may think of it - what makes it so thrillingly, awfully, terribly, tragically, special.They are truly not as other people."

sport	Formula 1 to have record 22 grands prix in 2020 season		Formula 1 will have a record 22-race season in 2020.The sport's calendar, announced on Thursday before the resumption of the current season in Belgium, features two new races in the Netherlands and Vietnam.Only Germany has been lost from this year's 21-race schedule.The season begins in Australia on 15 March and ends in Abu Dhabi on 29 November. The British Grand Prix is on 19 July, a week later than this year.Squeezing in the extra race has meant seven 'double-headers' - where races are held on consecutive weekends.Bahrain follows a week after Australia, and the other events a week apart are the Netherlands and Spain on the first two weekends in May; Azerbaijan and Canada in early June; France and Austria; Belgium and Italy; Singapore and Russia; and the USA and Mexico.F1's bosses have said their intention is to potentially extend the calendar to as many as 24 races in the future, principally to drive revenue. But teams have reservations about that, both in terms of the demands on their staff and as a potential risk to the exclusivity of the sport.Teams had to give permission to extend 2020 beyond 21 races, as that is defined as a maximum in the sport's rules.Beyond 2020, the situation is less clear, as the regulations have not yet been defined.Talks about changes to the sport have been going on for two years but so far only a budget cap of $175m a year - with several exclusions, including the salaries of drivers and the three top executives - has been agreed.Teams and F1 have until the end of October to finalise the new rules, having already been forced to extend the previous deadline of the end of June.Grand Prix calendar 2020Australia (15 March), Bahrain (22 March), Vietnam (5 April), China (19 April), Netherlands (3 May), Spain (10 May), Monaco (24 May), Azerbaijan (7 June), Canada (14 June), France (28 June), Austria (5 July), Great Britain (19 July), Hungary (2 August), Belgium (30 August), Italy (6 September), Singapore (20 September), Russia (27 September), Japan (11 October), US (25 October) Mexico (1 November), Brazil (15 November), Abu Dhabi (29 November)
sport	Jolyon Palmer column: Charles Leclerc win at Monza leaves Formula 1 in a tangle	Why Leclerc broke the rulesThe risk of unintended consequencesLeclerc's second dodgy moveAre decisions consistent enough?A manifesto for change	"Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault during the 2017 season, is part of the BBC team and offers insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors.Charles Leclerc drove wonderfully on Sunday to win the Italian Grand Prix - but he should have been penalised for forcing Lewis Hamilton off the road at the second chicane.The fact Leclerc got away with that has left governing body the FIA, the race stewards and the race director in an uncomfortable Rubik's cube of a tangle.Let's start with the facts.Leclerc forced Hamilton off the road in the braking zone for the second chicane on lap 23, as Hamilton attempted a move on the outside. This is undeniable.Hamilton kicked up the grass in his evasive action as the Ferrari moved across, and was forced to cut the chicane and rejoin behind.Firstly, this is not fair racing from Leclerc. The rules dictate that in such situations drivers must leave a car's width of space for their opponents, particularly in the braking areas, where they are in full control of their car's positioning, unlike at the apex or exit, where small slides can cause them to deviate from their original and intended trajectory.Leclerc moved to the right while he was braking and forced Hamilton off the road. Hamilton couldn't do anything about it, other than to crash with Leclerc or to go off and cut the corner, as he was already on the limit of the brakes and couldn't back out from alongside the Ferrari man. Nor should he have had to.Last year, Red Bull's Max Verstappen was penalised five seconds for an almost identical infringement on Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas at turn one in Monza, and it cost the Dutchman a podium.With Leclerc, though, the FIA brought out its latest measure instead of keeping things consistent. They instead showed the black-and-white warning flag to Leclerc.Race director Michael Masi likens it to a yellow card in football; but it's effectively nothing more than a slap on the wrist.The race stewards are at liberty to investigate any incident, regardless of whether Masi uses the black-and-white flag. But in this case they took no action.Some have seen this as the stewards bottling it with a huge decision, against a race-leading Ferrari, in Monza, surrounded by 100,000 or so Italian fans all wearing red. Hamilton and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff made a similar point after the race.In my view, the decision was clear-cut. Much as I didn't want to see a penalty, as it would have inevitably ruined the race, the rules are the rules and they must be adhered to for the good of the sport over the entertainment factor of the show.This is F1's equivalent of Manchester City being 0-0 with Crystal Palace and in the 60th minute Raheem Sterling is brought down in the penalty area and the underdogs also then have a man sent off.Sure, it ruins the game to give City the penalty and reduce Palace to 10 men, but those are the rules. You can't not do it because everyone wants to see a more balanced game for the remaining 30 minutes.And you especially can't not give it because the game is at Crystal Palace and their 25,000 fans in the crowd will be unhappy.I found it extremely uncomfortable watching Masi trying to explain the situation after the race.He said the revival of the black-and-white warning flag was a new measure brought in at the request of the teams and drivers to allow for harder racing.But what precedent does this now set?It means drivers are potentially allowed to commit one offence in a race and get away with it. What sort of racing is that going to produce? And how is that ethical or fair?Verstappen got away with a dubious race-winning move on Leclerc back in Austria and it has set a new precedent for forcing drivers off the road on the outside on the exit of the corner. But in many ways Verstappen's case was easier to defend than this one from Leclerc.Because Leclerc was given only a warning, it would appear drivers are now allowed to force each other off on the outside before a corner as well.If that's the case, there is a serious risk that the days of an overtake around the outside are well and truly over, unless a car is pretty much fully ahead before actually getting to the corner.Masi then went on to explain a further reason Verstappen might have been penalised last year and Leclerc not this year was because last year there was contact and this year there wasn't.On the face of it, that makes some sense. But in reality there was only no contact this time because Hamilton took better evasive action than Bottas did in his position last year.In fact, Bottas actually had more space than Hamilton did last year; he just didn't budge and the incident ended in light contact.Which leads me on to the next problematic situation - drivers might go looking for a bit of contact on the outside, just to prove to the FIA the absolute obvious, and thus get a penalty for the aggressor who is clearly contravening the rules.With motorsport safety coming back into the public eye after the death of Anthoine Hubert in Belgium under F1's very nose, what sort of a statement is this?It seems either idiotic or downright irresponsible, or even both.Wolff made this exact point after the race.Asked if the black-and-white flag promoted drivers taking more liberties and opened a can of worms, he said: ""There will be more touching. It will be more of a common practice. My opinion is it will go to the point that it will end up in a collision and then we will bale out again.""Wolff is absolutely right. Drivers will always do everything they can to gain an advantage, no matter what's at stake. If suddenly they can get away with pushing another driver off the track once per race, they will do it. And if for the other driver it is beneficial to have a little tap with the car next to you, they will look for it.The next issue with the black-and-white flag is whether it a pure yellow card, or a yellow card for that particular offence only? The FIA says the former - that any new driving offence would count.Leclerc's next on-the-edge move came when, under further pressure from Hamilton, he cut the chicane at turn one and then meandered up the curved straight of Curva Grande, with a sudden jink to the left as Hamilton appeared to have a run on him.Hamilton backed out and ultimately lost his momentum, and with it another chance of a move was halted by Leclerc's aggressive defence.This time, the actual cutting of the corner (which was investigated) was fine - Leclerc rejoined and clearly didn't gain an advantage.But the sudden chop across the nose of Hamilton through the flat out Curva Grande corner (which wasn't investigated) was once again right on the limit.In isolation I probably could see this being allowed, as the curved nature of the 'straight' blurs the lines somewhat. But with the backdrop of the black-and-white flag already deployed, this was potentially a second offence that could have seen a red.The problem to me is the stewarding is inconsistent - a point Hamilton made after the race.The stewards have a difficult job to do, they take it seriously and they try to do it as best they can. But at times, from the outside, it can feel like decisions aren't based on racing, but on the likely popularity of the decision with the masses.Back in China, Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat - nicknamed 'the torpedo' after a series of incidents a few years ago - was handed a whopping drive-through penalty for what appeared to be a pure racing incident when he collided with both McLarens on the opening lap.Would Leclerc have received the same penalty? I doubt it.The fact is, Leclerc is a very popular driver. In fact, I've never known a more popular front-runner and now race-winner in my time than the young Monegasque driver. Has that, plus the fact he drives a red car, had a bearing on the result this weekend?In Canada, I applauded the FIA for sticking to its guns - and the rulebook - when handing Sebastian Vettel a penalty for a breach of rules when he rejoined the track after going off and impeding Hamilton.But since then the demand from the teams and drivers to 'let them race' - which is also popular with the fans - has led to a problematic situation where it's hard to predict what their next decision will be, and where consistency can seem to be in short supply.This all overshadows the fact it was a cracking race and those were unbelievable drives from both Leclerc and Hamilton.The biggest frustration is that Leclerc need not have forced Hamilton off at all. He was on the inside into the corner, and ahead. Hamilton was never going to go around the outside, so it was completely unnecessary, and put a taint on an otherwise phenomenal drive.A five-second penalty might have outraged many in Monza, but not giving it puts the stewards in a more uncomfortable position - and there will probably now be many more incidents and controversies as a result.In my view, F1 needs a complete rules reset. It is a controversial idea, but I believe the sport needs a permanent race steward, or stewarding team, who share the same or similar ideals.At the moment, stewards - and the ex-drivers who sit on the panel each race - have different opinions of various incidents and this is what leads to inconsistency.But, as Hamilton pointed out, the drivers need consistency to know how far they can push things out on track.Secondly, once in place the stewarding team must explain the rules clearly to the drivers, what they can and can't get away with, and what the repercussions will be for each transgression.Finally, the simple bit - stick to the rules when handing out penalties.Sure, in the short term there will be some uncomfortable and unpopular moments. But once consistency is adhered to and the drivers are crystal clear what they can and can't do, F1 will be fairer, safer and better.Right now, that is the only thing detracting from what has been a season full of cracking races like Monza."

""Feels good, but difficult to enjoy on a weekend like this.""Earlier in the day, Hubert's mother and brother joined drivers from F2 and Formula 3 to observe a minute's silence before the F3 race.On Sunday morning the F1 Twitter account posted: ""Today we race. We do so with the heaviest of hearts, and we carry the memory of Anthoine throughout. Just like it was for Anthoine, racing is our passion and our dream. It defines us. So today we race for Anthoine. And today, and always, we honour him.""Hubert suffered a huge impact from the car of American Juan Manuel Correa at about 170mph at the Raidillon swerves.Correa is in intensive care, but his condition is stable, after surgery. The 20-year-old suffered fractures to both his legs and a ""minor spinal injury"" in the crash and was taken to hospital by helicopter.Governing body the FIA will launch a full investigation into the accident which will analyse its causes and how the cars and safety features at the track behaved in the crash.Hubert appears to have sustained two impacts - one with the barriers at the top of Raidillon, and another when his car was hit broadside by that of Correa, whose car then turned upside down and skidded along the track on its 'halo' head-protection device.In the case of F1 driver Jules Bianchi, who suffered fatal head injuries in a crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, a report was produced about two months after his accident at Suzuka.But there is no specific timeframe - the FIA safety department will take the time to study all relevant factors before publishing its report, which will then feed into the next steps in terms of any potential safety improvements that may emerge."
sport	Anthoine Hubert: Formula 2 driver Juan Manuel Correa critical but stable in induced coma		"Formula 2 driver Juan Manuel Correa - injured in the accident that killed French driver Anthoine Hubert - has been placed in an induced coma.Correa, 20, is ""critical but stable"" in a London hospital after complications following the crash, say his parents.The Ecuador-born American suffered a spinal injury and broken legs in the crash at Spa, in Belgium, on 31 August.Juan Carlos and Maria Correa said they believe his ""tremendous fighting spirit"" will help him recover.""We are confident that our son will surprise us like he always does,"" they said in a statement.Our condolences to the Hubert family...our hearts are broken, and we can only imagine the pain this loss has brought them.Correa had a four-hour operation in Liege, but on arrival in London was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome.""This is an injury considered common in high-impact accidents such as this one. Unfortunately, this injury resulted in Juan Manuel falling into acute respiratory failure,"" said the Correas.""Juan Manuel is currently in an intensive care unit that specialises in respiratory injuries. At this point of time he is an in induced state of unconsciousness and under ECMO support.""ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is similar to equipment used during a heart-lung bypass operation,Hubert, who was 22, suffered a huge impact from Correa's car, which was travelling at about 170mph, at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit.The Frenchman was taken to the medical centre following the incident, and died shortly after.Correa, who grew up in Miami and lives in Barcelona, has been racing this season with the Sauber junior team and is the development driver for Alfa Romeo Racing's F1 team.""We wish to thank everyone within and outside the motorsports community for the wonderful and caring get well wishes that we have received, as well as messages for a speedy recovery,"" said his parents.""We are confident that Juan Manuel will review them all himself once he is back in charge of his social media accounts.""They said the update had been issued in honour of the ""straight-to-the-point and honesty"" that characterises their son.""At this time, we kindly request that our privacy and space be respected. As a family, we need to pull together and be 100% there for Juan Manuel,"" they added.""Maria and I wish to take this opportunity to give our condolences to the Hubert family for their loss.

sport	Formula E: Vergne closes in on Formula E title		Media playback is not supported on this deviceFrenchman Jean-Eric Vergne won a controversial Swiss E-Prix to close in on the Formula E championship title.The red flag was waved 56 seconds into the race, as Max Gunther caught the rear of Pascal Wehrlein into Turn 13 - causing a mass-car pile up.Drivers argued with stewards after it was decided the race would be restarted under a safety car in qualifying order.Vergne's title rival Audi Sport's Lucas Di Grassi's 14-place leap to fourth was lost because of the decision.As drivers flew into Wehrlein's stranded Mahindra, Envision Virgin Racing's Robin Frijns spun into the wall causing problems further back, and subsequently retired with damage.Brazilian driver Lucas Di Grassi avoided the pile-up by running down an escape road, emerging fourth from 18th. But a full-course red flag was announced and the session was stopped for 40 minutes.While the stranded cars were being rescued under the red flag, Lucas di Grassi, Felipe Massa, and Antonio Felix da Costa argued with a race steward saying the decision to restart in qualifying order was unfair, because there had been no official flag waved before the places were gained.Pole sitter Jean-Eric Vergne, led the race from the restart taking the 28 points on offer - claiming his third win this season - stretching his title lead to 32 points.A wet ending to the race saw Mitch Evans and Sebastian Buemi follow in second and third respectively.
sport	Formula 1 bosses Chase Carey and Ross Brawn commit to staying in roles		Formula 1 bosses Chase Carey and Ross Brawn have committed to staying in their roles to complete the process of overhauling the sport.F1 is in the middle of discussions over new rules from 2021, including a revamp of the cars and introduction of a budget cap.Chief executive Carey and managing director motor sports Brawn will stay on at least until the new structure is completed and stabilised, BBC Sport can reveal.But commercial boss Sean Bratches is tipped to leave F1 at the end of this year.The commercial structure of the sport will be revamped over the winter and senior sources say that Bratches, the managing director commercial operations, will not stay in his post.Bratches, a former vice-president of sales and marketing at US television network ESPN, joined F1 with Carey and Brawn when the sport was take over by US group Liberty Media at the start of 2017.F1 declined to comment on the contractual position of its three senior managers.The commitment by Carey and Brawn means both are set to stay in post at a minimum through the first part of 2021, to ensure not only that the rules process is completed but that any teething problems that emerge that season will be dealt with by experienced hands rather than newcomers.It is understood that both Carey and Brawn are determined to finish what they started, have strong relationships with Liberty bosses and are minded to stay as long as is needed.The move gives the sport stability and may act as a reassurance to shareholders and investors at an uncertain time.Other than Renault, the teams' contracts do not run beyond the end of next season and talks over the 2021 rules are at a delicate stage.Brawn and his technical team have been working on a major revamp of the rules that is aimed at closing up the field and making the cars able to race much more closely together.There are also plans to introduce a series of standard parts which it is hoped, when combined with a budget cap of $175m a year for car operations, will close up the field.However, the top three teams Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull are opposing such sweeping changes.They feel that introducing so many changes at once could backfire and would prefer to keep the technical rules pretty much unchanged. They are also opposed to many of the standard parts as they feel using them will reduce quality, increase the cars' weight and not significantly reduce costs.Their argument is that the budget cap is already agreed and that its introduction renders the need for standard parts obsolete.This has caused a stand-off between Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull on one hand and F1, governing body the FIA and the other teams on the other.There are even suggestions that Ferrari could use its power of veto over the 2021 technical changes if a compromise that they find agreeable cannot be reached.There is a deadline of 31 October to finalise new sporting and technical rules for 2021, after which a new revenue distribution and governance procedure needs to be agreed.At the same time, F1's bosses are discussing potential changes to the format of grand prix weekends next year in an attempt to keep the sport relevant to younger audiences.One idea being broached is at a select number of races next year to replace qualifying with a race, with grid positions set in reverse championship order and the finishing positions defining the grid for the grand prix on Sunday.This and other proposals will be discussed at the next major meeting of teams and bosses in Geneva next month.
sport	Anthoine Hubert: Formula 2 driver Juan Manuel Correa moved to intensive care in UK		"Formula 2 driver Juan Manuel Correa - injured in the accident that killed French driver Anthoine Hubert last Saturday - has been moved to intensive care in Britain.Correa, 20, suffered a spinal injury and broken legs during the support race for the Belgian Formula 1 race.The American subsequently underwent a four-hour operation in Liege.""He will continue his recovery in the care of a specialist team,"" said a statement from his Sauber Junior team.Hubert, who was 22, suffered a huge impact from Correa's car, which was travelling at about 170mph, at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit.The Frenchman was taken to the medical centre following the incident, and died shortly after."
sport	Formula 1: Refuelling return to be discussed		"Formula 1 bosses are discussing bringing back refuelling in 2021.Jean Todt, the president of governing body the FIA, said he would like to bring back the practice, which was outlawed before the 2010 season.Todt said a final decision would be made on the basis of a study on the potential effects.""Personally, I would like to see refuelling, but I am happy to see a study on the positives and negatives,"" said Todt.He said one of the benefits would be that the cars would be lighter at the start of a race as well as smaller.Drivers such as Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have said in recent weeks that the cars are too heavy, as part of a renewed campaign by the Grand Prix Drivers' Association to influence the future of the sport.The cars have increased in weight in recent years by as much as 150kg as a result of the introduction of hybrid engines.""The cars have become too heavy which is something we have discussed,"" said Todt, team boss of Ferrari during the team's dominant era from 2000-2004.""I am pushing for analysing what it would mean if we introduced refuelling. If we did that you would have a lighter car at the start of the race and a smaller car.""And he rejected concerns that refuelling would lead to an increase in costs at a time that F1 has just agreed a budget cap for 2021.""When I hear it will be more expensive it makes me smile,"" Todt said. ""When I see the size of the [teams'] motorhomes I don't think it is the price that will be the killer to introducing it.""Todt said he had been warned that the reintroduction of refuelling would likely lead to teams' race strategies being too similar to each other but countered that that was a product of there being too much simulation in F1.However, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said: ""My recollection of refuelling, which was part of the sport when I came into F1, was that it became just a strategic race as to how much fuel you put in at the start. You wouldn't pass any cars on track, because you would either short-fill or long-fill the car in the pit lane.""So while it was a fascinating race for tacticians and strategists, it was a very static boring race on track. And that's why we moved away from refuelling so the drivers had to cope with a heavy fuel-load car and with that came the challenges of having to manage a car that lost 100kg during the course of a grand prix.""Todt added that he had asked FIA staff to look into whether the number of driver aids in F1 could be reduced.He said he had been told it would not be possible for a modern F1 car to be driven without power steering.But although F1 cars do not have common road-car driver aids such as traction control and stability control, he pointed to the fact that most starts were virtually flawless and that cars cannot stall any more as examples of areas where improvements could be made.His comments come in the context of F1's plans to make a major change in rules for 2021 to improve the quality of the spectacle.The cars' aerodynamics will be changed to allow them to race closer together, and a budget cap and changes to the prize money structure have been agreed in an attempt to reduce the performance differential between the teams.The budget cap was agreed last month, but the sporting and technical regulations have to be finalised by October.Todt admitted that the budget cap, which was agreed at $175m (about £140m) a year with exceptions for a number of areas such as the salaries of drivers and top executives, was a compromise.""Two years ago, I was very sceptical we would finally agree a structure. Is it the best agreement? No. But I think it is the best compromise,"" Todt said.He said he was ""expecting a lot of controversy"" over whether cap was being effectively policed.But he added: ""But I don't think a reputable organisation can take any risks of cheating because of the risk of damaging their reputation."""
sport	W Series: Has it already made a difference as women bid for Formula 1?	Female, gifted and broke'It's been incredible'What's holding women back in racing?What happens next?	"'Rethink racing' - that's what the W Series asked us to do.In six races over a four-month period, the female-only motorsport championship has generated significant interest in a male-dominated industry with the ultimate aim of getting women on the grids of top-level racing.The series is designed to help women break through the 'glass ceiling' often experienced after junior karting, when drivers embark on the quest for sponsors to fund the next level of a career in motorsport - which can cost millions.Originally criticised for segregating women from male competition, several of the 20 women who lined up on the W Series grid have been handed a chance they would not ordinarily have had.Just a week after the series finale, a number of drivers have earned paid seats elsewhere.When driver Alice Powell sought sponsorship, the response she often received was: ""We're not sure that a woman in motor racing is the right positioning for us.""The first race of the series in Hockenheim, Germany, was Powell's first time behind the wheel in five years because of the struggle for backing.Before the W Series came along, her dream of being a full-time racing driver appeared to be over and she worked as a labourer for the family firm, renovating properties.Powell said: ""Then W Series came along and changed the game. I had just been unblocking a urinal when I got the call.""Following Powell's second place at Hockenheim, Powell took W Series CEO Catherine Bond Muir to one side. Bond Muir explained: ""She hugged me and said 'thank you for making me feel like this again'.""Bond Muir, who has become known for her close relationship with all the drivers in the series, added: ""Alice was the first woman in GP3 to get points and then her career stopped and there was nothing for her, and this has given her the opportunity to show the world what a great driver she is.""Two days after Powell won her first W Series race in the season finale at Brands Hatch, it was announced she will drive for Heinricher Racing in IMSA GT3, a top-level sportscar championship, alongside British driver Katherine Legge; racing in W Series certainly helped her cause.Powell's is not the only success story. W Series champion Jamie Chadwick, who sealed the title at Brands Hatch, is backed by Aston Martin's junior driver programme, and won her class in the Nurburgring 24 hours race. She also signed for the Williams Formula 1 team as a development driver in May.Chadwick told BBC Sport: ""I was relatively unknown coming into this season and now I think the leg up the W Series has given me has been huge... I think as a first year of the series goes, it's been incredible what they've managed to achieve.""Spain's 19-year-old Marta Garcia, who was one of five different drivers to win a W Series race, said she was ""relieved"" to be on the grid 18 months after being short of money and dropped by Renault's driver academy in Spanish Formula 4 following just one season in the car.Now, after finishing fourth overall, Garcia plans to invest her £82,500 prize money in the Toyota Racing Series in New Zealand.Sabre Cook, an American engineer working for Infiniti and Renault in Formula 1, competed in the W Series to become one step closer to racing in the USA's biggest single-seater series, IndyCar. Italian driver Vicky Piria - who finished ninth in the W Series championship - was in touching distance of being an F1 test driver in 2013, aged 18, until it fell through.When W Series chairman Sean Wadsworth's children had a go-kart race, he told his 11-year-old daughter ""you could be a racing driver"". She replied: ""There's no point."" Wadsworth asked why and she responded: ""Because women don't do that.""The W Series was Bond Muir's idea, born over drinks with some friends. After doing some research and finding that women can race equally in motorsport, Bond Muir initially felt a women-only category was ""a completely dreadful idea because there's no need for it"".She told BBC Sport: ""And then I did more research and found that in the previous eight years the number of women competing in single-seater series across the world was actually diminishing year on year. I thought 'actually, there does need to be this platform'.""In motorsport, it's no secret that drivers need huge sums of money to make it - around £7m to get from junior karting to Formula 1.Media playback is not supported on this deviceChadwick added: ""Financial backing is the biggest hurdle and it's the same for everyone. If you look at all the drivers that have made it into F1 now, they have all come with significant backing whether that's personal or through sponsors or a team. None of them have paved the way by scraping the barrel.""It's tough, it's the way the sport is, but hopefully this has put me in a position to make that happen.""Wadsworth highlighted the success of the US women's football team, saying: ""Nike started investing in them 10-15 years ago and that allowed them to become professional sportswomen.""The big difference between what we have here and what Lewis [Hamilton] can do, or the rich kids in Formula 2 [the feeder series into F1], is Alice Powell has to fit toilets with her dad at the weekend because she's not a professional athlete.""As well as providing 20 women with the opportunity to race, it has given them media exposure on a global level. The races have been broadcast to more than 300 million people in more than 70 countries.Wadsworth added: ""Fabienne Wohlwend has just given up her job, and I think there's three of four of them going to be resigning from their jobs because they can now be professional athletes.""Many elements of the series have been distinctive and refreshing and it's all in the detail; from giving the top 10 drivers a share of the £1.2m prize pot to reinvest in racing, to the complimentary chocolates in the hospitality area which include helmet designs of past female F1 drivers.""W Series has changed many perceptions since its launch, including my own,"" said motorsport journalist Luke Smith. ""I was initially doubtful of the series' necessity, but it has quickly proved itself to be a massively positive force for women in motorsport.""It is helping to shine a spotlight on female racers, as well as opening up more doors for them. Beyond that, its wider message looks set to help inspire the next generation of women in motorsport both on and off the race track.""The W Series may have been set up to help raise female participation, but it has also created a platform to solve one of motorsport's big challenges - the cost of competing, at least for women.There are valuable superlicence points on offer next year for those with aspirations to compete at the top level. It is 43 years since a woman started an F1 race and the W Series has made the idea of a female driver racing at the pinnacle of motorsport more realistic."

sport	Alex Albon named Red Bull second driver for 2020 F1 season	Analysis	"Red Bull have named Alex Albon as their second Formula 1 driver for next season.Red Bull demoted Pierre Gasly to its junior team Toro Rosso mid-season and promoted the 23-year-old Thai-Briton for the remaining races.Albon has finished in the top six in every race he has contested for Red Bull, outscoring team-mate Max Verstappen by 19 points.""I know how fortunate I am to be given this opportunity,"" said Albon.""I'm hugely thankful that Red Bull have put their trust in me and believed in my results since I joined the team and for them to keep me in the car next year is a big deal.""Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner said there was still ""plenty of potential to unlock"" in the youngster, who made his Formula 1 debut for Toro Rosso at this year's Australian Grand Prix.""Alex has performed extremely well since his debut with the team in Belgium and his results - seven finishes in the top six - speak for themselves,"" he said.""It's extremely hard to deny that level of consistency and in tandem with a growing reputation as a tenacious, fiercely committed racer, Alex has proved that he fully deserves to continue his progress with Red Bull.""Meanwhile, Gasly will remain with Toro Rosso for the 2020 season, alongside Daniil Kvyat.BBC chief Formula 1 writer Andrew BensonAlbon has impressed since he was promoted in place of Gasly for the second part of the season.Perhaps his single stand-out performance was matching Verstappen's qualifying time at the Japanese Grand Prix, despite it being Albon's first visit to the daunting Suzuka circuit.There have also been a series of strong race drives, including coming through the field from the back in Belgium and Russia.The statistic that he has outscored Verstappen since he joined the team is slightly misleading, as the Dutchman has had a couple of messy races and a retirement through no fault of his own in Japan - and Albon has yet to prove he can match Verstappen's pace consistently.But the team have been very impressed by his technical feedback and his intellectual approach to his job.He carries around a little notebook in which he keeps key bits of information and is said by senior figures to be extremely sharp when it comes to analysing the performance of his car.Red Bull is a highly pressured environment but Albon has proved to be a calm and unflustered character. He and Verstappen get along well, and it is clear Verstappen has respect for Albon's ability, the two having been old rivals from their younger days in karting.Albon, who has a British father and Thai mother and has spent most his life in the UK but chose to race under a Thai licence, had a roundabout route to F1, but watching his development in 2020 will be one of the key themes of next season."

The Envision Virgin Racing driver made a successful lunge up the inside of polesitter Sims after the Safety Car restart which saw Andre Lotterer and Jose Maria Lopez retire following a collision on the first lap.Briton Sims' claimed his first pole position in nine years on Sunday, which came as a surprise to many - rounding up to a career 10th. That knocked Buemi out of championship contention as he needed three points for pole position and a race win to seal the championship.The Swiss driver Buemi, who won the championship in Formula E's second season, had to settle for a podium finish - his fourth in the last four races."
sport	Jolyon Palmer column: Formula 1's winners and losers so far in 2019	WINNERSHamilton and MercedesMax VerstappenHondaThe British rookiesLOSERSFerrariPierre GaslyRenault	Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault during the 2017 season, is part of the BBC team and offers insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitorsFormula 1 is on a summer break after a hectic run of five races in seven weeks, so this seems like a good time to reflect on the first part of the season.With 12 races down and nine to go, some teams and drivers have had a good first 'half' of 2019... and some much less so.This is my verdict on the year's winners and losers so far.Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes have been a record-breaking combination in 2019.Ferrari showed testing promise in Barcelona, but it was Mercedes who flew out of the blocks at the first race in Melbourne, and displayed utter dominance for much of the first part of the season.Hamilton and team-mate Valtteri Bottas were trading blows in the early races - indeed Bottas actually had the edge in qualifying up until Monaco.But Hamilton has been the man to shift up a gear when the going has got tougher - and it has, because both Ferrari and Red Bull have become more regular threats to the Mercedes dominance as spring turned to summer.Bottas has wilted away and is now a massive 62 points behind his team-mate, while Hamilton has remained on near-perfect form with his team, aside from the chaos of Germany where both team and driver faltered.This is a partnership that is heading towards another title, and another record - the first team to win six consecutive drivers' and constructors' championships. They might as well start engraving the trophies now.Max Verstappen has been the only driver not to make any significant mistakes this year, and arguably has been the strongest across the season so far.The Red Bull car was not as quick as Ferrari or Mercedes in the early races, yet Verstappen was constantly in podium contention.Now that Red Bull has taken a step forward, Verstappen is a constant menace to Mercedes. Two wins in the last four races - and almost a third in Hungary last weekend, but for a superlative performance from the Mercedes/Hamilton combination - show Verstappen is driving at the top of his game.Two front rows and a pole position since Austria in late June prove the Dutchman now has qualifying sorted as well, and I expect the Verstappen/Hamilton rivalry seen in Hungary to be a regular feature in the second half of the season.Red Bull's engine partner is the unsung hero of 2019. In a new partnership with Red Bull, the Japanese company has absolutely come into its own. The engine is still down on ultimate performance compared to Ferrari and Mercedes, but the progress it has made has been frightening.Winning races and now a first pole position in the hybrid era are well-deserved achievements for an engine manufacturer that was dragged through the mud in recent years during its ill-fated partnership with McLaren.Toro Rosso's strong performances this season are proof this isn't just a Red Bull special.Daniil Kvyat took Toro Rosso's first podium for more than 10 years with Honda power in Germany, and while Red Bull started slowly, the progression curve they have shown should be a worry to Mercedes looking forward to next year.It's not just Hamilton who has done a good job this year; the other Brits have been fantastic as well.Both rookies Lando Norris and George Russell might have been expected to take some time to bed in, but they have both been extremely quick from the outset.Norris has been faster than team-mate Carlos Sainz fairly convincingly across the first 12 races, although he trails him by a long way in the standings.That's partly because of some unreliability for Norris in Canada, France and Germany, while Sainz has also been very impressive in his own right, with great drives in Austria and Germany in particular. As a whole, McLaren are on the up.Russell has had a tougher time, because of the difficult position in which the Williams team find themselves, but he has done everything that could be expected of himHe has utterly demolished Robert Kubica in the team-mate stakes except from in Germany - and that will no doubt hurt as his fellow Williams driver somehow took the team's only point so far.With Williams showing more potential in Hungary, Russell will be hopeful of more eventful outings for the second half of the season to truly show his potential.There should also be honourable mentions for Kimi Raikkonen for proving he's still got it as he approaches 40 in the Alfa Romeo, and Anglo-Thai rookie Alexander Albon, who like Russell and Norris has had a very encouraging start to his Formula 1 career at Toro Rosso.Ferrari have underperformed massively in 2019. From being pre-season favourites, they've faltered relentlessly in every aspect.The car lacked pure speed early on and Mercedes leapt to an unassailable lead in the standings, but Ferrari also lacked reliability, which cost Charles Leclerc a win in Bahrain. Further reliability issues have hampered both drivers in Germany and Sebastian Vettel in Austria, leaving them to start from well down the order.But it's not just the car that's been poor. The drivers have made too many errors as well.Vettel threw away a strong result in Bahrain with a spin, and a good chance of a win in Canada with his grass-tracking moment and subsequent penalty.Leclerc has emerged as slightly the quicker driver in the last few races, but he is equally guilty of making too many mistakes - although he at least has the slight extenuating circumstances of still being very inexperienced in just his second season.The 21-year-old threw away a chance of victory in Baku with a qualifying crash, and then another chance in Germany went begging as he slithered into the wall. He was also extremely lucky to get away with an accident at the start of qualifying in Hungary.Operationally Ferrari have been poor as well.The strategy can be questioned for Leclerc losing a win in Austria - he started on the wrong tyres and pitted too early.Monaco qualifying was a mess, with Leclerc sat in the garage as he went out at the end of the first part of qualifying because Ferrari assumed he would be safe - only for him to end up knocked out.All in all, this has been one of the most dismal halves of a season for Ferrari and it culminated with them finishing more than a minute away from the win in Budapest. Hamilton could have done five pit stops and still beaten both Ferraris.There are positives, though. The car has had the pace to win at least four races - Bahrain, Baku, Canada and Austria - and is extremely fast in a straight line. The next two tracks of Spa and Monza have historically been a happy hunting ground for the Italian team and they should suit the car down to the ground.Ferrari will arrive at both races as favourites in spite of their woes thus far. If they can put those issues behind them and pull off a result in Belgium and/or Italy, they could still feature well in the remaining races.Pierre Gasly hasn't turned up yet in 2019. Since his switch to Red Bull, he has been nowhere near team-mate Verstappen, and the pressure is mounting.Two pre-season crashes set the tone for the Frenchman and it was clear he was struggling to adapt to his new surroundings.Being lapped by his team-mate en route to Verstappen's first win of the season in Austria would have been a particular low point, especially as Gasly actually got ahead of Verstappen on the first lap. He was lapped again in Hungary on Sunday.But in reality there are low points everywhere for Gasly this season. He has a lot of talent - he showed it last year with Toro Rosso - but the fact he's yet to beat his best result from last year is telling.I sometimes wonder if there's more than meets the eye here, because of the extent of the deficit to Verstappen, all of the time.Ultimately, I can't see Gasly turning this around in the second half of the season either and it looks fairly ominous for the young driver right now.Renault - and Daniel Ricciardo in particular - have had something of a horror show in 2019. Having made some steady progress since returning in 2016, this season the French manufacturer looks to have taken a leap backwards, in spite of signing a proven race winner in Ricciardo.For Ricciardo this must be humbling. He left Red Bull, who now look stronger than they ever were in the years the Aussie was at the helm, and now Renault have taken a step backwards for good measure.One points finish for Ricciardo in the last five races sums it up, while team-mate Nico Hulkenburg has struggled equally - or perhaps even more - in the other car.The engine looks to have taken a step forward, but reliability remains an Achilles' heel - four retirements can be attributed to the engine.The car overall, though, is just too slow, and Renault have slipped to sixth in the constructors' standings.Unless they can make a big step in the next few races, they could be looking over their shoulder at Alfa Romeo for the rest of the year, rather than aiming for fourth and bridging the gap to the big three, which was their ambition at the start of the season.What's the negative version of an 'honourable mention'? I'm not sure. Whatever it is, Bottas gets one for fading away dramatically after a very strong start, as do Haas, who are having all manner of troubles with their car, the tyres and also their drivers clashing too often.
sport	Formula 1: Melbourne to host Australian Grand Prix until 2025		"The Australian Grand Prix will continue to be held at Melbourne's Albert Park until at least 2025.The circuit has been the home of the race since 1996 and has become the sport's traditional curtain raiser.""This is proof that more and more promoters share our long-term vision for the future of F1,"" said Chase Carey, the sport's chief executive.It comes just a week after the future of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone was secured until 2024.Next year's season-opening race in Melbourne will be on 15 March, with Formula 1 celebrating its 70th anniversary."
sport	Ferrari: Charles Leclerc charts his journey to the top of Formula 1	A humble upbringing in a rich man's playgroundDealing with two terrible tragediesThe benefits of mental trainingDealing with team orders at FerrariRacing against a four-time championVerstappen and the future	"Charles Leclerc knew he wanted to be a Formula 1 driver by the time he was four years old.He grew up in Monaco, home of the most famous grand prix of all, and he says his first memory of the race is playing with toy cars at a friend's apartment on the exit of the first corner, watching the grand prix at the same time, ""dreaming of being there one day"".The car he dreamed about most was Michael Schumacher's Ferrari. And now, 17 years on, the dream has come true. Leclerc is driving his own F1 Ferrari, and doing a rather good job of it.While the headlines after last Sunday's British Grand Prix focused on Lewis Hamilton's record sixth victory at Silverstone, in many ways the highlight of the race was Leclerc's epic battle with Red Bull's Max Verstappen for the first 20 laps. It was just the latest indication that Leclerc could be a man with a very bright future.At the halfway point of his first season at Ferrari, only his second in F1, the 21-year-old could have had at least one win - and possibly a couple more.Leclerc is obviously disappointed that he missed out when his engine hit trouble in the closing laps in Bahrain after he had dominated the race. And he was mortified to crash in qualifying in Baku, when the race weekend looked to be his for the taking.In Monaco, he had set the pace in final practice, only for a strategy error by Ferrari to see him knocked out of the first part of qualifying. Losing the lead to a charging Verstappen with two laps to go in Austria hurt, too.But he says: ""It motivates me even more to try to progress and take that first win as quickly as possible. That's my target. I am trying to work as hard as possible and hopefully it will come soon.""In an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, one of F1's brightest new stars discusses: his formative years; the effect of the deaths of both his father and godfather - the former F1 driver Jules Bianchi; being team-mate to four-time champion Sebastian Vettel; his progress so far; and his ambitions for the future.Leclerc's father, Hervé, was a Formula Three driver and he introduced his son to karting, the nursery for nearly all F1 drivers, when he was three and a half years old.""From that moment on,"" Leclerc says, ""it was pretty clear I wanted to do that.""They lived in Monaco, with its reputation as a rich man's playground, but Leclerc says they were ""not particularly wealthy - in 2011, I had to stop karting because my father did not have enough money for me to continue and we did not have enough sponsors to help us"".The then 14-year-old was able to continue his career because he was picked up by Nicholas Todt. The son of FIA president Jean Todt had built a substantial driver management stable, which included Bianchi, Leclerc's godfather, who was then racing in GP2, the step below F1, and a Ferrari test driver.Thanks to Todt, Leclerc followed Bianchi into the Ferrari driver academy.Bianchi was only eight years older than Leclerc, more like an older brother, and was instrumental in tutoring the young driver during his formative years in karting.But despite the motor racing background, and a stellar career in karting, Leclerc says he only began to think that he could actually make it to F1 ""pretty late"".""I never told myself that I actually could arrive there,"" he says. ""I just told myself to keep working and keep focusing on the present to try to improve what I could do now and then I would probably have the opportunity to get there.""Did Bianchi and his father not tell him he had the talent to make it?""Yeah,"" Leclerc says, ""but I think they were saying a lot more: 'Keep your feet on the ground and keep working.' So, yeah, in the end I think I took the other side and kept working and not thinking too much about Formula 1.""This humility is something many have noticed about Leclerc since he made it to F1. He says: ""I am pretty sure it comes from them. I don't think I've ever been arrogant or anything like that, so it's also a bit natural.""I honestly believe it is the way forward. But the fact they kept telling it to me, I think it has helped me.""On track, Leclerc progressed to F1 pretty much as seamlessly as possible, winning almost everything along the way.Off track, though, he has had to deal with awful darkness - he lost both Bianchi and his father while he was making it through the ranks.Bianchi was driving for Marussia in F1 when he suffered terrible head injuries in a crash during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. He died nine months later. Despite the tragedy, Leclerc says he never considered stopping motor racing.""There was definitely no thoughts any time to stop my career because of that,"" he says. ""From the beginning when you go into this sport, you know how dangerous it is. It will never be a safe sport.""Of course, the cars are getting safer and safer but, when you are going at 340km/h, it can never be safe. This I knew from the start. And I just wanted then to be good for him because he had taught me many things.""He had always pushed me forward and helped me to get better, and the only thought I had when this happened was just to do good for him to make him proud.""Then, when Leclerc was competing in Formula 2 in 2017, his father died on the eve of the race at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.Focusing on that weekend, Leclerc says, ""was very, very difficult"". Practice was ""very bad"". But then he had a talk to himself. ""I just asked myself what he wanted me to achieve on a weekend like this, and the answer came back pretty quickly - that he wanted me to win.""So he did - finishing first in both races, although a 10-second penalty in the second demoted him to second place.Leclerc got through this, he says, because of mental training he had been doing since early in his career.""It is always very difficult to put into words because it is not like physical training, where you lift weights and you can definitely see the difference where you are lifting more weight week after week,"" Leclerc says.""It is a little bit the same process. But the results, you don't see them as easily because it is about how you are feeling and how you are dealing with pressure. So it comes a lot more naturally.""But I have a lot of tests to see more the results of it. And it is all about concentration, being calm in the tense moments, which is very important, being able to calm yourself as quickly as possible.""F1 weekends are full of things and any time that you have five minutes, you need to use it as well as possible to calm down. So all of these small details make a small difference in the end.""Leclerc's dominant F2 season earned him a seat at Sauber in 2018 and, after a shaky first three races, he turned a corner in Baku, where he drove brilliantly to take sixth place.From there, he never looked back.His impressive performances earned him the call from Ferrari, and he became their least experienced driver since the legendary Gilles Villeneuve was signed in late 1977.Before Leclerc had even turned up at his first race, though, team boss Mattia Binotto made it clear that Vettel would have priority in ""50-50 situations"". This translated to the application of team orders of one kind or another at all of the first five races this season.This, Leclerc admits, was ""not easy - but it's part of it, so you need to get used to it and understand it, being clever when you accept them and when you don't, and for now it has worked pretty well"".The one time he ignored an order was when he was recovering quickly after a bad start from pole in Bahrain and was told to wait two laps behind Vettel, who was leading. Leclerc passed Vettel a few corners later.""There were a few races where it was reasonable and then others like in Bahrain when I thought it was better not to respect them,"" Leclerc says, ""because in the car I felt I had more information than they had on the pit wall. That's how I felt it.""I felt like I had a significant pace advantage, I was coming quite quickly and I felt it reasonable to overtake.""In the end, I understand they are trying to do the best job for the team and I completely understand. It can be very frustrating from the car sometimes but it is all about staying calm and then the mental work I have done since the beginning of my career helps.""Ferrari's lack of competitiveness, and the way the past few races have developed, mean the team orders issue has evaporated.Focus has shifted on to the dynamic between the two Ferrari drivers. Leclerc was quicker than Vettel at a number of races in the first part of the season - Bahrain, Baku and Monaco - but he harmed his chances with a series of mistakes in qualifying. Some were big, such as when he crashed in Baku when looking set to dominate the weekend; the rest were small.A mediocre performance in Canada in mid-June, though, led to some soul-searching and self-analysis. He changed his approach to qualifying after working out how to have the car set up properly for when it matters, the top 10 shootout. Leclerc has out-qualified Vettel at all three races since.Does he think this was a turning point?""This definitely was a positive point of the season,"" he says. ""Then, whether it is going to be the turning point or not, I don't know.""But as I've said, I am still very early in my racing career and I am pretty sure there is a lot more I can learn and a lot more things I can do better. I will focus on these things and hopefully there will be even more turning points in the future.""If Leclerc carries on like this, life will become even more uncomfortable for Vettel than it already is after his series of crashes in the past year. Leclerc says he is simply enjoying being measured against a driver of such quality.""It was always going to be a very interesting challenge for me,"" he says. ""I am at the beginning of my career. He is a very experienced driver and to have him by my side is very important because I can definitely grow a lot and learn a lot things from him, which I did from the beginning of the season.""But it is also a great challenge for me to try to beat him, and that's what I am here for. I always want to be the fastest on track and I always try to give absolutely everything to be in front.""Leclerc's monumental battle with Verstappen at Silverstone was an echo of times past, in a less high-profile arena - they were disputing karting titles in the early part of this decade and now find themselves going toe-to-toe again at the highest level.The way things look now, Leclerc-Verstappen could turn into the next great F1 rivalry.""I really hope so,"" Leclerc says. ""We had some very good fights in karting that didn't always end in a good manner, but it was fun, good times.""They have had wheel-to-wheel battles in the past two races, their brief but intense fight for the lead in Austria preceding the much more drawn-out - and even more intense - one at Silverstone.""And I can't wait to have more with him,"" Leclerc says. ""In the end, we have done most of our career together, so it is fun to find ourselves again here in Formula 1.""And his more general ambitions for the future?""Well, hopefully the first win to come very soon,"" he says. ""And many more after. But at the end the target is the first win now, trying to take the opportunity whenever we have it.""In the future... my dream as a child was being a world champion. Now I am finally in a team where I think this can be a reality so we need to keep working and hopefully this will happen one day.""After the first 18 months of his F1 career, would anyone bet against it?"
sport	Formula 1 2019: All you need to know about the teams	Alfa Romeo - Kimi Raikkonen (7), Antonio Giovinazzi (99)Ferrari - Sebastian Vettel (5), Charles Leclerc (16)Haas - Romain Grosjean (8), Kevin Magnussen (20)McLaren - Carlos Sainz (55), Lando Norris (4)Mercedes - Lewis Hamilton (44), Valtteri Bottas (77)Racing Point - Sergio Perez (11), Lance Stroll (18)Red Bull - Max Verstappen (33), Pierre Gasly (10)Renault - Daniel Ricciardo (3), Nico Hulkenberg (27)Toro Rosso - Daniil Kvyat (26), Alexander Albon (23)Williams - George Russell (63), Robert Kubica (88)	All you need to know about the teams in 2019 (all facts correct as of the start of the season).Taking over from Sauber, the Alfa Romeo name returns to Formula 1 for the first time since 1985. All of Alfa Romeo's 10 wins came in the first two years of the Formula 1 championship - 1950 and 1951 - with Giuseppe Farina becoming the world champion in 1950 and Juan Manuel Fangio a year later.For 2019 they have the most experienced driver in F1 in the form of 39-year-old Kimi Raikkonen, partnered by 25-year-old Italian Antonio Giovinazzi, who starts the season with only two grands prix to his name as he replaces Marcus Ericsson.The 2018 season promised so much for Ferrari, but in the end Sebastian Vettel finished 88 points behind world champion Lewis Hamilton with the team 84 points adrift of Mercedes in the Constructors' Championship.They have a new pairing for 2019 as 21-year-old Charles Leclerc swaps seats with Raikkonen, who is now at Alfa Romeo, to partner four-time world champion Vettel.It is the same again for American team Haas as Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen keep their places for 2019. Magnussen got the bragging rights in 2018 as he came ninth in the championship, with Grosjean 14th.A frustrating year for McLaren in 2018 saw Fernando Alonso retire from F1 as his car was not competitive enough. He is replaced by compatriot Carlos Sainz, who moves from Renault, with the Spaniard joined at the team by 19-year-old Briton Lando Norris, the runner-up in the 2018 Formula 2 Championship.Once again Mercedes were supreme in 2018 with Lewis Hamilton winning the world title again and the team becoming the constructors champions for the fifth successive season.But question marks remain over his team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who faced team orders in Russia and was told to give the race lead to Hamilton, before the Finn had a disappointing end to the campaign, coming only fifth in each of the final four races of 2018.Racing Point is the new name for the team formerly known as Force India, who were bought out by a consortium led by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll.Despite the off-track turmoil, Force India still did remarkably well in 2018, ending seventh in the standings, despite having the 59 points in the Constructors' Championship they earned in the opening 12 races of the season wiped from the records after going into administration. They would have come fifth overall if they had been able to keep all their pre-administration points. Lawrence's son Lance moves over from Williams to join Sergio Perez at the team.A season of what might have been for Red Bull in 2018. The pairing of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo won four races between them, but at least one of their cars (sometimes both) failed to finish in 10 of the 21 races, with Ricciardo not finishing eight times.The Australian has now gone to Renault with Pierre Gasly getting a promotion from Toro Rosso to join Verstappen.There is a new face at Renault this year as Daniel Ricciardo - having tired of reliability issues at Red Bull and also playing second fiddle to Max Verstappen - moves to the French team to join up with Nico Hulkenberg.A surprise pairing for 2019 as Russian Daniil Kvyat, who dropped out of Formula 1 during the 2017 season, is back in the sport and partnered by 22-year-old newcomer Alexander Albon, the London-born and Suffolk-educated Thai who finished third in the Formula 2 Championship in 2018.Last season was a disaster for Williams as they finished bottom of the constructors' championship after picking up only seven points, with their drivers finishing in the top 10 in just two of the 21 races.This year they have a completely new line-up. Robert Kubica is back racing in F1 after a nine-year absence and is joined by Formula 2 champion George Russell, a 20-year-old Englishman.
sport	Brazilian GP: Lewis Hamilton to negotiate new F1 contract	Focus on Ferrari	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceLewis Hamilton wants to continue in Formula 1 - but will take his time over finalising a new contract.The British driver, who clinched his sixth world title at the US Grand Prix, is almost certain to stay at Mercedes.""When you've been with a team for so long, we are kind of joined at the hip,"" the 34-year-old said. ""All that detail can take its time.""But you need to set some time aside to say 'where are we, what's the next goal, what else are we planning?'""Hamilton's current Mercedes contract runs until the end of the 2020 season.Speaking before this weekend's Brazilian Grand Prix, he said one of the issues on which he is looking for an answer is the future of team boss Toto Wolff, who has been linked in some quarters with a potential move to running Formula 1.""It's a difficult one because I know being stuck in one position for too long can not always be a positive so I always want people to spread their wings and do what is best for their careers. Only he knows what that is,"" Hamilton said.""But as a business you need to have the right people in place and he has been the right person - it has been the perfect match.""So I don't particularly want him to leave if I'm staying in the sport but ultimately that's going to be his choice.""This team is not one person. It's a huge group of people. But it is important to me and I am waiting to see where his head is at. The sport could also be in a good place with someone like him running it but I don't know if that's more of a fun experience.""Hamilton said he was not especially looking forward to the negotiations because ""it is just confrontation, isn't it?""He added: ""It's almost like I only just did this contract and I already have to start talking about the potential of the next one.""It won't be really stressful but it's daunting when you think about it coming up, also because you are committing to a period of time and it's sometimes hard to think that far ahead but of course it's nice to be wanted and hopefully soon we'll get that sorted.""Wolff is not in Brazil for this weekend's race, missing a grand prix for the first time since he took over as Mercedes motorsport boss in 2013 as he stays in Europe attending to other issues.Hamilton said: ""I texted him and said 'you've built an incredible team here and we're going to do you proud'.""Nothing really changes for us within the team. he will be missed on the pit wall and his input through the weekend will be missed but we are still here to do a job and our focus doesn't shift. He'll still be watching so you can still get in trouble from the headmaster.""Hamilton is determined to end the season on a high, saying he wants to win the final two grands prix in Brazil on Sunday and Abu Dhabi on 1 December.Ferrari will be the centre of attention in some ways following their poor performance at the last race in Austin.That followed a rules clarification from governing body the FIA, underlining ways in which interfering with the running of the engine's hybrid system would be illegal.The ruling came in answer to an enquiry from Red Bull, who had asked about potential ways of interfering with the mandatory fuel-flow meter that could lead it to exceed the maximum permitted fuel flow.Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto said in Austin that the ruling had not affected them, but there has been another clarification before the race in Sao Paulo, this time emphasising that it would be illegal for teams to introduce lubricants into the engine which could have the side-effect of boosting power.Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel said the team ""did not fully understand"" why they were off the pace in the US, but added: ""I am pretty confident we can be back to our normal form here.""Asked if that would silence the suspicion, Vettel said: ""We have had Mercedes having the best engine for five years and if it is now for a couple of months we are ahead, hopefully it stays like that for another five years and I don't care what people think or say.""Red Bull's Max Verstappen said in Austin that he believed Ferrari's dip in form was directly related to the first clarification.But Vettel said: ""Everybody is free to say what they want. I don't think anybody in the team took it personal. It is not professional and not mature.""We are not proud of how we performed in Austin on Sunday. After Saturday, no-one had the need to complain. Sunday, we struggled with more than one thing - conditions, tyres, set-up, which are things we need to work on. But live and let live. If that's what he thinks, that's what he thinks, but in the end we don't care so much.""Charles Leclerc, Ferrari's lead driver in the championship, has a 10-place grid penalty in Brazil as a result of fitting a new engine following a failure in practice in the US, which required him to use a previous-specification engine in the race.He said: ""I personally don't have any motivation to prove them wrong. We all know what we are doing. We know there is absolutely nothing wrong. And I feel confident things will come back to normal here.""In Austin, there were a few things did not go our way - and the change of engine to the older spec on my side was not ideal and for the race we saw that and that is why we changed the engine to the newer spec. But no extra motivation to prove them wrong."""
sport	Formula E season finale: A season of exciting racing nears conclusion	Narrow, twisty circuits - where team-mates tangleCloser racing - where victory can vanish in an instantPower save - when the battery diesSkills really matter...	"Formula E truly has it all: crashes, pile-ups, bumper-to-bumper racing, narrow twisty circuits and multiple winners - and that's just in one season that isn't even over yet.In its five-year existence, it has created its own niche as an environmentally friendly racing series, allowing manufacturers to test and develop new technology for the electric car market.But it is the racing that appears to be effecting change within motorsport.While Formula 1 - in its 70th year - battles criticism over the sport being too predictable, with controversial penalties dictating race results and a shortage of close racing, the Formula E season has been packed with thrilling races.The title race comes to a head this weekend with a double-header in New York City, where Jean-Eric Vergne will hope to convert his commanding 32-point lead at the top of the drivers' standings into his second successive title.The stage could not be more grand for the season finale, but just what is it that makes Formula E so electrifying?Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe narrow street circuits of Formula E, with some tricky 90-degree corners, can make overtaking difficult. But the close proximity of the walls and the lack of run-off areas means the margin for error is smaller, and races see frequent yellow flags and safety cars.The only possible way to get by your rival is to dive for the momentary gaps, or attack on a straight with the extra 25kw of power from the Attack Mode or Fanboost bonuses afforded to the drivers during a race.In Morocco, Britain's Sam Bird lost his place at the front of the race to the two BMW i Andretti drivers of Antonio Felix da Costa and Alexander Sims, who swapped positions as leaders until an over-excited Sims locked up, showing his team-mate the wall.Da Costa was out, and fuming, as Jerome d'Ambrosio inherited victory.Media playback is not supported on this deviceCars getting as close as they can is something fans love, even if it doesn't always work out so successfully for the drivers.In Formula E there's less 'dirty air' disrupting the flow from the aerodynamics of the car in front - as in F1 - meaning drivers can get closer to their rivals.Having spent much of the Hong Kong E-Prix locked in battle, Virgin Envision Racing's Sam Bird punctured leader Andre Lotterer's right rear tyre when aiming for an overtake on the final lap.Bird was given a five-second penalty for what was a ""disgusting move"", according to Lotterer, stripping him of his win after he had already collected the trophy on the podium and dropping him down to sixth.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIn previous years, Formula E drivers had to pit for a new car as the batteries did not last for the duration of the race.But the new 'Gen2' cars can hold on for the 45-minutes-plus-one-lap race duration as long as drivers conserve enough energy to cross the line with some battery life remaining.In Mexico, the race went to the line. Right to the line.Mahindra's Pascal Wehrlein was about to take his first series victory after leading much of the race. Audi Sport's Lucas di Grassi spent much of it chasing him down but was unable to find a gap to overtake.Instead of forcing the issue, he wisely elected to ease the burden on his remaining 2% of battery power by drafting the leader.What followed was a wonderful edge-of-your-seat moment, Di Grassi swooping around Wehrlein just metres before the line and stealing victory as the 1% battery in the stricken Mahindra ticked down to zero.Media playback is not supported on this deviceOne key difference between Formula E and F1 is that in the electric series the cars run the same chassis and battery. Therefore no one car dominates. Instead, drivers must rely on skill - which explains why, until Monaco, there had been eight races with eight different winners.Away from racing, Formula E has been hosted by some of the biggest and most impressive cities around the world to share its environmental capabilities and showcase the best electric car technology the manufacturers have to offer.The cars use road-suitable Michelin tyres which can be recycled, and across race weekends the series promotes the ban of single-use plastics, such as water bottles for spectators and teams.Just as F1 pushes the boundaries on design, technology, composite materials, and aerodynamic capabilities, Formula E is an avenue for the likes of Jaguar, Audi, BMW and other manufacturers to invest in the future of electric road cars."

sport	Wimbledon 2019: Rafael Nadal says seeding formula 'doesn't seem right'		"World number two Rafael Nadal says ""it doesn't seem right"" that he could be seeded behind world number three Roger Federer at Wimbledon.Wimbledon seeding is different from the other Grand Slams in that it does not always follow world rankings and is affected by grass-court performances.It means Federer may be seeded ahead of Nadal, who could be in the same half of the draw as Novak Djokovic.""It's just Wimbledon that does it,"" said 12-time French Open winner Nadal.Speaking to Spanish TV station #Vamos, Nadal added: ""If everyone did it, I think it would be appropriate or correct. Either way, being second or third seed, I have to play at the best level to aspire to the things I aspire to.""It is better to be second than third, but if they consider that I have to be third, I will accept.""Wimbledon seedings will be announced on Wednesday and Nadal, 33, is likely to be behind defending champion Djokovic and eight-time winner Federer, who won his 10th title at the grass-court tournament in Halle last week.The Spaniard lost in the Wimbledon semi-finals to world number one Djokovic last year but had not made it past the fourth round in his five previous appearances.Nadal's viewpoint was supported by Djokovic, who played at the Boodles exhibition event at Stoke Park in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday.""It's their rules and you have to respect it, although it's a little bit surprising to be honest,"" said Djokovic.""Roger is the greatest of all time and has won the most Wimbledon titles of any player in history and if any player deserves it it's him, but at the same time it's Nadal that he is taking over (from as) the second seed.""If he is seeded third, Nadal might have to beat Djokovic to reach the final.The world's top 32 players will be seeded, but the order may not follow that of the world rankings.Wimbledon's system favours grass-court specialists - taking a player's ATP ranking points, doubling the points earned at grass-court tournaments in the past year and adding on 75% of the points earned on grass the previous year.The women's seedings follow the WTA ranking list but changes can be made for a ""balanced draw"", which is why Serena Williams, ranked 183rd before last year's tournament, was 25th seed in 2018.The 2019 tournament begins on Monday."
sport	2020 Formula 1 season begins with Australian Grand Prix on 15 March		"The 2020 Formula 1 season will start on 15 March with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.The 25th race in Melbourne, which first hosted the sport in 1996, will mark the start of F1's 70th anniversary year.F1 chairman Chase Carey said: ""The Albert Park circuit is one of the most popular on the calendar. There is no better place to start the 2020 season.""The date, the same weekend as the start of last season, was announced without any further details of the calendar.F1 has already said there will be two new races on the schedule next year, with the return of the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort and a new race in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi.But four races are in doubt, with Britain, Germany, Mexico and Spain all out of contract at the end of this season.At least two of those races are expected to lose their places on the calendar, keeping the total number of races next year at 21.Spain and Germany are considered most vulnerable, and the Mexican government has expressed reservations about continuing with the race, but there are also doubts about the British event.F1 and Silverstone had been close to agreeing a new contract but the track's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club, are holding off on signing it after F1 admitted it wanted to hold a race in London.Italy's contract also ends this year, but F1 announced in April that it had reached an ""agreement in principle"" for a new deal through 2024. That contract has not yet been confirmed.There is also confusion surrounding the future of the Brazilian Grand Prix.The country's President Jair Bolsonaro has said the race will move to a new track in Rio de Janeiro from next year.But Sao Paulo's Interlagos circuit still has a year left on its contract, and there is widespread scepticism within F1 about the event in Rio. Several sources have told BBC Sport that ""it's not going to happen""."

If I could get to F1, that'd be great; if I could get three titles, that'd be incredible. And now we've doubled that - it's truly unbelievable.""Hamilton has two more races to go before the end of the season and he said after clinching the title at the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, on Sunday that he was determined to do as well as possible in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, with a particular focus on qualifying, which he has said is the one area he is less than satisfied with this year.""In my mind, I'm just too competitive,"" he said in Austin. ""So I'm thinking: 'OK, we've got two more races to go, how am I going to do a better job, how am I going to improve in qualifying? There's two more qualifyings to try and get pole, how am I going to see if I can potentially pull out a lap like I did in Singapore last year? How am I going to work it that I can be at the front of both of those?'""I'm always just looking to improve and I really love being in this sport. I'm so grateful to this sport for giving me a life and giving my life purpose.""At the celebration event, held at the Mercedes engine base in Brixworth and then the F1 car headquarters in Brackley, both in Northamptonshire, Hamilton thanked the Mercedes team ""for continuing to push every year"".Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, now the most successful F1 team principal in history in terms of winning consecutive championships, added: ""I remember our first management off-site meeting in 2013 where we put our objectives on the wall - it was the first time we wrote down 'We want to fight for a championship'.""But (then engineering director) Aldo Costa said that we should be more ambitious and make it plural - championships.""My first thought was that that's too far-fetched. But we ended up putting it on the wall. And here we are, almost seven years later, having won six double championships. I still pinch myself sometimes because I can't quite believe it."""
sport	Formula 1 teams agree to delay finalising new rules until October		"Formula 1 teams and bosses have agreed to delay the finalisation of new rules for 2021 until the end of October.There was a statutory deadline of this month for the changes to be settled but the unanimous agreement required for a delay was reached on Thursday.To achieve it, teams had to sign a letter guaranteeing that provisions for a budget cap and other financial rules could not undergo any further changes.Five smaller teams had refused to agree to the delay without this promise.This means that in 2021 teams will have to operate on a maximum budget of $175m, with exclusions for driver costs, the salaries of the three top executives, and marketing and race weekend travel costs.For the top three teams Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull, this is a significant drop from the $300-400m they currently spend.An FIA statement said: ""While the FIA Formula 1 World Championship's key stakeholders feel the core objectives outlined for the future set of regulations have been defined, in the interests of the sport it was agreed that the best outcome will be achieved by using the extra time for further refinement and additional consultation.""The need for the delay arose from the fact that the technical and sporting regulations were a long way from being finalised.F1 and the FIA first suggested a delay until October in March, and again in April.But it has taken until a meeting of all parties on Thursday to reach an agreement.This followed objections from Renault, McLaren, Alfa Romeo, Racing Point and Williams, who were concerned that if the financial regulations were not agreed the big teams would attempt to water them down further.The original plan for a budget cap was a figure of $150m, but more than a year's worth of talks have led to it being revised upwards by $25m.The five smaller teams agreed on the revised figure on the condition that the cap would come in immediately and a three-year glide path down to the final figure was removed.Along with the 10 teams, FIA and F1, drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Hulkenberg and the Grand Prix Drivers' Association chairman Alexander Wurz were at the meeting, along with tyre supplier Pirelli."
sport	Austrian Grand Prix: Formula 1 teams to blame for dull races - Alejandro Agag	Analysis	"Formula 1 teams should have no say in the governance of the sport, says Formula E founder Alejandro Agag.Mercedes have won all eight F1 races in 2019, with six wins for Lewis Hamilton and two for Valtteri Bottas.After a start-to-finish win in France, Hamilton put the blame on the sport's bosses and former F1 leader Bernie Ecclestone for the unexciting races.Agag said: ""What happened in Formula 1 is the fault of the teams. It isn't the responsibility of the FIA or promoter.""The Spaniard, who is also the chief executive of the all-electric Formula E series, added: ""The only way for Formula 1 in the future to have a healthy championship is to get the teams out of the governance completely.""The teams have their own interest, which is completely legitimate, but they shouldn't be allowed to introduce that interest into the equation.""The teams should let [motorsport's governing body] the FIA make the decisions, together with the promoter.""If I were Chase [Carey, F1 chairman], I would be looking at this saying, 'Oh my god, how do I fix this? I own the circus but I cannot change the order of the show.""After Sunday's win, five-time world champion Hamilton, who has won the past four F1 races, said: ""Don't point fingers at the drivers, we don't write the rules.""We have nothing to do with money shifting, all that kind of stuff. You should put the pressure on the people at the head, who should be doing the job.""This is a constant cycle of Formula 1 for years and years, even before I got to F1, and it's because the way Bernie had it set up and the decisions they were making back then and it's the same now.""Until that management structure changes, it will continue to be the same.""Hamilton leads the F1 championship by 36 points over Bottas with Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel a further 40 points behind before this weekend's race in Austria.Andrew Benson, BBC chief F1 writerAlejandro Agag is admired for the relative success he has made of Formula E in a relatively short time, but his analysis of the political situation in Formula 1 leaves something to be desired.It is simply untrue to say: ""What happened in Formula 1 is the fault of the teams. It is not the responsibility of the FIA or the promoter.""The single biggest issue in F1 at the moment is that it is a two-tier championship in which only three teams can have a hope of winning, and one of those three - Mercedes - is doing a better job than the other two, Ferrari and Red Bull.The two-tier championship has arisen out of an inequitable split in the prize fund, which disproportionately rewards the top teams. This, as it happens, was created by the man who used to be Agag's opposite number in F1, Bernie Ecclestone.Back in 2011, Ecclestone encouraged Ferrari and Red Bull to split from a teams' union that was causing him problems by offering them much more prize money. Mercedes did a separate deal which entitled them to similar money if they achieved long-term success. Which they now have.Ecclestone's problem was that the system he set up with the intention of giving himself more power actually played into the teams' hands, increasing the influence of, particularly, Mercedes and Ferrari. On this, Agag has a point.One can also point the finger at the expensive and complex hybrid engines for exacerbating the situation. But Ferrari's is now at least as good as Mercedes' so it's hard to see that as the main issue.Agag is right that something needs to change. And that is being addressed at the moment. A budget cap has been agreed for 2021, and teams and the authorities are discussing rule changes that will hopefully improve the racing.It is true to say that the teams are involved in this, and not everyone necessarily thinks that's a good idea - Lewis Hamilton said only last weekend he felt the teams should not be involved, for example.But the fact is that it has always been that way in F1, and the sport is so complex that it would be unwise to exclude them completely."
sport	Canadian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims to increase diversity in Formula 1	Making up with his fatherExpecting a challenge from Ferrari	"World champion Lewis Hamilton says he would like part of his legacy to be increasing diversity in Formula 1.Hamilton grew up on a council estate and is F1's first black driver and says he ""wants to pave the way for drivers from a similar background to myself"".He said he hoped to get involved in reducing costs in junior motorsport and in increasing the sport's social and racial mix.""I want to have people say I was a part of shifting that,"" Hamilton said.""That means getting involved in go-karting. It is so expensive in go-karts now.""My dad told me he spent £20,000 in the first year I raced but today to do a professional season of go-karts is $200,000-300,000. I want to be a part of shifting that.""Also to shift the diversity because there is the most minimal diversity and I want to be a part of changing that working with F1 and [governing body] the FIA.""I don't know why there aren't more mechanics or engineers, or even [people] in the media, coming through with more diversity.""Hamilton, speaking in a news conference before this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix, also talked about his improving relationship with his father, Anthony.Hamilton's father was his manager from the start of his career until their professional relationship ended over a dispute in the early years of this decade. They had a difficult time for a while but have grown close again in recent years.Hamilton said: ""The relationship's fantastic now. It wasn't always great but that happens in families.""I had my first Christmas with my whole family this year. There has been massive growth in the family and between me and my dad.""We were out partying until the early hours for his birthday in London the other day. Sometimes it just takes time to grow and come back in relationships.""As you get older, you realise how precious time is. I have friends who don't have their dads any more or who didn't speak to them in 20-30 years and I don't want that to happen.""My dad is the greatest man I know and someone I aspire to be like and I want him to be around a long time and that is why I am pushing him to go in the gym.""Hamilton, who is leading the championship by 17 points heading into the weekend, said he believed Ferrari would pose a tougher challenge in Montreal this weekend.Mercedes have won all six races so far this year, with Hamilton taking four victories and team-mate Valtteri Bottas two.But the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve's long straights could boost Ferrari, who have the most powerful engine and a car with less downforce and drag than the Mercedes.""I expect Ferrari will be really strong this weekend with the long straight so I am excited about that fight,"" Hamilton said.""I wouldn't say I was more nervous. Honda have picked up their pace. They are strong on the straights this year. So the Red Bull should be strong and the Ferrari is the quickest car in a straight line all year long in the past races.""We have managed to catch them up in the corners but whether that will be the case this weekend time will tell. I hope it's really close between us all.""Vettel, who is 45 points behind Hamilton in the championship, said: ""I can't make any predictions, but on paper it looks a bit more promising, so more towards Bahrain (where Ferrari set the pace).""On the other hand the asphalt is very smooth, it will be difficult to get the tyres up to working temperature. We've been struggling with that the last couple of races.""I'm not sitting here and painting things black - we haven't done a single lap this weekend, so I'm quite optimistic, and it was a strong course for us last year. If we struggle, we have some tricks up our sleeve - whether they work or not, we will see.""Hamilton, though, will be boosted by an upgraded engine Mercedes are introducing on all the cars using their engine this weekend.""The guys have been working really hard and it has not been the easiest or smoothest ride in terms of improving the engine,"" Hamilton said.""We have had great reliability and it is always great when you have a new engine when it is fresh. This is a power circuit so it is the perfect time.""It will have a slight improvement everywhere. It is not like the beginning of the hybrid era when we took massive steps but it is just small steps. The biggest step is that it is brand new. It is now small percentages but they are very much appreciated.""Hamilton, who has won the Canadian Grand Prix six out of the last 11 times it has been held, said he was looking forward to the weekend on what is one of his three favourite tracks.""I love coming out to Montreal,"" he said. ""The weather is often great, the circuit is fantastic and it is a track everyone agrees is one of the top three favourite circuits of the year.""And the city is a big part of that - vibrant, great food, great turnout of fans. And the track is awesome, go-kart-esque, with long straights so you can overtake and you are throwing it over these massive kerbs and not massive run-off areas.""He said his other two favourite tracks were Silverstone, home of the British Grand Prix, and Austin's Circuit of the Americas, which holds the US Grand Prix."

The Spanish Grand Prix was held over that weekend this season.F1 bosses are hoping to benefit from the surge in interest in Red Bull's Dutch driver Max Verstappen.""A Dutch Grand Prix, with Max's popularity, will be immense,"" said Red Bull team boss Christian Horner.As Verstappen has become one of F1's biggest stars, European races have been attended by huge numbers of Dutch fans, the vast majority wearing orange shirts in the national colours.

sport	Lewis Hamilton wins sixth F1 World Championship at United States Grand Prix	A determined drive to seal the dreamDriver of the dayWhat they saidWhat happens next?	"Lewis Hamilton sealed his sixth world drivers' title with second place in the United States Grand Prix.He becomes the second most successful Formula 1 driver of all time, one championship behind Michael Schumacher.Hamilton failed in a valiant attempt to win the race by trying a different strategy to Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, but that did not matter such was his points advantage.The Briton held off Max Verstappen for second as Bottas won in Austin.Hamilton had said before the race that he was not thinking of sealing the championship in Texas, only of winning the race, and he drove with the fierce competitive instinct that has defined his season and career.His decision to run long, do a single pit stop and try to hold off his rivals at the end did not quite work out - Bottas passed him with three laps to go - but it was a drive befitting the towering achievement he was to secure at the end of the race.Hamilton's sixth title has also moved him clear of the legendary Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio.""It's just overwhelming,"" he said. ""It was such a tough race. Yesterday was a tough day. I really just wanted recover and deliver the one-two. I didn't think the one-stop was going to be possible. I am filled with so much emotion. It is an honour to be up there with those greats.""My dad told me when I was six or seven years old to never give up. I was hopeful I might be able to win but I didn't have it in the tyres.""Asked what he could go on to achieve in his career, Hamilton said: ""I don't know about championships but as an athlete I feel fresh as can be. We won't let up, we'll keep pushing.""Hamilton has secured the championship with 10 victories out of the 19 races held so far this season, with two remaining in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.Starting fifth on the grid after a poor qualifying session, Hamilton passed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc for fourth at the first corner, and then made a brilliant overtaking move on the other Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel around the outside of Turn Eight, to run third behind Bottas and Verstappen at the end of the first lap.Victory seemed at least a possibility for Hamilton, even given Mercedes' usual approach of favouring the lead driver to ensure a race victory.And Hamilton decided to give it a go by staying out when Red Bull pitted Verstappen on lap 13, and Mercedes followed suit with Bottas a lap later to retain the lead, their stops locking both into a two-stop strategy.Hamilton's task was now to run as long as possible on his tyres before his single stop and hope to have enough life left in his tyres when he rejoined to be able to defend.Hamilton stopped finally on lap 24, giving him 32 laps to make it to the end on a set of hard tyres on a day when the rubber was wearing at a much higher rate than expected.Bottas made his second stop on lap 25, one after Verstappen, and rejoined six seconds behind Hamilton, a gap he had 20 laps to recover.It looked as if it would be easy, but Hamilton drove with control and skill to limit his losses, and it was not until the last five laps that Bottas was with his team-mate.One passing attempt at Turn 12 failed on lap 51, when Hamilton ran Bottas wide on his outside.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBut a lap later, after Hamilton had been delayed by lapping Pierre Gasly's Toro Rosso, Bottas used the DRS overtaking aid to ease past on the long back straight.Hamilton's hopes of victory were gone, but the title was still secure, and he had four laps left to defend against Verstappen, which he managed to do with help from a yellow flag that forced Verstappen to slow down, as the Red Bull finished on his tail.Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took a lonely fourth, the Italian car a long way off the pace, while Vettel retired from seventh place, after a sticky opening to the race, with a suspension failure after just eight laps.Red Bull's Alex Albon recovered from a first-lap pit stop following a clash with McLaren's Carlos Sainz at the first corner to take fifth, ahead of Renault's Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren's Lando Norris and Sainz.Bottas, who went into the race with the faintest hopes of keeping the championship alive for another race, said: ""Obviously big congrats to him. I personally failed with my target this year but he deserved it this year. He had some season.""Verstappen added: ""Very impressive. what else to say? He is doing phenomenally. He has a great team behind him. I just hope we can challenge them next year.""Brazil in two weeks' time. A historic race track in a fervent atmosphere and an edgy city. Nothing at stake, just a battle for honour."

sport	Ferrari hold 'clear the air' talks after drivers crash in Brazil		"Ferrari say they have ""cleared the air"" following the crash between Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc in the Brazilian Grand Prix.The drivers have had conversations with team boss Mattia Binotto about the incident and other matters.A spokesperson said: ""Since last Sunday, Mattia and the drivers have spoken every day, as they would normally do anyway.""""There was no official summit nor video conference,"" they added.""The air is now fully cleared and we are focusing on Abu Dhabi.""The 2019 Formula 1 season finishes at Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina track on 1 December.Ferrari would not elaborate on what had been discussed or the details of any agreement about how the two should race together in the future - or even whether they would be allowed to.Earlier this week, Ferrari chairman John Elkann said he was ""very angry"" about the incident.Elkann was speaking at an event to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Exor, a holding company with investments in a number of companies, including Fiat and Ferrari.He said: ""What happened made us understand how important Ferrari is.""The drivers, however good they are, mustn't forget they are Ferrari drivers. Team work counts. The only thing that counts is that Ferrari wins.""It has been an extraordinary season for the poles, but they have not been converted into victories.""That is a reference to the fact that Ferrari have taken nine pole positions in 20 races so far this year - seven for Leclerc and one for Vettel - while they have won only three grands prix.Ferrari's season has been characterised by an ongoing tussle for supremacy between the drivers.German driver Vettel, a four-time world champion, started the season with primacy in the team following the recruitment of Leclerc, who is in only his second season in F1.But the Monegasque has had a more convincing season and, with one race remaining, is ahead of Vettel in terms of championship points, wins, pole positions and on their qualifying head-to-head and looks set to stay that way.As their battle has intensified, both drivers have ignored team orders at various points in the season.That leaves Binotto with a difficult decision as to how to handle them next year.After the race in Brazil, Binotto described the crash, which happened as Vettel changed his line while trying to pass Leclerc and made contact with his team-mate, as ""silly"" but declined to apportion blame.He said that the team would ""analyse all the video and data"" with the drivers once the initial heat of the incident had died down.""They were free to fight,"" he said. ""They knew that. (We) let them race because we had secured second in the constructors' championship and they were somehow battling for their own position in the drivers' championship.""'Free to fight' doesn't mean to do silly actions, especially between the two team-mates and this for me was simply a silly action.""Binotto said the key issue was not to apportion blame but to ensure the drivers ""recognised what has been the actions and mistakes"".Meanwhile, Ferrari have shrugged off the importance of governing body the FIA inspecting their engine after the Brazil race.The FIA has issued two rule clarifications governing engines in recent weeks, in the context of suspicions from Ferrari's rivals as to the size of their performance advantage on the straights.Ferrari said the FIA ""had done a routine check, as they do many other times. Just usual procedure"".The FIA said that after Brazil they had looked at several cars' fuel-system components as part of systematic checking across the board throughout the season and not linked specifically to anything beyond that."

sport	Formula 1: The secret aerodynamicist reveals design concepts	What are aerodynamics for?Why do the cars look different this year?How are teams solving this problem?Why might Ferrari's philosophy work well?The benefits of Ferrari's designWhere might Ferrari go wrong?	"Formula 1 cars are fast. That is taken as read. But exactly how fast they are is perhaps not something people dwell on too often.To put it into perspective, Lewis Hamilton's pole position time for last year's British Grand Prix at Silverstone - one minute 25.892 seconds - was 34 seconds faster than the lap record for a grand prix motorcycle. A really quick road car, such as a Ferrari or McLaren supercar, would lap at around that pace, too.How does the F1 car do this? Part of it is an engine that produces close to 1,000bhp. But the difference in lap time is mainly made up of the F1 car's cornering abilities. And the main reason for them is aerodynamics.The manipulation of air around a car is the single biggest performance differentiator in F1 - and collectively the teams employ hundreds of people and spend many millions of pounds on refining it to find that crucial extra bit of speed.I am one of the people who does that. I am a senior aerodynamicist for an F1 team and I hope to try to explain to you some of the secrets behind F1 cars.I can't tell you my name, or where I work, because my team would not want me to be doing this. F1 is a secretive world. So let's just call me The Secret Aerodynamicist.In this first column, I am going to explain how the two cars expected to battle for this year's world championship differ in a crucial aspect of aerodynamic philosophy - and how it could mean that, although Ferrari have looked very strong in pre-season testing, they might find themselves down a dead end when it comes to developing and improving their car through the season.Let us start by taking a step back and look at why aerodynamics are so important in F1.The primary aim of aerodynamics is to generate downforce to push the wheels harder into the road, so the tyres give more grip. More grip means faster cornering speeds, harder acceleration and braking - and quicker lap times.To put this into perspective, at 100mph, a modern F1 car will produce roughly 750kg of downforce. Since this is more than the minimum weight limit of the car, this year 743kg, it means it could in theory drive upside down on the ceiling.However, it is not just about piling on as much downforce as possible. An F1 car has to work in a number of different conditions, and it is never a perfect scenario.An F1 car leans to the side when it corners, dips down at the front when it brakes and at the rear when it accelerates - and is often doing two of the three at the same time. And that's just the start of what is going on when it is on the limit on track.The aerodynamics have to provide a consistent and predictable amount of downforce at all times and in all these conditions, without sudden changes one way or another. This takes a great deal of analysis and number crunching using complex computer programmes and simulation in wind tunnels.For the car to perform at its optimum, it is important to have a good balance between how much the car pushes down on the front wheels, and how much it pushes down at the rear.If the aerodynamics don't push down enough on the front, the car won't turn into the corner. This is known as understeer. If you neglect the back of the car, then the rear wheels will slide and the driver will soon find himself pointing in the wrong direction. This is oversteer.You often hear complaints that F1 cars all look the same. This is because, to keep performance under control, the regulations are very prescriptive and there are only certain areas in which designers can innovate.But to the trained eye, there are key - and often fundamental - differences between the cars. These explain why one car is faster than another.For this year, the FIA, the governing body, has changed the rules on front wings. The idea behind the move was to enable cars to follow each other more closely in order to increase overtaking.The way they have done this is to reduce the freedom to design parts that manipulate the airflow. This would have cost downforce at the front of the car, so they also made the front wings 20cm wider to make up for that.The changes mean teams have lost a lot of our ability to control one of the biggest problems for an F1 designer - the air coming off the front tyres.This churning, turbulent air is a bit like the wake you might see behind a boat, and it's a problem for aerodynamicists because it's difficult to generate downforce from. The messier the airflow, the harder it is for us to make it do what we want.To solve this problem, last year we would use the airflow off the front wing to kick the tyre wake as far out and away from the car as possible. Now, because of the restrictions on devices to control the airflow that we can put on the front wing, all that's changed and, frankly, we're not yet sure what is the best thing to do.Looking at the cars this season, you can see that the approaches to this problem largely fall into two camps. We call these 'outboard-loaded' and 'inboard loaded'.Those names refer to the point on the front wing on which the most downforce is exerted, and consequently where the airflow is being directed.'Outboard' means at the outside edge; 'inboard' towards the middle. What makes things particularly interesting is that Mercedes and Ferrari have opposite styles.Mercedes have gone for 'outboard'. Their car has the highest and steepest bits of the wing at the outside tips, where the flaps meet what is called the end-plate, the vertical structure at the outside of the wing.This generates suction, or low pressure, outboard. Air from the middle of the car will travel towards this area of low pressure. We call this style 'out-washing' - ie, it sends air outwards, away from the car, in an attempt to control the tyre wake.The Ferrari approach is more loaded in the middle of the wing and quite unloaded at the tips - on the wing, you can see that the highest point of the flaps is at their inside edge, and they slope downwards towards the outside of the car.This draws air towards the centre and results in an 'in-washing' air flow.One advantage of reducing the download at the tips of the wing - what we call 'backing-out' the tips - is that airflow structures generated there will be much less stressed.I'll have to explain what that means before I go on to say why it could be a benefit. Bear with me - we're heading into the complexities of aerodynamic theory for a moment.Air near the surface of a wing, what we call the ""boundary layer"", likes to travel towards low pressure, which speeds it up, but does not like having to go back into high pressure, which will slow it down.The air will only put up with a certain amount of speeding up and slowing down before eventually it gets too stressed and won't hang on to the surface any more. Once this happens you have what we call ""stall"". Instead of a nice, clean, downforce-generating wing, you just end up with a load of wake, or ""dirty air"" - and much less downforce.Actually, the wings themselves don't give us much of a problem - all the slots between the flaps help us out there.It's the end-plate which is tricky. Because the rules mean we're pretty much stuck with a big flat plate, with very little curvature to help the air, all you can do is reduce the amount of speeding up and slowing down the air at the surface has to do - by 'backing-out' the tips.There are two potential advantages to Ferrari's approach.The first is that the reduced tendency to stall might produce a car that is more predictable to drive. And the more predictable a car is, the greater the driver's confidence.For this reason, quite often, a more predictable car with more consistent downforce but slightly less maximum load will end up being quicker than a car that in theory has more downforce but that which cannot generate the maximum load consistently.That's because the inherent nervousness of the 'peaky' approach means the driver does not have the confidence to push to the limit, as he fears he might lose control.In addition, the vortices - little tornadoes of spinning air - which are generated at the end-plate and which are so crucial to a car's overall performance can be drawn inside the tyre to help control the wake.Looking at the performance of cars from testing - always a fool's errand but bear with me - you might conclude that the Ferrari-style front wing is doing the better job. The Ferrari appears the quickest car at the moment.However, because of the need to back out the ends of the wing so much, it is always going to struggle to match the Mercedes style for absolute load.Remember how we need to have a good balance of front and rear downforce? Well, as the teams develop through the season, putting on more and more downforce at the back of the car, Ferrari might struggle to balance it out at the front. If so, that would give them a car hamstrung with understeer which just won't turn into the corners.On the Ferrari, there are already clues that they might be trying to compensate elsewhere for a lack of downforce generated from the front wing.The area beside the driver, at the front of the sidepods, around what we call in F1 the 'barge boards', can produce a lot of downforce. The barge boards are the curved pieces that jut out from the main body of the car, and which direct the airflow in ways the designers want it to go.The key with this, though, is that you want to keep as much energy in the air as possible, so as it travels down the car you can use that energy in the diffuser, at the back of the car.Air from the bargeboard area flows under the floor beneath the driver before feeding straight into the diffuser. The faster you can get the air to flow through the diffuser, the lower the pressure under the car and the more downforce it creates, sucking the car on to the track. But lots of manipulation in this area carries the risk of losing energy from the air.Mercedes have reduced the size of their bargeboards this year. This might mean they are generating less downforce at the front of their floor, but it gives them lots of potential to create plenty of downforce at the rear with the diffuser.By contrast, Ferrari's bargeboards have got bigger this year.This could be because they need to make up the front downforce which their front wing can't create. But it could well limit the ability of their diffuser to do its thing.In this way, Ferrari's philosophy could not only give them problems balancing the car front to rear as the season progresses, but also limit the amount of total downforce it can create.Ferrari might not be facing any problems now, and they certainly look to have started the year with a quick car.But as the season goes on, I wouldn't be surprised to see Mercedes out-develop them, while the Scuderia find themselves stuck down a blind alley."

sport	Lewis Hamilton wins Mexican GP but must wait for F1 title	Ferrari lose out yet againEven champions need reassuringHow did Ferrari get it wrong?Driver of the dayWhat happens next?What they said	"Lewis Hamilton won the Mexican Grand Prix with a superbly controlled drive in a tactical fight with Ferrari to move to the brink of the world title.Hamilton will clinch his sixth championship at the US Grand Prix next Sunday as long as he does not lose more than 22 points to Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas.Hamilton triumphed in a tense, slow-burn race of divergent strategies between the four Mercedes and Ferrari drivers.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was second, ahead of Bottas and Charles Leclerc.The four men closed up in the final laps as their different tactics came together.While Mercedes could congratulate themselves on gambling on a one-stop strategy with a long second stint to gain track position on Vettel and then hold off the German to the end, there will be questions over Ferrari's decisions.The Italian team twice gave up the lead, first with pole position winner Charles Leclerc, who was pitted out of first position after 15 laps to stick to a two-stop strategy decided before the race.And Vettel took his strategy into his own hands to decide to do the same when Hamilton made his stop.Ferrari had the chance to pit on the next lap and retain the lead, but Vettel suggested they ""leave him to it"", a decision that meant they would stop later and try to come back at Hamilton at the end of the race on fresher tyres.Vettel had tyres that were 14 laps fresher than Hamilton's for the climax to the race, but the reigning champion was more than capable of holding the Ferrari back.But the win was not without anxiety for Hamilton, who shortly after his pit stop questioned whether they had given him too long to make the tyres last, and who was also battling a car damaged by the contact with Verstappen.He complained so much that Mercedes chief strategist James Vowles came on the radio, a rare event used only at critical moments, to reassure Hamilton: ""You can do this.""In the closing laps, as Vettel was urged on by Ferrari, Hamilton was able to hold his advantage at just over two seconds and take his 10th win in 18 races this season.He leaves Mexico City, where he tied up the championship in both the last two seasons, with a 74-point lead over Bottas, the only man who can mathematically beat him.He needs to leave Austin, Texas, next weekend with a lead of 52 points to become only the second man in history to win more than five F1 world titles.The only way that can't happen is if Bottas wins and Hamilton finishes lower than eighth, a highly unlikely scenario in normal circumstances, especially at a circuit where Hamilton has excelled since its debut on the calendar in 2012.The divergent strategies meant that for the third race in a row Ferrari had turned first and second on the grid into a poorer race result.A chaotic first lap took Red Bull's Max Verstappen out of the picture, the Dutchman dropping to ninth place as he tangled with Hamilton, who had an oversteer moment as they disputed third behind the Ferraris at Turn Two.On the run down to the first corner, Hamilton, who started third, had been challenging Vettel for second behind Leclerc, but was edged on to the grass by the Ferrari.Ferrari had the one-two positions they would have wanted at the end of the first lap but somehow they still conspired to lose the race.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe first error was pitting Leclerc out of the lead on lap 15 when they did not need to.That ruined Leclerc's race and consigned him to a fourth place finish as the two Mercedes drivers and Vettel ran long and committed to one-stop strategies.With Vettel, Hamilton and Bottas running one-two-three, the key then was whose one-stop would triumph and Vowles' decision to pit Hamilton early in a successful attempt to get ahead of Vettel into the lead was critical.When Hamilton stopped on lap 23, leaving him 48 laps to go to the flag, Vettel decided to surrender the lead and stay out, with Bottas doing the same behind him to cover their bases.Despite Hamilton's concerns, he was able to eke out his tyre life and take an excellent win.Behind Leclerc, Red Bull's Alexander Albon took fifth. He had run third in the opening laps behind the Ferraris but was the first to stop and lock himself in a two-stop strategy.Verstappen recovered to finish sixth ahead of Racing Point's Sergio Perez and Renault's Daniel Ricciardo on a terrible day for McLaren.Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris had started seventh and eighth, but Norris retired after a bungled pit stop in which he was sent away without his left front wheel attached, while Sainz faded to 13th, lacking pace.The US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. One of Hamilton's favourite races, on a great track near a great city. Hamilton will surely clinch the title there - and he will be determined to do it in style, on a track where he has won five times in the last seven years.Hamilton: ""We came here thinking we were on the back foot but we pulled through, I had quite a bit of damage on the car so the race was quite a struggle but I kept my head down. It felt like a long second stint but I am so grateful today.""I don't mind (not clinching the title yet). I love racing and just take it one race at a time. This is a race I have wanted to win for some time and it has always been a bit tricky for us. everything held together and the team did the best strategy, holding off the Ferraris was not easy in the end.""Vettel: ""Surprisingly, the hard tyres worked really well. It was an intense race because there was no break.""It was a good race but here and there with strategy we could have been a bit stronger.""Bottas: ""I enjoyed, considering yesterday. The start was quite tricky - I dropped a place. But I don't think we could have done much more today."""

""It's been a difficult season, lots of ups and downs but these kind of wins make it all worth it.""Rowland had qualified in first but dropped down to fourth because of a three-place grid penalty picked up from the Paris E-Prix, meaning Vergne started the race in pole and he held off Rowland.""I got pole, then had a penalty but came back to come second and I'm very pleased,"" said Rowland.""It's the first really good race and I've struggled in a lot of races.""There was disappointment for another British driver, Sam Bird, who battled up from 13th and was sixth on the final lap, but a late collision dropped him down to 17th.The next race takes place in Berlin, Germany, on 25 May, before a race in Bern, Switzerland, and then the season-ending double-header in New York.There are full replays of the Monaco E-Prix race on the BBC Red Button from 19:00 to 21:00 and from 21:35 to 23:35 on Saturday and then from 21:00 to 23:00 on Sunday, 12 May."

sport	United States Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton says he can still get better	Hamilton comments 'a bit disrespectful' - Verstappen	"Lewis Hamilton says he can still get better as he embarks on the weekend when he should clinch a sixth Formula 1 drivers' championship.Hamilton is almost certain to seal the title at Sunday's US Grand Prix, needing only to ensure he does not lose 22 points to Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas.""I never thought I would have five titles. If I am able to get a sixth one, it will be pretty unreal,"" Hamilton said.""I don't think I've hit peak yet and I plan to continue to get stronger.""Hamilton emphasised that ""nothing is a given"" and that he is ""approaching it exactly as I have all year, one race at a time"".The only way Bottas can keep the championship alive is to win the race - and even then Hamilton only has to finish eighth to secure the title.The 34-year-old Briton has won the race at the Circuit of the Americas near Austin, Texas five times in the seven years it has been on the calendar.""Austin has been a good race for us in the past,"" Hamilton said. ""It was not so good last year, but it is a good hunting ground in general and I am going to be pushing very hard this weekend to finish where I plan to finish.""But it's going to be a challenge again with the temperatures and the wind. I can't tell you how it would feel but I approach every year as if it's the first and it'll be the same next year.""Austin is experiencing unusually cool temperatures. Thursday was said to be the coldest Halloween for nearly 30 years. Overnight lows are close to freezing. That is expected to create difficulties for the drivers to get the Pirelli tyres up to the right operating temperature.Hamilton said he believed 2019 had been one of his strongest seasons, and pointed to his race performances as a highlight.""I've only had four poles but I've had 10 wins,"" Hamilton said. ""Within the team, we often forget how many wins we've had because we are so focused on each race and we forget how well the season has gone because it has felt so hard.""But definitely when you look at the numbers, it is a good feeling. Hard work pays off and the guys have collectively worked harder than ever.""Every year we try to get better, we try to apply ourselves better and balance our energy levels better, communicate better, so we deliver consistent results collectively. It's great to look at the results because it reflects the improvement we've made.""I would say Sunday [race day] has been the thing I have been most proud of, it's been stronger than last year and that's good to see.""The goal has been to try to keep the consistency from last year and build on other areas and the race was one of those and we have been stronger all year throughout the races. There are areas we can still improve on.""Hamilton gave the strongest hint that he will be still be in F1 in 2021, when the new regulations announced by the sport on Thursday come into force, and that he will likely stay with Mercedes.""Nothing is set in stone for the future but I am definitely enjoying what I am doing and I don't see any reason to stop because I love what I do,"" he said.""I don't see myself going anywhere else. I love being here at Mercedes. I love being a part of the brand, of the history, and the idea of staying with Mercedes, I have been with them since I was 13.""The idea of continuing on with them even beyond F1, probably heavily involved within Daimler, is quite attractive.""Meanwhile, Red Bull driver Max Verstappen criticised Hamilton and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel for their remarks after last weekend's race in Mexico.Hamilton, who collided with Verstappen at the first corner, said he had expected he would be ""torpedoed by Max"" at some point and he always gave him extra room compared to other drivers.Verstappen responded on Thursday in Austin, by saying: ""Looking at Turns One and Two in Mexico, I don't think that happened. It was a bit of a silly comment to make. I think I'm always a hard racer but fair.""It's just not correct - but of course it's easy to have a dig at someone. From my side, it's fine. It's always positive when the talk is about you. That means you're in their head.""He added that it was ""a bit disrespectful and I prefer to fight on track and of course I like to fight hard but on the edge. If they want me to stay behind, it's better to stay at home. I really want to take the fight to them because that's what we are here for. We fight for victories because that's what we live for.""Hamilton said in response: ""I was explaining the scenario. I don't think it was disrespectful in any way. There wasn't any fall-out. It was a great race and a great weekend."""
sport	Formula 1's Netflix series Drive to Survive: What we learned	It's like a Premier League documentary without the top sixIt shows Gunther Steiner's 'David Brent' management style is box officeIt makes big crashes even more dramaticIt shows the sport's human side	"Formula 1: Drive to Survive is a 10-episode Netflix series, a behind-the-scenes documentary that at its launch earlier this year promised to give ""exclusive and intimate access to the greatest racing championship in the world"".Designed for both die-hard fans and newcomers to the sport, it's a fly-on-the-wall experience spotlighting the drama and politics in F1.But just how far behind the scenes did it actually go?A problem with the series from the outset is that the sport's two top teams, Ferrari and Mercedes, declined to be involved.That's clearly disappointing, since the rivalry between them is one of the biggest focus points in the sport.Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said the team's involvement in the documentary would have been a distraction, ""especially also if our main competitor was not doing it"".Could Ferrari and Mercedes not just have sat down and agreed to get involved and each be equally distracted?Luckily, there's enough sub-plots brought to life to keep it interesting in the absence of Ferrari and Mercedes.Throughout the series, Gunther Steiner is highlighted for his harsh yet amusing method of managing the Haas team. It's a peculiar management style - think David Brent in The Office.In episode seven, Haas driver Romain Grosjean is having a rough time. Steiner has had enough and takes his frustrations out at a Haas team dinner.Standing to address the team, Steiner says: ""Maybe Romain didn't want to come because he had no points. Or maybe I didn't invite him because he doesn't deserve any food.""Their relationship worsens through the season to the point where, after another crash, Grosjean sits against the wall and sobs. Seconds later we see Steiner simmering on the pit wall.""All this bad luck is draining me,"" says Grosjean. ""In Formula 1 you do feel lonely sometimes. There are not many people who can understand what you're going through, you can be a hero to zero in five seconds.""But Steiner is not interested: ""Just stop whinging. Good guys never win…""The series dramatises the biggest crashes, such as Nico Hulkenberg's flip after catching the wheel of Grosjean (who else?) in Abu Dhabi.After being sent airborne into the barriers, the German is left upside down ""hanging like a cow"". Seconds later his Renault catches fire.The shock of the moment is cleverly drawn out - even if viewers already know the outcome - with super slow-mo effects, long pauses, and scene cuts between team members, spectators, friends and family as they await his response on the radio.It's a moment that underlines the ever-present jeopardy to the sport, highlighting the repercussions that just one small one mistake has on the driver and the team.Everyone has a story, and there are hundreds of them in Formula 1.Daniel Ricciardo's is covered in episode one, beginning in Perth, Australia where the Red Bull man, alongside his parents, talks about where it all started for him, before he took off to Europe to chase his dream.""How could we not let him go?"" says his mother Grace, who goes to the majority of the grands prix and always prays for a safe race.You really feel for the sacrifices people make to get to F1. And in Ricciardo's case they have been rewarded - no more so than when we witness his victory at the Monaco Grand Prix, where he gracefully falls into the team's swimming pool in celebration.As it transpires, 2018 is seismic year for Ricciardo, who during the course of the campaign takes the decision to jump ship from Red Bull to join Renault.It's a move he takes months to ponder, and the documentary is there every step of the way."
sport	Lewis Hamilton fastest in Formula 1's Australian GP practice		Lewis Hamilton started the new Formula 1 season with fastest time in the first practice session at the Australian Grand Prix.The world champion had emphasised on Thursday that he felt Mercedes were behind Ferrari heading into the season.But in a closely matched session, Hamilton edged Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel by 0.038 seconds. His team-mate Charles Leclerc was 0.036secs behind.Just 0.193secs covered the top four, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen next up.British-born Thai Alexander Albon, a rookie driving for Toro Rosso, brought the session to a brief halt with a crash at Turn Two.The incident knocked off the front wing but Albon was able to drive the car back to the pits.The other new drivers, Britain's Lando Norris and George Russell, began cautiously on the Albert Park street track, which is notorious for its dirt and bumps and where it is easy to lose the car and damage it.Norris ended the session 18th, four places and 0.6secs off team-mate Carlos Sainz. Russell was last and 0.8secs off his Williams team-mate Robert Kubica.Williams were, as expected, adrift of the back of the field - Kubica was two seconds off the next slowest car, which was Norris.Part of that margin was in tyres - Williams only ran the medium tyre while most others set their times on the quickest soft - but that still leaves the Williams more than a second off the back of the grid.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAt the front, Hamilton's performance undermined Mercedes' claims that they were behind Ferrari.The world champions led the way throughout the session, Bottas starting off with the quickest time when running the medium tyre, before Hamilton vaulted ahead by 0.267secs on the soft.Bottas ran wide at the penultimate corner and narrowly avoided clouting the wall while trying to improve his time.Sixth quickest was Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen, ahead of an impressive performance from the returning Daniil Kvyat in seventh place in the Toro Rosso on the medium tyre.The second Red Bull driver Pierre Gasly was eighth quickest, ahead of Renault's Nico Hulkenberg, who missed the first half of the session with a technical problem.His team-mate Daniel Ricciardo was baulked by Haas driver Romain Grosjean on his quickest lap so the Australian's 17th quickest time was not representative.
sport	Formula 1: Five talking points ahead of the new season	Hamilton v Vettel, Part IIIHow will Leclerc do at Ferrari?A new era for Red BullA new Brit packAre Williams that bad?	"The 2019 Formula 1 season starts in Melbourne this weekend and it promises to be one of the most interesting in years.The first car has not even turned a wheel in anger and yet there are so many intriguing plot lines right down the grid.Let's take a look at some of the big questions on the eve of the Australian Grand Prix.Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes have dominated Formula 1 for the past five years, Hamilton winning four of the last five world titles and his former team-mate Nico Rosberg the other.But those statistics belie the facts that in 2017 and 2018 Ferrari started the season with an absolutely competitive car and their lead driver Sebastian Vettel should have at least taken the title fight to the last race.In 2018, Vettel had something of a personal meltdown, making a string of errors which, exacerbated by management failures at Ferrari, saw his season implode and Hamilton win with two races still to go.It's all change at Ferrari this year. Their unpopular former team principal Maurizio Arrivabene has gone, and in his place is former technical director Mattia Binotto, renowned as a cool and calm personality who will provide a more stable environment for the team.And Ferrari have hit the ground running, their car clearly faster in pre-season than the Mercedes, who F1 sporting boss Ross Brawn described as ""a little bit out of sorts"".Hamilton himself put the gap between the two cars in performance at as much as half a second a lap, and said: ""This is going to be the toughest battle yet.""Can Vettel and Ferrari finally get one over on their great rivals?The big question over Vettel may be how he will cope with the pressure of a title fight, after wilting so badly in 2018, but there's another - and that is in the identity of his team-mate.Kimi Raikkonen - reliable, not-quite-quick-enough - has gone to sister team Alfa Romeo, and in his place has come 21-year-old Charles Leclerc, who is tipped as a star of the future.There is great anticipation within F1 as to how Leclerc will fare at Ferrari, with many expecting great things of him.Ferrari have said Vettel will have priority in certain circumstances at the beginning of the year, but if Leclerc proves a match for Vettel how long can they let that carry on, and how will they manage the situation?The battle inside Ferrari could be as exciting as that between them and Mercedes.Red Bull have finally parted company with engine partner Renault after five years of the turbo hybrid engine formula marked by bitterness and recriminations.In Renault's place has come Honda, who have not exactly set the world on fire since they returned to F1 in 2015. Unless you're talking about how many engines have failed.Nevertheless, there is optimism at Red Bull that they will be more competitive with a Honda engine than they were with a Renault - and their minimum goal for the season is to be closer to Mercedes and Ferrari than before.Red Bull did not set any eye-catching times in pre-season testing but their lead driver Max Verstappen, who won two races last year and should have had a third, said he feels ""optimistic"" about the season ahead.""If we look to the longer runs, it looks all pretty promising,"" the Dutchman said, ""so, yeah, I'm looking forward to start racing now. I think we have a pretty good package and also the engine seems to work really well. I'm really happy about that.""If Red Bull can get in the mix with Ferrari and Mercedes, the prospects of the fiery, aggressive, uncompromising and very quick Verstappen going toe-to-toe with Hamilton and Vettel are mouth-watering.Hamilton was Britain's sole representative on the grid last year but this season he is joined by two of his countrymen. Well, two and a half, really.Williams' George Russell and McLaren's Lando Norris arrive in F1 after stellar junior careers. But Toro Rosso's Alexander Albon, who races under the Thai flag but was born in London to a British father and Thai mother, has proved pretty handy himself.Russell has been part of the Mercedes junior programme for the last two years and has already driven seven F1 cars.As he puts it: ""Three Mercedes, two Force Indias, one Williams and one McLaren, that's quite a surreal little fact. Even now just saying that, it kind of hits me. You think, 'Blimey, that's quite a privilege.' Even though my career's only just started its already been an amazing achievement.""Norris, who finished second to Russell in Formula 2 last year, has excelled in everything he has driven - including alongside Fernando Alonso when they teamed up at the Daytona 24 Hours in 2018.Albon, who finished third in F2 in 2018, thought his chances of an F1 career were over, and had signed to drive for Nissan in Formula E, only for Red Bull to come calling when they realised they were short of a driver.All three have spent their junior careers racing against not only each other, but fellow F1 drivers Leclerc, Verstappen and Mercedes reserve Esteban Ocon.It really is the start of a new generation, with Russell and Norris proving so far to be potentially at the head of it.Even before Williams' new car had run, the omens were not looking good, with stories coming out of the factory that it was two seconds slower than the 2018 car - already the slowest on the grid.When it missed the first two and a half days of testing because it wasn't ready, things looked even worse, and when it finally did hit the track, they didn't look much better. It was slowest of all throughout winter testing.To sum the field up on the eve of the season, Ferrari look to be in front, Mercedes and Red Bull closely matched not far behind, the midfield appears not only to have closed the gap to the big three, but to have compressed within itself - and then there is Williams.Heading into Melbourne, the question about Williams appears to be not so much are they at the back, as how far off the back are they?This would be a real shame, not only for Russell, but also his team-mate Robert Kubica, whose return to F1 after eight years out following the life-changing injuries he suffered in a rally crash in 2011 is one of the stories of the season.But it's also terrible news for Williams, former multiple championship winners who appear to have completely lost their way.All times GMT and are subject to change at short notice."

'They've found a balance of youth and experience''A selling club, but in a better financial position'Can they win the Champions League this season?	"Are we witnessing the re-emergence of Ajax as a force in European football?The four-time European champions - who gave the world Johan Cruyff, Patrick Kluivert, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp - have gone from the 2017 ignominy of failing to qualify for a Uefa competition to earning a place in the Champions League semi-finals.Is this a fluke? Or should it come as no surprise?Former academy player Jordi Cruyff, Johan's son, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily Podcast that De Godenzonen (Sons of the Gods) now have all the right ingredients.Barcelona-bound Frenkie de Jong, 21, defender Matthijs de Ligt, 19, winger David Neres, 22, and Hakim Ziyech, 26 - plus the more experienced Dusan Tadic, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Daley Blind - have helped Ajax not only overachieve in Europe but also lead the Eredivisie.""Ajax at the moment have an amazing generation. The chemistry is there.""They have a few players at 19, 20, 21 years of age - which comes every 10 years or so. The club are now benefiting, on and off the pitch, from having these good young stars.""One of those has been sold to Barcelona [De Jong], but they have this golden hand.""They have also changed something this season. They have not won the Dutch league since the 2013-14 season - in contrast to what they achieved this week and having reached the 2017 Europa League final - and have made some adjustments.""The team has young talent, but in every part of the pitch they have players with experience after spending some money to bring in Tadic and Blind.""I think the experienced ones have guided the young and brought some balance.""Ajax are now playing excellent football and lead the Dutch league from PSV Eindhoven on goal difference.""""The reason Ajax haven't been in the Champions League semi-finals in recent years is because they cannot compete with the likes of the moneyed Premier League, La Liga and Bundesliga teams.""They are a selling club and the Netherlands is a selling country. It's not an end-station for players, it's a middle-station. It'll help you progress and it's somewhere that gives you a platform.""Ajax understand their position, but are now in a good financial situation which means if there are six high offers for players, they don't have to accept all six.""If the central defender goes, Ajax have a back-up as a result of the forward thinking of bringing players in a few years ago.""This year everything came together - the change of policy of bringing in older players helped them a lot and gave them the stability they need.""But you can't argue with fact that Ajax is a school of education. It has been like this for many, many years and will continue to be for many, many years.""""When you're in the last four and eliminate Real Madrid and Juventus en route - winning at their grounds - then that's not a coincidence any more. You have a right to dream.""Liverpool are having an excellent year and Barcelona, as long as Lionel Messi is fit, will be favourite in every game they play.""Now it's about the small details that can decide things. Ajax, for sure - the win in Italy will make them think they can beat anybody on their day."""
sport	Formula 1 committed to investigating Bahrain activist's case, say bosses		"F1 chiefs say they will ""continue to investigate"" alleged human rights abuses in Bahrain.Representatives met with campaigners on Wednesday to discuss Najah Yusuf, who was jailed two years ago.Protest groups including Human Rights Watch and the Bahrain Institute for Rights & Democracy claim Yusuf had been given a three-year sentence because she protested against the 2017 race.Bahrain authorities say Yusuf's jailing was not related to the grand prix.The sport has been accused by human rights groups of sending ""an appalling message"" over the matter.Liberal Democrat peer Lord Scriven met F1 officials on behalf of the campaign groups. He outlined claims of alleged sexual assault during Yusuf's interrogation as well as claims that a coerced confession was used to convict her.Following the meeting F1 bosses said the sport is ""committed to respecting internationally-recognised human rights in our operations globally and we take all such responsibilities seriously"".A statement continued: ""As part of that commitment, we obtain from every national promoter of a Formula 1 Grand Prix its commitment to respect internationally recognised human rights.""We continue to remind all promotors, including Bahrain, that peaceful protest at all our events is a democratic right.""Lord Scriven said he had been told F1's general counsel Sacha Woodward-Hill would look into the matter.""I am relieved that Sacha and Formula 1 have expressed genuine concern and have an open mind to investigate further the particular circumstances which have led to Najah's imprisonment and the violations of her human rights since her arrest,"" Lord Scriven added.The parties have agreed to hold another meeting once further investigations had been carried out.Staged for the first time in 2004, the Bahrain Grand Prix has been one of the most controversial races on the F1 calendar.It was cancelled in 2011 after pro-democracy protests were crushed. At least 35 people were killed; protesters claimed the death toll was far higher.In 2013 a group of British MPs called on then-F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone to cancel the race again amid further unrest in Bahrain.

sport	Fernando Alonso to compete at 2020 Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia		"Spaniard Fernando Alonso has confirmed he will compete in the famous Dakar Rally in January 2020.Alonso, 38, will be the first Formula 1 champion to race in the desert endurance event, which is to be held in Saudi Arabia for the first time.He has been preparing with a series of rallies in deserts in the past few months and described it as ""the hardest challenge ever in my career"".The two-time F1 champion will compete in a Toyota Hilux pick-up.Alonso left F1 at the end of 2018 to pursue new challenges elsewhere in motorsport.Primarily, he has set his sights on winning the Indianapolis 500 and becoming only the second man in history to win the so-called 'triple crown', which also includes the Le Mans 24 Hours and Monaco Grand Prix, although some regard the F1 aspect of it to be the World Championship.He won Le Mans in 2018 and 2019 with Toyota to add to his two F1 world titles in 2005 and 2006 and his Monaco victories in 2006 and 2007.Alonso said: ""After Formula 1, I started to discover some new things in motorsport and the most iconic races.""I started with the World Endurance Championship, we won Le Mans twice and the world championship and that feeling and that family I found inside Toyota opened my eyes for other opportunities.""One of those opportunities was this one: Dakar. It's the hardest race on the planet.""Alonso has not announced his plans for next year's Indy 500.His options are to race for McLaren's new Indycar team, set up after their embarrassing failure to qualify for the Indy 500 with Alonso this year, or to try to join another outfit.The Dakar Rally was set up in 1978 and for the majority of its life was known as the Paris-Dakar after its route from the French capital through the Sahara desert to the Senegalese capital.However, political unrest and warfare in Saharan Africa led to security concerns and it was relocated to South America from 2009.The first Saudi running of the event will start in Jeddah on 5 January and finish outside Qiddia on 17 January.Competitors have to navigate their own route through the deserts without notes, using only maps and GPS systems, and the dunes and other natural hazards create particular challenges even for experienced drivers."
sport	Formula 1 2019: Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on his dying father's wish	The battle with VettelGrace under pressure	"Just before Charles Leclerc's father died in June 2017, his son told him a little white lie.Leclerc was in the middle of his Formula 2 season, a member of the Ferrari driver academy, and being widely tipped for a graduation to Formula 1 the following year.He knew his father, Herve, was close to the end. So Charles told Herve that he had been guaranteed an F1 drive for 2018. Only he hadn't.""It was a bit earlier than I had really signed,"" Leclerc recalls, ""but in the end I didn't lie because I am here and now in Ferrari, which feels incredible.""He says his father's ambition for his son was ""to be in F1 and to be world champion. I haven't done that yet but I will work to realise his dream.""It might not be that far away.This season will be only Leclerc's second in F1, and already he has a seat at the biggest team of all. It's about as strong an endorsement of his potential as it is possible to get.It is very unusual for Ferrari to take a driver so early in his career. They normally prefer to employ experienced drivers, ideally with a proven winning ability. So to choose Leclerc - to replace the 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen - says an awful lot about both how impressive Leclerc was in his debut season with Sauber last year, and how good Ferrari expect this 21-year-old from Monaco to become.In fact, Leclerc has been taken on by Ferrari earlier in his career than any driver since Gilles Villeneuve at the end of 1977. The Canadian went on to carve himself a place as one of the great F1 legends in four short seasons before his death in a crash at the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix.Could Leclerc's talent be in the same bracket? He has done enough in his short career so far to show that it is not a ridiculous question.Parachuting Leclerc into Ferrari for 2019 provides a chance to begin to answer the question, for he is team-mate to four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel. The German is one of F1's elite, but Leclerc's potential is such that many expect him to give Vettel a run for his money.Their performances in pre-season testing only emphasised this point. Their fastest laps were just 0.01 seconds apart and, over race distances, their overall times were almost identical.Ferrari have acted early to try to dampen down discussion on the issue of an internal battle between their drivers. New team boss Mattia Binotto, the former technical director who has replaced Maurizio Arrivabene after the errors that blighted Ferrari's 2018, has said that in ""particular situations our priority will be Sebastian"".Binotto says: ""When you have your intentions clear from the start, you do not make mistakes when you may have an ambiguous situation.""The two will be free to fight. We will not ask Charles to be slow or Sebastian to be fastest. We need both of them to run to the maximum.""But if there any ambiguous situations at the beginning of the season, Sebastian is the one with more experience (and has had) many years with us. He already won championships so he is our champion.""Leclerc is easing himself into Ferrari and has been careful to avoid stoking any controversy. But at the same time he is not troubling to hide his ambitions.""Obviously I will be happy if I get used to this car as quickly as possible, and that I'm straight on the pace,"" he says. ""I'm realistic, too. It's only my second season in F1. I have a lot to learn, and there is a long road ahead.""I can't hide that I'm pushing to be as ready as possible for the first race, and if Mattia has the problem to manage two quick drivers, then it's a good sign for me.""But for now I'm just focusing on myself, trying to improve every lap I am doing in the car. It is a top team, and there are procedures that are quite different to the team I was in before. There is a bit of adaptation.""Ferrari's reluctance to promote young drivers has in the past at least partly been founded on questions about how they might cope in the highly pressured situation of driving for F1's most famous team.F1 is a merciless environment that brutally exposes any weaknesses, and some drivers wilt under the light upon them. Driving for Ferrari - effectively an Italian national team, with expectations high, and every nuance micro-analysed - magnifies the intensity of the situation by a considerable amount.Even Vettel has proven vulnerable to this pressure, as the series of mistakes which unravelled his title campaign last year proved.So Binotto's remarks about the way the drivers will be handled, at least initially, are in many ways, a clever approach.It works for Vettel, in that it acts as an overt, public statement that the team is behind him as their lead driver, potentially reducing the stress that might have been a contributory factor to some of his mistakes last season.And it lessens the immediate pressure on Leclerc, by effectively saying, don't worry too much about any desire you feel to beat Vettel from the off; take your time, this probably is not your year anyway.It remains to be seen how Leclerc will cope with this new step up in his career, but so far the signs are that he has the mental fortitude and resilience to cope.After a dominant career in the junior categories, Leclerc started his debut season with Sauber last year with very high expectations on him. But in the first three races he was unconvincing. He was not initially that quick, and he made a few unprovoked errors as well.But a change in approach to the set-up of the car for the fourth race in Azerbaijan transformed his season. He drove a stunning race to sixth place in Baku, and never looked back.Even before that, there had been signs that this was a man more than usually immune to the distractions of the outside world impinging on his professional performance.Three days after his father's death in that summer of 2017, Leclerc had to race in Baku in Formula 2. The personal torment can only be imagined, but he put his car on pole by more than half a second, and won the first race. That meant a start in eighth for the second race, which he also won, although a 10-second penalty demoted him to second.""It was very hard to take,"" Leclerc remembers, ""because I lost him on the Wednesday just before the race so it was very fresh.""The only thing I told myself was that seeing me race for him was absolutely everything and he definitely would not want me to be destroyed before the race and do a bad race.""The only thing he would want me to do would be win the race for him, so I was very happy to have honoured him this way.""His father is the not the only person close to him Leclerc has lost on the way up. He was also godson to the former F1 driver Jules Bianchi, who died in July 2015 of head injuries sustained in a crash during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.Bianchi's father and Leclerc's father were best friends, and Jules, only eight years older, was more a big brother to Charles than a godfather.If he is primarily out to win for himself, they are never far from his mind. Leclerc heads into the most important season of his young life wearing a helmet that carries tributes to both men.""I think of them every time I win a race,"" he says, ""and I am sure they are up there looking at me smiling.""Additional reporting by Jennie Gow"
sport	Jolyon Palmer column: How McLaren are showing Renault the way in Formula 1's midfield fight	What's up with Renault?Some good news for Renault on the engineCan Renault ever win again?	"Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault during the 2017 season, is part of the BBC team and offers insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitor.Behind the fight at the front between the big three teams, McLaren are arguably the story of the new Formula 1 season.They had a torrid time last year, and faced a lot of criticism for underperforming woefully despite having a star driver in Fernando Alonso and a budget bigger than many of their midfield rivals.Aside from poor performance, what hurt McLaren the most was that they had gone into the season making bold claims about what they could achieve after dumping Honda engines and switching to Renault.In 2019, that has all changed - the expectation and the performance.Alonso exited F1 at the end of last season, leaving McLaren with Carlos Sainz and rookie Lando Norris. And for the first time since I can remember, McLaren came into the season playing down expectations.But after four races, they lead the best of the rest 'Class B' fight - sitting behind only Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull - having picked up a strong double-points finish in Baku last weekend.Norris has hit the ground running, showing strong pace and, as yet, few rookie errors, while Sainz has had more misfortune but is showing well as the inherent lead driver in the team.And it could have been better still.Contact with Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat effectively ruled both drivers out of the Chinese Grand Prix on lap one.Sainz's Renault engine let go in Melbourne to rule him out of a result there and he lost out on a good haul of points in Bahrain after contact while trying to pass the Red Bull of Max Verstappen.There is room for improvement and refinement for the team yet, but they have made a big step in the right direction and there's all the groundwork for a very strong year.The baton of 'most disappointing midfield runner' has been passed by McLaren to the factory Renault team.And nobody will be more disappointed than their star driver Daniel Ricciardo.The big-money winter signing from Red Bull came into the season with huge hopes and a lot of attention.At race one in Melbourne, the city was pretty much solidly yellow with Renault merchandise in support of the Aussie. The backing he had was enormous, but the fans saw their man fail to make the top 10 qualifying shootout and effectively retire from the race within metres of the start.Four races later, it feels as though Ricciardo is almost a forgotten man in Formula 1 now.Renault's 29-year-old driver is such a likeable, larger-than-life character, but he is pretty anonymous in the ultra-tight midfield.In Baku, he was most notable for an overzealous move on Kvyat, which turned into a clumsy episode as he reversed into his rival in the run-off area of Turn Three to take them both out of the race.But the criticism doesn't lie with Ricciardo. In fact, after a slightly underwhelming start, he has been driving pretty well. He outperformed Renault team-mate Nico Hulkenberg solidly through the Baku weekend and scored a very good seventh place in China, despite lacking race pace compared with his rivals behind.Hulkenberg is still grossly underrated. He takes an easy jab because of the fact that he's never stood on an F1 podium, but he's been performing at the highest level in midfield cars for years.I was his team-mate in 2017 and I know exactly how good he is. If he got himself into a top car, he would certainly be good enough to fight for a title.Drivers are not Renault's problem. It's the car, which is lacking in both pace and reliability.Unbelievably, they have the second slowest average qualifying pace in the field so far, ahead of only Williams, who have all sorts of problems of their own.Admittedly, it is very close, with just over 0.3 seconds separating their car - the ninth-fastest - from Haas, the fourth-quickest, and there are some extenuating circumstances.But Renault have made third qualifying in only one race out of the four so far - in China, where both cars edged to the front of the midfield.In Baku, Ricciardo picked up a big slipstream at the end of first qualifying to just nudge himself out of the drop zone by 0.1secs. Meanwhile, Hulkenberg spent the entire weekend way off the pace, ahead of only the Williams, saying he was missing ""love and harmony"" with his car.Qualifying pace isn't Renault's only concern, though. Reliability has been very weak as well in the opening stages of the season.Both cars retired with engine failures in Bahrain when in positions to score points. Hulkenberg lost a chance of points in China as well with another engine issue.Further problems with both cars in qualifying in Bahrain, and for Hulkenberg in Australia, have hampered progress as well and left them with a lot of work to do on race day.Renault lie seventh in the standings and still have every possibility of ending up fourth in the constructors' championship if they can find some pace and reliability in their car.But for a team who began the season hoping to close the gap to the top teams it has been a dismal start.McLaren, running the same engine as Renault, are showing them the way at the moment, but are also demonstrating that it isn't just the Renault engine that is holding the works team back. The chassis is clearly seriously underdeveloped.From when I first drove for Renault in 2016, up until the end of last season, there were only very limited improvements in the performance of the Renault engine.There had always been a big deficit to Mercedes and Ferrari and by the end of 2018 it hadn't closed, which ultimately forced Red Bull to switch to the ever-improving Honda engine.This year, though, there appears to be a bit of a breakthrough. Finally the Renault engine seems to have taken a step towards its competitors.After the hazy picture of pre-season testing settled and a pecking order emerged in Melbourne, there was some finger pointing towards the Enstone-based side of the team, which looks after the chassis.But after the next race in Bahrain, when the team were on for a strong double points finish until both engines simultaneously expired, the memo was very much ""we need to work together"" once more.All of this demonstrates the difficult position the team is in right now. Finger-pointing is a dangerous game for a team who build their chassis in a different country to their engine.Harmony is key to getting the most out of it - as is being demonstrated by Mercedes, who are extracting the most out of every aspect of their team right now.They are such a chiselled outfit and, without having a completely dominant car, they are blowing away the competition because they are excelling in every other area.Renault can recover this season, and I still expect them to, although if they are to regain their fourth position by the end of the season, McLaren may be hard to beat.But the bigger question is: Can they ever close the gap to the top teams?They have plateaued since 2017, which was effectively their first year back, as in 2016 the team were basically running an underdeveloped Lotus car because they decided on their return to F1 as a works team so late in 2015.It would be good for F1 to have another team in the mix at the front and with the budget and power that Renault wield in the automotive industry, they are surely the most likely on paper to make the step.F1 as a sport would not be the only beneficiary. Ricciardo walked away from a race-winning Red Bull team to join the French marque this year.Even though I'm sure he would have appreciated the task ahead when he signed, he surely couldn't have imagined having this as a starting point.Usually the next race in Barcelona would be seen as a good chance for a turning point for the team, but Ricciardo has picked up a three-place grid penalty on a track that is difficult to overtake on.It was a penalty born out of the frustration of racing outside of the top 10, but Ricciardo will have to get used to that for now, because Renault look like being midfield runners for the foreseeable future."
sport	Lewis Hamilton on a tough season, the risks of racing and his future	A question of life and death'I would say I have a very complex life'A tricky work-life balance'I can stay focused in meetings for, like, 23 minutes'The 2019 season and its challengesOn hitting peak form and staying there'It still sucks to lose'	"Lewis Hamilton is explaining what keeps him hungry - how, despite six world championships, 83 grand prix victories and more money than he probably ever dreamed of, his desire for success in Formula 1 burns as bright as ever.""The thing is I never got into it for money,"" the Mercedes driver says. ""Of course it is great that that piles up - no problem. That is a bonus. As long as those things don't become the lead factor of what I do.""The core of what I do is that I love racing. I love the challenge. I love arriving knowing I have got these incredibly talented youngsters who are trying to beat me and outperform me, outsmart me, and I love that battle that I get into every single year.""And I am working with these guys [his Mercedes engineers] who are so much smarter than me and they make me feel smarter. When I am challenging them and proving them wrong so many times, it is unreal.""Hamilton laughs and refers to the conversations he has with chief engineer Andrew Shovlin and his colleagues about the complexities of the car.""It happens a lot,"" Hamilton says. ""I say something to Shov, and he will say: 'No, the numbers say this', and I will say: 'It's this and this and this.' And he will say: 'Oh you are right.' It feels so good. There are a lot of things like that.""Hamilton is in expansive form as he discusses his 2019 season and all matters involved in it. Over the course of the interview he covers:One of the most fundamental questions any human being can ask themselves is what their life is worth, what risks they are prepared to take to do what they enjoy.While Formula 1 drivers are confronted with this to some degree every time they get in their car, it became very real for them at the Belgian Grand Prix this year when Formula 2 driver Hubert was killed in a crash shortly after F1 qualifying had finished.Hamilton was doing his television interviews at the time, and the footage of his reaction when he saw the accident on a screen nearby, the anguish on his face before he cut an interview short and walked away, is chilling.Hamilton has mentioned the impact of Hubert's death briefly a couple of times this season. But this is the first time he has talked about it in depth.""It wasn't the first time I've seen that happen in my career,"" Hamilton says.""I remember quite vividly when I was young [aged eight] I won this race in Kimbolton and Daniel Spence died and that was a tragic time for me as a kid, the first time I had known someone to die. And I was just with him that day.""That was a tough one. This one, I was doing an interview and I saw it happen out of the corner of my eye and I just knew it was [bad]. And lots of things flashed through my mind.""I remember watching Ayrton [Senna] when he watched [Roland] Ratzenberger crash and seeing his face. There was a lot of deja vu in that experience.""A lot of thoughts went through my mind in the evening. I worried about the kid. I know what it's like to be in F2 and having the dream of being somewhere.""I thought to myself: 'The cars are still unsafe.' Particularly lower down the ranks it's probably even less safe than it is for us.""And then there is the question of how much more do you need, how much more do you want? And finding all those balances.""I'm not chasing because I have to have it, because I love what I do. And I was like, 'Jeez, I could spend more time with my family' and all these things that you can look back on.""I'm sure when it comes to your last day and you're at the pearly gates - I like to think you're at the pearly gates - you're looking back on your life, you're never asking: 'I wish I had more money.' You always wish you had more time. And you probably have a ton of regrets: 'If only I'd made that decision on that day, I could have spent more time with my loved one' or whatever it is.""All those things were going through my mind. But there was never a second I thought I wasn't going to keep racing. The fear factor never crept in.""That was an important factor for me. Because I remember when that kid died, when I was eight, one of my best friends at the time quit racing. Fear crept into him and he just quit. For me, I was like, if that ever creeps into me, I know that's the last legs of my career.""That was not the only time the wider questions of existence have crept into Hamilton's professional life this season. After arriving home from the Japanese Grand Prix in October, he took to Instagram to post some messages reflecting his despair over the climate crisis, saying the world was ""messed up"" and he felt like ""giving up on everything"".He defended his intervention on arriving at the subsequent race in Mexico. But he never addressed whether there was a wider personal context to it.""There is,"" he now admits, ""but I don't really wish to go into that.""He adds: ""Most of the time, I wear my heart on my sleeve, so it was an emotional post, which is not always good to do. It just felt like I was banging my head against the wall and not gaining ground.""There is a lot of push-back on a lot of things I do, and a lot of questioning of everything I do and say. You live your life under a magnifying glass. And the pressure for anyone that's in the limelight… we're only human, so at some stage you're going to buckle a little bit.""But I always say it's not how you fall, it's how you get back up. And I really turned that negativity into a positive and came back and won that next race. And you'll probably see if you look back in the history of the times I've often had those difficult phases, I've often won the next races. That's where my strength lies.""How does he feel to have his personal views - and his right to express them - questioned?""I just understand it's just the way of life,"" Hamilton says. ""But the fact that is the way it is doesn't make it any easier.""I would say I have a very complex life. I'm sure we all have complex lives. But I can't talk about absolutely how complex it is.""I am trying to be more open about that, as you'll see on my social. But there is a line where it's the limit and for me personally that one there was slightly over the limit.""But I don't regret it. Because I think for those who are following me and are on this journey with me, I don't think showing vulnerability is always a bad thing. They can just see I'm human at the end of the day.""Hamilton has been keen for some time to pursue outside interests, such as his growing interest in fashion, and he and Mercedes have always insisted that giving him the freedom to pursue his other ambitions revitalises him and ultimately makes him perform better.But Hamilton admits he has to be careful not to take too much on.""I would say just the energy load, there is a lot; I have to take a lot of weight. I don't go to the races and just go home, and [be at] home all week just training, which would be so much easier. I have so many commitments. And I would say that in many areas that's a strength but if I'm not careful that can easily tip over and be a weakness.""I am constantly monitoring that. I run a tight ship with Marc [Hynes, his adviser and close friend] and my guys. I don't plan to be the easiest person to work with. I tell you how it is.""And if I ever feel that I need to back away, I've got people around me who [are supportive]. Like [last] Monday, for example, I was, like, 'Bono, I can't be there Monday but let's catch up on Tuesday because I'm overloaded. I need to sleep.' It's about understanding your body and making sure you stay centered.""Media playback is not supported on this device'Bono' is Hamilton's race engineer Peter Bonnington, one of the key figures at Mercedes - along with technical director James Allison, Shovlin, chief strategist James Vowles and others - who have helped shape the team into such a formidable force.Just before this interview, Hamilton was deep in conversation with Allison and Shovlin about some technical matter, and he says his growth in this area has been critical to his continuing success.""I've just sat with James, and these guys are so smart; their intelligence level is on another stratosphere compared to mine,"" Hamilton says.""However, their minds can't compute what I can do in the car. We're just tuned differently. Trying to understand them, sitting at the table and speaking to them about what they can take from me to apply to the car, is really the key.""We're always working on that relationship, that rapport,"" Hamilton continues. ""We know each other so well.""I go in a meeting with them at the factory and those guys can sit in meetings for hours and stay focused. I have a window of, say, 23 minutes or something like that. As soon as I get there, it's all going over my head. They know. I say: 'Look, I gotta get up, go for a pee, have a coffee or something and I can come back.' And they get another 23 minutes.""At Mercedes, they believe this has been Hamilton's most impressive season. He has won half the 20 races so far, and had put a lock on the championship with seven victories in the first 10 grands prix.If that looks like it was easy, Hamilton says it has been anything but. He says the 2019 Mercedes, while very strong, has been a difficult car to understand, it has taken time to get to grips with the intricacies of Pirelli's latest tyres, and team-mate Valtteri Bottas has been a stronger adversary than before.But if Hamilton's season has been awesome in its consistent excellence, it has lacked the standout 'wow' moments that have come to be associated with him - a stunning pole lap out of nowhere, for example.And while Hamilton is up 13-7 on Bottas in their qualifying head-to-head, and comfortably quicker on average, the Finn has five pole positions to Hamilton's four, which clearly irks him.But when I ask whether this change in the character of his season was a deliberate plan, Hamilton looks almost hurt.""I wouldn't say it has been a plan to be less 'wow',"" he says, but he admits: ""More consistency within the race was really important for me. So, other areas, in just health aspects, weekend-in, weekend-out delivering.""It's crazy because we got to August and I'm thinking 'Jeez, I've had eight wins.' And as a team we've had, like, 14 wins and you kind of forget those things because you're just always looking forwards and time is always ticking.""But it was not intentional not to be 'wow'. I've been searching for that 'wow' lap this year. And honestly I've had good laps but they've not shown in the order, necessarily, you know?""Some of my second places that split up the Ferraris, for me felt like relatively quite 'wow' laps, but because I wasn't on pole by half a second it doesn't appear that way for you. But for me internally it did.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceBottas' increased strength was particularly notable at the beginning of the year, something Hamilton attributes in part to his former number-two race engineer transferring over this year to become the Finn's lead engineer and taking some of the world champion's secrets with him.Bottas hit the ground running, after four races was leading the championship by a point from Hamilton and all the talk was of him being a new man in 2019. Hamilton admits it gave him pause for thought.""First couple of races are usually not perfect for me,"" Hamilton says. ""They're still not bad, still better than average, but then there's all the outside pressures of 'Valtteri 2.0' and I'm thinking: 'We're 2-2, two wins apiece.' And for me I'm… I can't… I've got to stay solid in my mind, I can't allow the outside… but being human it's very hard not to notice those things.""But then I just started ramping up after that, and it went 3-2, 4-2, 5-2, 6-2, 8-2 and I was like: 'That's gooood.'"" He laughs.How does he find that extra gear? From inside himself, and from the details of hard work, Hamilton says.""From myself - hard to explain it. Like when you wake up, you're kinda groggy and not 100%. Then you hit… we all hit perfect peak at different points in the day. Just finding a way to be more fine-tuned physically. I think I've become the most fine-tuned physically and mentally I've ever been and that's a constant - every year I'm trying to improve that.""A key strength is that Hamilton has what Shovlin calls ""more tools in his box"" as a driver to adapt instantly in the car to changing conditions, such as weather or handling balance.That, Hamilton says, is ""conscious"".""I've always been able to adapt. One of my strengths is I think I am probably one of the most adaptive drivers there is. I'll jump into almost any scenario and figure my way through,"" he adds.""And that's why it works so well in the rain, for example, because you have to be dynamic in those places. Constantly shifting your driving style.""I have also studied other athletes. I listen to Valentino [Rossi] and how he feels he's had to change his driving style to keep up with the newer generation and I question myself whether that's necessary. That's his journey. He was so great, you know? But I look at that and try and figure out how I would position that.""If you look at tennis players and how they change their swing. I speak to Serena [Williams] and the nuances she goes into. I watch golf and see how Tiger [Woods] has slowly come back after improving his swing.""It is very similar to a driver. You can change these small things that just give you a wider platform and a wider foundation to be able to pull laps together. But, man, it's millimetres, or micrometers, and it's very, very hard to see the differences always.""As he talks, Hamilton's love for the sport and determination to succeed is obvious. But he says that he has learned to deal better with the disappointment of losing as he has got older.""I remember, like, 2007 and 2008, in those times I couldn't leave my hotel room for three days. Through my whole young karting [career], I was so hard on myself.""In my mind, that is just how I deal with things. And people couldn't understand it: 'You finished second, or finished third or fifth' or whatever it may be. And they couldn't understand the turmoil that I would drop into - a really, really dark place, and I couldn't get myself out of it.""And that applied to a lot of things in my life. And as I've grown older I've just understood how to stay centred, get myself out of these dark holes, and I am less… even in the worst cases, they are not really that dark. That is just growth.""There was no quick, short route to doing it. But it still sucks to lose.""At 34, Hamilton knows he is closer to the end of his career than the beginning, but retirement is still some way off.""I don't fear it,"" he says. ""Naturally for athletes, it has to be the saddest day, to hang up and stop doing something you've loved your whole life and as long as you can remember.""But that is why I have all these other things in place that I can fall back on. The fashion side, for example. I've found another business that I can do for a long time if successful. Currently that is going really, really well but I don't know how long it will go. But at least I have another interest.""There are a lot of different things I can be interested in. I know my life is not going to be over when I retire. And that gives me a lot of comfort.""But right now I feel physically good enough to continue so I'm going to try to eke that out as long as I can."""
sport	Mick Schumacher eighth in standings after Formula 2 debut at Bahrain Grand Prix		Mick Schumacher, son of Formula 1 great Michael, sits eighth in the Formula 2 standings after his debut weekend at the Bahrain Grand Prix.The 20-year-old German finished eighth in race one on Saturday, meaning he started on pole in Sunday's second race after grid positions were reversed.On Sunday, Schumacher came sixth in the sprint race, won by Luca Ghiotto.Italy's Ghiotto occupies top spot in the standings leading into the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on 28 April.Schumacher Jr, who drives for Prema Racing, took eight points from the opening weekend and sits 29 points behind leader Ghiotto.The German began the second race on pole thanks to the reverse grid system for the top eight finishers of race one.His father is the only driver in history to win seven F1 titles, and also has the all-time record of 91 grand prix victories.The 50-year-old, who retired from F1 for a second time at the end of 2012, has not been seen in public since suffering severe brain injuries in a skiing accident in December 2013.His son will test with the Ferrari and Alfa Romeo F1 teams in Bahrain on Tuesday.
sport	Antonio Giovinazzi: Italian signs extension at Alfa Romeo for 2020		"Italian Antonio Giovinazzi will stay at Alfa Romeo for his second Formula 1 season next year.The 21-year-old will again partner veteran Kimi Raikkonen, who will be heading into the final year of his contract in 2020.The decision to retain Giovinazzi probably ends the F1 career of German Nico Hulkenberg, at least for a year.The only seat yet to be filled is the second Williams alongside George Russell.That is expected to go to rookie Nicholas Latifi.Giovinazzi, who is a member of the Ferrari driver academy, had an erratic start to his rookie season and there was pressure from within the Alfa Romeo team at one point to take Hulkenberg instead for 2020.But Ferrari had the final call on the seat, through the team's financial relationship with sister brand Alfa Romeo, and they have seen enough potential in Giovinazzi to convince them he deserves to be given a further opportunity.Giovinazzi took time to find his feet but he has out-qualified Raikkonen four times in the past five races, although he lags behind the Finn in the championship, having scored only four points to Raikkonen's 31.Alfa Romeo team boss Frederic Vasseur said: ""Antonio has emerged as a very quick driver, even alongside as tough a benchmark as Kimi, and we expect him to develop even further as his experience grows.""Giovinazzi said: ""I am grateful for the incredible level of support I received in my first full season in Formula 1. Everyone in the team has stuck by my side since I joined and I am really looking forward to continuing our journey together.""We learned a lot this year and I am confident we can make a big step forward next season. I won't be a rookie any more so there won't be any excuses for me. I want to be competitive right from the start of the championship and repay the confidence the team has shown in me.""Hulkenberg has lost his seat at Renault after three years to Frenchman Esteban Ocon and his future in the sport is unclear."
sport	Formula 1 accused of sending 'appalling message' over Bahrain Grand Prix		"Formula 1 has been accused by human rights groups of sending ""an appalling message"" over abuses allegedly related to the Bahrain Grand Prix.Coming just over three weeks before this year's race in Manama, the criticism concerns the jailing of activist Najah Yusuf.Last month, 17 campaign organisations wrote to F1 management urging them to put pressure on Bahrain.They said she was jailed over criticism of the race, which authorities deny.Protest groups, including Human Rights Watch and the Bahrain Institute for Rights & Democracy (Bird), claimed that Yusuf had been given a three-year sentence because she protested against the 2017 race.However, in correspondence seen by the BBC, F1's general counsel Sacha Woodward-Hill replied that Bahrain's authorities had assured her that Yusuf's conviction was not related to the grand prix, and that people were free to criticise the event.Last year F1 admitted ""concern"" that the court judgement in Yusuf's case referred to negative comments she made about the race on social media.Bird's head of advocacy, Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, accused F1 of ""sending an appalling message that its supposed commitment to human rights in reality means nothing"".He said: ""Its decision to continually rely on false assurances by the Bahraini government is extremely disappointing. F1's response amounts to complicity in covering up for Bahrain.""British Liberal Democrat peer Lord Scriven, who is to meet Formula 1 management next week to discuss Yusuf's case, said he ""will be making it clear in the strongest possible terms that the leadership of F1 have personally not done enough in the case of Najah Yusuf and human rights abuses generally by the Bahraini authorities stemming from the holding of Bahrain Grand Prix"".He added: ""F1 are happy to be a fig leaf for the Bahraini authorities who use the event of the grand prix to portray a picture to the world that hides the systematic human rights abuses of those who wish to stand up and have true freedom of expression.""If the leaders of Formula 1 won't deal with Human Rights abuses that are directly linked to their sporting events, then maybe it's time to take the case direct to the sponsors, teams and individual drivers.""The Bahrain authorities said that Yusuf's conviction was unrelated to the grand prix.""Najah Yusuf's defence did not claim during her trial that her right to free speech had been infringed. Peaceful protests of any kind are protected by Bahrain's constitution and do not constitute a crime,"" the statement said.Woodward-Hill, in a letter to Bird, said: ""The Kingdom of Bahrain has clearly stated that the charges and convictions of Ms Yusuf have 'absolutely no relation to the F1 race' and have provided a detailed response in relation to concerns around the case.""F1 is committed to respecting internationally-recognised human rights and we take all responsibilities seriously.""Staged for the first time in 2004, the Bahrain Grand Prix has been one of the most controversial races on the F1 calendar.It was cancelled in 2011 after pro-democracy protests were crushed. At least 35 people were killed; protesters claimed the death toll was far higher.In 2013 a group of British MPs called on then-F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone to cancel the race again amid further unrest in Bahrain. However, recent races there have passed off without incident."

sport	Chinese Grand Prix: Charles Leclerc aims for first win at Formula 1's 1,000th race	How do you mend a broken Ferrari heart?Will there be any Shanghai surprises?Hamilton's Chinese inkHow can I follow the Chinese Grand Prix on the BBC?	"Formula 1 reaches its 1,000-race milestone at this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai, where Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will try to erase his Bahrain heartache with a maiden victory.If ever there was a grand prix that brought F1 fans together in collective sympathy, then Charles Leclerc's gut-wrencher in Bahrain was surely it.The 21-year-old celebrated plenty of firsts under the floodlights at Sakhir, including a maiden pole and podium finish.But a first F1 win had wait for another day after his Ferrari agonisingly suffered an engine problem with nine laps to go, allowing Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton to come through to take the win.Ferrari have confirmed Leclerc will use the same power unit in China after the team had traced the issue to ""a short circuit within an injection-system control unit"".Can the 1,000th F1 race provide the moment of Leclerc magic his fans are so desperate to see?Designed to look like the Chinese symbol for ""shang"", meaning upwards, and with a flat-out straight for almost 1.4 kilometres, the Shanghai International Circuit has proved a happy hunting ground for world champion Hamilton, who has five victories here - three for Mercedes and two for McLaren.With an tricky start to the lap - a tightening right-hander that sweeps uphill before dropping back down - a front-row spot on the grid is a must. History suggests it would be unwise to bet against Hamilton being right up there again, with a record six previous poles to his name at this track.Hamilton's pedigree in China and Leclerc's red-hot form will only add to the pressure on the second Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel, whose clumsy spin in Sakhir was his fifth such error in the past 13 races.The German was outpaced by team-mate Leclerc throughout the Bahrain weekend, and admitted his car was ""extremely difficult to drive"" after finishing down in fifth place.Nothing less than a top-three finish will do for Vettel as he is already 22 points behind championship leader Valtteri Bottas - the Finn one point ahead of Mercedes' team-mate Hamilton.Yet if Vettel thinks his season has started poorly, he should spare a thought for Daniel Ricciardo.The Australian swept to a sensational victory for Red Bull in Shanghai in 2018, passing five cars thanks to a fresh set of tyres during a safety-car period. ""I don't seem to win boring races,"" he said at the time.Fast-forward one year and it's all very different for Ricciardo, who is now at Renault and has two DNFs from as many races at the start of the season.He has struggled to match the pace of team-mate Nico Hulkenberg and admitted in Bahrain that he was over-driving because he was used to a car with more performance.""There are for sure some things I need to figure out what I need in the car as far as set-up goes,"" he said.""The positive is I know there is a lot for me to still gain from this car. I hope it happens sooner but it is going to be a bit of a process.""Hamilton has already expressed his excitement at seeing his 'Team LH' fan contingent in China this weekend.""I got this 'Warriors Love' tattoo right after my win in 2017,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""A moment that will stay with me a lifetime.""You always make me feel so welcome and the energy you give me is incredible.""Is there any space left for another inky tribute if results go his way on Sunday?Set your alarm clock to ""groggy"" as the early morning starts for UK fans return this weekend.Friday's practice sessions, plus Saturday's final practice and qualifying will be available on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.Race day on Sunday needs a quick channel switch to BBC Radio 5 Live for full commentary from 07:00 BST.As ever you can follow every twist and turn with BBC Sport's live text commentary and get involved with your thoughts and predictions using the hashtag #bbcf1 via Twitter.Click here for full coverage details."

The session lasts one hour and sees drivers divided into four groups of up to six cars, defined by their position in the championship.Once out, each driver has six minutes to set their best time, with the top-six drivers proceeding to the super pole shoot-out in a bid to secure a pole position and additional three points.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIf a 03:40 alarm call on a Sunday morning seems a little too early, viewers can catch up on all the action from qualifying on the BBC Red Button from 06:00 GMT.Round four in Mexico City saw Brazil's Lucas di Grassi win a dramatic race after the Audi driver overtook Mahindra Racing's Pascal Wehrlein metres before the finish line.Former Formula 1 driver Wehrlein led for large periods but ran out of power on the final corner as Di Grassi edged past on the inside.Series organisers also announced in the build-up to Hong Kong that Formula E on the streets of London will be held in 2020 around the London Docklands and the ExCel centre.The London E-Prix was previously held in 2015 and 2016, when Battersea Park provided the stage for back-to-back season finales.After Mexico City E-PrixBritish drivers with championship pointsCompared with some of its carbon-belching cousins, Formula E is considerably more friendly to the environment.The sport was developed with sustainability in mind, with organisers saying the aim is to ""reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible"".It does this by powering its cars with a battery that uses 100% renewable fuel, and tyres that - as well as lasting an entire race - can also be recycled afterwards. Meanwhile, spectators are encouraged to use public transport to get to events, with no public parking available.One drawback with battery-powered cars is they have not had the capacity to last an entire race, resulting in the rather unusual (and somewhat gimmicky) sight of drivers having to swap cars mid-race.That will no longer happen - this season's Gen2 car is fitted with a battery that will last from start to finish.With the car manufacturing world looking to switch to developing almost exclusively electric cars within the next couple of decades, Formula E provides them with the ideal arena to test new technology at a competitive level.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSpectators play a key role in the action during Formula E races.'Fan boost' has been a feature of the past few seasons, with viewers able to vote using an app to determine which driver gets some extra power during a race.New this season is 'Attack Mode', which gives competitors a speed boost after they drive through an allocated area on the track."

sport	Formula 1 testing 2019: Williams in turmoil as Sebastian Vettel fastest	Williams in troubleFerrari look 'ultra strong'Fastest times, day one, first pre-season test, Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya	"Williams are in turmoil in the build-up to the new Formula 1 season as a result of delays building their new car.The new FW42 missed the first day of pre-season testing on Monday, will not be ready for Tuesday and is likely to miss much of Wednesday as well.On track, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel set the pace, with a lap 0.4 seconds quicker than McLaren's Carlos Sainz.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said Ferrari ""looked ultra-strong"" but added no team was chasing ultimate lap times.Williams' car was still at the team's Oxfordshire factory on Monday and was not scheduled to be finished until late on Tuesday, before being flown to Spain.The problems have led to questions about the future of technical boss Paddy Lowe.The 56-year-old joined Williams in 2017 from Mercedes, where he was the senior technical figure as the team won three consecutive world title doubles from 2014-16.Lowe is ultimately responsible for all technical aspects of the Williams group, including the performance of the F1 car, and pressure is building on him within the team.Insiders say that employees had been warning for some months that delays could lead to the car missing the start of testing, but action was not taken in time to solve the problem.Teams are allowed only eight days of testing - four this week and four next - before the first race in Australia on 14-16 March.Deputy team principal Claire Williams described the delay as ""extremely disappointing"".She added: ""It is looking more likely than not that we will now not be in a position to run on track until Wednesday at the earliest.""On Monday, Williams hoped the car would be ready to fly to Spain on Tuesday evening, but the earliest it is expected to be at the track is between 1am and 2am local time on Wednesday.Although Williams plan a night shift to prepare the car for the third day of the test, they accept it is unlikely to be ready for the start of testing at 9am local time, given the inevitable teething troubles any team encounters with a new car.The aim is to get the car on track at some point on Wednesday, but that could slip to Thursday - the final day of the test - if there are any problems.Just as worryingly for Williams - who dominated much of the 1980s and 1990s in F1 but slumped to last in the constructors' championship in 2018 - the team fear privately the car will be slow when it does finally hit the track.Get to know all the cars for the 2019 seasonInsiders say it is projected to be at least two seconds slower than last year's car, which was already the slowest in F1.Rule changes to front wings aimed at improving the racing have reduced downforce at the initial stages of design but many teams have clawed a large part of it back, and the times set on track on Monday suggest most teams' cars will have comparable pace at least to 2018.If the word from inside the team is accurate, Williams could be facing a season adrift of the rest of the field.But that remains a subject of speculation until at least it runs, and more likely until the race in Melbourne next month.Williams were hoping to make progress this season after their poor performance forced them to recognise how far they had fallen, and they embarked on some internal restructuring.The team have an all-new driver line-up of Robert Kubica, who is returning to F1 after eight years out caused by life-changing injuries suffered in a rally crash in February 2011, and British novice George Russell - the Formula 2 champion.The latest delay comes after Williams were forced to postpone a planned shakedown test on Saturday, and then to miss the first day of pre-season testing on Monday.Vettel ended the first day fastest, ahead of Sainz, Haas driver Romain Grosjean and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.""We couldn't have hoped for a better day,"" said Vettel, who completed 169 laps, more than any other driver. ""It was unbelievable.""The car was working really well, we had no issues slowing us down. We actually completed the programme just the way we wanted. And were able to squeeze a little bit more out even.""Lewis Hamilton, who drove only in the afternoon after taking over from Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, was ninth fastest as the world champion, as usual, concentrated on longer runs in testing.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said he thought Ferrari, who let their title chances slip last year with a series of errors, ""looked ultra-strong"".""We are all looking at lap times but it's not the purpose of these tests - it's about going through the data and testing the parts,"" Wolff said. ""Sebastian Vettel's time was very quick. The time was quicker than everyone else and definitely the Ferrari has been going strong this morning.""Wolff said Hamilton had come back from his winter break in good form.""The (car) weight regulations have been lifted and he came back stronger and musclier than before,"" Wolff said. ""He is in a super mental state, the best I have seen so far. So he looks physically and mentally in shape. A good start.""Pre-season testing times are a notoriously misleading guide to real form as it is impossible to know the specifications cars are running in - tyres, fuel loads and engine modes all make a significant difference to performance.Most of the teams ran reliably despite it being the first full day of testing, although both Haas and McLaren had cars stop on track.Kimi Raikkonen spun the Alfa Romeo into the gravel at Turn Five on his first flying lap of the day but there were no crashes.

It's slippery down the inside, my brakes locked up, and it's a shame it ended that way.""An upset Lotterer added: ""My race is done - hopefully his one too. I protected my position in a fair way. It's what you would call a disgusting move, and it's not really the way we should race.""I lost it thanks to him.

sport	Formula 1 testing 2019: Williams describe delayed start to testing as 'embarrassing'	Ferrari continue to impress	"Williams say it was ""embarrassing"" to miss two days of pre-season testing because their car was not ready.The Williams, driven by Briton George Russell, finally made it on to the track at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on Wednesday - with a day and a half left of the four-day test.Deputy team principal Claire Williams said: ""It's not a situation that we anticipated, or that we ever wanted to find ourselves in.""Debutant Russell was 13th fastest.The 21-year-old was eight seconds off the pace set by Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat, who - after a late run on the fastest tyre - pipped Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen by 0.058 seconds.Williams added: ""We're not just disappointed. It's embarrassing not bringing a race car to a circuit when everyone else has managed to do that, particularly a team like ours that has managed to bring a race car to testing for the past 40-odd years.""Williams said she wanted to apologise to the team's fans, but also to drivers Russell and Robert Kubica, who is returning to F1 after an eight-year absence following a 2011 rally crash that left him with partial movement in his right arm.Williams said the delays ""became apparent quite late on"", and after initially hoping they could make the second day of the test ""parts just weren't coming through as we hoped they would"".She refused to expand on why the problem happened.The situation has raised questions within the team about the future of chief technical officer Paddy Lowe, who is ultimately responsible for all technical parts of the company.The team cancelled a media briefing that had been scheduled for Lowe, saying it would now not take place until next week's second test after the car had undertaken significant running.And Williams ducked questions about Lowe, saying: ""I've read a lot of speculation about his position. Right now all I am focused on - and the team should be focused on - is making sure the car is in the right place.""Kubica is due to drive the car on Friday morning, before Russell runs again in the afternoon, and Williams is hopeful the team will be able to make up for lost time.""We've missed two days of testing, and that's not ideal,"" she said. ""That's a lot of potential kilometres. But I don't think that we will actually know the full impact of having missed those days until probably a bit later on.""Clearly we're doing everything we can to condense the programme that we had, to make sure that we maximised the time available and we really focused our efforts and attention on the most important and critical areas to make sure the car is in the best shape possible for Australia.""Russell managed 23 laps, with a best time of one minute 25.625 seconds.Williams said the team were still waiting for parts to arrive to allow them to concentrate on an aerodynamic assessment programme on Friday.Get to know all the cars for the 2019 seasonKvyat's late dash on the softest tyres displaced Raikkonen, who had topped the times for much of the day.Renault's Daniel Ricciardo also leapt up the times late in the day, with a run on the second-softest tyre, to push Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel down to fourth.Nevertheless, Ferrari continued to impress with their pace and reliability - Vettel and new team-mate Charles Leclerc were fastest on the first two days.World champion Lewis Hamilton, who was 12th fastest for Mercedes, said Ferrari were ""very strong"", adding: ""It appears they have a better package than last year, which means it will be a bigger challenge for us.""Hamilton added Mercedes were concentrating on learning about their car and it would not be until the second pre-season test next week that people would have a better idea where the teams stood.Fastest times, day three, first pre-season test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya1 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Toro Rosso 1:17.704 *****2 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo one minute 17.762 seconds *****3 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 1:18.164 ****4 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari1:18.350 ***5 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1:18.787 ***6 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 1:18.800 ****7 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas 1:19.189 ***8 Pietro Fittipaldi (Brz) Haas 1:19.249 ****9 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 1:19.354 ***10 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 1:20.102 ***11 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 1:20.693 ***12 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 1:20.818 ***13 George Russell (GB) Williams 1:25.625 ***Key: * = C1 tyre (hardest); ** = C2 (second hardest); *** = C3 (middle); C4 **** = (second softest); ***** = C5 (softest)"
sport	Kimi Raikkonen puts first miles on new Alfa Romeo Formula 1 car		Kimi Raikkonen has put the first miles on the new Alfa Romeo Formula 1 car.The 39-year-old Finn drove the car, from the team that used to be called Sauber, for 33 laps at Ferrari's Fiorano track in Italy.The Alfa Romeo, which was in a temporary colour scheme, will be official unveiled on Monday at the start of pre-season testing at Spain's Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.Raikkonen has moved to Alfa Romeo from Ferrari this season.His team-mate will be Italian Antonio Giovinazzi, who drove for Sauber in two races in 2017.Details of the car were hard to discern in the few pictures published but the Alfa Romeo looks to have a front-nose design similar to the 2018 and 2019 McLarens.The car also has a novel front-wing design, unlike that seen on any other car so far.This year, the front-wing rules have been changed to try to make the racing better. The aim of the rules is to reduce the amount of aerodynamic downforce lost by one car following another.But the new front-wing design also produces less downforce than those used last year, and teams have spent the winter trying to reduce the losses in overall downforce created by the rules.
sport	Formula 1 race organisers express concerns over future of the sport	What are F1's plans?What are the circuits' concerns?	"Formula 1's race organisers have expressed concerns over the future of the sport and demanded a more open approach from its owners.The F1 Promoters' Association (FOPA), which represents 16 of the 21 races on the calendar, says it wants ""a more collaborative approach from F1"".The FOPA discussed its concerns with F1 at a meeting in London on Tuesday.Stuart Pringle, chairman of FOPA, said: ""There is every indication the message has been received.""Pringle is managing director of British Grand Prix venue Silverstone.The circuits are worried about the loss of free-to-air television coverage, a lack of clarity over rules and the methods F1 is using to attract new races.And they feel that their voice has been ignored so far by the owners of F1, the US group Liberty Media, which took over the sport in January 2017.Pringle added: ""We were frustrated that we felt we had no option but to take this sort of action. But actually we have had a very positive day.""We believe our concerns will be looked at and we as a group of promoters do recognise that ultimately we are all striving for the same thing - a healthy sport. We want to work in a meaningful way to achieve that so we will work collaboratively with them going forward.""Pringle had earlier described Liberty's approach as ""disjointed"" and said the circuits had ""great concerns about the future health of the sport under the people who run it now"".The circuits' intervention comes at a delicate time for F1, with the contracts of five major races all up for renewal at the end of this season. Britain, Italy, Spain, Germany and Mexico are all out of contract after this year.All want to continue but say they cannot do so under the financial terms on offer from F1.Race-hosting fees are the single biggest source of revenue for F1, so the circuits hold a strong hand in discussions.F1 declined to comment on the specific issues raised by the circuits.Liberty is determined to make major changes to the way F1 is run. But talks on their plans to introduce a budget cap, reorganise revenue distribution to the teams and change the technical rules to make the racing closer have progressed slowly.F1 has already had to abandon a plan to change the engines significantly, but it insists negotiations are moving forward.There has been no public confirmation of any agreements as to the shape of the sport after 2020, when the teams' current contracts expire.Sources close to F1 say that there is general agreement on the principle of a budget gap and revenue redistribution but nothing concrete has been agreed.The latest plan is for a sliding scale of budget restriction, starting at around $175m in 2021, and reducing to about $135m in 2023. But the exact numbers are yet to be finalised and a number of areas of spend will not be included - such as engines, marketing and the salaries of the most expensive employees, including drivers.The circuits say it is a risk for them to be asked to plan long-term contracts with a partner without knowing the direction in which the product is heading.They have been concerned by what they believe was Liberty's willingness to give an advantageous deal to Miami, which insiders claim was effectively offered a race for free because F1 was so keen to secure an event in the Florida city. Efforts to finalise a deal have so far foundered.A statement from the circuits said: ""There is a lack of clarity on new initiatives in F1 and a lack of engagement with promoters on their implementation.""New races should not be introduced to the detriment of existing events although the association is encouraged by the alternative business models being offered to prospective venues.""The circuits are also concerned that the migration of TV coverage away from mass-market outlets towards either pay television or direct to consumer through F1's own outlets will inevitably restrict the sport's appeal.The statement said: ""It is not in the long-term interest of the sport that fans lose free access to content and broadcasting.""The UK is the latest market to effectively lose live coverage of races in 2019.A new contract, negotiated by former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone before Liberty took over, kicks in which sees live coverage of all races on Sky this year. Only the British Grand Prix will be live on free-to-air, on Channel 4, which also has highlights of the other 20 races.The circuits believe that moving from free-to-air will inevitably restrict F1's reach to casual viewers, restricting it only to hardcore fans, which has an immediate effect in cutting the audience but also threatens the sport's appeal in the long term.This is of particular concern to Silverstone, which saw attendance drop for its MotoGP race after it switched from free-to-air TV to pay-to-view and is concerned the same thing could happen with F1, further affecting its ability to afford to host the British Grand Prix.The UK TV switch follows a similar move in Italy last year.F1 points out that its overall TV audience has grown in the two years since Liberty took over, for the first time in a decade. The total audience in 2017 was 1.755 billion and 1.758 billion in 2018.However, live race audiences dropped slightly from 2017 to 2018, the total brought down by a decline in Italy, without which numbers would have gone up year on year.The races represented by FOPA are: Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Britain and the USA."

sport	How Formula 1 is aiming to be 'more exciting and race-able' in 2021	What's the problem?What is F1 doing about it?How successful have they been?What's wrong with the current car design?How are they fixing it?Is anything else changing?	"Formula 1 is being reinvented - some might say revolutionised - and if it's a success, it will be closer, more competitive and more exciting.Everyone involved in the sport has known for years that one of its biggest problems is that the cars cannot easily race closely together. Now, F1's bosses have set themselves the task of addressing this in time for a major reset of the many aspects of the sport in 2021, and they believe they are getting somewhere.""I'm confident we are going to make a big step forward,"" says Pat Symonds, Formula 1's technical director and the man leading research into the new-look F1. ""I think we'll have a much more race-able car. I think we'll have a better-looking car.""Revealing exclusive details about the cars that will race in 2021, this is how they are planning to do it.Symonds and his small team of former F1 engineers at the central London headquarters of the sport's owners Liberty Media have been looking at ways of solving a problem that has haunted the sport for decades.The current cars have awesome performance, with braking forces as much as six times the force of gravity and cornering forces that can top 5G. But the way they generate that performance is exactly why drivers find it so difficult to race.The performance comes from huge amounts of aerodynamic downforce. But the cars can only generate that load if they are driving on their own. Put another car in front of them, and the airflow to the car behind is badly disrupted - and that has a huge effect on how much downforce it can create.A 2018 F1 car following another car within 10 metres would lose as much as half of its total downforce. So it is literally physically impossible for that car to keep up.They only way a car behind could follow at the same speed as one in front was if it fell back to about two seconds adrift, out of this 'dirty air'. Which by definition makes it impossible to overtake it.To look at it from a performance perspective, on the vast majority of F1 circuits in 2018, a car following behind needed to have a lap-time advantage of nearly two seconds to overtake the one in front.In other words, two closely matched cars competing for the lead cannot reasonably be expected to overtake each other. In many ways, it's a miracle there is any overtaking.Symonds - who works under F1 sporting boss Ross Brawn - set his team the task of studying what aerodynamic phenomena led to cars performing in this way, and what could be done about it.Their starting point was to ask an industrial designer to come up with a series of concepts for what a 2021 car could look like, based on a brief that it had to be open-wheel and open-cockpit, but to improve the aesthetic appeal.Symonds discussed the results with F1 chief executive Chase Carey, Brawn and marketing boss Sean Bratches and they agreed on one of the five concepts. The task for Symonds and his team was then to come up with a way to make it produce downforce levels that would give it F1-style performance, but with much reduced negative effects.Symonds says: ""The whole research is about the effect on the car that's following. And our aim right through the project is to try to present air to the following car that allows it to produce a level of downforce that's close to it being in free air.""It's never going to be the same as it is in free air, but we're just trying to get as close as we can to that.""The initial task was to study the wake - the airflow behind the car - and see if it could be made more benign to a car behind.They used computational fluid dynamics, a way of simulating airflow over and behind a surface using software, and mixed different methods beyond the standard approach used by F1 teams to drill down into the detail of the airflow.And they asked the teams to be involved, by giving each one specific areas to focus on, and pooling the results on a confidential basis - so no single team would know which team had done which work.The current problem is that the wake is low down, and creates a low-pressure area directly behind a car. And the car behind needs high-pressure air to generate its downforce. The F1 group needed to find a way to make the wake sit higher.Symonds says they have found ""a remarkable improvement"".""When conditions are good, if we can ensure they are not broken down, then we've made a difference of many tens of per cent of performance of the following car,"" he says.There are caveats. Symonds won't quote numbers, he says, because ""we're not yet sure whether we can maintain that improvement under all conditions, and therefore it is not particularly valid to quote numbers"".But given that current cars are losing half their downforce, and there are only five lots of 10% between 50 and 100%, one can assume that Symonds and his team must be somewhere in the region of 90% or so of retained downforce for the car behind. If so, it would be a remarkable achievement.What this means is that in 2021 F1 cars will be generating their downforce in a completely different way to now.Currently, this is done through controlling vortices of air that spin off certain parts of the car, manipulating and accelerating them through particular areas of the upper bodywork, until they flow to the back of the car, where some of the air flows between the rear wheels above the floor, but much of it goes under the sides of the floor in front of the rear wheels and through what is known as the diffuser at the rear of the car - the central floor between the wheels.Perhaps the key vortex is what is known as the Y250 vortex. This flows in two streams off each side of the front wing, where a mandated neutral section - the flat bit in the middle - connects with the areas outside it that teams are allowed to manipulate.This vortex then flows, on each side of the car, inside the front wheels, around the outside of the bodywork either side of the driver, and towards the rear.This vortex is extremely powerful - but it is also extremely sensitive to the airflow to the front wing being disrupted. Reduce the airflow to the front wing, and the vortices lose power - and, hey presto, the car's downforce is dramatically cut.The task was to eliminate these vortices and create the downforce in another way that had two differences - it was less sensitive to a car in front, and it sends the airflow behind the car higher into the air.Symonds calls this higher wake - created by what is called an ""up-wash"" effect - a ""mushroom"" because of the shape it forms in CFD pictures.""What we want to do is have more robust flow structures,"" Symonds says. ""We don't want to have to rely on some of these vortical structures which work fine when a car is in good condition but don't work fine when it is in the wake of another car.""That's led us to a number of things. It's led us to be producing more of the downforce from the underbody of the car, but at the same time we need to rely on producing a lot of the downforce from the combination of a diffuser and rear wing system because we need to up-wash the wake, the wake being very dirty, low-energy air. We want to up-wash it over the top of the following car.""The idea that the solution to the overtaking problems experienced by current cars was to produce a greater proportion of the car's total downforce from the underbody has been touted as a panacea in some quarters for some years now.It harks back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, the days of so-called 'ground effect', when the harnessing of underbody airflow using a floor shape known as a venturi led to prodigious improvements in performance - so much so, that it was eventually banned.But since F1 has moved towards what might be called vortex-based aerodynamics, other areas of the sport have retained underfloor aerodynamics to a greater or lesser extent - primarily IndyCars and endurance prototype racing (Le Mans, to the layman).And the drivers of these cars have been saying for a while that F1 should head in that direction, too, because it is much easier to race closely in those cars than in F1 cars.A key proponent of this view has been Alexander Wurz, the former F1 driver and two-time Le Mans winner, who is also the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.Symonds again won't give numbers on how much downforce will be generated from the underbody as a proportion of the total, and compare it to now, but it's clear from reading between the lines of what he does say that the shift is substantial.F1's interrogation of aerodynamics does not stop there. A lot of effort has also gone into understanding the effect of tyres on airflow. This is quite large on current cars, because the tyres have such tall sidewalls, a function of the 13-inch wheels used in F1.These are now totally out of step with road-car wheels, where even mundane family hatchbacks now typically have 18-inch rims.Engineers will argue that smaller wheels might not look as cool, but they are actually better for performance - not least because the wheels are lighter.But the 'spring effect' in the sidewalls also has a surprisingly large effect on aerodynamics, and this will be removed in 2021 by a switch to 18-inch wheels.""One of the things that is quite important is that there are areas of aerodynamics that are actually very difficult to understand,"" Symonds says, ""and they are rewarded by having enormous aerodynamic teams working on them. A lot of that has to do with the flow around the wheels and tyres, because the tyres move so much.""So one of the things we've done is go to 18-inch wheels and lower profile tyres. Because those tyres will move around less, so it is an easier problem to solve. And we hope then all the teams will have a slightly more equal chance with the big teams.""The work on aerodynamics is not complete. Symonds says that while they have made the rear of the car ""robust"", the same is not true yet of the front.""We need to continue work on that,"" he says. ""Because if you do break down the flow structures we've got, the performance just disappears. For example, we have done some changes on the front-wing design which has shown it is quite sensitive and we can lose probably a quarter of what we've gained just by a small change. So we've got to eliminate that sensitivity in those areas.""Meanwhile, the new aerodynamic rules are just one part of a wholesale restructure of F1, with changes planned - but not yet agreed - to the revenue split and a cost cap for key parts, with a final aim to bring the grid closer together.""We have around a 3% performance difference between the front and back of the grid,"" Symonds says. ""If we could get that to 1.5%, on top of cars being able to follow a bit closer, and on top of cars that are not quite so expensive to make, then we really will have changed something."""
sport	Formula 1 in 2019: The stories that could define the new season	MercedesFerrariRed BullRenaultHaasMcLarenRacing PointAlfa Romeo RacingToro RossoWilliams	"Every Formula 1 season has themes - storylines that define the year.Some of these come as a surprise. Who could have predicted that 2018's championship would turn on so many errors from Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari, for example?Others are more predictable. Every team heading into this year has a series of questions hanging over them that will form part of the narrative of the season, reflective of their immediate history, of expectations and necessities - and the same goes for their drivers.As the clock ticks down to the launches of the new cars and the start of pre-season testing in mid-February, let's look at the context within which every F1 team is heading into 2019.Media playback is not supported on this deviceDrivers: For Lewis Hamilton, nothing else will do this year but a sixth world title. The question for Hamilton is: how does he find it in himself to top last season? Undoubtedly his greatest yet.A virtually flawless 2018, including a number of thrilling, inspirational drives, will not be easy to top. But Hamilton headed into the winter saying he was going to work on trying to do exactly that, and he says he is ""ready to fight"" again.For his team-mate Valtteri Bottas, this could also be a defining season.The Finn ended last year winless, even if he was unlucky not to take at least two victories, and he has only a one-year deal for 2019. With Esteban Ocon in the wings as reserve driver, and team boss Toto Wolff pledging to find the Frenchman a drive for 2020, the pressure is on Bottas to perform.Team: Mercedes won a fifth consecutive drivers' and constructors' championship double last year and this year are aiming to break the all-time record set by Ferrari in the Michael Schumacher era.But last year they were able to achieve their feat only because of Ferrari's implosion - Vettel could have won the title had he had as flawless a season as Hamilton.Ferrari have made steady progress in recent years. In 2017, they were faster for much of the first half of the year, only to be steamrollered when Mercedes kicked on after the summer break. In 2018, Ferrari stepped up again - faster than Mercedes more often than it was the other way around.If that trend continues, Mercedes could have their work cut out. So the pressure is on the world champions to make a significant step forward with their new car this year.Drivers: Big changes this year, with the arrival of Charles Leclerc to replace Kimi Raikkonen and a new team boss following the ousting of Maurizio Arrivabene.But in many ways the spotlight is on the man who is supposed to lead the team on track - Vettel.It sounds odd to say it of a four-time world champion with 52 wins, but the German is arguably fighting for his reputation. He crumbled in the fight with Hamilton last year. And in Leclerc he faces the threat of a talented rising star, much as he did with Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull in 2014, when Vettel lost in no uncertain terms.If Vettel is beaten by Leclerc on a regular basis this year and, assuming Ferrari have a competitive car, again falls short of the title, what will that mean for his future, with only a year left on his Ferrari contract after this season?Leclerc has different pressure, of his first season in a top team, and the most famous one of all to boot.Expectations are high, so good did he look in his debut year last season. He says he expects to win races and challenge for the title if the car is good enough. Whether he lives up to those ambitions or not, the internal dynamics at Ferrari will be fascinating.Team: Ferrari arguably produced the best car last year and lost the title only because of errors, largely by Vettel, but also from the team.With former technical director Mattia Binotto in Arrivabene's place, the first question is whether Binotto can maintain the team's forward technical progress while being in overall charge.Beyond that, can he provide a more stable environment and wiser race-team operational management, both of which were beyond Arrivabene?If he can, Ferrari could be formidable indeed - but how will they manage the relationship between the drivers?Drivers: With Daniel Ricciardo gone, Max Verstappen effectively formally takes on the role of team leader he had carved for himself by the force of his consistently superlative performances last year - once he stopped crashing in the first six races.But that does not necessarily mean the Dutchman will have it all his own way.Frenchman Pierre Gasly is Verstappen's new team-mate, and he looked very handy indeed with some of his starring performances in his debut season at Toro Rosso, most notably his brilliant fourth place in Bahrain.Verstappen and Ricciardo rubbed along pretty well for most of their three years together, despite a handful of on-track incidents.Gasly is a friendly but forceful character and while Ricciardo was already established as a winner by the time Verstappen joined him at the team, Gasly is out to carve a reputation.It is not hard to see tension developing between the Red Bull drivers if they are evenly matched. And Red Bull have not always handled such situations well - remember Vettel and Mark Webber?Team: All eyes on the Honda engine this year. Red Bull have great hopes of their new partnership, believing it will help them close the gap to Mercedes and Ferrari. But even they don't believe it is realistic to expect Honda to improve enough in 2019 to close the gap to the best engines.Can they make enough progress to enable Red Bull's chassis to do the rest and make it a three-way fight at the front?And if progress is less than expected, will Red Bull, fresh from a fractious relationship with Renault caused by their consistent public criticisms, be able to keep their mouths in check?Drivers: Daniel Ricciardo joins the factory Renault team amid a fanfare following his surprise decision to leave Red Bull.Renault hope that the recruitment of the Australian seven-time winner can help them move to another level as they seek to close on the big three.But first of all Ricciardo has to establish himself as team leader, which will not necessarily be an easy task with Nico Hulkenberg as his team-mate.The German is highly rated by Fernando Alonso, among others, and is unlikely to be a pushover. Not least because Ricciardo's arrival offers Hulkenberg a golden opportunity to prove he deserves to be classed among the elite, a ranking that has escaped him so far in a career that remarkably does not even include a podium finish.Team: When Renault returned as a constructor in 2016, their target was to be winning races within five years. Last season, though, progress slowed, and they will be under pressure to close on the top teams in 2019.This means improving both car - which was at least a second off the similarly powered Red Bull last year - and engine, where Renault were in danger of falling to fourth out of four in the pecking order by the end of last season.Insiders say progress has been made on the engine, but that Renault's realistic hope is to halve the gap between their power-unit and those of Mercedes and Ferrari.That would be something - but it's still not enough for a team whose pretensions of being title contenders by 2021 are in danger of collapsing.Drivers: A third season together for Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen, both of whom have challenges ahead.Grosjean came very close to his career going down the toilet after a series of errors in the first half of last year, only to rescue himself with some starring performances later on. Can the Franco-Swiss ever find a way to access his best stuff - which is of a very high quality - on a more consistent basis?Magnussen was overall the more convincing and consistent, but although he produced some very strong performances last year, the impression is that when Grosjean gets it all hooked up, the Dane can't quite live with him.Team: Last year was the best yet for this small team that continues to cause resentment from rivals through the closeness of their relationship with Ferrari.Haas say other teams could follow suit, in buying everything but aerodynamic surfaces and chassis from a bigger team, but the likes of Williams and McLaren say that's missing the point; F1 is not meant to be like that. That debate is not going away any time soon.With the caveats that situation creates, Haas have done an impressive job so far in F1. But they could have done better in 2018 and they know it.Their fundamental aim for 2019 is to maintain their competitive position - often best of the rest on pace last season - and cut out the inconsistency and mistakes to deliver their potential more often.Drivers: Two-time world champion Alonso has gone. And without him… what? The shadow of the brilliant Spaniard will hang heavy over McLaren in 2018, as they start what they hope will be the first season of a rebuilding programme that will return them to competitiveness by midway through the next decade.Alonso has been replaced by Carlos Sainz. He is a driver of considerable pace and potential but who has had a tendency to be a bit up and down so far in his career. And alongside him is British rookie Lando Norris, whose clearly abundant talent has created great expectations.The battle between the two of them is highly anticipated but a lot depends on the car.Team: McLaren might have spent 2013-17 in denial about how far they had fallen, but once it became clear last year, they have certainly not hesitated in doing something about it.Three senior figures are out, four new ones have been appointed - although new technical director James Key and new F1 managing director Andreas Seidl do not yet have start dates.At the start of a rebuilding process, the key this year is to show evidence they have improved. Last year, they had the second-worst car for much of the season and only Alonso's genius saved their blushes and secured a higher-than-deserved championship position.People both inside and outside McLaren will be looking for signs of progress from the lowest ebb in their once-illustrious history.Drivers: Lance Stroll's switch from Williams to the former Force India team, which is now owned by his father, the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, sets up one of the most interesting dynamics of the new season.Stroll Sr is very ambitious for his son, and ran into friction at Williams on occasions as a result. One example being when he demanded a new front wing was taken off Sergey Sirotkin's car in Hungary last year and given to Lance when Stroll had damaged his. The team refused, which led to a sizeable argument.Now Stroll owns a team, he can do what he likes if any such similar situation arises.Stroll Jr was outpaced by Felipe Massa in his debut season at Williams, and was out-qualified more often than not by rookie Sirotkin last year. How will he compare with Sergio Perez, an established and formidable driver, whose quality is known?If Perez is consistently quicker, how will Stroll Sr react? And if there is any attempt to favour the family connection, what will be the response from Perez - a determined character not afraid to speak his mind?These are fascinating questions heading into the team's first full season in its new guise.Team: Had it not been for their mid-season points reset after financial collapse, Force India would have finished fourth for the third consecutive season last year.Now under new ownership and better funded than for some time - perhaps ever - the team have ambitions of moving up the grid.That's not going to happen overnight, but it will be worth watching what happens now the grid's best pound-for-pound team is finally married to decent resources.Having said that, rich as Stroll is, his bank balance is no match for those of the massive global corporations his team would have to beat to move forward. So the challenge could be keeping expectations grounded in reality.Drivers: All change, with veteran Kimi Raikkonen, 40 this year, rejoining the team where his F1 career started, although they have just changed their name from Sauber to Alfa Romeo Racing.Alfa Romeo were Sauber's title sponsor in 2018.Partnered by Italian Ferrari protege Antonio Giovinazzi, Raikkonen will do the usual - consistent, reliable performances without setting the world on fire.The pressure is all on Giovinazzi, who looked set for a stellar career when he chased Gasly all the way to the Formula 2 title in 2016, despite being in his rookie year, but who developed a reputation for crashing in a handful of appearances for Sauber in 2017.Team: Sauber made giant strides in 2018, starting the season as the slowest team, ending it competing for best of the rest.The team benefited from decent resources for the first time in years, but it's also true that most of the impressive performances came from Leclerc.Can the team keep up the momentum now the Monegasque has left for Ferrari?Drivers: Russian Daniil Kvyat returns for a second chance at F1. He has been re-employed just over a year after being dumped by Red Bull, largely because their conveyor belt of young talent had a hole in it.Quick but inconsistent, Kvyat will be a decent yardstick for promising rookie Alexander Albon, who was born in Britain but races under a Thai passport, and is highly rated.Team: Toro Rosso lost technical director James Key at a crucial time last summer when he was poached by McLaren.In theory that might hurt them. In practice, they are quietly confident and are aiming for fifth place in the championship. But they always say that.As the second Red Bull team in a year when the factory outfit takes on Honda engines, they are likely to continue the role of guinea pigs they fulfilled as the Japanese company tested developments last year.Media playback is not supported on this deviceDrivers: One of the most tantalising partnerships of the season pitches Robert Kubica, returning after an eight-year absence following his life-changing rally crash in 2011, against British rookie George Russell.Kubica's comeback is a real feel-good story - the Pole, after a brutal rehabilitation period, finally getting a chance to continue a career that had looked destined for the very top. But questions remains as to the level at which he will he perform, with only partial use of his right arm.Russell, a Mercedes young driver, is one of the most promising youngsters in years.In the perceptions game, how will it play? If Kubica beats Russell, will Russell's reputation be damaged or will people think Kubica has returned close to or at his previous level? If Russell beats Kubica, will it be seen as inevitable, given the Pole's ""limitations"", as he describes his physical issues, or a great achievement? The same questions apply if they are closely matched.Team: Williams hit rock bottom in 2018, finishing last in the constructors' championship. The car wasn't great, to say the least, but an uninspiring driver line-up hardly helped.They hope to have addressed the driver issue, but what of the car? Unlike McLaren, there have been no obvious major changes in the team - other than the departure of performance director Rob Smedley, who is likely to pop up elsewhere by summer time.Williams really need to show signs of progress, if they are to allay concerns about their future."

"Media playback is not supported on this deviceSix races, six different winners, from six different teams.It has been a thrilling Formula E season and the European phase of the campaign begins on Saturday with the Rome E-Prix - you can follow live coverage on the BBC.Portugal's Antonio Felix da Costa holds a one-point championship lead over Belgium's Jerome D'Ambrosio.Reigning champion Jean-Eric Vergne is third after winning in Sanya, China, with Britain's Sam Bird in fourth spot.Bird, who was forced into an early retirement in China having gone into the race top of the standings, is hoping to repeat last year's race win in Italy.""Winning last year was such an amazing feeling, especially in front of such passionate motorsport fans,"" said the Englishman. ""Of course, it would be great to do the same again this year, but we'll just have to see.""The competition is seriously high this season with just 10 points currently separating the top six drivers, and all six races so far have seen a different winner, so it's really open.""As always, qualifying will be key, but if we can get this right and start from the front then we have the car and the team to deliver.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceYou can watch live coverage of the Rome E-Prix on the BBC Red Button, Connected TV, the BBC Sport website and BBC iPlayer from 14:30 BST on Saturday, 13 April, with a full replay of the race available on the BBC Red Button later on Saturday.Formula E has been to Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Chile, Mexico, Hong Kong and mainland China this season and the Rome E-Prix starts the European leg of the season, with forthcoming races in Paris, Monaco, Berlin and Bern before the season-ending double-header in New York.This will be the second race to take place in the Italian capital and the 2.87km track, which consists of 21 turns, is one of the longest of the season.The start/finish line is located on Via Cristoforo Colombo, with the cars racing around the Obelisco di Marconi, against the backdrop of the iconic Colosseo Quadrato.Media playback is not supported on this deviceCompared with Formula 1, Formula E is considerably more friendly to the environment.The sport was developed with sustainability in mind, with organisers saying the aim is to ""reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible"".It does this by powering its cars with a battery that uses 100% renewable fuel, and tyres that, as well as lasting an entire race, can also be recycled afterwards. Meanwhile, spectators are encouraged to use public transport to get to events, with no public parking available.One drawback with battery-powered cars had been that they lacked the capacity to last an entire race, resulting in the rather unusual (and somewhat gimmicky) sight of drivers having to swap cars mid-race.That will no longer happen - this season's Gen2 car is fitted with a battery that will last from start to finish of races.With the car manufacturing world looking to switch to developing almost exclusively electric cars within the next couple of decades, Formula E provides them with the ideal arena to test new technology at a competitive level.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSpectators play a key role in the action during Formula E races.'Fan Boost' has been a feature of the past few seasons, with viewers able to vote using an app to determine which driver gets some extra power during a race.New this season is 'Attack Mode', which gives competitors a speed boost after they drive through an allocated area on the track.Former Ferrari and Williams driver Felipe Massa, runner-up in the Formula 1 world championship in 2008, has signed a three-year contract to race for Monaco-based Venturi and is 15th overall after coming 10th in Sanya.It has been a struggle for Stoffel Vandoorne, Fernando Alonso's F1 team-mate at McLaren for the past two seasons, in his first year in Formula E as he has only collected three points from six races for the HWA Racelab team.Mahindra Racing's Pascal Wehrlein, who had two seasons in F1, is 10th overall after coming seventh in China. He led throughout the race in Mexico City, but in an incredible finish ran out of battery power in the final straight and was overtaken by Lucas di Grassi. Wehrlein was also handed a five-second penalty to drop him down to sixth.Tom Dillman (Fra, NIO Formula E Team), Maximilian Gunther (Ger, GEOX Dragon), Felipe Nasr (Bra, GEOX Dragon) and Felix Rosenqvist (Swe, Mahindra Racing) have all failed to score a point.15 December, 2018: Ad Diriyah, Saudi Arabia. 1.

sport	Formula 1: Sauber renamed Alfa Romeo Racing from start of 2019 season	Analysis	"Sauber will be rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing from the start of the 2019 season.Alfa Romeo was last on the Formula 1 grid as a constructor in 1985 but returned to the sport last season as Sauber's title sponsor.The Swiss team say the ownership and management structure remains unchanged but the Sauber name will disappear.Sauber has been a fixture in F1 since in 1993, when team boss Peter Sauber made the switch from sports car racing.Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, and Antonio Giovinazzi will race for the rebranded outfit, which finished eighth in the constructors' championship last season and will again be powered by Ferrari engines in 2019.Team principal Frederic Vasseur said: ""After initiating the collaboration with our title sponsor Alfa Romeo in 2018, our team made fantastic progress on the technical, commercial and sporting side. This has given a boost of motivation to each team member.""We aim to continue developing every sector of our team while allowing our passion for racing, technology and design to drive us forward.""The Italian car manufacturer dominated the early years of F1, with Giuseppe Farina winning the inaugural world title driving an Alfa in 1950, before Juan Manuel Fangio claimed the first of his five titles racing for the team a year later.Alfa will roll out their 2019 car on the first morning of pre-season testing, which gets under way in Barcelona on 18 February.Chief F1 writer - Andrew BensonThe renaming of the Sauber team as Alfa Romeo may on the one hand be a rebranding exercise for marketing purposes, but it is also a seminal moment in Formula 1 history.It marks the first time an F1 team will be solely named after the iconic Italian manufacturer since 1985 - and the first time the Sauber name will not be on the grid since 1993.Both entities have carved a unique place in motorsport history.Alfa Romeo were a major force in grand prix racing between the wars, spawned Ferrari and won the very first F1 world championship in 1950, even if their history in the sport has been somewhat less illustrious after they faded away in the mid-1950s.Sauber, for their part, first entered F1 as a proxy for Mercedes, with whom they had previously had a successful period in endurance racing.After Mercedes joined McLaren in 1995, Sauber went it alone, before joining forces with BMW from 2006-9, and then becoming independent again. They had just weathered a difficult financial period before heading back up the grid in 2018 after the Fiat Group made investment in the team following the decision for the cars to carry the name of its Alfa Romeo brand.Those links have just become stronger still, and they suggest the now-renamed Alfa Romeo team could continue the upward progress seen last year most obviously in the starring performances of Charles Leclerc, who is now at Ferrari.Politically, it is also an important move. It further enhances the team's status as a Ferrari B team - already evidenced by Leclerc's promotion and the presence of Italian Antonio Giovinazzi in the car this year alongside ex-Ferrari veteran Kimi Raikkonen.In addition to Ferrari's strong relationship with Haas, that increases the company's strength as negotiations over the sport's future beyond 2020 enter a critical phase this year."
sport	Andreas Seidl: McLaren Formula 1 team boss to begin role on 1 May	Why the new role for Seidl?

To have an opportunity to contribute to the McLaren legacy is extremely special and inspiring.""McLaren has the vision, leadership and experience but, most importantly, the people to return to the front, and that will be my absolute focus and mission.""McLaren decided they needed someone to take direct operational responsibility for the F1 team under Brown and the board of directors.That person will be Seidl, who is highly regarded for his work with Porsche in the World Endurance Championship.His appointment ensures that there is now a senior manager with oversight of and sole responsibility for the F1 team and no other distractions.Brown's role is not to run the F1 team on a day-to-day basis - as chief executive officer, he has authority over all of McLaren's racing activities, including the IndyCar programme set up for this season and a potential future entry into the World Endurance Championship.""Concentrated senior leadership on our F1 programme is an integral part of the long-term strategy of McLaren Racing to expand into other forms of global motorsport over time,"" Brown said.McLaren have won 12 drivers championships, with their last one coming with Lewis Hamilton in 2008, and they finished sixth in the constructors' championship in 2018 and ninth in 2017.Their drivers in 2019 are Spain's former Renault driver Carlos Sainz, 24, and British 19-year-old Lando Norris, competing in Formula 1 for the first season.The first race of 2019 is in Australia on 17 March and there will also be races held in Bahrain, China and Azerbaijan before Seidl begins his role."
sport	Formula 1: Williams launch new colour scheme as team rebrands for 2019 season		"Frank Williams likes the paint job on his Formula 1 team's new cars - which is fortunate for daughter and deputy team principal Claire, who says she would have been fired if he hadn't.Williams have switched from their traditional navy-and-white colour scheme to sky blue and white for 2019.It is one part of a new era for a team without a grand prix win since 2012.""Frank loved it, and you might be surprised to hear that,"" Claire said. ""I was a little nervous presenting it.""The British outfit, founded by Frank more than 40 years ago, have won a combined 16 driver and team titles but finished bottom in the constructors' championship last season.Williams' new title partner, telecommunications company ROKiT, is expected to add substantial investment to a team that will begin the season with British rookie George Russell alongside Robert Kubica, who is back on the grid for the first time after a crash eight years ago.""We are telling the world a very clear story and clear message as to where we are as a company,"" added Claire, who said moving away from the team's traditional colours shows they are a ""fresh, revitalised brand"".""Frank is very protective of the traditional navy blue and white, but also understanding of the arguments behind the change.""He is fully behind it. I am still here, and if he didn't like it, he would have fired me.""Reigning Formula 2 champion Russell makes the step up to F1 with Williams this season after a year as Lewis Hamilton's understudy at Mercedes.""It is important to try and build a great relationship with the team and show what I can do on track as well as behind the scenes,"" said the Englishman, who turns 21 on Friday.""The help I have had from Mercedes and Lewis has been mainly listening and learning.""Lewis goes out there to work on every aspect and really build that team around him, which is why he and Mercedes are so strong. That is what I want to do here."""

sport	Formula 1: Kimi Raikkonen's world is a very different place	Loved for being bored. And impatientIce creams and military serviceA man of few words. Very fewBorn with a spanner, not a silver spoonSlow speaker, quick starterLegendary status	"The private area of Singapore's main airport often caters for celebrities and the wealthy, preparing for security checks - just one more easy step before boarding their private jets.It is usually light work for the security staff. But not during one particular evening in 2008.A man places his bags on the conveyor belt. As everyone else expects him to walk through the scanner, he sees his belongings just about to disappear and has a brilliant idea. He jumps onto the moving conveyor belt himself. Panicked and raging security staff are brought to life by the unusual turn of events, expecting to apprehend a maniac.Instead they turn him over and are faced with Formula 1 driver Kimi Raikkonen, curious that the scanning equipment would give him ""an image of the precise details of his body, and his bone structure in particular"".The Singapore staff ""suggest leg irons and a tough interrogation instead"".During a lengthy career spanning the eras of Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton, he may not stand out for the greatest race results. But there is far more to the Iceman beyond his cold persona.He has been called the 'least bothered man in sport', but his move to Sauber for 2019 confirms his enthusiasm for racing is very much alive.So why is a man of so few words such an icon in F1?There are many reasons why Kimi Raikkonen is both loved, and often loathed. His detractors point to an indifference to anything outside his own world, and below-par results in the Ferrari. However, he does possess something many modern sportspeople lack: character.Those who dislike him can't deny his on-track shenanigans are amusing: he moans to his race engineers like a teenager when they remind of his tasks: ""Yes yes yes yes, I'm doing the tyres, you don't have to remind me every second.""He often gets confused about who is in front of him on track. When the championship is at stake, he's not sure who has won it. There have been times when, following a heavy crash, he has stepped out of a wreck of a car with so little emotion, it is as if he's just parked up at Tesco.And when there is animation, things get even more unbelievable, as evidenced during a hectic restart during this year's Azerbaijan Grand Prix: ""Gloves and steering wheel, someone tell him to give them to me. Gloves and steering wheel! COME ON!""Then there is the serious drama: He broke a Ferrari mechanic's leg during a pit-stop in Bahrain this year. In an extraordinary race, it was a moment that left us with our hands on our heads, and jaws on the floor.It could only be Kimi.In Malaysia in 2009, the cars were on the grid during a mid-race postponement following a torrential downpour. Raikkonen had waited long enough for the restart, deciding to leave his car, and the waiting grid, to get an ice cream and a drink before disappearing into the Ferrari motorhome - to the astonishment of the other drivers, his strict paymasters and the millions watching.His antics were even more outlandish away from the circuit; mischief has always followed Raikkonen around. During his time in the army in his youth, he broke the record for the longest time in confinement - about 20 days.He was allowed special dispensation to leave on race weekends, but following one particular win, it got boozy, and he and his friend were late returning to the barracks.Moments before attempting to climb over the fence in the darkness, they were spotted by military policemen. While his friend was thrown in the van and taken for questioning, Raikkonen jumped into a ditch. He then outran the security dogs, across fields and eventually flopped into his bed - drunk and covered in grass - and pretended to be asleep.When later questioned about his evasive action he replied: ""That's exactly what you teach us here; we're scouts after all.""British driver Jenson Button once said of Raikkonen: ""He's a man of a few words, but he's all about the racing.""Quite literally: he didn't speak until he was three. His concerned parents took him to a specialist to see what the problem was... the diagnosis? His intellectual test results were higher than was average for his age. He just didn't want to talk.Thirty-six years later, nothing has changed - he still doesn't want to talk, but it could be argued he lets the racing speak for him with his consistent podium appearances over the years.As somebody who only removes his sunglasses to shower, it's no surprise he's the only driver in history to cause yet more controversy by wearing them on the podium while standing for the national anthems.The Raikkonens weren't blessed with wealth, despite being immersed in the motorsport world. 'The Unknown Kimi Raikkonen' - a book detailing his personal life - describes his family as ""petrol heads, who inhaled the same stinking air… their hands were covered in oil, and they lived from hand to mouth, or to be more precise, from hand to petrol tank"".Matti, Raikkonen's father, was a rallying mechanic who drove stock cars, while his brother Rami is also an engineer. Raikkonen didn't finish the mechanics course.The family were well known in motorsport, yet finding funding was not easy. As Raikkonen's mother Paula said: ""We needed more and more money all the time, but it still wasn't enough,"" the family often relying on leases from friends.Away from driving, Raikkonen's enthusiasm for life usually involves something with an engine, but not necessarily four wheels. He's been known to drive in motorcross, rallying, and he founded IceOne Racing - a team who compete in the World Rally Championship - as well as Raikkonen Robertson Racing in Formula 3.The Finn's entry into F1 was quick, but not smooth. He had driven only 23 car races when he was granted a superlicence, having spent his youth in karting.Raikkonen took a step up from karting when landing a contract in England in Formula Renault in 1999. There were problems, though: He could not speak English and he had never driven a formula car before.Knowing he should, he borrowed one from a Finnish racing team at Alastaro circuit. Shortly after, there was a new track record.His reputation spread, and in 2001 came his first F1 test with Sauber. Team boss Peter Sauber knew he wanted to sign this young talent. Raikkonen needed that F1 superlicence, though, in order to be able to drive in the sport. He did not have one, nor enough points to get one.With help from his friends, Raikkonen wrote to the FIA in English, arguing why he should be granted one. Max Mosley, then the FIA president, was the only member of the judging committee to vote against it. The Finn was in.His career eventually gave him 21 race wins and a world title in 2007 - making it a laudable decision for the FIA board of decision makers.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Raikkonen seems disinterested in winning another championship. When asked this year if the champagne tasted sweeter 113 races and five years since his last victory, he replied typically: ""It's the same champagne in second and third...""It takes less effort to get a mere podium after all, meaning less of a spotlight at the FIA end of season awards, or at least it does if one doesn't turn up on stage drunk.Lewis Hamilton says when he was younger, he played F1 on the PlayStation and he would always be Raikkonen in his car.""I always dreamed of racing against him,"" Hamilton said. ""It's crazy how you get to work with some of these legends. I don't know whether they realise the respect the younger generation in F1 have for them.""For every Raikkonen fan, there are those who dislike him. But Formula 1 fans cannot deny there's something different about him, especially as he's now the oldest on the grid after 18 years in the sport.He rose to F1 with his passion for speed and talent in a car. It wasn't for fame, money, or the lavish lifestyle.Those in his close circle say that what you see, is what you get, that Raikkonen has no hidden agenda. They add that he's loyal to those who are important to him, and family means everything.""Kimi has got a big heart. He watches and listens; he doesn't speak immediately… Then when he comes out with a statement, it's often something considered.""Over to the man himself, then… ""I'm not interested in what people think about me. I'm not Michael Schumacher.""Quite, but what he lacks in words, the Iceman more than makes up for in intrigue and cold, hard racing.Which is just as well, because if you ask him about his grand plans for the rest of his life beyond Formula 1...""I'll get a dog."""
sport	Formula 1 2019: A new era for the sport on television as well as on track	What will the free-to-air package look like?The Sky offeringWhat does this mean for F1 and UK audiences?	"Formula 1's relationship with the British public undergoes a huge shift this year.For the first time in more than 40 years, audiences in the UK will not be able to watch regular live coverage of the F1 season as part of their basic television package.The only race available to watch live on free-to-air television - requiring only a licence fee - will be the British Grand Prix.Britain's five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton said during pre-season testing that this development was ""definitely not cool"", as he recalled settling down to watch grands prix live as a child.It is the result of a new contract between F1 and pay-television company Sky, which was signed by former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone before the sport was sold to Liberty Media.This contract runs from 2019 to 2024 and it hands Sky the exclusive broadcast rights to F1 in the UK.The deal contains a requirement that the British Grand Prix and extended highlights of the remaining races must be on free-to-air television. But it is for Sky to decide where, as long as the outlet satisfies the contractual requirement for ""90% technical availability"". This basically means it has to be a channel on Freeview/Freesat.For 2019, Sky has opted to do a deal with Channel 4, which from 2016 took over the former BBC contract to show about half the races live and the others as highlights. No decision has been made on 2020 onwards.Channel 4 last year had 65.7% of the total audience watching F1 in the UK, according to the sport's official figures. It says its average audience for live race coverage - lights to flag - was 2.9m. For the entire live race programme, the average was 2.5m.It is aiming to keep its programming as recognisable and distinctive as possible, despite the loss of live race coverage.The on-air line-up remains pretty much the same. The most high-profile figures - presenter Steve Jones, analysts David Coulthard and Mark Webber, and commentator Ben Edwards - are still on board.The only on-air personnel to leave are former racing drivers Karun Chandhok and Susie Wolff. Chandhok has moved to Sky, while Wolff is concentrating on her business interests, including running the Venturi Formula E team. It has added Billy Monger, the 19-year-old British racing driver who lost his legs in a crash in 2017.And Stefano Domenicali - Ferrari team principal from 2008-2014 and now chief executive of Lamborghini - will be a pundit for an unspecified number of races.Sky has imposed a series of restrictions on C4 in the contract for the highlights races, which will affect both the race coverage itself, and what happens around it.For example, only 50% of the total running time of C4's programme can now be taken up by the on-track coverage - down from between 60-70% last year. They are not allowed to do interviews in what is known as the 'pen' - where all the drivers are taken to do a round-robin of broadcasters after qualifying and race - or in the pit lane. Any 'pen' interviews they use will have to come from Sky. The amount of interviews C4 can do in the paddock is restricted. And they have been forbidden from doing a 'grid walk'.None of these restrictions apply to the live British Grand Prix.In addition, the highlights programmes can now not start until a minimum of three hours after the race, although this could be a blessing in disguise as it pushes them into evening prime time, when audiences are potentially bigger.C4 intends for its programme to retain its broad appeal. Like the BBC before, it has always aimed to produce something that can be enjoyed by both the less-committed casual audience and hardcore fans.Sky wants to set itself up as the go-to place for F1 in the UK.Last year, it had 34.3% of the total UK F1 audience, and the number of people watching its live coverage grew by 21.9% over 2017.Its average audience for its live race programme was 707,000, according to official F1 figures, which measure across the broadcast, so will come up lower than just the race action itself. There have been peaks over 1m on occasions. Sky would not provide exact figures.Its presenting team remains pretty much as was, other than the addition of 2009 world champion Jenson Button, for some races, and Chandhok for the vast majority.The Sky deal is worth a reputed £1.2bn to F1 over its duration. That means income from Sky UK alone amounts to about 11% of F1's turnover and Sky has effectively become the sport's biggest single sponsor.Insiders expect Sky's vast investment to buy it some freedom from the restrictions imposed on broadcasters in their contracts. Sources say it is planning a studio in the paddock at the European races, for example, although Sky would not confirm this. F1 chief executive Chase Carey, incidentally, is on the board of Sky UK.Sky would not share its plans for where it will broadcast F1 other than its dedicated channel, but it will show the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - and quite possibly each of the first three races - on Sky One, which increases the audience.As for the future of the free-to-air aspect of the deal, Sky is said to remain open-minded. It has two options - strike another deal with a major free-to-air channel such as C4, or put it on one of its own channels on Freeview, the most high-profile being Pick.Sky is expected to trial a bunch of races on Pick as a tester this year, but as long as C4 sticks to the terms of its contract and works with Sky rather than against it, Sky is said to be not opposed at this stage to that relationship continuing into 2020.The risk for F1 in this new arrangement is that UK audiences drop substantially.No matter what Sky does with its programming, it would be highly unlikely, based on past evidence, to get close to replacing all the free-to-air audience. If Sky achieved another 21.9% growth in live audience, it would rise to 862,000. That would be a drop of more than 58% from 2018 to 2019.Not many sports have thrived in terms of audience and public engagement when they go solely to pay TV.Football continues to generate massive interest despite the Premier League being shown live only on pay TV, with highlights on free-to-air, via Match of the Day.But football is the exception to the general rule.Liberty has always emphasised that it sees the future of broadcasting in F1 as a combination between free-to-air, pay TV and what it calls OTT, or direct-to-consumer over the internet.In other countries, F1 is already running an OTT platform. But this is not possible in the UK because the Sky contract forbids it. The earliest the UK can have F1 TV, as it is known, is 2025.But OTT will not appeal to everyone, and it remains unclear whether it will attract casual audiences.It is another form of pay TV. It requires the audience to know about it and go and seek it out. And there are questions over the level of appeal when a sport provides its own editorial content, with the inevitable impact on the independence of the coverage.The risks of sports going pay TV only are well established: many people simply won't be prepared to pay the money to watch; and it limits the chances of a casual audience finding it.Social media has made an impact in terms of broadening the number of ways people might come across F1 - and in keeping gross audience figures high. But even if seeing content clips on the internet piques people's interest, the barriers to watching extensive amounts of F1, and thereby creating new and committed fans, remain if the sport is solely on pay TV.Lower viewing figures also make it harder for teams to sell themselves to potential sponsors - already a difficult task in the current global financial climate. And fewer people watching reduces the appeal of F1 to major participants such as Mercedes, Ferrari, Renault, Honda and Red Bull, who are in it for the global exposure it gives their brands.A reduced audience has other potential knock-on effects. A smaller audience means less interest and potentially declining participation levels. Which could restrict the number of aspiring racing drivers, engineers, mechanics and so on in a country that has been the epicentre of F1 for decades.F1 is taking a step into the unknown. The sport will make more money as a result, but the effects on its long-term health in the UK remain to be seen.All times GMT and are subject to change at short notice."
sport	McLaren have 'cautious optimism' for 'important' 2019 in Formula 1	Will the Renault engine improve?What about drivers now Alonso has gone?Will Alonso be involved at all?	"McLaren say 2019 is an ""important year"" as they seek a route back to competitiveness following one of the worst seasons in their history.Chief executive Zak Brown said: ""There is a lot of cautious optimism but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.""We've done that before and we're not going to make the same mistake twice.""McLaren expected to challenge for podiums in 2018 but instead found themselves with the second worst car on the grid for much of the season.That led to a major restructuring programme, the departure of several senior figures and the arrival of a number of new ones as the team sought to resolve the problems that had led to producing such an uncompetitive car.McLaren have historically been one of the strongest teams in Formula 1, winning 12 drivers' championships and eight constructors' championships between 1974 and 2008. However, their last race win was in 2012.""Development is going well. We're kind of on-track with what we are wanting to achieve,"" said Brown.""We have no idea where the competition is other than speculation. I don't think we will know until we get to [pre-season testing in February in] Barcelona but we are pleased with the progress we have made.""We have done things differently. Everyone is working well together so it feels like a more quiet confidence but we're on our toes. we know this is an important year for us to show progress and that comes with some exciting nervous energy.""We know we are not going to get there overnight. It is going to feel good before it looks good, because there is a lag in what we do today doesn't hit the track tomorrow.""Brown said engine partner Renault, which lagged some way behind the standard-setting power-units of Mercedes and Ferrari, was optimistic it had improved.""They are telling us that they are very pleased with their winter progress,"" he said. ""That they have found a lot of kilowatts, and think that they will be in the ballpark.""I don't think it's appropriate for me to quote the numbers they have given us but they feel they are going to be very competitive next year.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceMcLaren have an entirely new driver line-up next year following the retirement of two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who scored 80% of their points in 2018, and their decision not to continue with Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne.Spaniard Carlos Sainz has been signed from Renault and his team-mate will be British novice Lando Norris, who was McLaren's reserve driver in 2018 and in whom the team have great hopes.Brown said he had been impressed with a ""very aggressive"" Sainz so far.""He is very engaged with the engineering team,"" added Brown.""He wants to know. He spends time on the phone, with me, with the engineers. He's had a lot of off-season conversations with Fernando so he's very engaged and I think he's very excited and he's fully up for joining us on our road to recovery.""He is under no illusions that next year is going to be a tough year.""Alonso maintains a relationship with McLaren, who are setting up a team for him to have a second assault on the Indianapolis 500 in 2019.There is a tentative plan for the 37-year-old to test the new McLaren at some point but nothing definitive yet.""He is for sure going to watch our progress with interest because he is still part of the family,"" said Brown. ""We have spoken about testing and it is something were are going to talk about further over the winter.""We need to look at our entire programme. Certainly having his experience in the car would be a great thing but we need to make sure our two new drivers get sufficient time because they are going to be our race drivers next year, so it is an ongoing conversation."""
sport	Who will be racing in Formula 1 in 2019?		
sport	Formula 1 reveals 2021 car concepts		"Formula 1 has revealed plans to improve the quality of racing with a new car design to be introduced in 2021.F1 sporting boss Ross Brawn said the main purpose was ""to produce cars that are more raceable"".""I'm pretty optimistic we are going to produce some great looking cars and the are going to be able to race more closely than in the past,"" he said.Brawn said changes to the aerodynamics would mean cars were able to follow each other much more closely than now.F1 has been working on a new car design for about a year, the 63-year-old former Mercedes and Brawn team boss said, collaborating with governing body the FIA and the teams on alleviating the problem whereby a car behind another loses a significant amount of its performance.Brawn showed three different concept designs at the Singapore Grand Prix on Friday and said the new cars in 2021 would have features from all of them.The designs had leaked a day earlier after he showed them to a group of young people interested in getting involved in engineering.""Rather naively I put up this image on the screen and all the phones came out and that was it,"" he said.Brawn said the central aim of the new rules was to ensure drivers could follow other cars more closely.""The primary thing we're doing is trying to reduce the amount of performance lost to a following car,"" Brawn said.""It is like a force field. You can't get near it, because as soon as you do you lose performance and fall back, and you see people dropping back and the loss of performance degrades the tyres more than it should do.""We can't eliminate that completely but we can reduce it, so the time differential for one car to attack another can be much less.""With the current cars, when they get to within two to three car lengths, they can lose 50% of performance, the tyres degrade more and it becomes very challenging. At the moment we have (new) designs that only lose 20% - maintain 80%.""The designs have a strong family resemblance to current cars, but feature farings near the wheels to clean up the airflow.Brawn would not give further details of the aerodynamic concepts involved in reducing the effect of the wake of one car impeding the performance of one behind.He said the aim was for the FIA to produce a set of regulations by the end of next year, to ensure all teams had enough time to work on their new designs.Next year's cars will feature changes to the front wings that came out of the 2021 research.""In doing this project, we recognised there are some features that benefits come from the nature of the flow that comes off the car in front and the sensitivity of the car behind to that,"" Brawn said."" Next year is an important barometer to see how much impact it has on the ability for the cars to follow.""He said next year's cars would probably be a little slower than this year's as a result and added that the same would be true of the 2021 cars because there was a risk if development was allowed to continue the cars would become dangerously fast.""The cars are pretty impressive now but if they continue to develop at the rate they're developing there will be a need to pull it back,"" he said.Brawn added that no final decision had been made on the future of the controversial DRS overtaking aid."

""To have an opportunity to contribute to the McLaren legacy is extremely special and inspiring.""McLaren has the vision, leadership and experience but, most importantly, the people to return to the front, and that will be my absolute focus and mission.""McLaren decided that they needed someone to take direct operational responsibility for the F1 team under Brown and the board of directors.That person will be Seidl, who is highly regarded for his work with Porsche in the World Endurance Championship.His appointment ensures that there is now a senior manager with oversight of and sole responsibility for the F1 team and no other distractions.Brown's role is not to run the F1 team on a day-to-day basis - as chief executive officer, he has authority over all of McLaren's racing activities, including the IndyCar programme set up for this season and a potential future entry into the World Endurance Championship.""Concentrated senior leadership on our F1 programme is an integral part of the long-term strategy of McLaren Racing to expand into other forms of global motorsport over time,"" Brown said.Seidl is the fourth new management appointment since July, with three top-level figures having left as a consequence of McLaren's poor performance last season.Chief technical officer Tim Goss was removed from his position in April, followed by the resignation of engineering director Matt Morris in July. That left only head of aerodynamics Peter Prodromou still in situ of three men who had headed McLaren's design department at the start of the season.McLaren have re-signed Pat Fry - who left them to join Ferrari in 2010 before being fired at the end of 2014 - as engineering director and have appointed James Key as technical director.Key will start work for McLaren this year, probably in the spring or early summer, once he has finished his 'gardening leave' from former employers Toro Rosso.On the operational side, racing director Eric Boullier resigned in July and former IndyCar driver Gil De Ferran was simultaneously appointed sporting director.McLaren switched from Honda engines to Renault for 2018. They believed the Japanese power unit was holding them back and expected to be close to fellow Renault users Red Bull on performance last season.Instead, McLaren had the second slowest car on average. It was two seconds a lap slower than the Red Bull.The team finished sixth of 10 teams in the constructors' championship, but 80% of their points were scored by two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who left F1 at the end of 2018 and will race for the newly established McLaren team at the Indianapolis 500 this May.Alonso has been replaced by fellow Spaniard and former Toro Rosso and Renault driver Carlos Sainz, whose team-mate will be British rookie Lando Norris.De Ferran's role will expand to take in the IndyCar programme and, potentially in the future, a world sportscar entry.The 51-year-old is effectively to be Brown's right-hand man across all McLaren's motorsport activities - he is essentially an internal management consultant, floating across all aspects of McLaren's racing operations and offering advice and insight.The Brazilian will remain heavily involved in F1, but is also likely to be part of Alonso's bid to win the Indy 500, where the Spaniard is bidding to become only the second man in history to win motorsport's unofficial 'triple crown'.This is to win Indy, the Le Mans 24 Hours and the Monaco Grand Prix, although some regard the F1 aspect of it as the world championship.De Ferran, who won the Indy 500 in 2001, and was twice a champion of the related Champ Car series, acted as Alonso's driver coach at Indy in 2017, when the Spaniard led 24 laps and was contending for victory when his engine failed in the closing stages.In addition, De Ferran has run his own team in endurance racing in the US in the past."

sport	Formula 1: Mercedes' Toto Wolff says 2018 was 'most challenging season'		"Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said 2018 was his team's ""most challenging season"" after picking up a fifth consecutive Formula 1 constructors' championship trophy.Briton Lewis Hamilton was also awarded his fifth drivers' championship trophy at a gala in St Petersburg, Russia, staged by governing body the FIA.""We all had to raise our game, each and every member of our team,"" Wolff said.""Winning both titles is a testament to the incredibly hard work of the team.""Mercedes won 11 of the 21 races in a season that also included 13 pole positions and 26 podium finishes, while Hamilton became the joint second most successful driver of all time.Hamilton joined Argentine legend Juan Manuel Fangio on five championship wins, behind Michael Schumacher who won seven titles.But Hamilton - and Mercedes - had to fend off a strong challenge from Ferrari, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen eventually finishing second and third in the drivers' championship.""I feel honoured to receive this trophy on behalf of everyone in Brixworth, Brackley and Stuttgart who helped to win these championships,"" Wolff added.Elsewhere, Britain's George Russell was awarded the FIA Formula 2 drivers' championship trophy after securing the title in Abu Dhabi in late November, while Germany's Mick Schumacher was awarded the Formula 3 European drivers' championship trophy."
sport	Renault appoint Thierry Koskas as head of Formula 1 programme		"Renault have appointed Thierry Koskas as the head of their Formula 1 programme.Frenchman Koskas will replace Renault Sport president Jerome Stoll on 1 January, as the team seeks to close the gap on Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull.Koskas will report directly to Renault chairman Carlos Ghosn and oversee managing director Cyril Abiteboul.Renault say their target is to ensure the team can ""race with the best and contest the title"" by 2021.Koskas' appointment comes at a time when many senior figures in F1 believe Renault face existential questions about their participation in the sport.They are currently spending about 60-70% of the budgets of world champions Mercedes and their closest competitors Ferrari and Red Bull.And while Renault will finish the 2019 season best of the rest in fourth place, their car has been on average nearly 1.7 seconds a lap off the pace, and at times has been lapped by the Red Bulls, which this year use the same Renault engine as the factory team.Ghosn was initially sold on the idea of Renault owning their own team again on the basis of spending no more money than their current budget.F1 bosses are in the midst of talks with the teams aimed at introducing cost control and a budget cap, but that is unlikely to be in operation on any significant level in time for 2021.Renault could therefore face the difficult choice of either accepting they are unlikely to catch the top three teams at their current level of spending, increasing their budget to a level they did not initially want to, or waiting for the cost-control measures to kick in and accepting that they might take longer to achieve their targets."
sport	Formula E: Five reasons to become obsessed with the all-electric series	The 'Gen2' cars look like the BatmobileThere are some familiar faces in the driver seatsYou can affect the race from the comfort of your own sofaIt's as close to real life Mario Kart as you can getIt is constantly improvingFormula E calendar 2018-19	"Traditional ""petrolheads"" may have a thing or two to say, but the legend that is Sir David Attenborough has spoken.""The collapse of civilisation is on the horizon unless we act now,"" said the naturalist at the UN climate summit earlier this month.How can sport adapt to play its part in saving the planet? Well, motorsport is arguably taking some action.Back in 2014, Alejandro Agag, former chairman of Championship football club Queens Park Rangers, decided all-electric single-seater racing was what the world needed.And so, Formula E was born.Now, five seasons later, the new, much-upgraded second generation of cars is ready to race.The BBC will be showing every ePrix live on BBC Red Button, Connected TV, BBC Sport website, mobile app and the iPlayer.The opening race of 2018-19 season takes place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Saturday and is live from 12:00 GMT.While the sport is very open and honest about not trying to REPLACE Formula 1 at the forefront of motorsport (and for millions, it never will anyway), it is worth your attention, and here are a few reasons why.No, really. Look at them.This second incarnation of the Formula E car was launched in January 2018 and first tested in the public eye by 2016 F1 world champion Nico Rosberg at the Tempelhofer in Berlin.During the test, Rosberg repeatedly sounded surprised at just how much power the car was giving him, saying over team radio it had ""awesome acceleration"".But does the new car sound like the Batmobile?No - they still sound like a one-litre Corsa going 120mph in reverse.An important difference between F1 and Formula E is that all 11 teams involved use the same power source (battery), creating a more competitive environment than its petrol-based cousin.They all have access to the same top speeds of about 174mph (280kph), but with some twists - we will come to those later.A little over a year after his F1 retirement, Felipe Massa is back on the track and applying his 15 years of experience at the top level to another format.The Brazilian has signed a three-year deal for Venturi racing - the Hollywood team with a Hollywood part owner in Leonardo DiCaprio.The team also has the added benefit of former Williams test driver Susie Wolff being their team principal.Stoffel Vandoorne, who has driven for McLaren in F1 for the past two seasons, also joins the line up with new team HWA Racelab.There are five Britons in the driver line-up this season, with Alexander Sims (BMWi Andretti Motorsport), Sam Bird (Envision Virgin Racing), Oliver Turvey (NIO Formula E), Oliver Rowland (Nissan E.Dams) and veteran driver Gary Paffett (HWA Racelab) all on the grid.And here's how you can try and help your favourite driver win...Have you ever jumped off your seat while watching the Grand National, yelling at your horse, willing it to go faster?Well, imagine exactly that with Formula E cars, but it actually helping your favourite driver.You don't have to scream at the TV, but you can grab your phone and send your favourite driver a power boost.Here's how it works - five drivers per race receive a 'Fanboost' burst of power, which they can deploy in a five-second window during the second half of the race.It's up to viewers around the world to decide who will get the extra oomph to carry them a little further during the race.OK so there are no banana skins to slip up on, but there are ""go faster stars"" to help drivers who need a bit of extra power.They aren't actual stars, but during certain points of a race, drivers will be able to pick up an extra hit of power at their own risk when they drive over a certain part of the track.The new power mode gives an extra 25kW of power, the equivalent of an extra 33 brake horsepower on an F1 car (or 0.5 seconds per lap).This is hopefully going to make for some incredible passing manoeuvres and every time it is activated, the LED lights on the safety halo flash blue.Bring on a night race.They still sound like travel hairdryers, but don't let that fool you.The technology these cars use has improved vastly over the five short years since its creation.In previous seasons, the battery life of the car was only enough to reach the halfway point of a race, but in the second generation of Formula E car, it lasts the full race.It brings an end to the clunky mid-race car swap where a driver would jump out of the car in the pit and jump into an second vehicle.Most fans are delighted with this improvement in technology, others are sad to say goodbye to the often comical leap across a pit garage.It's a powerful battery too - the round-about equivalent of 20,000 AA batteries in each car stacked end to end.What's more is the races only take place on street circuits, meaning the excitement levels are huge.15 December 2018: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia12 January 2019: Marrakech, Morocco26 January 2019: Santiago, Chile16 February 2019: Mexico City10 March 2019: Hong Kong23 March 2019: Sanya, China13 April 2019: Rome, Italy27 April 2019: Paris, France11 May 2019: Monaco25 May 2019: Berlin, Germany22 June 2019: Bern, Switzerland13 and 14 July 2019: New York, USAMedia playback is not supported on this device"
sport	Formula 1 drivers welcome Pirelli contract to make tyres more raceable	We support Pirelli - Mercedes boss Wolff	"Formula 1 drivers have welcomed a new tyre supply contract for Pirelli as a chance to make the tyres more raceable.The Italian company's deal, which runs until 2023, comes amid pressure from drivers for less sensitive tyres that allow them to push harder in races.Drivers manage tyres carefully, taking seconds off their potential pace to keep temperatures under control.Pirelli partially addressed this in 2017, only for the issue to return this year.Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) chairman Alexander Wurz told BBC Sport: ""Now we know Pirelli will remain as our partner, I welcome their efforts to co-operate more intensely with the drivers to tune their product for higher track performance.""The 44-year-old Austrian, who raced for Benetton, Williams and McLaren in a career that spanned a decade, said Pirelli had met the GPDA in the drivers' briefing at the Brazilian Grand Prix earlier this month and promised it would address the issue.The drivers' campaign is a renewed effort after a similar push over the winter of 2015-16. That extracted a promise from Pirelli to produce more robust tyres which could be pushed harder for an entire race stint and which recovered their performance if they overheated when following another car closely.Pirelli has been trying to produce such tyres, but earlier this year their motorsport boss Mario Isola said it was a challenge in the context of a parallel request from F1 for softer tyres that the sport's bosses hoped would lead to more pit stops.""We know their request is to have softer tyres they can push - but it's not so easy,"" Isola told BBC Sport at the Monaco Grand Prix in May. ""It is a real challenge to make tyres soft with thermal degradation and no overheating.""The softer tyres this year have not increased the number of pit stops.Instead, drivers are lapping more slowly in an attempt to make one-stop races work, because this leads to a better overall race time than lapping more quickly and doing more stops.This is because of the difficulty of overtaking, which is partly due to aerodynamics but also because of the tyres' tendency to overheat within not much more than a lap when following another car closely enough to try to pass.Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has said the way the tyres behave was ""completely the wrong direction"" for F1.""We have expressed our support for Pirelli because we know it is a difficult task to manage,"" he said. ""But in past years we have simply asked the wrong things from them.""By making the compounds softer and softer and softer, trying to trigger degradation and therefore more pit stops, the strategists have come up with the [solution that the] fastest race time is about managing those tyres and trying to achieve a one-one-stop or a two-stop.""Completely the wrong direction. We need robust tyres, which Pirelli is perfectly able to produce.""They just need to be given the right objectives and then the drivers can push the tyre harder, they can stay in the wake of the car in front, and we are not seeing the blistering or deg that causes these seven seconds [of lap time offset] you've mentioned.""Pirelli's new deal includes a commitment to switch in 2021 from 13-inch to 18-inch wheels, which will require lower-profile tyres that are more in line with those used on road cars.It will extend Pirelli's relationship with F1 to at least 13 seasons, following their return in 2011."
sport	Formula 1: Lewis Hamilton and other peerless performances	Lewis Hamilton's storming victory (Silverstone, 2008)Ayrton Senna's qualifying lap (Monaco, 1988)Juan Manuel Fangio's comeback (German Grand Prix, 1957)Sir Jackie Stewart's marvellous 'rain race' (German Grand Prix, 1968)Michael Schumacher's masterclass (Spanish Grand Prix, 1996)	"""All of a sudden, this lap out of nowhere was just flowing, beautiful,"" said Lewis Hamilton. ""It was like a dance.""He knew he had produced one of modern Formula 1's great moments with his qualifying lap in Singapore last Saturday. A race victory followed; it appears that this year's drivers' championship could well, too.It was one of those moments when a driver shows that extra 1% to lift him above all rivals. Those moments do not come along too often in F1; when they do, they are worth celebrating.BBC Sport has looked through the archives and dug out five other moments when a driver proved themselves on a different plane to the rest.The 2008 British Grand Prix was held in conditions more suitable for the Boat Race; heavy rain in the morning had left water on the track.Lewis Hamilton responded with a masterful drive for the first of his five career Silverstone wins - finishing a staggering 68 seconds clear of nearest challenger Nick Heidfeld and making a major statement of intent on the way to his first drivers' title.His race could have ended in the opening seconds. Starting in fourth, Hamilton jostled with team-mate Heikki Kovalainen at Copse corner, slid wide as the spray flew into the drivers' faces and touched the other McLaren at high speed. But they both recovered and sped away.At times, the conditions were almost impossible, particularly when heavy rain came down during the second half of the race. Hamilton said afterwards that there were moments he could not see through his visor, having to clean it during the first two turns of each lap.""It's definitely and by far the best victory I've ever had,"" said the Briton immediately after the race. Ten years later, it probably still is.It seems unimaginable now, but one of the greatest laps ever driven in a Formula 1 car was not captured on television at all.Perhaps that has added to the mystique of the late, great Ayrton Senna's qualifying lap at Monaco in 1988; we have to rely on eyewitness accounts to piece it together.The dry facts: Senna out-qualified McLaren team-mate Alain Prost by an astonishing 1.4 seconds to take pole position.It's the telling of the story, though, that gives it the added romance. Senna suggested in an interview with Canadian journalist Gerald Donaldson that during the lap, ""I was no longer driving the car consciously"" and that ""I was kind of driving it by instinct, only in a different dimension"".We have to take his word for that. On-board cameras were in their infancy then, and were not used at all during the 1988 season. And while the qualifying session was filmed for television coverage, the trackside cameras did not pick up Senna during his lap. Footage from 1990 is usually used to patch over the Brazilian's recollections of that qualifying performance.As great a performance as it was, it ended up counting for nothing on race day. Senna lost concentration and landed his car into the barriers on lap 67 at Portier corner, and went home with zilch.Regarded as the greatest ever, it seemed like the most relaxed comeback in Formula 1 history.Nowadays with pedantic tyre strategies, fast out laps from the pits back into the race are the done thing to get on the pace and warm those rubber boots up. But that wasn't the strategy Fangio took.The Argentine led from pole at the Nurburgring and found himself rejoining the race 50 seconds off the pace after a pit stop with 10 laps to go.In a completely relaxed manner, he just continued in his 250F Maserati and made no impression on the Ferrari race leader for the first three of the final 10 laps.Then he put the hammer down and began lapping an astonishing 15 seconds faster than his previous year's record. By the end of lap 19 of 22, he was 13 seconds behind the pace, and then thrashed it even more for the final three to take the race victory and create a new lap record more than eight seconds quicker.Sir Stirling Moss said: ""He was just a great artist of driving."" Fangio was apparently so good that he rarely needed to push his car to the limit, but on the days he did, it provided some jaw-dropping moments.Fifty years on, the 'rain race' is where Sir Jackie Stewart drove his most legendary victory. It all began with bad weather at the Nurburgring, torrential rain and fog so thick drivers could only see 100 yards in front of them 3,000 metres high in Germany.The Nurburgring was the most challenging track on the calendar in 1968, with its 14 miles of ""Green Hell"", as it was known by the drivers. The race was potentially going to be postponed to later that year at Hockenheim - the other main German Grand Prix circuit - but they continued regardless.The rain became so bad the track had channels of water running across it in several places, but Stewart's rivals were no match.In an era when serious injury and death were all too tragically common in dry conditions, the Scot said: ""When I got back to the pits, the first question I asked Ken [Tyrrell, team principal] was, 'Who died?'"" Thankfully there were no additions to the list of 1968 fatalities that day.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMichael Schumacher's maiden Ferrari victory was one to remember, not because it was his first, but because it could well have been his best. And there have been a few...His 1996 Ferrari was said to be a ""dog of a car"" and one which shouldn't have won any races. But he took it to a higher level that day, and proved himself to be the type of driver who can do exceptional things in sub-standard machinery.In what was another dangerously wet race in Europe, the German started on the second row, in third. After actually losing some places earlier on, by lap 13 he was leading.Different team strategies played a small part in Schumacher's stunning victory, as Ferrari preferred a full wet car set-up, while Williams were hoping for a drier afternoon.But that alone cannot account for Schumacher lapping five seconds quicker than anyone else. Stunning."
sport	Formula 1: FIA reject Haas' protest on Force India championship entry		"Haas' protest that the Force India team are not entitled to an entry in the world championship has been rejected by Formula 1 officials.Haas claimed that Force India, which collapsed in July and was bought by a new owner, were not a constructor.This was rejected by governing body the FIA, but the decision could have financial consequences because it confirms Force India as a new team.That could mean they lose the right to previously earned prize money.The stewards ruled that the Force India had not broken rules that forbid teams from using parts designed by other competitors because the old entity could not be considered a competitor, as it had ceased to exist.And they said there was no restriction in the rules on using parts from a former or excluded team.However, the FIA's confirmation of Force India as a new team could call into question their entitlement to more than $30m worth of prize money next year - and equally make Haas entitled to double that.Haas team boss Gunther Steiner said at a news conference on Friday that he was simply seeking ""equality for all teams"".He added: ""We came in under certain conditions. We were aware of what we had to do, but that was not the case (for Force India).""This is a reference to the decision by F1 to allow the new Force India to keep receiving prize money earned by the old one.The initial intention had been for new owner Lawrence Stroll to buy the equity of the old team but this hit a snag because of the legal and financial difficulties surrounding former co-owners Vijay Mallya and Sahara Roy, who have been accused by Indian authorities of financial impropriety.These meant it was impossible to complete a sale in time for Force India to race at the Belgium Grand Prix after the summer break, and instead the old team was allowed to collapse and Stroll bought its assets. The FIA then granted it an entry as a new team.But Haas always objected to it being allowed to keep its prize money - and other teams only granted their permission for the deal to come together on certain conditions, which have not yet been satisfied.If Force India are reclassified by F1, they would lose more than $30m of prize money next year. And Haas could potentially gain $60m which they were not previously entitled to.Haas has not yet said whether it will take the process any further.F1 has been approached for a response but is yet to comment."
sport	Typhoon Hagibis: Japanese Grand Prix qualifying postponed	Mercedes find the speed	"Formula 1 has cancelled all activities at the Japanese Grand Prix on Saturday as Typhoon Hagibis approaches.The tropical storm, the year's biggest, is due to hit Japan on Saturday and strong winds are set to continue into Sunday, when qualifying and race will be held.Valtteri Bottas led Lewis Hamilton to a Mercedes one-two in second practice.Those results could decide the grid if conditions are too difficult to hold qualifying on Sunday morning.Bottas was 0.1 seconds quicker than Hamilton, with Max Verstappen third and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel fourth and fifth ahead of Red Bull's Alexander Albon.Organisers said they had taken the decision to postpone qualifying and close the circuit on Saturday ""in the interests of safety for the spectators, competitors, and everyone at the Suzuka Circuit"".Qualifying, which had been due to take place at 15:00 local time (08:00 BST) on Saturday, is now due to take place at 10:00 (02:00 BST) on Sunday.The race will be held as scheduled at 14:10 (06:10 BST).The potential impact of the tropical storm has already led to the cancellation of two matches at the Rugby World Cup.F1 organisers delayed a decision on Thursday to have a clearer idea of the path of the storm.Mercedes were first and second, with Bottas ahead of Hamilton, in both practice sessions.And the second session took on more importance than normal because teams were aware it could set the grid.Suzuka is expected to be hit by high winds and heavy rain throughout Saturday in what is currently a Category Three typhoon and is due to hit the coast not far from the track on Saturday before moving north towards Tokyo.Flights are being cancelled across the country, as are train services from Tokyo to Nagoya, the closest big city to Suzuka, from Saturday morning, as well as most trains between Nagoya and Osaka to the west.Efforts were being made to limit the potential damage at the track on Saturday, for which there have been warnings to stay inside and Japanese authorities have set up social media accounts and an app for safety tips during the storm.But, even though the storm has weakened slightly from its high point earlier in the week, there are concerns among officials that the damage might be too extensive for the track to be cleared in time to run qualifying on Sunday morning.Mercedes appear to be in a strong position after Friday practice, their cars quicker than anything else on both short runs and longer ones aimed at simulating the race.In fact, Mercedes were as much as a second a lap on average quicker than Ferrari on their race simulations.Ferrari, who have won three of the last four races and taken pole position at all of them, appear to have slipped back judging from Friday.Leclerc was 0.356secs off the pace, with Vettel 0.235secs further behind him, and that was despite the Italian team running their session differently than Mercedes and in a way that should in theory have given them greater potential for a quick time.All teams took advantage of the lack of running on Saturday to do an extra low-fuel, high-speed run in second practice, but while Mercedes and Red Bull did both their quick laps in the middle of the session, Ferrari did one then and then one at the end.That was the lap that vaulted Leclerc up from sixth to fourth, but although Vettel was able to improve his personal best lap time, he slipped behind his team-mate.Albon was 0.336secs off Verstappen, a strong effort from the Anglo-Thai rookie on his first visit to Suzuka and in only his fifth race for the team following his mid-season promotion.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMercedes have an aerodynamic upgrade on the car that the team hope will wrest back the advantage from Ferrari, while Red Bull also have tweaked aerodynamics as well as a new fuel for their Honda engine aimed at boosting performance on the Japanese manufacturer's home track.Bottas said: ""Very positive day, tried some things. Felt good from the beginning, really happy with the car in general, still minor things with the balance to tweak but both short and long runs felt good. It's always so much fun here driving these cars, and especially when the car feels good.""It is only practice but I do feel still the gains we've made with the car. We can just push the car further than before. But still Sunday is going to be close.Hamilton added: ""It's a work in progress. When you're first on the track, you're pushing the limits, there is always time to find at this track, always areas you're weak at.""This is not my strongest of circuits. Valtteri got a massive tow on his fastest lap and gained like 0.5secs up the back straight so it's an interesting dynamic because you don't want to be behind someone in the first part because you need clear air but if you're lucky and you get a slipstream later on, then it's perfect.""Best of the rest was McLaren's Carlos Sainz, ahead of Racing Point's Sergio Perez, Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly and the second McLaren of Lando Norris.In the first session, Japanese Naoki Yamamoto was driving Gasly's Toro Rosso on his first experience of F1 and was a creditable 17th fastest.Yamamoto was just 0.1secs off team-mate Daniil Kvyat but was running the soft tyre while the Russian was on the medium."

It felt just completely different for me because it just happened so fast.Speaking about the moment she realised everything had gone wrong, Florsch said: ""[It was when] I didn't have the control any more because I lost my two side wheels because of the other driver, then you're just like 'OK, this is going to be a crash' but I never thought 'this is going to be a really bad crash'.""Even when I was in the hospital, for me, the crash wasn't so horrible.When I saw the video for the first time, I was like 'okay, this actually looks quite bad'.""When I saw the video for the first time, I was like 'OK, this actually looks quite bad'.""I watched it for the first time on the Friday after the crash, and of course I was also shocked because it doesn't look nice at all. It's really horrible.""I didn't expect it to look that bad because, in the car, it didn't feel so horrible.""So the flying [through the air] part, I remember, but it felt different. For me, it felt like sliding on the ground. I don't know if it's because it happened so fast, but it just felt the same.""Of course, it was a little bit strange that I was landing on top of the barriers, but I didn't get it together, so I also didn't really think about what it happened.""The video got quite big and a lot of people saw it. A lot of people texted me, especially F1 drivers like [Fernando] Alonso, [Nico] Rosberg and [Nico] Hulkenberg, but also F1 teams.""It's just unbelievable to see how close not just family stays and to have all those fans all over the world supporting you.""""My dad was at my car with me and my mum and little sister were at home. I think it was quite bad for all of them because the video looks horrible,"" Sophia said.""That was also one of my first thoughts, to tell the team over the radio that I'm OK and to please tell my family, but it didn't work.""When I was at the hospital, the first thing me and my dad did was take a selfie to send to my mum and my sister to tell them I'm OK.""Even if I watched the video, I would not think that the person in there would be OK.""It was just so much unluckiness coming together with luck to not make it a really bad one.""Asked what her mother said after she revealed her intention to return to racing, Sophia said: ""Actually, I think she never really asked me, it was more my grandmother and my aunts and uncles.""When I explained why I still wanted to race, they actually understood it. I think all people who are really close to me and who know me already knew the answer before the question because they know that it's just my life and I would continue even though this crash happened.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceFlorsch also talked about her friendship with British racing driver Billy Monger, who received the Helen Rollason Award - given ""for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity"" - at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show.""I've known Billy for a lot of years actually and we've been karting already together and we did Ginetta Juniors together one year,"" she said.The 19-year-old had both his legs amputated following a crash during a Formula 4 race at Donington Park in April 2017, before returning to racing in March 2018.""He's a super cool kid and also quite a good friend. What he had to go through is really hard and a lot of people would have said 'OK, I want to stop',"" Florsch added.""He was already so positive and a happy person before the crash and it's incredibly nice to see that he didn't change at all.""He's still this guy who loves racing, who is happy and enjoying life to the edge.""He was an inspiration for so many people because his story is incredible. He has an incredible heart and he's just taking the best out of it and that's really nice.""He text me after my crash and said he was sending best wishes which is nice to know.""If Florsch's nerve has not been affected by the crash, neither has her ambition.""Of course I hope to be back behind the wheel,"" she said. ""The plans are to do the same series again as I did this year, the F3 European Championship which is now called Euromasters - so that's going to be my plan.""Hopefully it will be with Van Amersfoort, the team that I raced with this year, because they are an amazing team.""I'll see how it goes, but my goal is to get to F1 and have success there and maybe be world champion.""It's quite a big goal but I'm getting closer every year and I think it's possible to be there, for sure, and to be a woman world champion.""I just want to be the best driver. I think the woman part comes by itself."""

sport	Japanese Grand Prix: Typhoon qualifying decision delayed until Friday		"Formula 1 has delayed a decision on whether to cancel Japanese Grand Prix qualifying as a result of Typhoon Hagibis until Friday.The storm is expected to make landfall on Saturday on the south coast of Honshu island, where Suzuka is located.A statement from F1 bosses said: ""Every effort is being made to minimise disruption to the F1 timetable.""However, the safety of fans, competitors and everyone at the Suzuka circuit remains the top priority.""Governing body the FIA said it was ""closely monitoring Typhoon Hagibis and its potential impact on the Japanese Grand Prix"".The potential impact of the tropical storm, said to be the biggest of the year, has already led to the cancellation of two matches at the Rugby World Cup.F1 organisers are waiting to see whether the storm continues on its current track before deciding whether to cancel qualifying on Saturday.That decision is expected to come before the end of Friday and will primarily be down to Japanese local authorities, whose responsibility it is to decide whether to close the circuit and advise people to stay indoors to reduce the risk to life from the storm.If authorities do not take that action, F1 will almost certainly try to run Saturday's programme, which has final practice at 12:00 local time (04:00 BST) and qualifying at 15:00 (07:00 BST).Wind speeds are forecast to be 160km/h on Saturday afternoon.Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel said: ""I don't think anybody wants to put anybody's life in danger, so you need to keep things a bit on the ground.""There is the forecast, but how many times a forecast has changed I don't know. Currently, it sits at 100%, so it is quite clear, but we will see what happens throughout the weekend.""It would make sense if by tomorrow night, if there is more evidence, to take an action for Saturday.""We are nice and cosy in the garage - we are sheltered - but for the people around the track in the grandstands it is not so nice if there is 80km/h of wind shaking in your face and the rain comes sideways.""The German's Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc said: ""It is pretty clear if the typhoon is going to come here, there is no way we can drive.""Qualifying in Japan has twice before had to be postponed because of the threat of a typhoon, in 2004 and 2010. In both cases, it was run on Sunday morning, before the race in the afternoon.The US Grand Prix in 2015 was also affected by a tropical storm. There, Friday second practice was cancelled. Saturday morning practice went ahead with no spectators, after the public were advised not to come to the track for their own safety, and qualifying was subject to a series of delays before eventually being delayed until Sunday."

sport	Jolyon Palmer column: My star Formula 1 drivers of the 2018 season	Lewis HamiltonMax VerstappenCharles LeclercA mouth-watering prospect for 2019Farewell to a legend	Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault during the 2017 season, has joined the BBC team to offer insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors.The Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi epitomised much of the 2018 season.There was some high drama, particularly at the start, some moments of real excitement in the middle, building up to an exciting finale, which ultimately fizzled to nothing with a few laps to go as Sebastian Vettel couldn't challenge Lewis Hamilton for the win.It's been a great season of on-track action on the whole, and my three star drivers of the season were on great form in Abu Dhabi as well.Firstly, of course, the world champion. What a season Lewis Hamilton has had, and what a way to wrap it up in Abu Dhabi.Before this year, Hamilton had never won any remaining race in a season after clinching the title. This time he took pole and won both of the remaining races to end what turned into a dominant year in emphatic style.His victory on Sunday was one of the more understated. Having taken pole by only 0.15 seconds ahead of team-mate Valtteri Bottas on Saturday, he pitted early in the race, which seemed a bold call by Mercedes.But while Bottas struggled after his own stop, and dropped down the order, Hamilton was in complete control. He beat his team-mate, who had started next to him on the grid, by almost 50 seconds.The comparison between Hamilton and Bottas is stark this year. Over the first half it was much closer, but you felt Hamilton had the edge. The second half was a demolition.After the halfway point at Silverstone, Hamilton won eight of the remaining 11 races. Bottas scored just four podiums in that time and didn't get a victory all season, finishing 161 points behind his team-mate.Bottas is a good driver, and it highlights just how good Hamilton has been this year.I can't think of a more impressive performance by any driver over the course of an entire season than this one from Hamilton.My second driver of the year is Max Verstappen. He's undeniably super-talented. He's unbelievably quick but prone to being hot-headed and making mistakes.But over the course of this season he has developed into an almost complete driver.Verstappen came in for a lot of stick after Monaco, where he crashed in practice and therefore had to start from the back. It was the latest in a series of errors over the early races. He had the pace but kept making mistakes - he had incidents in all of the first six race weekends.But boy has he turned it around. Podiums in all of the last five races - including a win in Mexico, a should-have-been win in Brazil and a drive to second from 18th on the grid in Austin - show his potential for next year.Finishing fourth in the championship, only two points behind Kimi Raikkonen, is an extraordinary achievement, considering his difficult start to the season and the lack of competitiveness from his Red Bull team, particularly in the middle of the season.Verstappen drove another strong race on Sunday, recovering from a poor start that left him on the edge of the top 10 and nursing his car through engine overheating issues early on.He showed his extreme aggression in the car with moves on Force India's Esteban Ocon early in the race and then Bottas late on, having minor contact with both.It shows there's still a risk element to his driving, which if someone is fighting for a title isn't ideal, but at least right now Verstappen is getting it right more often than not, when earlier on in the year it was costing him dearly.My third driver of the year is the man moving to Ferrari to partner Sebastian Vettel in 2019.Charles Leclerc had a super weekend in Abu Dhabi, qualifying comfortably in the top 10 before rising up to fourth place in his Sauber early on, legitimately passing Daniel Ricciardo's Red Bull.Sauber pitted him too early, which mired him in traffic for a large part of the race, but he showed impressive race-craft to match his obvious pace.Leclerc had big pressure coming into the season after a standout performance last year in Formula 2 and starting in a struggling team as a Ferrari junior.But for a rookie he has been incredibly consistent, making very few mistakes, after an admittedly shaky first couple of races.Sauber are the most improved team this year, and I'm sure that a significant part of that is down to Leclerc extracting the last bit of pace from the car and giving the team fresh motivation.These three drivers are hopefully going to be big rivals next year, with each in one of the three top teams.The three-car battles for wins at the end of the season have added an extra dimension to each race and made them more thrilling as a result.Verstappen's chances next year hinge very much on Honda hitting the ground running in their new partnership with Red Bull, who switch from a 12-year partnership with Renault.Red Bull have a superb chassis. The fact they won races this year, despite a significant power deficit compared to Mercedes and Ferrari, underlines that.If Honda can prove to be an upgrade from Renault, as Red Bull hope, they will surely be a threat, particularly if Verstappen can keep his form going from the end of this season.Leclerc can be a big threat in the Ferrari next year. It's one of the things I'm most excited about. He will come in with an assumed position as number two to Vettel, but it's very possible he could out-perform the German, win races and even make his own challenge for the title.I'm sure Vettel will be wary of his arrival into the team, particularly after his experience with Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull in 2014, where the young driver upset the establishment.As for Hamilton, he's driving at his best, has a team who are proven winners behind him and seems to be enjoying his racing more than ever. He will be so tough to stop in 2019, but the two other stars of 2018 will be giving it their all to do exactly that.A final word for another star of 2018, and Formula 1 in general. Fernando Alonso has been superb this season in a McLaren that has been woeful.Pipped to the top 10 in the drivers' championship on the final day, Alonso still managed to almost single-handedly secure sixth place for the team in the constructors' championship, an incredible achievement considering McLaren have often had either the slowest or second slowest car this year.To finish the season with a record of 21-0 against team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne in qualifying shows Alonso is still driving at his best as well.Just as with Bottas at Mercedes, Vandoorne is no slouch, but he's been made to look second-rate this year, to the point where he is out of F1 for 2019.Alonso will be a big miss for F1 as a whole. He's one of the all-time greats and, on a personal level, it was a pleasure racing him during 2016 and 2017.Alonso has been plagued by off-track politics and poor decisions in F1. And when it comes to karma, he is certainly due some payback as he attempts to complete the triple crown in 2019 by adding victory at the Indianapolis 500 to his F1 and Le Mans titles.

"Media playback is not supported on this deviceAfter the closest finish to a Formula E race, the 2018-19 season heads to Santiago, Chile, for the third round on Saturday, 26 January.Just 0.143 seconds separated Mahindra Racing's Jerome d'Ambrosio from second-placed Robin Frijns of the Envision Virgin Racing Team in Marrakesh earlier this month.It came after Alexander Sims and his BMW Andretti team-mate Antonio Felix da Costa, who had been second and first respectively, crashed into each other late on.Da Costa had been aiming for his second win of the season after holding off reigning champion Jean-Eric Vergne, of DS Techeetah, to win the first E-Prix in Saudi Arabia in December.D'Ambrosio is top of the standings on 40 points, with Da Costa and Vergne both on 28 after two of the 13 races.Coverage of the Santiago E-Prix is live on the BBC Red Button Connected TV, the BBC Sport website and BBC iPlayer from 18:30 GMT on Saturday, with a full replay of the race available on the BBC Red Button later on Sunday.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThis will be the second E-Prix to be staged in Santiago, although it will be held three miles away from last year's contest - at a 2.4km, 14-turn track in O'Higgins Park.Santiago is the only South American race of the campaign. Last year's race was chaotic, with six cars failing to finish as Vergne won. The Frenchman was lucky to stay on the track when team-mate Andre Lotterer ran into the back of his car, but the pair managed to stay in the race, with the German finishing second.Vergne will be looking to do better than in Marrakesh, when he spun in the opening seconds of the race while trying to move into the lead, although he did fight back to finish fifth. ""I was an idiot because it was completely unnecessary,"" was the champion's blunt verdict.Compared with some of its carbon-belching cousins, Formula E is considerably more friendly to the environment.The sport was developed with sustainability in mind ,with organisers saying the aim is to ""reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible"".It does this by powering its cars with a battery that uses 100% renewable fuel, and tyres that - as well as lasting an entire race - can also be recycled afterwards. Meanwhile, spectators are encouraged to use public transport to get to events, with no public parking available.One drawback with battery-powered cars is they have not had the capacity to last an entire race, resulting in the rather unusual (and somewhat gimmicky) sight of drivers having to swap cars mid-race.That will no longer happen - this season's Gen2 car is fitted with a battery that will last from start to finish.With the car manufacturing world looking to switch to developing almost exclusively electric cars within the next couple of decades, Formula E provides them with the ideal arena to test new technology at a competitive level.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSpectators play a key role in the action during Formula E races.'Fan boost' has been a feature of the past few seasons, with viewers able to vote using an app to determine which driver gets some extra power during a race.In Saudi Arabia, Da Costa, Lucas di Grassi, Daniel Abt and former Formula 1 drivers Felipe Massa and Stoffel Vandoorne were the top five drivers to be awarded extra power. Massa, Pascal Wehrlein, Sebastien Buemi, Da Costa and Vandoorne got the vote to receive power in Marrakesh.New this season is 'Attack Mode', which gives competitors a speed boost after they drive through an allocated area on the track.Da Costa and D'Ambrosio have both benefited from the new feature during the opening two races, but Geox Dragon Racing's Jose Maria Lopez missed the activation zone and ended up in the wall in Saudi Arabia.Badly.Former Formula 1 drivers Massa, Vandoorne and Wehrlein are among the 22 drivers in 2018-19, but all three are without a point so far.Ex-Ferrari and Williams driver Massa, runner-up in the Formula 1 world championship in 2008, has signed a three-year contract to race for Monaco-based Venturi.But the Brazilian has had a difficult start in the all-electric series, finished 17th after a handful of penalties in Saudi Arabia.He was then called ""an amateur"" by fellow Brazilian Nelson Piquet Jr after the pair nearly collided in a free practice session, before Massa came 18th in Morocco - the last of the finishers.Vandoorne - Fernando Alonso's F1 team-mate at McLaren for the past two seasons - has also made the switch to Formula E and is racing for HWA Racelab.The Belgian made a good start by qualifying in fourth place in Saudi Arabia, but technical problems with the car meant he was only 16th in the race.In Marrakesh, Vandoorne failed to finish, as team-mate Gary Paffett hit his car after less than 10 minutes of the race.Mahindra Racing's Wehrlein missed the opening race because he was still under contract in F1 and an early technical issue saw his race in Morocco end prematurely.26 January 2019: Santiago, Chile16 February 2019: Mexico City10 March 2019: Hong Kong23 March 2019: Sanya, China13 April 2019: Rome, Italy27 April 2019: Paris, France11 May 2019: Monaco25 May 2019: Berlin, Germany22 June 2019: Bern, Switzerland13 and 14 July 2019: New York, USA"

I want to keep having fun like I have done all my life.""There are 13 races in 12 cities including Paris, Rome and a double header in New York to close the season, from 15 December to 14 July 2019.Massa says he feels ready for the challenge of adapting to tighter street circuits and the new Gen2 car, which has double the energy storage capacity of the Gen1 model.""I'm racing this season and I don't know any tracks - except Monaco, half of the track I know,"" he added.""The understanding about all these batteries, how to use them in the perfect way - especially during the race - the way you need to save and charge them.

"Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe new Formula E season gets under way in Saudi Arabia on 15 December, and you can watch all 13 races live on the BBC.The all-electric series will take place in some of the most iconic and eye-catching cities in the world - from Marrakesh to Paris, with the season finale a double header in New York.This will be the fifth season of Formula E, and promises to be the most exciting and interesting so far, with some big names among the 11 teams and 22 drivers.The opening race in Riyadh is live on the BBC Sport website, Red Button and Connected TV from 12:00 GMT on Saturday.So what is Formula E? And why should you watch it?Compared to some of its carbon-belching cousins, Formula E is considerably more friendly to the environment.The sport was developed with sustainability in mind, and the aim to ""reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible"".It does this by powering its cars with a battery that uses 100% renewable fuel, and tyres that - as well as lasting an entire race - can also be recycled afterwards.

Those attending ePrixs are also able to compete with actual drivers in virtual-racing events during race weekends.New for 2018-19 is 'Attack Mode' - akin to something from Mario Kart, this is another temporary speed boost that will be available to drivers during races.It will require drivers to take additional risks by moving off the racing line and on to a different area of the track, where the new mode will be activated, providing the car with a temporary power boost.The points system mirrors Formula 1 - 25 for the winner down to a single point for 10th place - but there are significant differences with motorsport's most popular series. In Formula E, additional points are awarded for pole position and fastest lap, while races last for 45 minutes - half the length of a typical F1 grand prix.Perhaps the most significant addition to the line-up for this season is Felipe Massa.The former Ferrari and Williams driver retired from F1 last year and will this season race for Venturi in the all-electric series. The Brazilian will be reunited with former Williams reserve driver Susie Wolff, the first female team principal in Formula E.Stoffel Vandoorne - Fernando Alonso's team-mate at McLaren for the past two seasons - has also made the switch to Formula E and will race for HWA Racelab.Among the other competitors are Nick Heidfeld, who spent a decade in Formula 1, and former Toro Rosso driver Jean-Eric Vergne, who is the reigning champion.There will also be a strong British representation, with Sam Bird, Gary Paffett, Oliver Turvey, Oliver Rowland and Alexander Sims all on the grid.Among the manufacturers taking part are BMW, Audi, Jaguar and Nissan, while Mercedes, who have dominated F1 for the past five years, will enter Formula E in the 2019-20 season.When Formula E first arrived on the scene, one of the main criticisms of it was that cars were too slow for top-level single-seater racing.In 2014, the top speed of the cars was about 140mph, but this season they will be able to reach almost 180mph. That means they are edging closer to their Formula 1 counterparts, which can zip along at up to 230mph. However, the tight and twisty nature of street circuits will always make it difficult for Formula E cars to challenge an F1 car's straight-line speed.The Gen2 cars also feature a significant change in look.With sleek bodywork featuring swooping arches, the cars have more than a passing resemblance to the Batmobile, marking a significant move away from the somewhat clumsy look of previous incarnations.With faster cars and a bolder look, Formula E has a real chance of making motorsport fans sit up and take notice this season.Motorsport events have often been the destination of choice for the rich and famous pretty much since the first Formula 1 championship way back in 1950, and celebrities continue to flock to F1 races around the world.However, thanks to its glamorous city-based locales and environmentally-friendly message, Formula E races are also proving popular with the stars, meaning celeb-spotting on a race weekend can often turn into a who's who of the A-lister world.Titanic and Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio is probably one of the most well-known celebrities connected to Formula E, with the American actor having co-founded the Venturi team that has competed in the series since its first season in 2014.Meanwhile, Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor in the Marvel films and portrayed 1976 F1 champion James Hunt in Rush, and Lord of Rings star Orlando Bloom have both got behind the wheel of a Formula E car in recent years, while model and actress Emily Ratajkowski joined former F1 world champion Nico Rosberg for a spin in Berlin earlier this year.15 December 2018: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia12 January 2019: Marrakesh, Morocco26 January 2019: Santiago, Chile16 February 2019: Mexico City10 March 2019: Hong Kong23 March 2019: Sanya, China13 April 2019: Rome, Italy27 April 2019: Paris, France11 May 2019: Monaco25 May 2019: Berlin, Germany22 June 2019: Bern, Switzerland13 and 14 July 2019: New York, USAMedia playback is not supported on this device"
sport	Sophia Florsch: Formula 3 driver says 'I am going to come back'		"Formula 3 driver Sophia Florsch says she is ""going to come back"" after having an 11-hour operation on the fractured spine she sustained in a high-speed crash in Macau on Sunday.Doctors used bone from the 17-year-old German driver's hip to repair one of her vertebrae in the surgery.""I have to stay a few more days in Macau,"" said Florsch.Her team principal said on Monday that the surgery went ""extremely well"" and there is ""no fear of paralysis"".Florsch, who races for Van Amersfoort Racing, hit the back of Jehan Daruvala's car on lap four of the F3 Macau Grand Prix, then launched over the inside kerb into the car of Sho Tsuboi. That impact catapulted her car over the barrier and into an area occupied by marshals and photographers.Team owner Frits van Amersfoort estimated she was travelling at 276kmh (171.6mph).""I want to thank all of my fans for every single get-well wishes, which I now start reading,"" Florsch added on Facebook.""This really motivates me and gives me courage. My thoughts are also with everyone who was involved in the accident. I hope everybody is healthy.""At the accident were really nice people, which I still have in my mind. Thank you for all the encouraging, calming words in these tough minutes in my car.""A real big thanks to the medical staff here in Macau for the friendly and professional treatment."""

"It was a thrilling Formula 1 season with great races, controversy, crashes and superb overtakes with Lewis Hamilton showing his brilliance to win the world title for a fifth time.But how much of it had you predicted way back in March before the first race of the campaign?Before it all got under way, we asked for your predictions on the top three drivers, the best and worst teams and who would be classed as the worst driver.So how did you all do?We have crunched the numbers and these are the results...It looked like being an epic battle between Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, with the German holding an eight-point lead after the British Grand Prix in July.But Lewis Hamilton raced away to win the title, just as 71.2% of you predicted. There were 1.4% of you who were extremely optimistic and tipping Fernando Alonso to win a world title at McLaren. In the end he came 11th with his McLaren so uncompetitive the Spaniard decided to leave Formula 1 altogether.That's two out of two. Sebastian Vettel was backed by 39.5% of you to come second and that is exactly what he did, finishing 88 points behind Hamilton. The Ferrari man won the first two races of the season - in Australia and Bahrain - and gained further victories in Canada, at Silverstone and in Belgium, but no wins in his last eight races of the season left him well behind Mercedes' Hamilton.Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen came third, finishing two points clear of Max Verstappen, who had been backed by 27% of you to take that third spot.The Finn won his first race in more than five years at the United States Grand Prix, although it came after he had already been dropped by Ferrari for next season, with him swapping seats with Sauber's Charles Leclerc in 2019.This was never going to be in doubt. Mercedes, for the fifth successive year, became Constructors' Champions - just as a whopping 76.5% of you said they would. They picked up 655 points throughout the season - 408 from Hamilton and 247 from his team-mate (and ""wingman"", as team boss Toto Wolff called him) Valtteri Bottas.With so many of you opting for Mercedes to be champions, it was only natural that Ferrari were tipped to come second. That is what 52.3% of you said would happen - and it did. They ended on 571 points - 84 less than Mercedes - with Vettel picking up 320 points and Raikkonen 251.The Red Bull pairing of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo both won two races in 2018, but a number of race retirements, including eight for the Australian, left the team floundering in third, just as 58.1% of you predicted at the start of the season.This is where the crystal ball got a bit blurry. Sauber had been absolutely rubbish in 2017 and a lot of you expected them to be clogging up the back of the grid every race again. Charles Leclerc, in his debut Formula 1 season, was tipped by 30.8% to be the worst driver (including by me), with team-mate Marcus Ericsson the second-most popular option. Instead, Leclerc surprised everyone and ended 13th - a performance that has led to him racing for Ferrari in 2019.But it was another debutant, Sergey Sirotkin at Williams, who took the dubious honour of finishing bottom of the pile. He picked up just a solitary point, in Italy, and even that came when he finished outside the top 10 but benefitted from Romain Grosjean's disqualification to ensure all 20 drivers got at least one point.Sauber, backed by 60.7% of you to come last, proved the critics wrong by finishing eighth. Only 4% of you could have guessed that it would be a nightmare season for Williams as they came last with only seven points in 21 races, with Lance Stroll picking up four of them in one go by coming eighth in Azerbaijan, one of only three top-10 finishes for Williams in 2018."

Update soon.""Florsch hit the back of Jehan Daruvala's car on the high-speed run to Lisboa on lap four and then launched over the inside kerb into the car of Sho Tsuboi.The speed-trap figure before the braking area showed that she was travelling at 171.6 mph [276.2 kph] at the time.The impact with Tsuboi lifted her car over the barrier and into an area occupied by marshals and photographers.Japanese driver Tsuboi was taken to hospital with back pain, while race organisers said two photographers and a marshal were also taken to hospital.Photographer Minami Hiroyuki was taken in with concussion, while marshal Chan Cha In suffered a fractured facial bone and lacerations. The other photographer, Chan Weng Wang, had a liver laceration.The race was immediately red-flagged before restarting an hour later."
sport	Formula 1: Seven key issues facing the sport's bosses for the 2019 season	High-profile races under threatA defeat on engines; what of the other rules?What about money?And the budget cap?Broadcasting - especially in the UKIs F1 meeting its own targets?The thorny issue of tyres	"Formula 1's bosses are heading into 2019 facing a critical period as they try to impose their vision on the sport.Liberty Media's stewardship has produced mixed results since the US group took over in January 2017.There is a more open atmosphere in F1, and a new race in Vietnam in 2020, but a number of historic events are under threat and teams' prize money has consistently dropped over the past 18 months.Rule changes planned for 2021 have not yet been revealed, F1 has already lost one battle with the teams, and there is no agreement in other key areas.And 2020, when all but one of the teams' contracts with F1 end, looms ever closer.Perhaps the biggest single issue facing F1 is the fact the contracts of five races expire next season.Along with the British Grand Prix, which exercised a break clause in its contract after 2019, the races in Germany, Italy, Spain and Mexico are also heading into the last year of their contracts.The concern for F1/Liberty is all will want to renew at a lower rate than they are paying. And insiders say the circuits are working together on the matter to strengthen their hands.Silverstone said it ended its contract because it could not afford to carry on at the escalating rates stipulated in the agreement it made with former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone in 2009.It wants to continue, but it and F1 are some way apart on their ideas of an acceptable fee.Losing any of these races would be bad news - Liberty is trying to expand F1, not shrink it. The absence of Britain, Italy and/or Germany would be an especially awkward look when Liberty has said it values the classic European historic races and is determined to preserve them.And, even if none of these events is among F1's biggest earners, any race that drops off the calendar means a significant loss of income - Silverstone is paying more than £18m next year; Italy €24m (£21.4m) and Mexico a reported $25m (£19.7m).Liberty took over F1 with plans to make it more competitive and increase its appeal to spectators, restructure prize money so it is distributed more equitably, and impose a budget cap.It has already lost one battle - F1 has been forced to backtrack on plans to simplify the turbo hybrid engines from 2021 following opposition from the car manufacturers.Against F1's original wishes, the heat-energy recovery unit at the heart of both the engines' remarkable efficiency and their complexity will stay. And it's quite possible plans to loosen fuel limits will also be dropped on the same basis - why incur the cost of changing the engines, the manufacturers say, when no-one else is interested in entering?At least on engines people generally know where things are going. On other issues, the water is muddier.There has been no sign of the new technical rules for 2021, with which F1 plans to change aerodynamics to make it easier for cars to follow each other closely, thereby improving the racing.Technically, the rules are the responsibility of the FIA. But F1 has set up a significant department under sporting boss Ross Brawn to research the issue. The two are said to be working together.Why the delay? F1 says it's deliberate - it doesn't want to give the teams too much notice, to try to prevent the better-resourced stealing a march.But a truncated time period also favours the bigger teams - because they can put more people on it, and learn more at a faster rate.Back in April, F1 presented the teams with a plan to change income distribution and introduce a budget cap from 2021.F1 wants to reform a prize-money system which disproportionately rewards the top teams - the legacy of one of Ecclestone's myriad divide-and-conquer strategies back in 2011.Money will still be distributed on a performance-related basis, but the disparity between first and last will be significantly reduced.The exact prize-money structure has not been revealed. But sources say that, in essence, the teams have been offered a protected level of income - but little chance for it to go up significantly, even if F1's profits increase.The bonuses that rewarded Ferrari, Red Bull, McLaren, Williams and Mercedes will go. In their place, engine manufacturers will be given a $10m (£7.9m) bonus, and Ferrari an additional $40m (£31.5m) because of their status.For many months, no further talks took place on this, and teams were beginning to get nervous and edgy. In late October, F1 boss Chase Carey moved to calm them by instigating a series of regular meetings, and discussions have started to inch forward.Publicly, the teams say talks are going in the right direction. However, privately not all have the same position - and Mercedes and Ferrari, in particular, are said to be steadfast in their unwillingness to accept the proposal presented by F1 so far.Liberty proposed a budget cap of $150m (£118m) in 2021, the idea being to reduce the performance gap between the top three teams - who are all spending close to double that amount - and the rest.Now, it is proposed there is a glide path down to it, with the first year set at $200m (£157.3m), then $175m (£137.6), before settling on $150m (£118m). There is also talk of delaying the start of it until 2022 or even 2023.The problem is, every year that goes by before the cap is introduced is more time for the big teams to invest in resources and equipment that will entrench their advantage for years to come.There is also the issue of satellite teams. Some argue a budget cap will simply increase the likelihood of big teams 'buddying up' with smaller outfits to spread resources, increase economies of scale, and make it impossible for the authorities to work out who is doing what work for which team.This presents an existential threat to teams such as Renault, McLaren and Williams, who are not involved and believe this runs counter to the fundamental tenets of F1. They have been told it will be stopped - but not how.For the first time since the mid-1970s, live broadcasting of F1 will be almost non-existent on free-to-air television in the UK next year.A lucrative new contract with Sky, signed by Ecclestone in 2016, kicks in. It dictates only the British Grand Prix must be live on free-to-air, along with highlights of all the other races. Channel 4 will broadcast this in 2019.Sky paid handsomely to own the rights to show live F1 in the UK - the contract, until 2024, is said to be worth £1.2bn.But what effect could it have on F1's public appeal? Will it prosper, as football has? Or suffer, in the manner of cricket? Many feel they already know the likely answer to that.Beyond 2019, there is another question. The C4 deal is for only one year. Will Sky, which owns the rights, extend it, or switch free-to-air coverage to one of its own channels?The latter would meet the requirements of the Sky contract that the free-to-air coverage must have ""90% technical availability"" to the public. But it would risk diminishing the audience even further.Sources say Sky's plan as things stand is to promote its Pick channel through 2019 as a place people will be able to see F1, and then use it to meet its free-to-air obligations in 2020.If so, how does that fit with F1's desire to grow the audience? And will the sport's bosses try to pressure Sky to think again?Liberty bought F1 professing its plans to grow both its audience and its income.On-track audiences are up, TV audiences have increased by about 3% from 2017 to 2018, and its social media following has ballooned.But the teams' payments have decreased slowly but consistently for the past 18 months - largely because of greatly increased overheads at F1, which has new central London offices, and significantly more staff.In terms of TV, it is hard to discern a clear strategy behind F1's oft-repeated mantra that it wants a split between free-to-air, pay and what is known as OTT, or selling direct to the audience.In Europe, F1's main market, Liberty has negotiated two new deals since it took over. One, in Italy, saw it move predominantly to pay-per-view, in an effective mirror of the new UK deal. Another, in Germany, extended its relationship with free-to-air on RTL, with pay TV dropped.So, of the sport's three biggest European markets, live coverage is now almost exclusively on pay TV in two, and free-to-air survives substantially in only one.To improve the racing, Liberty says it is addressing aerodynamics, and its effect on the ability of a car to closely follow another, in the 2021 rules.Yet the drivers have been saying for some years that one of the key problems preventing them racing harder and closer is the tyres.The Pirelli tyres are prone to overheating, and this restricts how hard drivers can push in races. In effect, although the car could go faster, in a race stint there is a maximum optimum lap time before the tyres are pushed over the edge.Drivers have to keep the tyre below its surface-temperature limit for the average of the lap or stint. Push harder, and the tyres overheat and lose performance.This is why race lap times are so much further off qualifying pace than can be accounted for by fuel load or engine modes - by a number of seconds - and why drivers spend most races trying to make a one-stop strategy work.Doing more pit stops is counter-productive - because the tyres won't let the driver push harder to make up the lost time, despite the car going much slower than it is capable of.The result is ""the races aren't fun,"" as Haas driver and Grand Prix Drivers' Association director Romain Grosjean puts it. Not only that, he says, but if drivers aren't on the limit, they aren't going to make a mistake - and errors liven up races.Try to question Brawn on this, and he simply refuses to engage.In recent weeks, the drivers have started a renewed push for what in unguarded moments they would call better tyres.Not all racing tyres behave like this, and one possible way of enabling drivers to race harder - as Liberty says it wants them to - would have been to explore the idea of another supplier during the recent tyre tender period.F1 dismissed Michelin, whose tyres are driven flat out by the leading cars in the World Endurance Championship, because it felt its philosophy did not fit.Korea's Hankook, which supplies the DTM German touring car championship, was a rival for Pirelli but in the end the Italian company secured a new contract until 2023.Did Liberty do this deal because it genuinely believed Pirelli could produce the tyres the drivers want, even though their characteristics have been fundamentally the same since its debut in 2011? Or because fiscal issues trumped sporting ones, and the lucrative Pirelli deal was needed at a time when finances are under pressure? Or both?Some team bosses admit F1 needs to end the era of excessive tyre management. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff says it is ""completely the wrong direction - we need robust tyres, that Pirelli is perfectly able to produce. They just need to be given the right objectives.""It's too late to change the tyres for 2019, but if Pirelli does not make significant changes for 2020, what then?"
sport	Formula 1 in 2019: Lewis Hamilton's sixth title and will Leclerc be better than Vettel?	Can anyone stop Hamilton and Mercedes?Pressure on Vettel and FerrariWhat if Leclerc is better then Vettel?Can Honda make Red Bull title contenders?How will Ricciardo get on at Renault?Can rising stars help British legends?Will new rules improve the racing?Don't forget the off-track stuff	"As the sun sets on 2018, and Lewis Hamilton's glorious march to a fifth world title fades into history, thoughts turn to the new Formula 1 season.What can be expected of a year in which Hamilton is looking for more success, Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel seek atonement, and a number of new names and faces - and one famous old one - look to make their mark?Media playback is not supported on this deviceThere's one goal for Hamilton and his Mercedes team in 2019.For Mercedes, a sixth consecutive championship double would break Ferrari's record of five from 2000-4. For Hamilton, a sixth world title would move him clear of Argentine legend Juan Manuel Fangio and leave him only one short of Michael Schumacher's all-time best.The German's record of 91 wins could also be attainable - Hamilton is on 73, has at least two more years in F1, and has won an average of 10 a year for the past five seasons.Hamilton's messaging around Schumacher's records has changed in recent times - over the final weeks of 2018 he went from saying they were ""never a target"" to ""hoping I can at least get close"".After the best season of his career in 2018, Hamilton will start the new season as favourite, the fastest driver in the world, more settled than ever before in the best team on the grid.Team-mate Valtteri Bottas, meanwhile, is in a very difficult position. Winless in 2018, the Finn needs to up his game. And he knows that if he does not do so, the man who could replace him is already in the team - reserve driver Esteban Ocon.Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has said Ocon will have a race seat in F1 in 2020, after the Frenchman was forced out of Force India following its takeover by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll and the installation of his son Lance alongside Sergio Perez.Will that seat be as a replacement for Bottas as Hamilton's team-mate?Ferrari and lead driver Sebastian Vettel ended last season pushing the line that, in the end, they were not quite strong enough to win the title.Vettel said they were ""still too far away"" and team boss Maurizio Arrivabene was talking about a need to develop a ""winning habit"" and take more one-twos.The reality is Vettel and Ferrari could - and arguably should - have won the title had they not made so many mistakes, regardless of how good Hamilton's season was. And it's simple enough to prove it by going back through the season and looking at the results they could have had but threw away for various reasons.Many of those errors came from Vettel, who said he was going to spend the winter looking at himself and working out how to do better in 2019.If Ferrari design a car that can compete right at the front again, can Vettel and the team raise their game and take the fight to Hamilton and Mercedes throughout the entire season? If not, what will the fall-out be?The driver line-up at Ferrari creates an intriguing new plot line. After four years, the cosy relationship between Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen, who knew his place and was not usually quick enough to challenge his team-mate anyway, has gone.In Raikkonen's place, Ferrari have signed 21-year-old Charles Leclerc, who has all the makings of a very special talent indeed.How will Leclerc, fresh from a stellar debut season with Sauber, match up with Vettel?Despite Vettel's difficult 2018, he remains a world-class act, and beating the German will not be easy. But if Leclerc starts to do it, it will raise all sorts of uncomfortable questions at Ferrari.Assuming they are battling Hamilton for the title, which driver do they back? If it's Leclerc, how would Vettel - their number one for four years and clearly the senior figure - react? And, regardless of how it plays out, how do the team handle the new dynamic?Red Bull have finally ended their difficult relationship with engine partner Renault and joined forces with Honda - and expectations are high.Red Bull claimed at the end of last season the Honda was already better than the Renault - although Honda F1 technical boss Toyoharu Tanabe demurred and suggested to this writer that the two engines were ""comparable"".There are still question marks about Honda's performance and reliability. They used more engines per driver than any other manufacturer last season, even if some of the changes were for tactical reasons in a development year.Nevertheless, the expectation at Red Bull is the Japanese company can make more progress over the winter and move the team closer to the front.Team boss Christian Horner says: ""We are expecting speed bumps along the way. It is not going to go to a Mercedes-beater in year one, but we're taking a longer-term view on it and we believe the resource, the capability, the desire of Honda is far better suited [to us than Renault].""Even a modest increase in relative performance from the engine could make a big difference to Red Bull.They ended the season fully competitive in most of the past four races, so don't rule out them joining the fight with Mercedes and Ferrari for regular race wins.If they can, the prospects of Max Verstappen and his all-in, bullish approach coming up against Hamilton are mouth-watering.And, into the bargain, the Dutchman has a feisty new team-mate in Pierre Gasly. If the Frenchman is close to Verstappen on pace, there could be fireworks.Over the past five years at Red Bull, Daniel Ricciardo has established himself as one of the finest drivers in the sport, arguably the best overtaker - and the funniest guy in the pit lane.The Australian has taken the momentous decision to leave Red Bull and move to Renault, which he calls ""the next step, the next leap, the next challenge"".Many have questioned Ricciardo's move from a team that wins races to one regularly lapped by his former employer in 2018.How will it go? Can he help Renault with their quest to become winners and champions again? Will Renault close at least some of the chasm that separated them as the best of the rest from the top three teams?How will Ricciardo feel if he is lapped by Gasly in what could have been his car? How will he compare with new team-mate Nico Hulkenberg up in what is the German's first opportunity in years to showcase his talent against a genuine top-liner?And, off track, can Ricciardo and his zany sense of fun stay central to the narrative? He deserves more than to be a comic sideshow.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMcLaren and Williams have fallen a long way from their halcyon days, when they dominated the sport for much of the 1980s and 1990s.The two great names had the worst cars on the grid for much of 2018. Both hope the new season will mark the beginnings of a turnaround in fortunes. And both have identified promising young British drivers as part of their revival.At McLaren, Lando Norris joins Spain's Carlos Sainz, following the departure of the legendary Fernando Alonso, who has left F1 to try to win the Indianapolis 500 and complete motorsport's 'triple crown' of Monaco Grand Prix, Le Mans and Indy.Norris is only 19, but has excelled on his way up the ladder and McLaren have great hopes for both him and Sainz. Having identified design flaws in their 2018 car, they expect to make a step forward on the track.Williams, meanwhile, have one of the most fascinating driver line-ups on the grid.Briton George Russell, who beat Norris to the Formula 2 title in 2018, is thought to have extremely big potential. The 20-year-old is partnered by Robert Kubica, returning after an eight-year absence caused by the horrific rally accident in 2011 that left him with a partially severed right arm.Kubica, winner of the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, was one of the sport's most exciting talents. Can the Pole recapture his former level, while driving with a significant disability?Formula 1 bosses have changed the technical rules for 2019 in an attempt to enable cars to race closer together.The front wing has been modified in a way that it is hoped will reduce the effect of so-called 'dirty air' on a car behind.It means a driver trying to overtake should find his car's aerodynamics less badly affected in the wake of a car in front. So he should be able to follow more closely, and overtaking should therefore be a little easier. That's the theory, anyway.The new wings are wider, but much less complicated - and are also less effective at generating downforce.The change has come out of research into a wider set of rule changes for 2021.Technically speaking, the new wing reduces what is known as the 'out-wash effect' - the ability of teams to turn the airflow around the outside of the front tyres, and energise the patterns of flow vortices that are so critical to the ability of modern F1 cars to generate downforce.But, as teams have begun to research the change, scepticism has grown as to whether it will have any significant effect. Teams say they have clawed back most of, if not all, the lost downforce, and they believe any improvement in the ability to follow will be marginal, if it exists at all.The fact the tyres are not changing fundamentally further undermines the belief there will be any noticeable change. Their thermal sensitivity has arguably at least as big an effect on the ability of drivers to follow closely and race hard.The proof is in the pudding, of course. But if the wing change makes little difference, one has to wonder what teams will then say about the likelihood of the 2021 changes working - not that anyone knows what they are yet.Talk about rule changes inevitably leads to questions of politics, which look set to be centre stage in 2019.The teams are in the midst of negotiations with F1's new owner Liberty Media about their contracts for the period after 2020 - when every team's commitment to F1 ends, apart from Renault.Among the most crucial matters to be agreed is how much prize money each team receives.F1 wants to make the money split more equitable, reduce the amount of money the big teams receive, and introduce a budget cap. The leading teams are understandably not keen on any cut in income, even if they accept ways have to be found to reduce costs and bring the field closer together.In theory, F1 could just impose its plans and say take it or leave it. But they don't want to work in that way, not least because the risk is the likes of Mercedes or Ferrari could quit.With the deadline of the end of 2020 getting ever closer, this promises to be one of the defining aspects of the new year."

"Media playback is not supported on this deviceAntonio Felix da Costa won the opening ABB FIA Formula E Championship race of the season in Saudi Arabia.The BMW Andretti driver just held off reigning champion Jean-Eric Vergne after a safety car saw the race bunched up in the closing stages in Ad Diriyah.Da Costa started from pole but slipped behind the Frenchman, before Vergne took a pit penalty for overusing power.Vergne took second with Jerome d'Ambrosio third, while Felipe Massa finished 14th on his Formula E debut.Oliver Rowland was the highest-finishing of the five British drivers in seventh, followed by Sam Bird in 11th.""It's amazing, it's been tough, it's been long months of work and I am really happy with that,"" said Da Costa.""We have got some work to do, but a good start and we will work on that and keep it going.""Da Costa set the early pace, despite a messy start from pole where the Portuguese driver overshot his starting position and began the race at an angle.Vergne produced a smart overtake with 26 of the 45-minute plus one lap race to go, but the TECHEETAH driver dropped back after being handed a drive-through penalty.Da Costa, Massa, Stoffel Vandoorne, Lucas di Grassi and Daniel Abt were the top five drivers to receive a fan boost, as voted for by viewers using an app to determine who gets some extra power during a race.The new 'Attack Mode' also saw drivers take additional risks by moving off the racing line and on to a different area of the track, where the mode is activated to provide the car with a temporary power boost.A yellow flag with 10 minutes remaining saw leader Da Costa reeled back in, producing a flat-out finish after the race restarted with three minutes on the clock.Da Costa activated his Attack Mode off the back of the safety car to quickly re-open a two-second lead and then just about held off a resurgent Vergne.Media playback is not supported on this device12 January 2019: Marrakesh, Morocco26 January 2019: Santiago, Chile16 February 2019: Mexico City10 March 2019: Hong Kong23 March 2019: Sanya, China13 April 2019: Rome, Italy27 April 2019: Paris, France11 May 2019: Monaco25 May 2019: Berlin, Germany22 June 2019: Bern, Switzerland13 and 14 July 2019: New York, USA"

sport	Formula 1: How would the championship standings look without the errors?	AustraliaAzerbaijanFranceAustriaGermanyItalyJapanWhat is the total effect on the championship?	"Sebastian Vettel admitted after the Japanese Grand Prix that he and Ferrari had helped Lewis Hamilton to the verge of a fifth world title by their own failings.""We made it a bit too easy for them in the last couple of races,"" the German said. ""Credit to them, they executed well. But we need to look after ourselves and do our bit and then we see.""Vettel was still clinging on to the hope that he could turn things around in the remaining four races.Yet Hamilton now has a 67-point lead and can tie up the championship if he wins the US Grand Prix on 21 October and Vettel is lower than second. And with the performance advantage Mercedes have suddenly developed in the last three races, a Mercedes one-two looks eminently possible.The errors made by Vettel and Ferrari have been a defining story of the season. But just how would the championship be poised if they - and Mercedes - had had error-free seasons?In other words, just how ""easy"" have Ferrari and Vettel made it for Hamilton?The first major error of the season came in the opening race, when Mercedes miscalculated the gap Hamilton needed to keep the lead under a virtual safety car period, and Ferrari stole the win for Vettel.The result was that Hamilton was second when he should have won, Vettel the other way around.Result:Vettel goes from second (18 points) to first (25 points). He gains seven pointsHamilton goes from first to second. He loses seven pointsNet effect: Vettel +14 pointsA potential win for Vettel becomes a fourth place. Ferrari pitted Vettel too early, responding to Hamilton's early stop, which was a result of him locking a wheel and damaging a tyre. That gave Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas the lead.At a re-start after a late race safety-car, Vettel locked up and ran wide trying to re-pass the Finn, and slipped back to finish fourth. Meanwhile, Hamilton won the race after Bottas suffered a puncture.Result:Ignoring chaos theory and assuming Bottas would have had his puncture anyway, Hamilton turns a second place (18 points) behind Vettel into a win (25 points): Plus sevenVettel and Ferrari turn a win (25 points) into a fourth (12). Minus 13Net effect: Vettel -20 pointsVettel crashes into Bottas at the first corner, spins to the back and recovers to fourth.Result:A driver error from Vettel turns a potential third place (15 points) behind a Mercedes one-two into a fifth (10 points). Minus five points.Net effect: Vettel -5 pointsVettel is given a three-place grid penalty for impeding Renault's Carlos Sainz in qualifying. The driver does not realise Sainz is there and Ferrari do not warn him. Vettel is demoted from third place on the grid behind the two Mercedes to sixth, putting him behind eventual winner Max Verstappen's Red Bull.Result:Vettel and Ferrari turn a potential win (25 points), following the retirement of both Mercedes, into a third place (15 points): Minus 10 points.Net effect: Vettel -10 pointsVettel crashes out of the lead in a late-race rain shower. Hamilton wins the race.Result:Vettel retires (zero points) from a race he should have won (25 points): -25 points.Hamilton wins a race in which he would likely have been second (18 points): Plus seven points.Net effect: Vettel -32 pointsIt is Kimi Raikkonen's turn to run last in qualifying - Ferrari have a system whereby the drivers alternate race to race. But in Monza, following another car gives a gain of about 0.3secs a lap because of the effect of the slipstream.Ferrari choose not to reverse the order of the two cars, despite Vettel being their only title contender, and Raikkonen takes pole from Vettel by 0.161secs.Before the race, Ferrari tell Raikkonen that he will not be retained in 2019. Raikkonen defends the lead from Vettel after the start, through the first chicane and approaching the second.Hamilton takes advantage and passes Vettel around the outside into the second chicane. Vettel crashes into Hamilton and spins to the back. Hamilton beats Raikkonen to the win.Result:Vettel and Ferrari turn a potential win (25 points) into a fourth place (12 points) through poor race management and a driver error - minus 13 points.Giving Ferrari the benefit of the doubt, let's say Hamilton would have beaten one of the Ferraris anyway with a drive of the quality he produced and say he turned a second (18 points) into first (25). Plus seven.Net effect: Vettel -20 pointsBoth Ferrari and Vettel made mistakes in qualifying - Ferrari by fitting intermediate tyres for a dry track and Vettel in going off on his only dry lap in final qualifying once he had fitted slicks.That meant Vettel started eighth instead of a likely third. And in the race he tripped over Red Bull's Max Verstappen, which he would otherwise have been ahead of.Result:Vettel finished sixth (eight points) when he could have finished third (15 points).Net effect: Vettel -7 pointsAdding all that up brings a total net loss to Vettel of 80 points. Which means, had Ferrari had a perfect season, he could still be leading the championship by 13 points.That might not have changed the end result of the championship. Mercedes have made a big step forward in performance in the last three races and developed a significant advantage. If that is maintained over the remaining four grands prix, it is hard to see how Vettel could defend that lead.At the same time, Hamilton has driven arguably his best season, and has been sensational in snatching some of the wins. It could easily be argued that only his genius put him in a position to win the races in Germany, Italy, Singapore and Russia, for example.But, taking nothing away from Hamilton, it does go to show just how much easier Ferrari and Vettel have made it for him."
sport	Formula E: Mexico City E-Prix is the fourth race of the 2018-19 season and will test the drivers	Recap: How does Formula E work?Fan Boost and Attack ModeHow are the big names doing?How they stand - after three races of 13Formula E socialWhere and when are the races?	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceAfter the hottest race in Formula E history, the series moves on to Mexico City for the fourth round of a sizzling season.Great Britain's Sam Bird, who finished second in the championship last season, leads the standings, having finished third in round two in Morocco before a victory last time out in Chile.With temperatures reaching 45C on track in Santiago, Bird kept his cool to win the third of 13 races in the 2018-19 campaign.The Envision Virgin Racing driver finished ahead of former Formula 1 driver Pascal Wehrlein, with Germany's Daniel Abt inheriting third after Britain's Alexander Sims was bumped down to seventh because of a time penalty for causing a collision with Edoardo Mortara.""The team put in an amazing effort at the last race in Chile for us to come away with the win, but we're barely a quarter of the way through the season so we must be pragmatic and take each race as it comes,"" said Bird.""For me, the Mexico E-Prix has previously brought mixed results, so we'll have to see. As always, we'll give it our all and aim to come away with a good points haul.""It was a second successive disappointment for Sims, who had crashed into team-mate - and race leader - Antonio Felix da Costa late on in Morocco. That forced Sims down from second to fourth, and Da Costa out of the race altogether.Coverage of the Mexico City E-Prix is live on the BBC Red Button, Connected TV, the BBC Sport website and BBC iPlayer from 21:30 GMT on Saturday, with a full replay of the race available on the BBC Red Button later on Sunday.British-based Envision Virgin Racing are top of the team standings with Bird's team-mate, Dutchman Robin Frijns, fourth overall.Media playback is not supported on this device""The aim in Mexico City is to capitalise on our current momentum and look to extend our championship lead,"" said managing director Sylvain Filippi.""But I've been involved in Formula E since the beginning, so I know anything is possible in this championship and, of course, how competitive the current field of teams and drivers is.""The Mexico City E-Prix will again be held at the city's Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit, although using a shorter, modified version incorporating the famous Peraltada final corner and the spectacular stadium section.The 17-turn clockwise circuit is 2.093km long, with Saturday's race lasting 45 minutes plus one lap.The Mexico City E-Prix has been part of the Formula E season since season two and there have been three different winners - Jerome d'Ambrosio in 2016, Lucas di Grassi in 2017 and Abt in 2018.It will be another tough test for the drivers with temperatures again predicted to be high on Saturday. Humidity will play a factor as the circuit is 2,285m (7,500ft) above sea level.Media playback is not supported on this deviceCompared with some of its carbon-belching cousins, Formula E is considerably more friendly to the environment.The sport was developed with sustainability in mind, with organisers saying the aim is to ""reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible"".It does this by powering its cars with a battery that uses 100% renewable fuel, and tyres that - as well as lasting an entire race - can also be recycled afterwards. Meanwhile, spectators are encouraged to use public transport to get to events, with no public parking available.One drawback with battery-powered cars is they have not had the capacity to last an entire race, resulting in the rather unusual (and somewhat gimmicky) sight of drivers having to swap cars mid-race.That will no longer happen - this season's Gen2 car is fitted with a battery that will last from start to finish.With the car manufacturing world looking to switch to developing almost exclusively electric cars within the next couple of decades, Formula E provides them with the ideal arena to test new technology at a competitive level.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSpectators play a key role in the action during Formula E races.'Fan boost' has been a feature of the past few seasons, with viewers able to vote using an app to determine which driver gets some extra power during a race.New this season is 'Attack Mode', which gives competitors a speed boost after they drive through an allocated area on the track.Former Ferrari and Williams driver Felipe Massa, runner-up in the Formula 1 world championship in 2008, has signed a three-year contract to race for Monaco-based Venturi.But the Brazilian has had a difficult start in the all-electric series; he was 17th in Saudi Arabia, 18th in Morocco and failed to finish in Chile.Stoffel Vandoorne, Fernando Alonso's F1 team-mate at McLaren for the past two seasons, has also made the switch to Formula E and is racing for HWA Racelab.The Belgian made a good start by qualifying in fourth place in Saudi Arabia, but technical problems with the car meant he was only 16th in the race, and then failed to finish the past two races.Mahindra Racing's Wehrlein missed the opening race because he was still under contract in F1 and an early technical issue saw his race in Morocco end prematurely. But, in only his second ever Formula E race, he came second in Chile to jump up to ninth in the overall standings.Maximilian Gunther (Ger, GEOX Dragon), Tom Dillman (Fra, NIO Formula E Team), Gary Paffett (GB, HWA Racelab), Stoffel Vandoorne (Bel, HWA Racelab), Felipe Massa (Bra, Venturi Formula E team) and Felix Rosenqvist (Swe, Mahindra Racing) have all failed to score a point.15 December, 2018: Ad Diriyah, Saudi Arabia. 1.

Last year, the Briton said he thought Yamamoto was talented enough to be in F1.Yamamoto said driving an F1 car had been ""a dream of mine since I was a kid"", adding that he first watched them in action at Suzuka 27 years ago.""To get this chance at Suzuka - a very important circuit for all Japanese racing drivers - in front of such a big crowd of Japanese fans, will make the experience even more special,"" he said.""I have prepared as well as possible for this, spending time as part of the Toro Rosso team at several grand prix weekends, and I have also worked in the Red Bull simulator.""I want to enjoy the experience of driving an F1 car as much as possible and I will be trying my very best to get the most out of it.""Katsuhide Moriyama, head of brand and communications at Honda, said: ""We hope Naoki makes the most of this opportunity, that he learns from it and that it helps him as a racing driver.""We also hope that seeing Yamamoto on track will serve as an inspiration to young Japanese drivers, so that in the near future we can once again have Japanese drivers competing in Formula 1.""The senior Red Bull team, who also use Honda engines, have yet to confirm who will partner Max Verstappen next year, but motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has been quoted saying the seat is between Alexander Albon, who was promoted in place of Gasly in the summer, and the Frenchman.Marko has also said Russian Kvyat will stay at Toro Rosso in 2020.Honda have been planning their engine usage in recent races to ensure all four of their cars are in the best possible competitive shape for the home grand prix.The race weekend faces the possibility of being affected by typhoon Hagibis, which is in the western Pacific Ocean and tracking towards Japan.

sport	Women-only motorsport series launched to find potential Formula 1 stars	Brute strength 'not required'What do official women's bodies say?Why a women-only series?'If I could, I would race 365 days a year'	"A new women-only motorsport series has been launched in an attempt to find potential female Formula 1 stars.W Series will start in 2019 and is backed by a number of major F1 names, including 13-time grand prix winner David Coulthard and Red Bull design chief Adrian Newey.Coulthard said he believed men and women could compete on equal terms in motorsport.He said the existing structure had ""not worked"" in finding a top woman driver.The last woman to start an F1 grand prix was Italy's Lella Lombardi in 1976.Coulthard said: ""If you want a fundamental change in the outcome, you need a fundamental change in the process. W is a fundamental change in creating an opportunity to bring through female talent to the highest possible level.""Newey, designer of cars that have won 20 F1 drivers' and constructors' titles with Williams, McLaren and Red Bull, added: ""I have a reasonable understanding of the constituents of a top-class driver's necessary skill set. And brute strength isn't on that list.""That being the case, I believe the reason why so few women have so far raced successfully at the highest levels against men is a lack of opportunity rather than a lack of capability.""W Series aims to attract up to 20 of the world's leading female racing drivers to compete for a $1.5m (£1.14m) prize fund across six races in Europe, and will include a round in the UK. The cars will be identical and be provided and run by the championship.The championship is free to enter, and competitors will be selected through a programme that assesses their abilities. The winner will receive $500,000 (£381,000) to help further her career, as well as support and advice from the experts employed by the series.Coulthard said he ""absolutely"" believed women could succeed in F1.""Can they be as good as Lewis Hamilton? I don't know,"" the 47-year-old said. ""But I do know there are an awful lot of men in F1 who are not as good as Lewis.""So if we don't create a platform that may give an opportunity to accelerate that access, then nothing is going to change.""Michele Mouton, a world rally winner in the 1980s and president of the Women in Motorsport Commission for governing body the FIA, said: ""One of the objectives of the commission is to help ensure females have equal opportunities to compete at the highest level of the sport.""We know from our recent driver-assessment programme that there is a pool of very talented women drivers who deserve the chance to do this.""As competitors, they want to be the best and the only way for them to benchmark their performance is to compete in a mixed environment, which they are already doing.""While this new series is obviously giving an opportunity for women to showcase their talent in a female-only environment, our objective is to have more of them competing alongside men and demonstrating they have the same ability and potential to succeed in top-level FIA championships.""Former Williams test driver Susie Wolff, who is a member of Mouton's organisation and has launched a programme to promote female participation in grassroots motorsport, said: ""I respect anything that sets out to inspire and promote women in motorsport.""My view on this, and I know that this is the shared position of the organisations I work with, is that we should continue to encourage and create opportunities for women to compete on the same level as men.""We fundamentally believe that the best opportunity to identify top female talent is by facilitating a dynamic where more women can compete and rise to the top in a mixed competition on equal terms.""Coulthard argued that W Series would identify the leading existing female talent and help them progress their careers.He said finding talented young women and bringing them through the existing feeder categories, as the FIA proposes, would take ""a generation"".He added: ""Our view is we don't want to wait a generation. We welcome that generation of young women racers coming through, but this is providing a solution right now.""Catherine Bond Muir, the chief executive of W Series, said: ""We aim to bring the sport up to date and show the world just what women are really capable of.""Of all the many thousands of people involved in the technical side of our sport across the globe, only a handful are women. Our mission is to change all of that.""Jamie Chadwick, who made history in August as the first woman to win a British Formula 3 race, said that W Series is an opportunity for female drivers.She said: ""It's no secret that motorsport is an incredibly tough industry often dictated by financial factors.""As a funded championship, W Series not only offers a fantastic opportunity for top female talent to race but will also encourage many more young females to enter the sport.""I'm a racing driver and, if I could, I would race 365 days of the year.""I will still race against men in other championships but W Series is the perfect supplement to help me develop and progress further through the junior motorsport ranks. I'm excited about what's to come.""Former F3 and GP3 racer Alice Powell, sportscar driver Stephane Kox and British racer Vicky Piria backed the series as a ""positive"" development for women in motorsport.Powell added: ""It's also an important means to an end - a stepping stone for female drivers on their journeys from the lower formulae to more senior single-seater series, taking the skills they've learned in W Series on the way."""

sport	Formula 1: Vietnam capital Hanoi to host country's first grand prix in 2020	Taking inspiration from other tracksAnalysis	"Vietnam will host a Formula 1 grand prix for the first time in April 2020.A ""multi-year"" deal has been agreed to stage a race on the streets of the capital Hanoi.It is the first new addition to the calendar under Liberty Media's ownership of the sport.""Since we became involved in this sport in 2017, we have talked about developing new destination cities to broaden the appeal of Formula 1,"" said F1's chief executive Chase Carey.""The Vietnamese Grand Prix is a realisation of that ambition.""The proposed Hanoi track, which features 22 turns over its 5.565km length, will become F1's fourth street race, along with Monaco, Singapore and Azerbaijan.The circuit layout, created in collaboration with ubiquitous F1 designer Hermann Tilke, also features long straights, one of which is 1.5km in length and should see cars reach speeds of around 335km/h (208mph).The design also borrows liberally from other world-famous tracks.The first two corners mirror those of Germany's Nurburgring, while Turns 12 to 15 are inspired by a section of the Monaco street circuit, running from Sainte-Devote up the hill to Massenet.Turns 16-19 echo the sweeping Esses at Suzuka and the final three corners take inspiration from Malaysia's Sepang.Carey added that work had been done to ""enable a circuit that will not only test the drivers but also ensure that our fans enjoy the racing spectacle"".""It's a further demonstration of Vietnam's ability, as one of the fastest growing economies in the world to host events on a global scale and attract tourism to the country,"" said city of Hanoi chairman Nguyen Duc Chung.The Vietnam Grand Prix is the third race to be established in south-east Asia following Singapore and Malaysia - the latter being scrapped following the 2017 race due to poor ticket sales.BBC chief F1 writer Andrew BensonThe Vietnam Grand Prix is the first entirely new race introduced to the Formula 1 calendar since US group Liberty Media took over the sport at the start of last year.As such, it is a triumph for F1's owners - and a much-needed one, following the apparent collapse of plans for what they hoped would be a signature race in Miami. That has become mired in local politics, has already been delayed from its intended debut in 2019 and insiders say now probably won't happen.A race in Vietnam is part of F1's bid to expand interest in the sport. It effectively returns an event to south-east Asia that was lost when Malaysia ended its contract last year, but does so in a new location and iconic city - albeit some distance from its beautiful, historic centre.Hanoi's date in April underlines F1's desire ultimately to organise the calendar by geography - with the Asian races early in the season, Europe in the middle and the Americas at the end.But that's not proving easy because of existing contracts and the desires of certain hosts - such as Japan - to keep their current dates.And questions about the future of the calendar remain.Will Hanoi be an extra race, or fill a gap left by another? There are doubts over the long-term future of three key historic races in Britain, Germany and Brazil, none of which have contracts beyond 2019.Meanwhile, F1 wants to expand the schedule to as many as 25 races, while many of the teams don't want it to rise above the existing 21.And the sport itself is going through a period of uncertainty, with income dropping and talks dragging on over new regulations for beyond 2020 on cost control, revenue distribution and the cars themselves."
sport	Sergio Perez: Force India keep Mexican driver for 2019 Formula 1 season	How to follow the United States Grand Prix on BBC Sport	"Sergio Perez will stay with Force India for the 2019 Formula 1 season.The 28-year-old Mexican has been with the team since 2014 and is seventh in the drivers' championship with seven points finishes in the past nine races.Perez has been credited with fending off a winding-up petition against the team by starting administration proceedings earlier this year, saving all 405 jobs at their Silverstone base.""I'm very happy to finally announce my future,"" said Perez.""We've achieved so much success in the last five seasons but I think the best is yet to come.""Perez's team-mate next season is expected to be Williams' Lance Stroll, son of Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll - the man who led the takeover of the team by a consortium in the summer.The administration proceedings were triggered by Perez - who was owed salary payments - as part of an agreement with management to save the team, which was in financial difficulties related to the legal problems of then-owner Vijay Mallya.In return, Perez was guaranteed a seat in 2019 at Force India, for whom his Mexican sponsorship backing is important.""The new investment the team is enjoying fills me with confidence and I'm really excited about the future,"" said Perez, who came third in Azerbaijan in April and fifth in Belgium in August.Team principal Otmar Szafnauer said: ""I'm pleased that Sergio will continue his journey with us in 2019. Over the last five years he has confirmed his position as one of the most talented and consistent drivers on the Formula 1 grid.""Frenchman Esteban Ocon, Perez's current team-mate, is 11th in the drivers' championship, four points behind Perez, but faces an uncertain future in the sport.The Mercedes-contracted driver could be without a seat in F1 next year, although he has been in talks with Williams, who are yet to confirm who will partner 20-year-old Briton George Russell.BBC Sport has live coverage of all the season's races on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, plus live online commentary on the BBC Sport website and mobile app - including audience interaction, expert analysis, debate, voting, features, interviews and video content.All times BST and are subject to change at short notice."
sport	Scottish Premiership: What did we learn from the weekend's games?	Bad form may continue for CountySt Mirren call on defensive fortitude	"There was no international hangover for the Old Firm as reigning champions Celtic and nearest challengers Rangers continued where they left off before the break with victories that keep them neck and neck at the top of the Scottish Premiership.There were plenty of talking points elsewhere too, with contrasting fortunes at Hearts and Hibs after management changes and St Johnstone managing to pick up a point despite having two players sent off.Here are the 12 takeaways from the weekend matches...Two managers in Glasgow smilingIt was a day when James Forrest added another two goals to his Celtic tally, 18-year-old right-back Jeremie Frimpong put in a performance that manager Neil Lennon described as the best he had ever seen and, crucially, it was a 4-0 win as the Glasgow side maintained top spot ahead of their Old Firm rivals Rangers.But the story of the 4-0 win over Livingston was the return of Leigh Griffiths.Celtic have not done too badly without him since they lost 2-0 to the same side at the start of October, winning six from six in the Premiership, beating Lazio home and away in the Europa League and reaching the League Cup final.But, with the title race looking like it will be the tightest in years, a treble to defend and a Europa League last-32 place to look forward to, Griffiths' return is a welcome one for manager Neil Lennon. A few miles further south at Hampden Park, a certain Steve Clarke will be punching the air too at having the 29-year-old back in contention for a Scotland call-up.Kent on song as Rangers leave it late to make points safeRyan Kent scored his first goals of the season as Rangers beat Hamilton Academical 3-1.The first was a fantastic strike, with manager Steven Gerrard describing the fizzing shot into the top corner as ""world class"", while the second was a composed finish deep into stoppage time.The £7m winger is not quite 100% fit after his summer move from Liverpool - a daunting thought for opposition full-backs.Gerrard also described the 3-1 victory at Hamilton as ""very mixed"" and will know his side need to improve on moments of defensive slackness when it comes to Thursday's Europa League trip to face Feyenoord. Jermain Defoe had scored four in his last two outings against Accies but looked out of sorts up front before Alfredo Morelos came off the bench late on to lay on Kent's second goal and underline his status as the club's 'alpha striker'.Aberdeen miss creative spark from midfieldAberdeen have one of the league's best defences and one of its most potent attackers in Sam Cosgrove. The Englishman's goal against St Johnstone, his 17th of the league season, was a joy to behold but was more a piece of individual brilliance than the result of a flowing attacking move.A ponderous attack has been a common theme for Aberdeen this term, with their midfield stacked with holding players of a similar mould and Jon Gallagher not hitting heights that might have been expected after good performances earlier in the season. Manager Derek McInnes is missing someone like Ryan Christie or James Maddison, who both spent time on loan at Pittodrie before going on to flourish, to add another dimension to their attack.Perhaps, once Funso Ojo and Craig Bryson return to full fitness, the dynamic Lewis Ferguson could be pushed forward to fulfil that role.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMotherwell lack cutting edgeAlthough Hibs deserve plenty of praise for their 3-1 victory at Easter Road, it was by no means a poor performance from Motherwell. Stephen Robinson's side started brightly and deserved their early lead when Liam Polworth struck after nine minutes.Unfortunately for them, that sparked Hibs into life, with Jack Ross' side producing their most scintillating half of the season to turn the game on its head. But, over the course of the game, the visitors edged the possession, had one more shot than Hibs and had 10 corners compared to just one for the hosts.""What you do in the two 18-yard boxes is what counts,"" Robinson said. ""We didn't finish chances when we had them and we didn't stay with runners and got punished for that.""That was Motherwell's main problem - they failed to create any significant goal-scoring opportunities after taking the lead, while Hibs were able to carve them out relatively easily. They're now without a clean sheet in their last six games and will be hoping to put that right when St Johnstone visit Fir Park on Saturday.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBurke rolls back the yearsAngelo Alessio said: ""I see Chris Burke every day and he seems not to be 35 years old. He's like a young man."" The former Scotland winger was sensational as he scored twice in a 3-0 win over Hearts. Young left-back Aaron Hickey will be having nightmares about Burke running at him, while Michael Smith will be having cold sweats thinking about backing off as the Kilmarnock man charged at him for the best part of 50 yards before scoring.Burke has Mohamed El Makrini to thank for his unselfish play in setting up the game's first goal before the Scot turned provider for Eamonn Brophy's sublime header.Although Kilmarnock were frustrated by the scrappy nature of the second half, at no point did the hosts look like throwing this one away. With the damage done early on, they could afford to spend time on the ball and make Hearts do all the work.With two wins, two defeats and a draw in their last five games, Alessio will be looking to turn this dominant performance into a run of consistent results that could be the foundation for a successful term for the Ayrshire side.Media playback is not supported on this deviceRoss County hit the ground running at the start of the season with a run of form during which they lost just three of their opening 10 games in all competitions. However, such lofty heights now seem like a lifetime ago.Indeed, Saturday's defeat by St Mirren was an eighth consecutive league game without a win for the Highland side and just two points won from their last five is undoubtedly the kind of form that could result in the Dingwall side getting dragged into a relegation battle.Co-managers Steven Ferguson and Stuart Kettlewell's next task is to take points off Celtic before Hibs, Rangers and Kilmarnock await. Hardly the type of games you wish for when trying to resolve problems with your side.Media playback is not supported on this deviceToo early for panic at LiviLivingston's defeat by Celtic left them without a win in six games. They have not won since beating the Parkhead side since October.But playing Celtic and Rangers back to back is not easy for any team. Prior to that, they had posted draws with Hibs and Hearts, while only a late Allan Campbell goal denied them another point at Fir Park against Motherwell. Two international breaks in that time have made it seem like an age since they last picked up three points.On the horizon, though, four of their next five games come against teams currently occupying the bottom six. Three of them are at home at a venue where only Aberdeen and Rangers have defeated Livingston this season.After that, a truer picture will begin to emerge of how the season is likely to pan out for Gary Holt's side.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAccies ready for 'a dogfight'Hamilton forward Mickel Miller will be kicking himself after a quite remarkable miss, squandering a close-range chance to bring his side level for a second time.However, manager Brian Rice saw plenty to be pleased with as his side stayed in the game right up until Ryan Kent made it 3-1 to Rangers in stoppage time.""We are going to be in a dogfight,"" Rice said. ""Let's not make any mistakes about that. There are going to be five or six teams in a dogfight and we are going to be one of them.""But I'll tell you one thing: we are always up for a fight. You saw a team out there that never gave up. They play for one another, for me and for the club. There will be good days and there will be bad days.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceAustin MacPhee's managerial bid dealt a blowBefore kick-off, interim Hearts manager Austin MacPhee said he wanted ""to get on the front foot"" against Kilmarnock. After 19 minutes, his side were 3-0 down.This performance will set alarm bells ringing for MacPhee if he is serious about getting the job on a permanent basis. Hearts looked flat and disorganised and it wasn't until the second half when they looked capable of a comeback.Craig Levein's former assistant was audibly disappointed after not capitalising on his side's home win against St Mirren before the international break. Where in that game Hearts were dominant and controlled the second half, this weekend, the capital side struggled to make any impact. Aaron Hickey was utterly outplayed down his left side as veteran Chris Burke rolled back the years and the youngster was hooked at half-time to spare his blushes.While Saturday's clash with Ross County was almost defined by St Mirren's inability to convert chances into goals, the result itself was built upon strong, defensive foundations that have been evident since the start of the season.Jim Goodwin's side have only conceded two games at home this season. No other team in the Premiership can boast a better record than that and it is considerably better than the nine and 14 goals Hamilton and St Johnston have respectively shipped in front of their own fans so far this season.Which may explain why St Mirren are now above them in the table.Hibs find winning formulaJack Ross' first week at Hibernian could not have gone much better. A convincing win at home to one of the Premiership's in-form teams is exactly how he would have wanted to start his time at Easter Road.Although, by his own admission, Ross did not have to do too much preparation for this game. Last week's interim manager, Eddie May, had produced a 4-1 win away at St Johnstone as a blueprint for Ross to follow - and so he did. A completely unchanged line-up and, but for a slow opening nine minutes, it worked like a charm.Hibs' strike duo - Christian Doidge and Florian Kamberi - proved once again to be a handful, with both getting on the score-sheet. Vykintas Slivka and Melker Hallberg dominated and controlled the middle of the park. Ryan Porteous and Paul Hanlon dealt comfortably with the barrage of crosses and corners sent into their box, although the former may have been lucky to avoid giving away a penalty and consequently earning a second yellow card.Nonetheless, it was a very good performance from top to bottom, offering entertaining, attacking football with a solid base off the ball. Unless Ross feels the need to rotate the squad and rest players, it would be a surprise to see any changes for Tuesday's trip to St Mirren.Sparkling Kennedy needs helpMatty Kennedy grabbed the all-important equaliser for St Johnstone against Aberdeen on Saturday as the Perth side moved level on points with the three teams above them at the foot of the table.The winger's pace and superb finish for the goal was far from his only contribution, though, as he rampaged down the left flank to give Aberdeen right-back Shay Logan a torrid afternoon.However, Tommy Wright's side have scored just 13 Premiership goals so far this season, the second fewest, with Kennedy their top scorer in the league with three. The Northern Irishman needs more from strikers Stevie May and Callum Hendry - and their other forward players - if they are to steer clear of relegation. Particularly as their defensive record is the second worst in the Premiership."

Surviving was incredible,"" said Frits van Amersfoort, the owner of Van Amersfoort Racing.""We reckon she was travelling at 276km/h (171.6mph) at the time.""Florsch posted on social media on Sunday to say she will have surgery on her broken vertebrae on Monday.She hit the back of Jehan Daruvala's car on lap four and then launched over the inside kerb into the car of Sho Tsuboi. That impact catapulted her car over the barrier and into an area occupied by marshals and photographers.Van Amersfoot described the 20-minute period that followed as ""one of the worst of my life"".""We got some information from social media while we were waiting at the door of race control, but when you look at those images it is heartbreaking so we were thinking of the worst,"" the Dutchman told BBC Radio 5 live.""It took quite a long time before the race control could say anything about the health of Sophia - everyone can imagine that's not a nice thing to have.""I don't think I've ever seen anything like this. I haven't seen all accidents in motorsport but this was surely one of the worst I've ever seen.""We were lucky that she was flying because she went over a barrier. If she had hit the barrier it would have gone a lot worse.""Jean Todt, the president of motorsport's governing body, the FIA, has said Sunday's crash - which came a year after British motorcyclist Daniel Hegarty became the eighth rider to be killed on the circuit since 1973 - will be investigated.""The FIA is mobilised to help those involved and analyse what happened,"" he posted on social media. ""We will monitor the situation and make the necessary conclusions.""Japanese driver Tsuboi was taken to hospital with back pain, while race organisers said two photographers and a marshal were also taken to hospital.Photographer Minami Hiroyuki was taken in with concussion, while marshal Chan Cha In suffered a fractured facial bone and lacerations.

sport	Formula 1: New engine formula from 2021 announced		"Formula 1 has revealed its plans for a new engine formula from 2021.The proposals are aimed at reducing costs, ""improving the sound"", increasing competitiveness between teams and maintaining road relevance.The plan is to retain a 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid but to remove one of the two ways currently used to generate hybrid power.Engines will run at a higher speed and the drivers will have greater control over hybrid energy deployment.The key proposals, which are an attempt to improve the racing, were presented to teams by governing body the FIA and new F1 owners Liberty Media at a meeting in Paris on Tuesday.The proposals are:It is hoped the new formula will enable smaller, private engine companies to enter F1 and compete with the manufacturers and attract other car companies into the sport.The move follows months of work by the FIA and F1 Group, which was taken over by US group Liberty Media, and is recognition that the current engine has significant flaws.It has produced engines that have created a revolution in terms of efficiency but they have failed to excite fans, partly because of their limited noise, and the smaller teams feel they are too expensive.A joint statement by the FIA and F1 said the proposals would now be ""discussed and developed"" by interested parties in a series of meetings ""in the spirit of the widest possible co-operation"".However, if the FIA and F1 are in agreement, the teams do not have enough power within F1's rule-making procedure to block them - unless Ferrari objects and decides to use a veto over new rules it has enshrined in its contracts with the sport.Ross Brawn, F1 managing director motorsports, emphasised the proposals had arisen from ""a series of meetings with the F1 teams and the manufacturers who showed their interest to be part of the pinnacle of motor sport"".He added: ""We've carefully listened to what the fans think about the current (engine) and what they would like to see in the near future with the objective to define a set of regulations which will provide a powertrain that is simpler, cheaper and noisier and will create the conditions to facilitate new manufacturers to enter Formula 1 as powertrain suppliers and to reach a more levelled field in the sport.""The new F1 has the target to be the world's leading global sports competition married to state of the art technology. To excite, engage, and awe fans of all ages but to do so in a sustainable manner. We believe that the future power unit will achieve this."""
sport	Formula 1: George Russell joins Williams to become third British driver in 2019	A 'perfect progression'Lessons from HamiltonAmbitions for WilliamsWho will drive the other car?	"George Russell will become the third British driver in Formula 1 next year after signing to race for Williams.The 20-year-old, a Mercedes protege and leader of this year's Formula Two championship, has secured what Williams describe as a ""multi-year contract"".""I feel on top of the world,"" Russell told BBC Sport. ""It has been a lifelong dream to make it to F1 ever since I started racing when I was seven.""It was a long road. Suddenly it's here and it just feels amazing.""Russell said he would remain a Mercedes young driver but added: ""As of 2019, I am fully contracted to Williams and that is my 100% full focus.""Russell joins Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and fellow rookie Lando Norris at McLaren to make the largest British contingent on the grid since 2016.Deputy team principal Claire Williams said: ""We have always tried to promote and develop young talent at Williams, and George fits that ethos perfectly.""He is already highly regarded in the paddock and a driver whose career we have been watching for a while.""In the time we have spent with him so far, we believe that he will be a great fit for our team. His commitment, passion and dedication are exactly what we need.""Russell said he felt ""extremely well prepared"" for F1 after two years in the Mercedes young driver programme, including a series of test outings and two appearances in practice sessions for Force India last year.In an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, he said: ""I have been very fortunate with the guidance and opportunity Mercedes have given me over the past two years.""I have never been thrown in at the deep end. I started off with a private test in a 2015 car at the start of last year before getting the opportunity to test the 2017 car in Budapest and then into the P1 sessions with Force India.""It has been a perfect progression and slope into a full-time race seat and I really feel that now I am ready for this.""In his role as reserve driver for Mercedes, Russell said he had learned valuable lessons from four-time world champion Lewis Hamilton and his team.""It has been an incredible opportunity for me to see how he approaches and deals with a race weekend from within,"" Russell said.""He is portrayed as a guy who from the outside maybe doesn't look as interested in F1 as he does other aspects of life, but he is extremely motivated and really works hard to get the best out of all of his people.""Just seeing how he approaches situations and the relationships was a great insight for me.""My goal is to become F1 world champion one day and to do that I have to be the best, and learning from someone like the Mercedes team and from Lewis is a great opportunity and showed me that you cannot just rely on talent alone.""All the latest F1 GossipWilliams are one of the most successful teams in F1 history but they are in the midst of their worst-ever season and are poised to finish last in the constructors' championship.Russell said he believed the team were making ""a number of changes in the factory"" to return to higher levels of performance, after a ""tough"" season.""F1 is not just about the driver or the car. You all have to work together to get the best out of each other, and that is something I am really going to be working on - on building these relationships within the team, having trust from all aspects that we are all on the same page and all going in the same direction.""Russell said he believed Williams could target returning to a position as 'best of the rest' behind leading teams Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull - saying ""fighting for podiums"" was a ""realistic target"".Williams have not yet signed a driver for the second car alongside Russell.Canadian Lance Stroll is leaving the team at the end of the year to join Force India. This has not yet been officially confirmed but is an open secret within F1. The 19-year-old's father Lawrence Stroll led a consortium of businessmen that rescued Force India when it went into administration in the summer and wants his son to drive for his own team.Stroll's team-mate, the Russian Sergey Sirotkin, could retain his drive, while another possibility is that Williams promote reserve driver Robert Kubica to a race seat.A year ago, Williams intended to give the Pole a race seat in 2018, more than seven years after his career was curtailed by life-changing injuries sustained in a horrific rally crash in February 2011.In the end, Sirotkin was preferred, after impressing in a test at Abu Dhabi after the end of last season.But Sirotkin's performances have not made a compelling case for him to be retained and the team are considering whether there might be better options."

sport	Formula 1: Is Kimi Raikkonen right to stay in F1? - Jolyon Palmer	Why it's good to take risks on driversLeclerc the right call for FerrariGasly also a good call for Red BullSome great talent missing outShould Raikkonen have quit?Big hopes for Norris	Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault during the 2017 season, has joined the BBC team to offer insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors.The Singapore Grand Prix wasn't a classic by any means. Lewis Hamilton took a good step closer to the title with a dominant victory, but while the 2018 title fight is starting to fizzle out, there is already plenty to get excited about for 2019.This year's driver-transfer market has probably been the most interesting I can remember. There have been so many switches, resulting in plenty of new pairings and match-ups that will be fascinating to watch in 2019. It looks like of all 10 teams, only Mercedes will remain unchanged.The most exciting changes for me are two movers into top teams - Charles Leclerc to Ferrari and Pierre Gasly to Red Bull.It is always interesting to see new, young faces in top drives, and down the years it's actually been very rare that a young star has failed to deliver when a top team has taken a risk on them.In the last decade, Red Bull took a chance with Max Verstappen, Daniel Ricciardo, Sebastian Vettel and McLaren with Lewis Hamilton, and all went on to win races or championships for those teams and be extremely successful.The only exceptions have probably been Daniil Kvyat - who arguably was promoted too soon at Red Bull in 2015 and subsequently dropped - and Heikki Kovalainen, who replaced Fernando Alonso at McLaren in 2008.Kovalainen won a race and Kvyat had a few podiums, but they both failed to reach the heights expected of them at the time of the move.All in all, the stats say that teams who make bold driver choices benefit from them. I think it's not only good for the sport to see new faces in the hunt to win races in the top teams, but it's also good for those teams as well.A couple of months ago, Vettel stated a preference to retain Kimi Raikkonen as his team-mate next year. Of course he would. As a driver, you are always compared to your team-mate and Vettel has had the measure of Raikkonen for four years now.Raikkonen is a fair driver, who doesn't involve himself in too much politics and gets on with Vettel. It's a harmonious relationship within the team, but a fresh new youngster will be a different thing for Vettel to deal with and he may need to up his game again.After Vettel had won four straight world championships at Red Bull, Ricciardo replaced the retiring Mark Webber as his team-mate in 2014 and immediately beat the German, in a team that was built around him after a dominant era.Ferrari are poised to see another title slip through their hands right now as Hamilton seems imperious and Vettel has made a few too many mistakes in comparison this year.Vettel's errors ultimately may end up costing him this title, but overall he has been extremely good. The fact he is still 67 points ahead of Raikkonen in spite of those mistakes tells you the level he can operate at. But Hamilton's season has been unbelievable, faultless; his best in Formula 1 in my opinion.Fresh motivation and impetus in the team for next year in the form of the very promising rookie Leclerc is a big step in the right direction for Ferrari.Red Bull's case is different because they were forced to replace Ricciardo after his decision to switch to Renault.I'm sure Red Bull would have preferred to keep their race winning Australian, but Ricciardo's surprise switch to Renault (another exciting prospect and story for the neutral to see in 2019) meant they had a natural choice between Gasly and Carlos Sainz.They chose Gasly, another driver with an impressive rookie campaign under his belt at Toro Rosso, and I look forward to seeing how he gets on alongside Verstappen next year.Like Ferrari, Red Bull are a team who need a fresh new impetus after a disappointing season this year. A switch to Honda engines for 2019 is a big deal, but a new driver line-up will also give them a fresh start to build for the future again in a new era for the team.Overall, it's been a positive driver market, with plenty of changes at the front end of the grid, and still some seats to be settled further back as well.But there's a log jam of extremely good talent coming through that is a bit of an underlying frustration, mainly for Toto Wolff, whose Mercedes team have plenty of them on their roster.Esteban Ocon, a Mercedes junior, is set to lose his seat at Force India and have no 2019 F1 drive at all. This would be a big shame for the sport. And George Russell, the current Formula 2 championship leader, is struggling to make the natural step up to F1.For Ocon, his performances have made him worthy of a top drive in F1, but he has the doors closed off from the main Mercedes team for next year at least by their decision to retain Hamilton and Bottas for 2019.Russell, meanwhile, is below Ocon in the Mercedes pecking order. Recent reports have linked him to a seat at Williams for next year to replace Lance Stroll, who is surely bound for Force India - now owned by his father. If Russell and Williams can make a deal work, it would be a great step for the promising Brit.All the latest F1 GossipA seat in F1 is unbelievably tough to achieve. There are only 20 in the world, and at grass roots go-karting there are millions of young drivers who all aspire to get there at what will be a cost that varies between reasonable and huge.I dreamt of being an F1 driver from an extremely young age, but in reality I never thought I would actually get there. The stats speak for themselves and it is an almost impossible challenge.Only once I was winning GP2 - the forerunner of F2 - in 2014 did I think it could realistically happen.Every step a driver moves up the ladder, the dream becomes more of a reality. But even winning F2 is not enough these days. When I was GP2 champion in 2014 I needed a year as an F1 reserve in 2015 to get a chance (as well as a reasonable amount of good fortune). It was the same for both Vandoorne and Gasly in the following years.That's why there's a frustration when drivers who are under performing stay in F1, because the talent pool coming through is so vast and so good.Raikkonen signing for Sauber on a two-year deal is a strange one for me, and many in the paddock were surprised by the move as well.Having driven in top F1 machinery since his switch to McLaren in 2002, Raikkonen is stepping back to a midfield team, with next to no hope of a podium despite Sauber's recent progress.Yes, Raikkonen was on pole at Monza earlier this month, setting the fastest lap ever set in a Formula 1 car, narrowly pipping Vettel and Hamilton. But that was only his second pole position in more than 10 years, while Vettel has had five this year alone.On the whole, Raikkonen has had a brilliant F1 career. I remember growing up watching him putting in some mesmerising performances for McLaren, before winning his title with Ferrari in 2007. And he has generated a huge and loyal fanbase with his trademark 'ice man' personality.But the results haven't been there of recent years. He hasn't outperformed a team-mate since the first half of 2013 against Grosjean in the Lotus. In 2014, he scored a third of the points of team-mate Fernando Alonso on his return to Ferrari.Mercifully for him, Alonso left at the end of the year and he has been closer to Vettel since. But only in 2016 has Raikkonen got within 100 points of his team-mate at the end of the year. This year is going a similar way, with the gap between the two up at 67 points now with six races left.Raikkonen will be 41 by the time his two-year contract at Sauber expires, and with drivers' careers extending ever further it makes it that much harder for new talent to make the grid.If they are still at the top of their game, as Alonso appears to be at 37, with a brilliant seventh place for McLaren in Singapore on Sunday, then of course there's no reason to stop. Although, ironically, Alonso has decided to call time on F1 at the end of the year.But for Raikkonen, bar the odd flash of pace, it feels like his best was a while ago.Nonetheless his experience could help Sauber develop in the short term, as long as he can retain motivation in a car in which he will probably do well to score points.And although it's surprising, it is nice to see that Raikkonen really is still in love with F1 and the thrill of driving.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe final exciting mover over the summer, especially from a British point of view is Lando Norris moving to McLaren to replace Vandoorne.I have sympathy for Vandoorne because I know how good he can be, and for some reason he hasn't been able to deliver that at McLaren against Alonso. I hope he can find a seat elsewhere to prove himself, but it isn't looking too likely right now.Norris, on the other hand, is a reason for British fans to get excited. Currently second in F2 behind Russell, he has won every single-seater category he's raced in at the first attempt. While he's enjoyed a vast amount of testing in all series he's competed in as well, he's made the most of it with some dominant displays.His ability in the wet is plain to see, and for me that signals a natural talent, an innate ability to find grip and balance within a car. That's the stuff that you can't really teach a driver.With McLaren going backwards this year, it isn't ideal timing, but as I said above, just to get into F1 is phenomenally hard in itself and Norris now has a platform where he can show off what he can do to the world.When Hamilton won GP2 and was promoted to McLaren in 2007, he had the benefit of a lot of testing and a race-winning car. Norris will not have either, but he will also have less pressure and that can have benefits as well.The icing on the cake for the UK and motorsport on the whole would be for Russell to join him on the grid, making three British drivers for the first time since 2016.

sport	Formula 1: Years before McLaren competitive again - Zak Brown	More changes on the wayWhat about Alonso?	"McLaren boss Zak Brown says it will take years before the team are competitive again in Formula 1.McLaren split with racing director Eric Boullier this week and announced a new race-team structure, changes Brown says are the start of a rebuilding process.""This is going to take some time to fix, so I think we are years away. I don't know whether that is two or 10 or somewhere in between,"" he said.""We have to be very realistic and honest with ourselves.""McLaren started this year with ambitions of competing for podiums after switching from Honda engines to Renault, which Red Bull also use.Instead, they have found their car to be nearly two seconds off the pace, and lead driver Fernando Alonso has only managed to get into the top 10 in qualifying twice in nine races so far.Brown revealed that the team have made a backwards step with this year's car compared to last year's in terms of aerodynamics, one of the primary factors in F1 car performance.""We don't have the same level of downforce this year as last year,"" he said.""We have identified an area in which our car this year is weaker than last year. Did we have the best chassis last year? No, definitely not. Did we have a better chassis? It would be hard to say definitively yes or no but we know we have less downforce than last year.""McLaren's restructure of their racing team has seen Andrea Stella, the former Ferrari engineer who joined McLaren with Alonso in 2015, promoted to performance director, with responsibility for the race team at grands prix.Former Indycar champion Gil De Ferran has been named sporting director to work with Stella at race weekends.Brown indicated that the design department was also in the process of being restructured.Chief technical officer Tim Goss was removed from post at the end of April, leaving in place the other two members of the technical leadership, aerodynamics head Peter Prodromou and engineering director Matt Morris.But Brown said he was ""not done"" with making changes at McLaren after six years in the wilderness.""We are in the starting process of our recovery plan, and we plan to enhance our technical team,"" Brown said, in comments that will be interpreted as confirmation McLaren are looking for a new technical director to lead the design of their car.And he cautioned about expecting too much from the team at their home race in Britain this weekend.Alonso finished eighth in Austria last weekend having qualified 14th.""We had a good finish in the last race relative to where we started but we were uncompetitive,"" he said, ""and not much has changed since last race so I think everyone needs to not starting having too-high expectations, ourselves included.""Alonso has been consulted on the changes and Brown said he hoped he would stay with the team next year.""He really likes the McLaren environment,"" Brown said. ""He obviously believes in us because he had the ability to leave this year and he chose to stay because he believes in McLaren and I believe he wants to be here long term.""Brown said McLaren wanted to help Alonso complete motorsport's 'triple crown' by winning the Indianapolis 500 to add to his victories in the Monaco Grand Prix and Le Mans 24 Hours.Alonso has a choice between going Indycar racing full-time next year or staying in F1 and taking the Monaco Grand Prix off to compete in the Indy 500, as he did in 2017."

sport	Formula 1: Sauber's Charles Leclerc poised to join Ferrari		"Sauber's Charles Leclerc is poised to move to Ferrari next season.The 20-year-old has agreed, but not signed, a two-year deal to be Sebastian Vettel's team-mate until 2020, according to a source close to Ferrari.The move comes after an impressive start to Leclerc's F1 career this year with Sauber, including points finishes in four of the last five races.If the deal is confirmed, it would mean the end of 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen's five-year stay at Ferrari.The team said it declined to comment on what it described as ""media speculation"".Leclerc, who comes from Monaco and is a member of the Ferrari driver academy, is the reigning Formula Two champion and was given his Sauber seat this year with the intention of blooding him for a future at Ferrari.The plan was to promote Leclerc after one season as long as he delivered on his obvious potential, and he has done exactly that.After a shaky start to the season with mistakes in the first three races, Leclerc took a step forward at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April, where he took the unfancied Sauber to sixth place.Since then, he has finished 10th at the Spanish, Canadian and French Grands Prix, and demonstrated impressive race-craft, including holding off two-time champion Fernando Alonso's McLaren for half the race in Barcelona.Leclerc - the godson of former F1 driver Jules Bianchi, who died in 2015 from injuries sustained in the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix - told BBC Sport at last month's Monaco Grand Prix: ""It is a dream since [I was] a child to drive for the red cars so hopefully this will happen one day.""I will give everything for it to happen next year but the decision is not in my hands and the only thing I can do is give the best of myself on track and then hopefully it will be enough to consider me for the seat next year.""Assuming the Leclerc deal is finalised, Raikkonen's career is in danger of being over.There have been reports this week linking the 38-year-old Finn with a move to McLaren, but their priority is to keep Fernando Alonso as their lead driver.The Spaniard won Le Mans this year and is two-thirds of the way towards completing his ambition of winning motorsport's unofficial 'triple crown' of the Monaco Grand Prix, which Alonso has won twice, Le Mans and the Indianapolis 500.Alonso is weighing up between two main options: staying in F1 with McLaren but taking part in the Indy 500; or moving full time to Indycars in 2019.On Thursday, the two-time champion said: ""To win the Indy 500 you have only one chance each year. Even if you do the whole championship, you have only one race and 200 laps to do it.""If Alonso chooses to leave F1, McLaren's second option is Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, although the Australian is tipped to stay where he is."

I was always very clear when I took some time out to start a family that I wanted to come back and get my teeth into something and of course I could not work for Toto or a competing manufacturer.""I've had a front-row seat as he has led the Mercedes F1 team very successfully and it became clear to me that I wanted to stay within motorsport.""I met Gildo Pastor, the chief executive officer of Venturi, some years ago, when I was thinking about driving in Formula E.""We've stayed in touch and not long ago he texted me to ask if we could talk about me getting involved with Venturi on the management side.""It's the perfect opportunity to stand on my own two feet and take on a new venture in motorsport.""Pastor said: ""Susie's energy and expertise will help us grow by strengthening the team and introducing a new approach to management.""Susie takes a unique strategic view of the championship and motor racing in general.""From season five of Formula E, which starts in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia in December this year, Venturi will supply a power-train to the new German-based HWA team, the forerunner of the official Mercedes official entry.Venturi and HWA already have a technical relationship as HWA build up knowledge and expertise in Formula E ahead of their involvement.When Mercedes enters under its own name in late 2019, its team will use a power-train developed by Mercedes HPP, the UK-based operation that provides the German marque's Formula 1 engines.Venturi will continue as an independent entity through that period."

""We don't have any data from the current regulation cars in those conditions in Sochi, so this adds another challenge to the race.""Wolff also backed Mercedes' second driver Valtteri Bottas, who admitted at the last race in Singapore that he was finding it ""hard"" up against Hamilton amid the realisation that he was now out of the title fight this year.The Finn took his maiden victory in Russia last year and Wolff said: ""For every racing driver, that's a very difficult situation to be in because everything you dream about and everything you work for is winning the world championship.""When you realise you're not in the hunt any more, that's very difficult to handle.""But Valtteri has shown that he has the speed, the talent and the work ethic to win in a Mercedes.""He has always been a team player and that is one of his greatest character traits.""Valtteri could have won races this year, but the odds were against him. However luck isn't just a one-way street; and I know that Valtteri has every ingredient it needs to win at this level.

sport	Lando Norris: British McLaren driver 'realistic' about his 2019 Formula 1 targets	An all new line-upComparisons with HamiltonWhy McLaren chose NorrisA new senior engineer	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceLando Norris says he is ""realistic"" about what he can achieve in his debut season with McLaren next year.The British teenager has been promoted from reserve driver and joins Spaniard Carlos Sainz in an all-new line-up.Norris, 18, said: ""Rule number one is: Beat your team-mate. Apart from that, it is going to be a tough year.""We are not going to be winning, or competing against Ferrari and Mercedes. I would like to think we can make a step forward from where we are.""McLaren decided to give Norris his debut as a replacement for Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne, who will be dropped at the end of the season after two years in which he struggled compared to his team-mate, the double world champion Fernando Alonso.The Spaniard is leaving F1 at the end of the season and is expected to race in the Indianapolis 500, and perhaps a whole Indycar season, next year.Asked whether he was relieved not to have to compete against Alonso in his first season, Norris said: ""As much as I would have loved to partner Fernando, as much as I admire him and loved working with him, for the longevity of McLaren and helping them improve, having Carlos we can push each other a lot together.""Fernando would definitely help the team improve but it is good that teams have fresh starts every now and again. I don't think it's a bad or good thing I'm going against Carlos.""He said that he believed an all-new driver line-up would be a positive for McLaren.""They need two young drivers willing to say: 'We don't need to win; we don't want to win within the first two years of joining the team.'""That is a realistic goal. We are not going to be winning next year or probably the year after. It will probably be a few years.""As for his wider ambitions in F1, Norris said: ""I want to say I am better than the other drivers but I still have to prove that.""As long as I do a good job and put all my effort into proving I am worth it, everything should be fine.""I am just hoping whatever I do is going to be good enough. I want to be with McLaren and I want to win with McLaren. I don't think that is going to be next year, so it is more of a longer project.""McLaren have struggled this year, their switch from Honda to Renault engines revealing that their car is a long way off the pace and a lot worse than they thought it was. Previously, they blamed the Honda engine for their lack of pace.Norris has been promoted on the back of impressive performances in the Formula Two championship, in which he lies second with two rounds to go, and in tests and outings in practice sessions with McLaren.Norris has won several championships on his way up through the junior ranks, and has been labelled ""the next Lewis Hamilton"". The fact that the world champion also started his F1 career with McLaren only heightens the comparisons.Asked how it felt to be compared to a multiple world champion, Norris said: ""Growing up, I've always watched Lewis and aspired to have some attributes from him, mainly his speed.""His raw pace is probably the best of everyone on the whole grid, so there are bits you want from different drivers. And being compared to someone who could be about to win five world championships, who's won four, it's not a bad thing.""McLaren chief executive officer Zak Brown said he had promoted Norris because he was ""convinced he is a star of the future"".""McLaren are in rebuilding mode, and to have two extremely quick young drivers, one with a good amount of experience, one inexperienced, is a good combination, considering the five-year horizon. We pretty quickly got to the conclusion that Lando was the right driver.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceBut Brown said it would be misguided to compare Norris with Hamilton.""It is hard to get into driver comparisons. It's natural because Lewis started here.""But he's a world champion and the way he is going may end up being most successful driver of all time. All you can do is look at Lando and what he's accomplished and say he's a future star, and with the right car should be a world champion.""We need to manage him carefully and not get ahead of ourselves with comparisons to other drivers.""McLaren also announced that they have signed Englishman Pat Fry as engineering director as they continue the restructuring of their design department.The 54-year-old worked for McLaren from 1993-2010, before moving to Ferrari, where he was director of chassis and then engineering director before being sacked as part of a restructure at the end of their winless 2014 season.Brown said Fry would work with performance director Andrea Stella on setting the targets for performance on the 2019 car.McLaren in July signed Englishman James Key as their new technical director to lead their design team, but the 46-year-old is not expected to join until next year. He is on gardening leave from his previous job as technical director of the Red Bull junior team Toro Rosso."

"The battle to prove you are the team's number one driver can be close. Sometimes too close.That was the case during last Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix when Red Bull team-mates Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen collided while tussling for a place on the podium, ending their respective races.""I'm OK with Daniel,"" said Verstappen after the race. ""Me and Max love to race, that's cool. It was on the limit,"" said Ricciardo.Publicly, the relationship between the two appears to be fine - but can it last? BBC Sport takes a look at some other notable team-mate tangles and what happened next.""We've got to sit down with both drivers and make sure that this never happens again.""It must feel like deja vu for Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who said the above when two of his previous drivers collided during a race eight years ago.Back in 2010, Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were Red Bull team-mates but their relationship took a turn for the worse when they collided at the Turkish Grand Prix - driving in a straight line, as Verstappen and Ricciardo were - as a one-two finish was firmly on the cards.Horner invited the two drivers over to his house for a night of karaoke and guitar playing in the hope it would bring harmony to the feuding team-mates. However, while an uneasy truce did develop, things would never be the same again.At the time, neither had won a world title, but as 2010 signalled an era when Red Bull would dominate the sport things were never going to go smoothly.Fast forward to 2013 and Vettel - now with three world championship titles under his belt - famously ignored the ""multi 21"" instruction to not pass Webber at the Malaysian Grand Prix and let the Australian win in a bid for his own crown.Instead, the German instead said over team radio: ""Mark is too slow, please move him out of the way."" He then took things into his own hands and barged his way past Webber to claim victory.Their time as team-mates ended that year when Webber - empty handed and disillusioned - retired from Formula 1.This is comfortably one of the most well-known on-track clashes involving team-mates in Formula 1. Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were McLaren's drivers and both going for the 1989 title when they started the Japanese Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season.Prost was leading the championship, with Senna fighting to take the battle into the final race, and with seven laps to go the Brazilian attempted an ambitious dive up the inside of his team-mate at the final chicane. Prost shut the door and the two collided.If both retired, Prost would be champion but Senna got his car going again and recovered to win the race. He was, however, disqualified for cutting a chicane on his way to victory, handing the Frenchman the title.Their time as team-mates came to an end as Prost left McLaren to join Ferrari in 1990 - but their rivalry continued and once again the Japanese Grand Prix that year saw a coming together between the two on the circuit. This time, Senna turned into Prost soon after the race start, sending both cars hurtling into the gravel trap and out of the contest. As a consequence, Senna became world champion. 1-1.Perhaps it was best they never came as close to challenging each other again. Both would claim one more title during their careers, but they will forever be remembered for the period at the end of the 1980s when they were virtually stuck to one another.They were karting buddies and even raced each other when they were eating pizza, so it seemed that when childhood friends Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg became Mercedes team-mates, they would only want the best for each other, right?It started off well enough in 2013, but once things began to get heated on the track after they were given a title-winning car, their relationship deteriorated, with one of the first big flash points happening at the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix.The two touched on lap two of the race when Rosberg attempted a move on Hamilton, with the disbelieving Briton saying: ""Nico's hit me...""Rosberg lost part of his front wing but managed to plough on and finish second, but Hamilton suffered a puncture in the incident and eventually retired on lap 39.A very strong discussion in the motorhome after the race, followed by Hamilton claiming the title that year.Many more heated moments would follow. There was the infamous 'cap gate', when Hamilton threw a second place cap at Rosberg after victory for the Briton at the 2015 United States Grand Prix sealed another world title.Then there was the coming together at the Spanish Grand Prix a year later when Rosberg closed the door as Hamilton approached with too much speed attempting to take the lead, ending both of their races.By the time they collided at the 2016 Austrian Grand Prix, they were sworn enemies, but Rosberg's world title that year was enough for him and he retired.""He tried to kill me.""That was Esteban Ocon's blunt view after he and Force India team-mate Sergio Perez made contact during last year's Belgian Grand Prix.The simmering rivalry between the two had already dashed their chances of a podium at the Canadian Grand Prix and hopes of a top-three finish at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix were also ended when the two collided.But lessons were not learned as neither gave each other space on the run down the hill from La Source to Eau Rouge and the inevitable crash happened.Force India were furious and, after initially letting their drivers race, they said team orders would be imposed after Belgium.The two drivers, meanwhile, accepted the need to talk it out. ""I believe a new relationship can start from now and we can work as a team and put the interests of the team first,"" said Perez in August last year.Since then, so far so good. The pair were retained as team-mates for this season and last weekend Perez secured a top-three finish for the team with a superb third in Azerbaijan.But will it last?If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote."
sport	US Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is in Formula 1's top five, says Fernando Alonso	How to follow the United States Grand Prix on BBC Sport	"Lewis Hamilton is one of the five greatest champions in Formula 1 history, says Fernando Alonso.Hamilton will become only the third man to clinch a fifth world title if he wins Sunday's US Grand Prix and Sebastian Vettel is lower than second.Alonso named Hamilton with Michael Schumacher, Juan Manuel Fangio, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost as his top five.Hamilton winning a fifth title would be a ""great achievement"", added two-time champion Alonso.""It is difficult to compare different times and different ways to win those championships,"" said the Spaniard, who tied on points with Hamilton when they were McLaren team-mates in 2007, with both men finishing one point behind title winner Kimi Raikkonen.""Lewis probably winning five now, same as Fangio, it is a great achievement, and if one had to do it in our generation, I am happy it is him.""He showed the talent and commitment. When the car was dominating he won and when it wasn't he still put in performances to show his talent. That is difficult to see these days.""Hamilton is the only driver to win a race in every year he competed in F1.Alonso said: ""He showed the talent from day one and fighting for the championship in his rookie year, winning in 2008.""I am happy for him because he showed the talent from day one, he was able to win races when the car was able to win it, but also able to win when the car was not on top of the form, he still won some races, it is impressive.""Hamilton said he was not approaching this weekend in Austin, Texas, thinking about winning the title.""It just feels like another race weekend that we want to win,"" he said. ""It is a simple goal to arrive and try to do the same thing, the weather is up and down and the goal is to have the same performance as in previous races.""Hamilton is 67 points clear of Vettel - with only 100 available over the remaining four races - after winning six of the past seven races.""We expect Ferrari to punch back hard here this weekend,"" he said. ""We can't be relaxed. We have to come here and raise the bar.""I don't need more pressure, I am just trying to focus on how I have driven all year long. It is going to be a tricky weekend. Nothing is given.""As for his achievement in potentially matching Fangio's tally of five titles - with only Schumacher ahead on seven - Hamilton said: ""Fangio is like the godfather of the sport for us drivers. It is crazy to think I am embarking on a similar number of championships.""Vettel, who has not finished in the top two in the past four races, said: ""It is pretty clear. We need to be quick enough to win the races and then it depends on what the other side is doing. Focus on that.""The last couple of races we have not had the speed so we have some ideas floating around and hopefully we get back. Let's see what the next four races bring. We hope to be back to the form we showed earlier.""I always try to win. You have to be aggressive to win. You need to find the right balance. You never try to do something silly not to finish because that way you can't win.""I know what to do. We know we need to take a bit more risk here or there because we are not in a position to manage a gap in the championship because we do not have a gap.""BBC Sport has live coverage of all the season's races on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, plus live online commentary on the BBC Sport website and mobile app - including audience interaction, expert analysis, debate, voting, features, interviews and video content.All times BST and are subject to change at short notice."
sport	Formula 1: Ferrari chief Sergio Marchionne replaced as result of illness		"Sergio Marchionne has been replaced as the boss of Ferrari and sister company Fiat as a result of an illness.Fiat said the 66-year-old had suffered complications following surgery. A statement from Ferrari added that he would not be able to return to work.Marchionne had been the chief executive officer of both Fiat and Ferrari.John Elkann, the scion of the Agnelli family that controls Fiat, is named chairman of Ferrari, while Louis Carey Camilleri has become chief executive.Camilleri is a Ferrari board member and the former boss of tobacco company Philip Morris, the main sponsor of the Ferrari Formula 1 team.Briton Mike Manley, former head of the Jeep division of Fiat, has been named as chief executive of the Fiat Chrysler group.A Ferrari statement said the company had learned of Marchionne's condition ""with deep sadness"" and thanked him for ""the extraordinary contribution he has made in recent years at the helm of Ferrari"".Marchionne took over as president of Ferrari in 2014 from Luca Di Montezemolo, who served more than 20 years in the role.Di Montezemolo revived Ferrari after a slump in the early 1990s and oversaw the rise of the team that led to the dominant years with Michael Schumacher, who won five consecutive titles from 2000-2004.Ferrari's competitiveness dipped in the early years of this decade but they have surged again in the last two years after a major restructure of the F1 team overseen by Marchionne.The Italo-Canadian has also been a major figure on the political side of F1, and had formed a powerful alliance with Mercedes that was fighting major changes to the sport being planned by new owners Liberty Media for 2021.Marchionne has more than once threatened to pull Ferrari out of F1 after 2020 if he perceived the changes to be against how it saw the sport. He was particularly concerned about plans to simplify engines.Ferrari's statement said the board had given Camilleri ""the necessary powers to ensure the continuity of the company's operation""."
sport	Fernando Alonso: How does the Spaniard compare to the Formula 1 greats?	Alonso's place in Formula 1 historyHis careerAlonso's Formula 1 careerWhere did he have the most success?Best and worst momentsTeam radio annoyance	Media playback is not supported on this deviceTwo-time Formula 1 world champion Fernando Alonso has said he will not be racing in the sport in 2019.But how does he compare to other Formula 1 drivers? We have taken a look at some of his statistics and some of his best and worst moments in the sport.The Spaniard, who is now 37, has had some career. His 32 race victories puts him sixth in the all-time list, behind only Michael Schumacher (91), Lewis Hamilton (67), Alain Prost (51), Sebastian Vettel (51) and Ayrton Senna (41).Alonso's first race start came back in March 2001 when he came 12th in the Australian Grand Prix in a Minardi. In total, Alonso has started 302 races, with only Rubens Barrichello (322), Michael Schumacher (306) and Jenson Button (306) starting more.However, with nine races left in the 2018 season he should overtake both Schumacher and Button before the end of the year.Minardi (2001)Renault (2003-06)McLaren (2007)Renault (2008-09)Ferrari (2010-2014)McLaren (2015-2018)Alonso became world champion for the first time when at Renault in 2005 and retained his title the following year.In 2005, he won the title at the Brazilian Grand Prix with two races to spare and eventually finished 21 points in front of McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen.At the time, Alonso became the youngest man to become a world champion at 24 years, one month and 27 days, although Lewis Hamilton in 2008 and then Sebastian Vettel in 2010 broke this record, with the German being 23 years old when he won his first title with Red Bull.Alonso won seven races in 2005 and also won seven the season after to gain 13 more points than Ferrari's Michael Schumacher. That was to be his last world title, although he did come second in the championship on three occasions - 2010, 2012 and 2013 - in Ferrari's colours.His worst moments? So many disappointing moments have come his way since his return to McLaren in 2015 - where he has failed to finish inside the top four at any race and often failed to finish all together.During qualifying for the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2015, an engine failure in his McLaren left him unable to set a time in Q1 so he took to the deckchair and enjoyed the sun while the action went on around him. Social media loved it, with the hashtag #PlacesAlonsoWouldRatherBe spawning a host of funny tweets with him superimposed on to various locations around the world.But for many Formula 1 fans, the image was a sad one of a driver who should have been near the front of the grid, but because of mechanical problems and an uncompetitive car it left him fighting at the back. In his three full seasons in his second spell at McLaren he has come 17th, 10th and 15th and he is ninth after 12 races of the 2018 campaign.Being a two-time world champion, Alonso's standards are high. He has repeatedly showed his frustrations over team radio when things do not go his way or when his car lets him down.Click on the below links to hear some of them again...

He trained with us for a week and then signed his contract.""Kilmarnock have struggled for goals this season, netting six times in their first eight league games while Brophy has just two in 11 appearances.Jackson, who also played for Gillingham and Norwich City, is available for Saturday's Premiership match with Livingston, with the sides locked on 11 points.""He has similar quality and skill to Brophy,"" Alessio added. ""He has a lot of experience in the Premiership and it's important to have him here, and I have another alternative to Brophy.""I hope he scores a lot of goals here, but at the moment it's just important to have another striker."""
sport	Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen to stay at Haas for 2020 season	What next for Hulkenberg?	"Haas have chosen to stick with Romain Grosjean rather than replace him with Nico Hulkenberg as Kevin Magnussen's team-mate in 2020.Haas said they decided to retain the Frenchman in the interests of stability after a difficult year technically.Team boss Gunther Steiner said the decision was ""a close call"".""The main thing was do we want this step and introduce a new element into the team? That was the main reason we stayed with Romain,"" Steiner said.Magnussen was already under contract for 2020 and Haas ultimately decided to extend the contract of Grosjean, who has been with the US-based team since their inception in 2016 and has developed a reputation as a fast driver who is prone to making serious errors.But Steiner said he had also been instrumental in helping Haas analyse what has gone wrong with their car this season.""He is with the team for four years - we know his highs and his lows, like you guys know,"" Steiner said.""On a good day, he is a very good driver. He knows the team very well.""The biggest reason is our car this year is not performing as we wanted it to perform, which has nothing to do with the drivers. It is the car - we are very conscious about that at the moment and open about it.""A new guy wouldn't know where we started. Romain was a big part of getting the understanding of why we are wrong with the car, he was a big help and we didn't want to have any more unknowns.""Steiner said a desire to return to Haas's strong performances in 2018, when they finished fifth in the World Championship, was a key factor.""Our focus was only how can we get back to where we were last year,"" Steiner said. ""We need to get that going again, so just replicating what we did in 2017 for 2018 will help us get there.""He admitted that Grosjean's errors could well cost the team points but said that was taken into account.""Maybe he brings us there to get to the points and then we have to deal with afterwards - but if we never get there we can lose points,"" Steiner said.""Why do I need to change and take a risk? Only time will tell if it is the correct decision.""The decision looks to have left Hulkenberg in a tricky position if he wants to prolong his F1 career.He has also been talking to Alfa Romeo, where some in the team are said to prefer taking Hulkenberg rather than Italian Antonio Giovinazzi, who has had an error-prone debut season.But Giovinazzi is a member of the Ferrari driver academy and the teams have close links - Alfa use Ferrari engines and receive sponsorship funding from the Fiat Group for changing their name from Sauber for this season.Beyond Alfa, Hulkenberg's options look limited following Renault's decision to replace him with Frenchman Esteban Ocon for next season.There is a potential opening at Williams alongside George Russell, but that team are expected to need a driver to bring sponsorship money.Beyond that, the only apparent uncertainties are at the two Red Bull teams.Red Bull will wait until later in the year to decide whether to retain Alexander Albon after promoting the Anglo-Thai rookie from Toro Rosso two races ago.And Toro Rosso is a junior team that is unlikely to take on a veteran such as Hulkenberg from outside the Red Bull programme."
sport	Formula 1: British Grand Prix 'may not continue after 2019' - BRDC		"Silverstone and Formula 1 are still ""some way apart"" in negotiations to secure the future of the British Grand Prix, the boss of the track says.John Grant, chairman of the British Racing Drivers' Club that owns the track, said in a letter to members that he is ""hopeful"" a deal can be agreed.But he warned that ""as things stand, 2019 could be the last British GP at Silverstone - or indeed anywhere"".Silverstone's contract to host the race ends after next year's event.The track did have a contract until 2027 but last year exercised a break clause that enabled it to exit the contract after the 2019 race because they said it was becoming unaffordable.F1's new owners, Liberty Media, have said they want to keep the historic races which they consider to be vital for the health and future of the sport. The British Grand Prix is one of them, along with the Italian, German and Belgian Grands Prix.A new contract with Belgium until 2021 was announced last month, but Germany is out of contract at the end of this year.Grant's letter, seen by BBC Sport, said that Silverstone and F1 agreed on a number of areas:The letter adds that despite efforts to ""muster support from the British government... we should not assume any financial support will be forthcoming from government sources"".Grant's remarks contradict views expressed this week by Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, who said F1 had ""a desire to see a street race in London"".Horner added: ""F1 is going through changing times, lessons are being learned and there is so much competition that the BRDC are starting to move with the times.""Grant said Silverstone's aim in the negotiations was ""to reduce the presently unaffordable financial risk of one or two bad years, and for Silverstone to make a reasonable profit on the event in a good year"".On the possibility of reaching an agreement, he said: ""This will require compromise from each of us but must still broadly meet the objectives we have set out.""There is plenty of time to get this resolved, and it's more important for us to get to the right answer than an early answer. Although the expression may have been first used in a different context, 'No deal is better than a bad deal'.""F1 was not available for comment but BBC Sport understands talks are ongoing and bosses are hopeful an agreement can be reached with Silverstone."
sport	Formula 1 bosses aim for 2021 budget cap		"Formula 1 is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a budget cap in 2021 as part of attempts to make the sport more attractive.Owners Liberty Media presented more detail on their plans to the teams at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Friday.A budget cap in the region of $150m is central to the aim, along with more equitable prize money distribution and technical changes.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said it was ""a starting point of a dialogue"".Wolff added: ""It's good we are getting started in understanding how the shareholder Liberty sees F1's future, have some perspective from (governing body) the FIA as well.""There are many ideas and proposals that have been either overdue or necessary or good. And then there are some that are very challenging and need the detail to really understand.""Wolff added that F1 chairman Chase Carey had indicated that the proposals were not a fait accompli.""Chase used the sentence which is intelligent, which is: 'We have no exclusivity on good ideas,'"" Wolff said. ""And they will be starting discussions with each of the teams to see and understand their perspective.""Wolff added that he did not believe F1 and the FIA had a homogenous position on changes to engines for 2021 - last November both parties put forward a proposal for a cheaper, simpler version of the 1.6-litre turbo hybrid engines used in F1 since 2014.Wolff said: ""There is not clarity yet on what is the exact engine proposal. I think that the FIA and Liberty have to come to a joint opinion and then tell us what the concept looks like and then we would enter into a discussion in the strategy group to decide whether that is the correct path or not.""Ferrari, who have last year threatened to quit F1 if they did not approve of Liberty's plans, said had taken notice of the presentation but would not respond publicly to the announcement at this stage.The budget cap would not include drivers' salaries, but independent teams Force India and Williams welcomed the plan.Bob Fernley, deputy team principal of independents Force India, said: ""It is a constructive programme. Liberty are going around getting the individual teams' opinions and putting it together collectively into what they believe is the best way forward for F1 for the future, whereas in the past it was a very divisive process.""I can see the direction they are going in and from an independent team's point of view, it's very encouraging.""At least four teams - Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren - will have to make some adjustments. But they are keeping everybody on board with that process.""Williams deputy team principal Claire Williams said: ""I came back thinking: 'Let's crack open some champagne.' Because from our perspective if we can get these new regulations through, and if Liberty/FOM do everything they say they are going to do, that they presented this morning, then from our perspective I know that Williams' future is safe.""That's not to say that we were on the brink, or anywhere close, but with today's sport and the way it is structured and with the financial disparity between teams then the likelihood of Williams' survival into the medium and long-term was looking pretty bleak.""The basic outline of F1's plans are the same as have been telegraphed for some time:Under the new proposals, Ferrari would keep an extra financial bonus for its historic value to the sport, but this would be reduced to $40m - about 60% of its current amount.And all engine manufacturers would receive a bonus of $10m on top of the cut of the prize money they receive from the reconfigured structure.Part of the plans for 2021 is research into ways of making the cars able to follow each other more closely, and therefore provoke better racing, by adjusting the way the aerodynamics work.Some aspects of this research may be introduced early in 2019, as a result of parallel talks that are taking place to try to take a small step in the right direction for next season."
sport	Formula 1: Lando Norris approached by Toro Rosso for 2018	Alonso holds the keyAnd the chase is not over yetMcLaren like changePoor old Hartley	"McLaren have rejected an approach for their reserve driver Lando Norris to race for Toro Rosso this season.Red Bull had wanted the Englishman, 18, who races in Formula 2, to replace New Zealander Brendon Hartley in their junior team for the rest of this year.But McLaren preferred to keep Norris on his current trajectory.A McLaren spokesman said: ""We are not surprised that other teams approach our drivers. They clearly believe they are as talented as we do.""Toro Rosso refused to comment.The team, who are used as a proving ground for Red Bull's young drivers, are said to have been looking for a deal that would have potentially allowed them to keep Norris beyond the end of 2018Norris, who is currently leading the F2 championship, is one of the brightest rising stars in motorsport and could potentially be promoted to a McLaren race seat in 2019.However, the team will be looking to resolve the future of their lead driver, two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, before making any further decisions.The 36-year-old Spaniard says he has not yet decided whether to remain in Formula 1 next season.Although there are potentially open seats at all three leading teams in F1 - Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull - none are believed to be interested in signing Alonso, even though he is still regarded as one of the very best drivers on the grid.Alonso has set as his target to win motorsport's so-called 'triple crown' of the Monaco Grand Prix, which he has already won twice, the Le Mans 24 Hours and the Indianapolis 500.McLaren are assessing whether to set up an Indycar team and one possibility is that Alonso could either do a full programme in the US-based series next year, or dovetail an F1 season with a second attempt at the Indy 500.Alonso raced at Indy with McLaren in 2017 and was contending for victory until suffering an engine failure in the closing stages.He is racing for Toyota in the current World Endurance Championship 'super-season', and has his first attempt at Le Mans this month. He set the fastest time in last weekend's pre-race test.Alonso will race again for Toyota at Le Mans next year, when the classic event is the final event of the championship that started in Spa last month, where Alonso won in the car he shares with team-mates Sebastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima.If Alonso stays in F1, there is a very real possibility Norris could be promoted as his team-mate in 2019.But McLaren's rejection of Red Bull's initial approach does not necessarily mean the end of Toro Rosso's bid to grab Norris.Red Bull could come back with a different offer that is more amenable to McLaren.And one source close to the situation has told BBC Sport that McLaren have to offer Norris a full-time race seat by a date in October this year or he is free to join another team - such as Toro Rosso - for the final two races.A McLaren spokesman said he was ""not in a position to get into that detail"".However, McLaren also have to resolve the future of their other race driver this year, Stoffel Vandoorne.The Belgian has struggled to match Alonso since becoming his team-mate last year but is regarded as highly talented and will be given more time this season to prove himself.McLaren have brought in former Indycar driver Gil De Ferran as a roving adviser, and one of the Brazilian's responsibilities is to help in the development of the team's young drivers.De Ferran is attending grands prix for McLaren and has been charged with offering advice or opinion on any subject he considers might be worthwhile.The team have had a disappointing start to the season, in the context of their ambition to race with Red Bull following their switch to the same Renault engine.In fact, although their championship position is much improved over last year, when they finished second last, the car has proved to be about 1.5 seconds a lap slower than the Red Bull.This has led to major ructions within McLaren, who have split with chief technical officer Tim Goss, and are restructuring their technical department having realised they have fallen a long way behind the best teams in design capability.Hartley, a two-time world endurance champion, is in his first full season in F1 having made a debut in the closing stages of last season after Spaniard Carlos Sainz moved to Renault and Red Bull dropped Russian Daniil Kvyat.However, Red Bull have grown frustrated by a series of mistakes by the New Zealander and his future in the team is in doubt."

And Max Verstappen slipped ahead of the Finn into fourth place in the championship with a drive combining the maturity and speed he has generally shown in the second half of the season - the odd pit-lane fracas aside - and which is marking him out as champion of the future.As the season begins to fade in the rear-view mirror, here is a reflection on some of the highlights and low-lights of a long but fascinating year.Hamilton at MonzaHe heaped the pressure on Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel on the first lap from third on the grid. When Vettel left space on the outside approaching the second chicane, Hamilton went for it and pulled a clean pass, while Vettel clattered into the side of him and spun away his chances.After that, Hamilton chased Raikkonen closely until the first stops. Raikkonen stopped first, pushed too hard on his tyres for too long - unnecessarily, as he had a pit stop's advantage very soon - and blistered them.After his later stop, Hamilton hunted him down and took the lead with eight laps to go. ""You are the man, you are the man,"" Hamilton's engineer Peter Bonnington said over the radio after the victory. ""You knocked that out of the park today."" He wasn't wrong.Hamilton's Singapore poleOn a track where Mercedes have traditionally struggled, after being questioned for jetting around the world in the days before the race to launch his fashion collection, the world champion produced a lap that left his team's jaws on the floor, and briefly in stunned silence.""Lewis, this is Toto,"" team boss Toto Wolff said on the radio at the end of qualifying. ""This was the most epic lap I have ever seen around here.""It was run close by another stupendous effort at the season-opening race in Australia - more than 0.6s clear of the field.Italian Grand PrixThis felt like an old-school race, as close to flat-out as possible, and a driver producing a special performance and two super overtaking moves to move from third to a victory. It was key to the championship - but also symbolic of the superiority of Hamilton and Mercedes as driver and race team over a season on which Ferrari arguably had the faster car more often than not.Red Bull. Give them the power of a Mercedes or Ferrari engine and they would at the very least have been right there at the front all the time and quite possibly ahead. They had a mid-season dip but the car came on strongly in a late-season surge. If new partner Honda can deliver the goods next year, Max Verstappen could go toe to toe with Hamilton and Vettel. And how exciting would that be?It was close - but Ferrari just takes it from Mercedes, who spent most of the year chasing to catch up, after spending most of the hybrid era in front.Close call, this. On average one-lap pace, the Mercedes was 0.124secs faster, but how much of that was down to Hamilton? Ferrari arguably had a faster car than Mercedes for at least half the races, if not more, but they got in a technical fog in the autumn before recovering. Hamilton's impeccable driving in his best-ever season and Mercedes' operational advantage over Ferrari tipped the balance. Let's call it a draw.Media playback is not supported on this deviceFernando AlonsoIt must have hurt this great champion to have been saddled with donkeys for the final five years of his career but he has never lost his fighting spirit.In the second-worst car on the grid - and it was arguably the worst at several races in the second half of the season - he produced his usual consistent excellence. Not only did he finish only 19 points off the winner of the B-class championship, but he helped McLaren to a totally undeserved sixth place in the constructors.His drive in Baku was a masterpiece. His car damaged badly on the first lap, he hauled it to a seventh-place finish. What a driver he has been.Haas finished finished fifth in the constructors' and had the fifth fastest car with probably the second smallest budget. But there are still too many questions about the advantages their close relationship with Ferrari brings. They buy as many parts as they allowed to under the rules from Ferrari - everything bar the monocoque and aerodynamic surfaces - and the car is designed in the Ferrari wind tunnel.Given that, Force India take it. They started the year in massive financial trouble, collapsed into administration mid-season, yet still had fifth fastest car. Lost all their points when they were reconstituted as a new team for the last nine races and yet still finished seventh in the championship. Mega effort.Media playback is not supported on this deviceNo contest here. Sebastian Vettel crashing out of the lead of his home German Grand Prix was not only highly embarrassing and the sort of error a beginner should not make, let alone a four-time world champion, but it handed a victory to Hamilton and meant a 32-point swing in the title race from which Vettel and Ferrari never recovered.Daniel Ricciardo's pass of Valtteri Bottas for the lead in China was right on the edge, not only in terms of how late he braked, but in terms of balancing risk versus reward. Ricciardo has made this something of a trademark - he took his first win this way back in Hungary in 2014 - but this was possibly the best yet.Ferrari taking Charles Leclerc for 2019. The Monegasque started his debut season billed as a star of the future and, after a briefly shaky start, he absolutely lived up to it. Leclerc was sensational - there is no other word for it. He put in a series of superb races, crushed team-mate Marcus Ericsson, and won praise from all the top drivers. Yes, there were a few mistakes here and there, but it is to be expected in a driver's first season. His battle with Vettel next year is a mouth-watering prospect.Sauber started the year having already improved - catching up to the pack after being last by far last year. But they made quite remarkable progress through the season. Second slowest team in the first half of the year, they were sixth quickest in the second half, and regular top 10 contenders. They closed on Mercedes by 0.4secs over the course of the year. It will be interesting to see whether they can keep the progress up now that Leclerc has left.If your team-mate wins 11 races and the world championship and you finish fifth having not taken a single victory, you know it has not been a good year.To be fair, Bottas was unlucky. He was leading in China before a mid-race safety car allowed Red Bull to fit fresh tyres and leave the Finn defenceless against Ricciardo. He would have won in Baku were it not for a puncture, and he was forced to hand victory to Hamilton in Russia to maximise the team's title chances.Team boss Toto Wolff explained his slump from mid-summer as being partially down to the inevitable dip in motivation after being told he could not fight for the title.Wolff said on Sunday that Bottas had told him he wanted to ""go back home, recharge the battery, recover and recuperate and then come back. It's just been a very long one.""He starts next year under severe pressure - knowing that Esteban Ocon is waiting in the wings as reserve driver and that Wolff has to decide between them when he picks Hamilton's team-mate for 2020.Ricciardo, for saying after beating team-mate Max Verstappen to pole in Mexico that he was ""tripping major nutsack right now"".The latest in a series of highly individual and very funny comments from a man who carries himself with a lightness and relaxation very rare in Grand Prix drivers, and yet drives like a tiger. Or honey badger, as he prefers.At the next race in Brazil, he explained: ""I remembered the podium that got taken from me in Melbourne (in 2014), I said I was tripping balls. And it is an evolution of tripping balls. I may have said it around friends before, I don't know, but it just came to me. I say some spontaneous stuff sometimes. That was certainly one of them. Did you like it?""There were some other classics from Ricciardo, too. ""Sometimes you've just go to lick the stamp and send it,"" he said, explaining his move on Bottas in China.At the other end of the spectrum, Vettel's ""we speak after"" when he was told team-mate Kimi Raikkonen had stolen pole from him at Ferrari's home race, which Vettel knew was because the Finn had been in his tow, was a masterpiece of hidden meaning.Vettel again, for his crazed communication with his mechanics over the radio when he stopped to change tyres in a wet qualifying session in Belgium.""Stop, stop,"" he shouted. ""You will crash the floor. Basta (enough). Lift the car. You are scratching the floor, you are scratching the floor.""In its own way, it said a lot about the pressure Vettel was feeling driving for a team that was making mistakes that made their attempt to unseat Mercedes much harder.Ferrari, for sending their cars out in the 'wrong' order in qualifying at the Italian Grand Prix.With Vettel needing all the help he could get in his title battle with Hamilton, Ferrari mystifyingly chose to allow the German to run in front of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, giving the Finn the benefit of a tow worth 0.35secs. Raikkonen took pole by 0.161secs.This directly led to the first lap, when the two red cars raced each other, Hamilton passed Vettel and Vettel spun, losing further ground in the championship as Hamilton won a race Ferrari should have finished one-two.Media playback is not supported on this deviceForce India's Sergio Perez seemed to lose focus for two hours in the heat and humidity of Singapore. He drove his team-mate Esteban Ocon into the wall at the start and then, after spending a number of laps stuck behind Sergey Sirotkin's Williams, drove into the side of the Russian's car when he was finally about to get past.He said both moves were accidental, and we have to take him at his word, but there were some who weren't so sure.The Williams was the slowest car of the season, but this has to go to McLaren. Following a switch from Honda to Renault engines, they started the season with ambitions of challenging Red Bull but had the rudest of awakenings.The car was truly terrible. The only positive was that it at least made them realise how far they had fallen, and started a restructuring process. But they admit it will take years before they can expect to compete regularly at the front again.Singapore or Mexico. They were the worst examples of excessive tyre management, drivers lapping seconds off their maximum potential to keep tyres alive for required stint lengths. This is not racing as most people would understand it, and it needs to be sorted out in the future."
sport	French GP: How it feels to drive a Formula 1 car	Just don't stall itEyeballs at the top of their socketsHow do you start the engine again?	"Media playback is not supported on this device""Push as hard as you can on the brake, I mean really hard, and then release.""I'm sitting in a Formula 1 car and a Renault Sport engineer is giving me an important task.I thrust my left leg as far and as hard as it will go on the pedal, and release as instructed. The engineer glances at a value on a laptop and nods his head.""OK, this is the pressure you need to apply… you really have to give it as much force as you can.""This is the same E20 V8 machine that Kimi Raikkonen won with in Abu Dhabi in 2012. The race where he famously barked back to the pits during a safety car stint over team radio: ""Leave me alone, I know what I'm doing.""The straps are pulled so tight there is zero movement in the seat. My feet are at the height of my hips, if not higher, but it feels extremely comfortable.The steering wheel, with its plethora of switches, is shunted into place on the quick-release mechanism. It's surprisingly close to my face, literally no more than six inches away. A quick test reveals I can turn the wheel left and right 90 degrees no problem, and easily reach the engine cut-off switch to my bottom right. I'll need that later.It is difficult to believe that I am actually here. I have to make the most of it. The run would comprise just three laps, well actually one flying lap, book-ended by an out-lap and an in-lap either side.The backdrop to this once-in-a-lifetime event is at the Paul Ricard circuit in southern France. Paul Ricard is where the French Grand Prix returns after a decade away from the F1 calendar. It's a familiar haunt for sportscar racing series; the long and fast Mistral straight - punctuated by a chicane - and equally as exciting Signes right-hander make it a classic circuit.Some may raise eyebrows over the amount of run-off, but Paul Ricard doesn't pretend to be Monaco. Go too far off track, from the blue strips to the red, and the tyres will be destroyed because of the abrasive surface.A million thoughts race through my mind in the moments before the tyre blankets are removed.I'm mentally rehearsing pulling away using the clutch paddle on the bottom left hand side of the wheel.""Just slowly release and allow the car to move without any throttle,"" my instructor had told me.Bearing in mind that I had stalled the Formula 4 car twice earlier that morning during training, that didn't bode well. ""Don't exceed 60kph in the pit lane and don't floor it on the exit, or you'll end up in the barrier on the right.""As I thought about the slow run down to pit exit, suddenly the mechanics move forward and pull the blankets from the fresh slicks. The engine has already been fired up - a cacophony of V8 goodness wails behind me. The car is lowered and pushed out into the pit lane.""Treat this drive as an experience,"" the team said. ""If the car spins it's a red flag and that means half an hour of track time gone.""Suddenly, I'm waved to go… I release the clutch slowly and the car obediently moves forward… and with zero throttle coasts down the pit lane exit.As the front wheels cross it, I apply about 30% throttle and I'm off. Nearly 800bhp in a 690kg car is now on tap for the next few minutes.My first impression? Incredible... In comparison, the F4 car felt agricultural with its harsh, abrasive gear changes, engine vibration through the chassis shaking my teeth and blurring my vision.In contrast, the F1 felt so smooth, completely contrary to my expectation. The only thing to interrupt that seemingly silky smooth experience was the sudden, violent G-force jolt of the gear changes. As for the power, it just kept coming, up to 18,000 revs - and remember this is not the turbo era engine but the aspirated 2.4L V8.Steering was very positive, pleasantly weighty and enough to feel the tyres connected to the track. I didn't have any DRS or KERS, just an internal combustion engine which was occasionally pushed towards the engine rev limits. I only dared to find those limits on the straights.It's easy to go fast in a straight line. It's through the corners where skill is needed. That's where my guts stopped me.A cheeky session in a simulator before my trip, indicated that Signes, the fast right hander, could almost be taken ""flat"" - the accelerator almost fully to the floor. But when it came to the real thing, there was no way.My foot refused me to do what I did in the virtual world. Instead I ended up almost cruising around Signes - the car seemingly giggling during the audible downshifts.Because of my caution through the corners, I never really experienced the neck ache that so many talk about.The nearest I got to it was on the straight at full whack. Here the helmet seemed to get rushes of air caught under its lower front lip, therefore forcing my whole head back.To compensate I pushed my head forward but it didn't feel enough. So I tried another tactic; tilting my head slightly downwards looking into my lap, preventing the air force problem in the first place. This worked even if it meant looking down the straight with my eyeballs at the top of their sockets.So, came the final corner and the slow trip to the pits. But, in my over-excitement, I hit the neutral button on pit-entry.I tried to get the car back into gear but forgot the sequence with the clutch to do so. ""How was it? Take it into second gear first, then engage the clutch, or ... first?"" I said to myself as the car slowed rapidly. ""What if I'm wrong on that sequence? Will I mess up the engine and/or the clutch?""This scenario was too awful to contemplate so I opted to accept the situation and do nothing. The car stopped near the entrance to the pitlane and the V8 - which idles at around 6,000rpm - was still purring in the back.""Chris, turn off the engine. Turn off the engine... turn off the engine...""""The engine's going to overheat,"" I thought. ""How do I turn off the engine?"" The I remembered the strangely old-fashioned cut-off switch. I looked down, fumbled around, found the switch and killed the engine.My head moved up again and I became aware of a group of mechanics running towards me in the pitlane. Clearly the cavalry had been despatched to bring me and their very precious motor back to base.I apologised, with some embarrassment. ""I'm really sorry guys, I hit the neutral button by mistake"" as they grabbed the pre-defined points on the car and pushed me home for my rather ignominious return.Back in the garage, buckles were released and I got out, very carefully. My mind was still buzzing and in a whirl replaying the drive.A data engineer gave me a briefing on my performance... the clear weakness my braking. I was only braking at 30% of the amount a professional driver would deliver. Instant, hard stamp and a slow release are vital requirements in single-seater sports cars.If there's one thing I've learned, there's no glory in nursing the brakes."

But we've left two spaces available, to allow us a little more time to select the final two drivers.""The debutantes selected from more than 40 applicants after a three-day assessment programme include a third British driver, Abbie Eaton.Eaton, 27, has competed in a number of saloon and sportscar series and featured as the test driver on the Grand Tour television series.W Series competitor list 2020:Jamie Chadwick (GB)Beitske Visser (Ned)Alice Powell (GB)Marta Garcia (Spa)Emma Kimilainen (Fin)Fabienne Wohlwend (Lie)Miki Koyama (Jpn)Sarah Moore (GB)Vicky Piria (Ita)Tasmin Pepper (SA)Jessica Hawkins (GB)Sabre Cook (USA)New entrants:Ayla Agren (Nor)Abbie Eaton (GB)Belen Garcia (Spa)Nerea Marti (Spa)Irina Sidorkova (Rus)Bruna Tomaselli (Brz)"

This year's race took place on 25 March.Further details of next year's calendar have not been released, but it is expected to feature 21 races, like this year, with a new event in Miami, Florida, replacing the German Grand Prix.Germany's contract runs out this season and no new deal has yet been agreed with the Hockenheim track.The Miami race has not been confirmed but officials in the US city voted in May to begin formal negotiations with F1, which plans to hold the race in October.The Japanese Grand Prix's contract also expires this year but the Suzuka track is owned by Honda, which is entering a partnership with Red Bull Racing next season and will be keen for the race to continue.

There are still several grands prix to go this season, and I will take part in them with more commitment and passion than ever,"" he added.""Let's see what the future brings; new exciting challenges are around the corner. I'm having one of the happiest times ever in my life but I need to go on exploring new adventures.""Alonso has in recent years branched out into other series and in June he won the Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar race at his first attempt.He joined Toyota's World Endurance Championship (WEC) programme this season with the aim of winning Le Mans, and has dovetailed it with F1.That victory provided him with the second part of motorsport's 'triple crown'. Twice a Monaco Grand Prix winner, he is only missing Indianapolis 500 success.He competed in the Indy 500 for the only time to date in May 2017, retiring towards the end of the race with engine failure, having run strongly throughout and led for a total of 27 laps.Only Englishman Graham Hill has won all three classic races in the history of motorsport.Alonso ended Michael Schumacher's five-year dominance of the drivers' championship when he won the first of his titles in 2005.At the time, he became the youngster ever driver to win the title.He has also finished championship runner-up three times, and to date has achieved 32 wins, 22 pole positions and 97 podium finishes.In his statement confirming he would retire at the end of this season, he suggested there may be a chance of him one day returning.""I want to thank everyone at McLaren,"" he said. ""My heart is with the team forever.""I know they will come back stronger and better in the future and it could be the right moment for me to be back in the series; that would make me really happy.""Alonso tweeted a video 'letter' to F1 in which he said:You were not expecting me and I wasn't sure I wanted to get to know you.When I barely knew how to walk, I ran towards your noise, your circuits, without knowing anything about you,We had very good times, some unforgettable, others really bad. We have played together, against incredible rivals. You played with me, and I learned how to play with you too.I have seen you changing, sometimes for good, sometimes in my opinion for bad. Every time i close the visor of my helmet I feel your warm embrace, your energy, there is nothing like it.But today I have some other bigger challenges than those you can offer me. And this year, while I am still driving at my best, is how I want to remember you.I can only be grateful to you and to the people that are part of you, for having introduced to me so many cultures, traditions, languages, wonderful people, for having been my life.I know you love me, be certain that I love you too."

sport	Williams extend Mercedes engine partnership to 2025 at least		"Williams will use Mercedes engines in Formula 1 at least until 2025.The team, already committed to Mercedes for next season, have signed a new agreement for the following five years.Williams have declined in form since finishing third in 2014 and 2015, their first two seasons with Mercedes after turbo-hybrid engines came into F1.They finished last in 2018 and are on course for the same position this year, but they hope a technical department restructure will revive fortunes.Williams deputy team principal Claire Williams said: ""Mercedes has been one of the sport's most successful engine suppliers and we believe they will continue to have an extremely competitive engine package going forwards.""Over our time with them they have become a real friend of the team.""New rules planned for 2021 are aimed at making the grid more competitive.

sport	Formula 1: All you need to know about F1's return after the summer break	Alonso's leavingRicciardo's moving - and so are many othersForce India have been savedThe title fightRaikkonen set for yet another chance	"Formula 1 was supposed to spend much of the last three and a half weeks since the Hungarian Grand Prix on a summer break, but the teams and drivers seem not to have got the message.The normally quiet August period instead ended up witnessing a series of major news stories, including on the future of one of the sport's biggest icons.Here is a handy catch-up guide on everything you need to know as F1 returns for the decisive second part of the season, starting at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix on the classic Spa-Francorchamps circuit.Undoubtedly the biggest story of the summer break was Fernando Alonso's announcement that he is to leave F1 at the end of this season.The 37-year-old Spaniard is still at the top of his game - which makes him with Lewis Hamilton arguably the best driver in the sport - but he says he can find ""bigger challenges"" than F1 can offer elsewhere.What that really means is that none of the top teams want to sign him, and he does not believe his McLaren team, after a season in which just how far they have fallen has been laid bare, can become competitive in the near future.Alonso is likely to move to a full-time Indycar programme, with the aim of winning the Indianapolis 500 and becoming only the second man in history to win motorsport's unofficial 'triple crown' of Monaco Grand Prix (or F1 title, depending on how you swing), Le Mans and Indy.That means F1 fans likely have only nine more races to enjoy Alonso's unique abilities, fascinating personality and charisma. Many will be hoping that somehow his McLaren will allow him to find a way to go out on a high, unlikely as that may seem.Alonso's announcement was actually the second big driver news of the summer, following a week or so after Daniel Ricciardo announced his decision to move from Red Bull to Renault for 2019.It was known that the likeable Australian was vacillating over signing his Red Bull contract - he had it in his briefcase over the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend - but even so, the move came as something of a shock to most in F1.That's because of the obvious performance difference between Red Bull and Renault. They might be F1's third and fourth best teams at the moment, but the gap between them is so big that the Renaults have been lapped by the Red Bulls at some races this season.Ricciardo explained on Thursday in Belgium that it was ""by no means an easy decision"" but that he felt he was becoming a bit stale at Red Bull and wanted some fresh motivation.He said he was impressed by the presentation made to him on how Renault plan to move up to compete for wins and world titles in the next few years.Ricciardo's decision has set in motion a whole load of other moves.He will be replaced at Red Bull by Frenchman Pierre Gasly, whose F1 career only started this season, and Spaniard Carlos Sainz has been released from his Red Bull contract to join McLaren.Many other driver moves hang in the balance, not least mystery over whom Toro Rosso will fill both their cars with next season. There is also speculation over who Sainz's team-mate at McLaren will be - either incumbent Stoffel Vandoorne, their reserve Lando Norris or Force India's Esteban Ocon - and the line-ups at both Williams and Force India.Which brings us on to…Force India went into the summer break in administration but were quickly saved by a consortium of businessman led by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, the father of Williams driver Lance.That has led to the rather odd situation whereby Stroll owns one team but his son drives for another. The conclusion to that is obvious - Lance moves to Force India. That will almost certainly happen for 2019, but there remains a possibility it could happen before then.After that, who will be Stroll's team-mate in 2019 out of Force India's current pairing, Ocon and Sergio Perez?The obvious conclusion is Perez, as he triggered the administration process having taken advice from the team's management, and his Mexican backing is worth more financially than the benefits of having Mercedes-backed Ocon.The Frenchman is also proving marginally superior this year - so if Perez stayed, that could make the not-so-far hugely impressive Stroll Jr look better against his team-mate.Not only that, but Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff is trying to persuade McLaren to take Ocon - and the 21-year-old is a tempting opportunity as a known and highly rated quantity to put alongside Sainz.Vandoorne, on the other hand, has looked unconvincing alongside Alonso since he made his debut in 2017, and Norris is obviously talented but still very raw, and would arguably be better served with a second season in Formula Two in 2019.However, while Force India have not yet fundamentally changed their name, legally they are a new entity, and that means they need permission from all other teams for their rights to prize money to be transferred.McLaren, Williams and Renault are holding out on that permission because they fear Force India is now effectively a Mercedes B team, an arrangement they fear will competitively disadvantage them.Whether they continue to hold out remains to be seen - negotiations are ongoing on the subject of guarantees that they will operate as an independent entity.And if Force India (or whatever they end up being called) are a Mercedes B team, wouldn't it make sense for them to have a Mercedes-contracted driver - ie Ocon?Additionally, McLaren are making a stand against Force India (and by extension Mercedes), and therefore are not likely to be that keen to take on a Mercedes driver.Stroll's move - whenever that is - frees up a seat at Williams alongside Russian novice Sergey Sirotkin. They also use Mercedes engines, so perhaps Ocon could get that. But then relations between Mercedes and Williams have cooled as a result of the prize-money transfer thing.Could that open the door for a fairytale race return for reserve driver Robert Kubica, nearly eight years after his career was curtailed by the horrendous injuries he received in a rally crash in February 2011? Don't rule it out.Look out, by the way, for Norris' first appearance on track on a grand prix weekend, when he runs in Alonso's car in first practice.That's most of the off-track stuff, what about on the track?Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton goes into the final part of the season in an apparently strong position, 24 points clear of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel after winning the last two races.But Hamilton's victories came against the run of form - on pure competitiveness, Vettel should have won both races.The German threw away victory in his home event when he crashed out in a late-race rain shower, perhaps partly because he knew how quickly Hamilton was catching him.And the Ferrari was the fastest car in Hungary, but Vettel was scuppered by Ferrari's lack of pace in the rain in qualifying, when he could line up only fourth, and Hamilton took pole.Vettel finished second, but might still have challenged Hamilton for the win had Ferrari's strategists not made some obvious mistakes.Can Ferrari carry on that form at Spa, a track whose long, fast corners might be expected to favour the more efficient aerodynamics of the Mercedes? If they can, it would be a worrying sign for Hamilton.At the same time, both Mercedes and Ferrari are expected to be introducing their third specification of engine either at this race or the one a week later in Italy. Ferrari currently have a power advantage. If either makes a decisive step forward, it too could shift the balance in the title race.Talking of Ferrari, they are the only major team yet to reveal their driver line-up for 2019. Sebastian Vettel is under contract but will Kimi Raikkonen get another year?Before the sudden death of former president Sergio Marchionne last month, a decision had been made to promote Sauber driver Charles Leclerc from Sauber to replace Raikkonen.However, the mood music on that has now changed.Vettel has made it pretty clear he would like to keep Raikkonen, saying at the German GP: ""I like Kimi. As I said, I'd be happy to continue like that, but it's not for me to mention, to decide.""Charles, one way or the other, will have a great career. He's a great guy, he's fast, he's got everything, so definitely, he has no rush.""Now the word is that the new management of Ferrari have gone back on the Leclerc decision and decided to persist with Raikkonen for another year.If that happens, it is presumably in the interests of stability and because they worry the Monegasque might still be a bit too raw and inexperienced for the unique demands of being a Ferrari driver in only the second year of his F1 career.If he does not get the Ferrari drive this year, Leclerc is expected to be moved from Sauber to Ferrari's other satellite team, the more competitive Haas, where he is tipped to replace Romain Grosjean, the Frenchman who has had an incident-strewn season.For those who see great potential in Leclerc - and that is many - it is a disappointment, even if his last two races in Germany and Hungary were not up to the extremely high standard he set from the fourth race in Baku until Silverstone.But given Raikkonen's experience and willingness to kowtow to the team's demands when they want to favour Vettel, it is understandable.There was, though, another driver potentially available.And what it says about the priorities and decision-making at Ferrari that Raikkonen can retain a top-level drive in F1 while Alonso - who crushed him when they were team-mates in 2014 - is apparently not of interest, the reader can decide for themselves."

sport	Bahrain Grand Prix: Formula 1 bosses to reveal sport's future		"Formula 1 bosses will lay out their vision for the sport's future to the teams at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Friday.F1 motorsports boss Ross Brawn will explain the plans of Liberty Media, which bought the commercial rights last year, on cost control, revenue and technical rules.Plans include ways of cutting costs, creating a more equitable split of revenue among teams, a simplified engine and an increased number of standard parts.It will be the first time teams have heard this amount of detail on Liberty's plans.F1 is refusing to comment on the detail of the presentation - bosses have said they prefer to try to do their business in private to avoid creating a public debate on major issues.But the overarching aim is to create a better on-track spectacle and make competing in the sport a more profitable business for all participants at a time when more than half the teams are said to be struggling to make ends meet.The plan has four main aims:F1's plans, with which governing body the FIA is said to be in alignment, are not expected to be presented as 'take it or leave it'. But Liberty's fundamental position is that the sport has to change and time is running out to do so.Even with room for negotiation, the plans are likely to create unease among the teams.The car manufacturers involved in the sport have already made clear their opposition to proposals put forward by F1 and the FIA for simplified engines from 2021.F1 and the FIA want to keep the current architecture of 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines but with a simplified energy recovery system that both reduces costs and attracts new entrants.Mercedes and Ferrari have led opposition to the plan and are currently objecting to the proposal to remove the part of the hybrid system that recovers energy from the turbo, the so-called MGU-H.This is the device that allows the engines to run at revolutionary levels of efficiency. But it is also highly complex and expensive and is seen as part of the reason for Mercedes' domination of the sport since 2014.Plans to increase the number of standardised parts on cars - for example by forcing teams to use the same gearbox internals - are seen by Liberty as a way of reducing costs while having no impact on the audience.Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne has already said it will object to what he has described as plans by Brawn ""to fight against the DNA of F1"".The big teams are also likely to oppose any attempt to reduce the amount of revenue they receive, especially after the sport's income fell last year, reducing the prize money fund by about 5%."
sport	Lewis Hamilton: World champion 'doesn't know how I'm meant to feel'	Rivals pay tribute to achievementSchumacher's record 'very difficult''Emotional rollercoaster' of a seasonHow the world reacted to Hamilton's title victory on social media	"Lewis Hamilton said he was ""flying super-high"" after winning his sixth drivers' title and was struggling to come to terms with his achievement.The British Mercedes driver clinched the championship with second place at the United States Grand Prix behind team-mate Valtteri Bottas on Sunday.""It's beyond surreal that my life journey has brought me to this point in winning the sixth title,"" he said.""I don't know how I am supposed to feel right now.""Hamilton said he was not able to comprehend the scale of his achievement, which moves him to within reach of Michael Schumacher's all-time record of seven World Championships, further confirms his position as one of the greatest in Formula 1 history, and places him as one of the greatest British athletes.The 34-year-old said: ""How am I supposed to feel? I remember watching this sport when I was younger. It's odd to watch it and see someone in the TV set and now to be the person in the TV set and to be doing something like the great that I saw in Ayrton [Senna] and the great I saw in Michael.""I don't believe in the whole cloud nine thing. I am flying super-high right now. I have my family with me. I don't remember the last time my mum and dad and step mum and step dad were at a grand prix, and I don't think I've had them at World Championship grand prix before.""I am really happy to share that with them - the people who have been at the core of who I am and sacrificed everything they have for me to have the life I have to do and have this opportunity.""Hamilton's achievement was saluted by his main rivals, the Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel, Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Bottas.Leclerc, 22, said: ""Only one title is already a huge achievement. To win six is just incredible. He deserves it. He has done an incredible season. I grew up watching him on the TV and just huge congratulations to him.""Four-time world champion Vettel added: ""Now is the time to write as many good things as you can. If someone wins the title six times, then he deserves all of it. That's what I told him as well.""I am happy for him. I am not happy we were not in contention, but you need to respect what he achieved the last years and this year together with his team, how strong they've been.""Bottas, whose last slim hopes of beating Hamilton this season were extinguished in Austin despite his race victory, said: ""Obviously big congrats to him. I personally failed with my target this year, but he deserved it this year. He had some season.""Verstappen described Hamilton's achievement as ""phenomenal"".Hamilton's Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff added: ""It's where talent meets big push for self-improvement all the time - and that combination makes him stand out in his generation.""He will always say there is room for improvement and this is the mentality you need to have. He is for me on an extremely high level but you never want to give yourself or anybody 10/10 because you might be a nine and you want to have the room for being 10 in the future.""Wolff said he believed there was every chance Hamilton could at least match the record of German former driver Schumacher, who won seven world titles with Benetton and Ferrari between 1994 and 2004.""There is a reason why the Schumacher record stands because it is just very difficult,"" he said.""If we are able to provide the drivers with a good car and we continue to work on the gaps we still have and try to minimise the mistakes - and he has a good season - there is no reason why he couldn't go for a seventh title.""Hamilton said: ""I have always said reaching Michael's was never a target for me. I am not really one to think of records and those kinds of things. I definitely thought getting anywhere near Michael was so far fetched. It was so far away and now it seems so close - and yet it is so far away I still can't comprehend it.""I believe I have the ability to continue to grow and to do more with this team and within F1. That would be the target but time will tell. Right now, I am just focused on trying to be as fit and healthy as I can be, smile as much as I can and enjoy this beautiful journey they call life.""Hamilton has dominated the season, winning 10 of 19 races so far, but he said it had been ""the hardest year for us as a team"", largely because of the death of their non-executive chairman and three-time world champion Niki Lauda in May.And he said he had to have a talk to himself on Sunday morning to motivate himself for the race after a disappointing qualifying session left him fifth on the grid.He also referenced the death of Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert in a crash at the Belgian Grand Prix.""We lost Niki this year, a crucial and pivotal member of the team and the emotional rollercoaster we've been on with losing him,"" he said.""Outside the car, just trying to remain focused, that is the toughest. It is only other athletes at the top of their game who can relate to it probably.""This car has not been easy. We started the season thinking we were going to be behind. Mid-point of the season we were behind. And it has been a real challenge.""It has been the toughest second half to the season we have had, fighting against Red Bull and Ferrari, which is great. We welcome that. Every journey is different, every year you go through a different rollercoaster of emotions.""Each and every single one of us is struggling with something in life, small or big. I have tried to show people that from the outside things always look great, but it's not always the case.""I am also struggling with lots of different things and battling with some demons. And trying to make sure I am constantly growing as a person.""When I wake up, I look in the mirror and I am trying to lift myself up and say: 'Yes you can do it, you can win this race if you do the right steps.'""Losing Niki, I didn't think that would hit me as hard as it did. That was really upsetting. That was a tough, pivotal point.""Lost a young kid in Spa, I saw it happen on the TV. When something happens like that it can put lots of doubts in your mind and battling that off and thinking: 'Is it time to stop or should I keep going?' Because there is lots of life afterwards.""I still want to spend time with my family and have a family one day. But I am so charged, and I love doing what I do so much there is not a lot that can stop me."""
sport	Formula 1 is planning a grand prix in Miami for 2019		"Formula 1 is planning to hold a grand prix in Miami, Florida, next year.The Miami City Commission will vote next week on a proposal to conclude a deal with F1, with a view to the first race being held in October 2019.Sean Bratches, F1's managing director commercial operations, said the move by the local government body was ""an important step"" towards holding a race.If the event comes off, it would be the first street race in the US since a grand prix in Phoenix, Arizona in 1991.The Miami race would be the second F1 race in the United States, in addition to the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas.The Austin race is also held in October, which raises the question of whether the two events would be twinned, or whether Texas could be moved to earlier in the season, perhaps to coincide with the Canadian Grand Prix in June.Bratches said: ""We appreciate the community's interest in hosting a Formula 1 race and look forward to working with local officials and stakeholders to bring this vision to life.""Miami's status as one of the world's most iconic and glamorous cities, combined with its robust tourism infrastructure, makes Miami the perfect destination for Formula 1 and its fans."""
sport	Formula 1's greatest drivers: Sir Stirling Moss	SportsmanshipThe crash that ended his careerMille Miglia	"Sir Stirling Moss is the ultimate proof that statistics count only for so much when assessing the worth of a grand prix driver.Once Juan Manuel Fangio had retired in mid-1958, there were no doubts in the minds of anyone in Formula 1 - including the other drivers - about who was the best.The balding, diminutive Englishman who walked on the balls of his feet like he owned the race tracks of the world effectively did. He was The Man - and everyone knew it.Moss towered over the sport to such an extent that he effectively became it. He was known as 'Mr Motor Racing'. Such was the impact Moss made that more than 50 years after his enforced retirement he remains a household name.That Moss should have won the F1 drivers' title is beyond doubt. He was far, far better than many who did.But for a combination of reasons - his resolve to drive for English teams wherever possible, his preference for privateer teams over factory ones, a racer's determination to put victory before all else, sheer bad luck - it never happened.He came closest in 1958, when he lost out on becoming Britain's first world champion to Ferrari's Mike Hawthorn by a single point despite winning four races to his rival's one.In the denouement to that season, Moss also demonstrated another of the qualities that has lodged him in the collective memory - his sportsmanship.At the Portuguese Grand Prix, three races from the end of the season, Hawthorn was under threat of disqualification after being accused of reversing on the track. Moss' impassioned defence of his friend and rival allowed the Ferrari driver to keep his second place, which as things turned out was decisive in the championship.In the final race of the season, in Casablanca, Moss needed to win to give himself a chance of the title and if he did, Hawthorn needed to be second to fend him off.As Moss dominated at the front, Hawthorn drove a tactical race to ensure he was ahead of Moss' Vanwall team-mates, and was then let through into second place in the closing stages by Ferrari partner Phil Hill.Hawthorn's name was on the trophy, but no-one - least of all the Ferrari man himself - was under any illusion that the better driver had finished second.Moss missed out again the following year. Driving a BRM against the dominant Cooper-Climax of Jack Brabham, Moss finished only three of the nine races, but won two of them and finished second to the Australian in the other.Despite his BRM's poor reliability, Moss went into the final round in Sebring, Florida, still in with a chance of the championship. Again he led - from pole position - only for the car to fail once more.A massive accident at Spa in 1960, which he was lucky to survive, ruled Moss out of most of that season, but he was back for 1961.Although his Lotus 18 was outclassed by the gorgeous Ferrari 156 'shark-nose', that season Moss produced two of his greatest races.He took on and beat the faster and more powerful Ferraris at both Monaco and the Nurburgring in performances that stand the test of time as among the greatest there have ever been.It was Moss' last full season, for his career came to a shuddering halt at Goodwood on Monday 23 April, 1962.Racing, as he so often did, outside F1, he crashed into a grass bank and was gravely injured after his Lotus veered out of control for reasons unknown, but which have always been suspected to be some kind of mechanical failure.He was in a coma for a month, the left-hand side of his body partially paralysed for six, and it was a year before he tried a comeback.In a private test session, also at Goodwood, he discovered that, while he could still produce the lap times, his concentration had gone and he sadly announced his retirement.It brought to an end a career of such depth and variety that, to this day, many still regard him as the greatest racing driver there has ever been.Partially, this view is based on his sheer versatility - at a time when grand prix drivers frequently raced in other categories, Moss excelled in everything he drove.Outside F1, he was never better than at the 1955 Mille Miglia - a road race covering 1,000 miles through Italy in the fastest sportscars of the time.Moss' drive on that event has passed into legend. With his co-driver, the journalist Denis Jenkinson, reading pace notes from a roller map, Moss was in a position to compete on level terms with drivers who knew the route much better than he did.Driving a Mercedes-Benz 300SLR, he won in a new record time, beating team-mate Juan Manuel Fangio by nearly half an hour.It is that sort of performance that has led many to class Moss above Fangio, the dominant force of F1 in the 1950s, but it is a hard argument to sustain on the basis of results in the premier category.The two were also team-mates at Mercedes in F1 in 1955, and it was clear who was the faster driver.Moss out-qualified Fangio only once all year - at the British Grand Prix, which was also the Englishman's only victory. To this day, Moss suspects the Argentine let him win, something the great man went to his grave insisting was not true.For his part, Moss insists Fangio was better than he was. Enzo Ferrari, though, for whose team Fangio won one of his titles, disagreed. He rated Moss with the 1930s giant Tazio Nuvolari as the greatest driver of all time.A measure of Ferrari's esteem can be seen in the arrangement he came to with Moss shortly before the Englishman's career-ending crash.Desperate to get Moss into one of his cars, Ferrari tried to persuade him to drive for Maranello. Moss said he was happy to drive a Ferrari - but would do it only for his favourite team, the privateer outfit run by his friend Rob Walker, whose cars were always painted blue. And Ferrari actually agreed.""Looking back,"" Moss says, ""I suppose it was a fairly astonishing concession. But just after that I went and nearly killed myself, so unfortunately it didn't happen.""Ferrari was one of many who believed it a travesty that Moss did not win the world title. But the man himself saw it differently.For him, like Gilles Villeneuve two decades later, the most important race was the one he was in, and not being able to call himself world champion was of little matter.""To me,"" he once said, ""the idea of driving for points goes against the whole point of racing. That's why I so admired Villeneuve's approach. If you're not trying to win at all costs, what on Earth are you doing there?""As far as I'm concerned, boy, any driver who's worth the name tries to win every race he runs. Eventually, the world championship ceased to be very important to me.""Feature first published in 2012"
sport	Pretty slow: What are Formula 1's best-looking backmarkers?	Eagle Mk1 (1968)McLaren-Alfa Romeo (1970)Ensign (1980)Alfa Romeo (1985)Minardi (1985)Ligier (1990)Brabham (1992)BMS Scuderia Italia (1993)Simtek (1994)Sauber (2018)	"After qualifying both cars on the penultimate row of the grid for the season-opening grand prix in Australia, it's clear Sauber do not have the quickest car of 2018.But they certainly have one of the most striking.The best-looking F1 cars typically populate the sharp end of the grid - certainly that's generally been the case in the past couple of decades - but go a little further back in history and some of the best paint jobs were to be found scrapping for minor honours.With that in mind, BBC Sport has selected some F1 cars from down the years that failed to earn a single point in the year highlighted, but at least had the upside of being easy on the eye.Take a look at our gallery and then cast your vote for your favourite at the bottom of the page.The Eagle immediately caught the eye on its entry to F1 in 1966 with its sleek design and dark blue livery, and for a time looked destined for great things.The '66 car had decent pace but was unreliable, but a year later was quick enough to start on the front two rows at every race. However, crippling unreliability remained, and Dan Gurney's win in Belgium and third in Canada - while impressive - were scant return.By 1968 a lack of development saw the car fall hopelessly off the pace as Gurney retired from four of just five entries that season. The end came, ignominiously, in Canada, where Al Pease became the first, and so far only, driver to be disqualified from a World Championship race for being too slow.The liberal nature of F1's participation rules back in 1970 meant that McLaren were able to run effectively two teams that season - one powered by the ubiquitous Ford Cosworth DFV, and the other by an Alfa Romeo engine.It is the latter that makes this list after Andrea de Adamich and Nanni Galli failed to haul the McLaren-Alfa into the points in 10 attempts, a sequence that included five failures to qualify.Still, that papaya orange livery was a real treat for the eyes.The British Ensign team, founded by Mo Nunn in the early 1970s, failed to pull up too many trees in 10 seasons in F1, but their cars were typically well turned out challengers.That was certainly the case with 1980's N180, which was piloted by five-time grand prix winner Clay Regazzoni until he suffered a career-ending accident at the United States Grand Prix West at Long Beach.Britain's Tiff Needell - later to find greater fame as a host of the BBC's Top Gear - took over the drive for two races before he was replaced by Dutchman Jan Lammers. A second N180, driven by Briton Geoff Lees, competed in the Dutch and Italian Grands Prix, but a pointless campaign could not be averted.Alfa Romeo are one of the most desirable carmakers in the world, a reputation built in part on their success in the earliest years of the F1 World Championship, when the Italian constructor powered Giuseppe Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio to title wins in 1950 and 1951.Alfa's abrupt withdrawal from the sport before the 1952 season marked the end of their involvement as a manufacturer until 1979, when they returned for a second bite of the cherry.Two poles and a handful of podiums followed over the next five seasons, but it was clear the glory days were long gone. The team's final car, 1985's 185T, looked the part, but was woefully off the pace. ""The worst car I ever drove,"" was one of the kinder things Riccardo Patrese later said about it.When people used to describe Minardi as ""perennial backmarkers"", they weren't exaggerating.The Italian team based out of Faenza failed to score a world championship point in 10 of the 21 F1 seasons they contested, with their best return in a single campaign just seven points, achieved in both 1993 and 2005.The 1985 M185, driven by Pierluigi Martini, was the team's first car and arguably the best-looking of any they created over the following two decades. It failed to score a point after a punishing debut season featuring 12 retirements and one failure to qualify.Ligier were one of the most competitive teams in F1 in the 1970s and early 1980s, but by 1990 they had been in decline for several years and reached their nadir with consecutive pointless campaigns in 1990 and 1991.The JS33B from 1990 at least had a vivid paint job and a selection of state-owned sponsors to remember it by - gambling and fags, anyone? - but points, alas, were comfortably beyond it.A Renault engine deal briefly revived the team's fortunes but the Ligier name was destined to disappear from F1 at the end of 1996.The once-mighty Brabham team were in their death throes in 1992, but they were at least fated to depart the F1 scene in a measure of style.The two-time constructors' champions - with Eric van de Poele, Giovanna Amati and future world champion Damon Hill on driving duty - qualified for just three races before quietly expiring after the Hungarian GP, but they nevertheless made a mark on the collective memory with an arresting pink-and-purple livery.Like fellow Italian also-rans Minardi, BMS Scuderia Italia spent the vast majority of their F1 existence shackled to the back few rows of the grid - although there were notable highs.A pointless first campaign in 1988 was no surprise, but the team surpassed expectations the following season when Dallara's nimble chassis helped Alex Caffi to fourth in Monaco before Andrea de Cesaris went one better with third in Canada.Another podium for JJ Lehto came at the brutally attritional 1991 San Marino Grand Prix, but the team's days were numbered. The final Scuderia Italia car - 1993's Lola T93/30 - was a vision in red, yellow and white as it bimbled around the grand prix tracks of the world, but competitive it was not.The team sat out the final two races of 1993 as the money ran dry, before a merger with Minardi kept some of the team's component parts alive, if not the name.Simtek burst on to the F1 scene in 1994 with well-intentioned plans of appealing to a new breed of F1 fans with their edgy purple-and-black livery and sponsorship from MTV and Russell Athletic.But the harsh realities of F1 quickly took hold. The death of driver Roland Ratzenberger in a crash in final qualifying for the third race of the season at Imola was a shuddering blow from which the team never truly recovered.David Brabham gamely led the team through to the end of the season while a carousel of pay-drivers occupied the cockpit of the second S941 - an indication of the financial plight that had so swiftly engulfed the team and led to their ultimate demise just five races into the 1995 season.Ok, so we're just one race into the 2018 season and lobbing the new Sauber in with a bunch of cars whose shared trait was a failure to score a single World Championship points is perhaps a tad unfair.However, the lovely C37 was the motivation for this entire article, so in it must go.Certainly based on the opening race and the form of recent seasons it's not wholly unfair to predict the Sauber will be cruising at the back this season, but if it starts to drive as good as it looks, maybe the points will begin to flood in.If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote."

sport	Formula 1: Can Lewis Hamilton & Mercedes be stopped in 2018?	Hamilton and a place in historyFerrari with questions to answerCan Alonso get back to where he belongs?What about the halo?It'll get tasty off track, too	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe same question hangs over Formula 1 at the start of the 2018 season as it has for the past five years. Can anyone stop Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes?The cars may feature what is arguably the single biggest visual change in years - with the introduction of the 'halo' driver head protection device - but the action on track looks set to be very familiar.The realities of the momentum of four consecutive world championship doubles, in addition to an imposing performance in pre-season testing, have installed Mercedes and their formidable lead driver as hot favourites as the clock ticks down to the first race of a new season in Australia on Sunday.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who looked set to snatch the title from Hamilton last year until his season imploded late on, is talking up his hopes.The German, competing with Hamilton for the honour of being the first driver of his generation to become a five-time world champion, says Ferrari are ""starting from a good base"" with the new car. And he has played down the superiority apparently shown by Mercedes over eight days in Spain.But even Vettel concedes Mercedes are the team to beat, and all indications are the champions have an advantage heading into the new season.Hamilton has broken a number of F1's statistical records over the past year. And having moved ahead of his hero Ayrton Senna in terms of pole positions and titles, he has said he is not especially motivated by the idea of supplanting Michael Schumacher's record 91 wins (Hamilton is 29 short) and seven titles (three to go).But motivation to keep winning he definitely has.Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio, whose tally of five titles is under threat from both Hamilton and Vettel this year, holds a special place in motorsport history. It is hard to imagine anyone ever matching his statistical achievements in terms of averages. And he is regularly in the top two or three of lists of greatest drivers of all time.So it is not surprising to hear Hamilton say the prospect of ""being up with Fangio"" is ""quite exciting"".Hamilton's desire to leave a legacy that statistically defines him as better than Vettel - a belief he already holds privately - is another factor urging him to keep going.""There are other drivers relatively close, like Sebastian,"" he said, when discussing the record of pole positions last year. ""I have got to take it as far as I can take it.""Beyond that, there is Hamilton's personal quest to be the best he can be. ""It is quite simple,"" he says. ""I want to somehow be better than I was last year, which I think was the best year I had performance-wise.""How can I top that? I proved it was a very, very strong year, but there are lots of areas actually.""For the others, this is a scary prospect, and it is not the only one.Last year, Vettel took the championship lead with victory in Australia in March and did not relinquish it until the Italian Grand Prix in September, while Mercedes struggled to get on top of a car that was fast on some circuits but difficult to work with on others.Their target over the winter was to maintain the strengths of the 2017 car while fixing its weaknesses, or what team boss Toro Wolff called its ""diva qualities"".Hamilton said during testing: ""There doesn't feel any of those."" Technical director James Allison says the 2018 car would ""blow away"" last year's. If he and his team have succeeded in their task, this could be a long season indeed.In that scenario, the only entertainment risks being whether Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas can provide a substantial challenge, which the Finn is yet to prove is the case.Ferrari enter 2018 surrounded by questions as to whether they might have let their best chance to beat Mercedes slip through their fingers.Last year's car was arguably the best - as opposed to out-and-out fastest over one lap - of the season. But driver and team errors let the title slip away.This year, while Mercedes have stuck to their own design philosophy and evolved it, Ferrari have combined theirs with some of Mercedes'.In particular, Ferrari have lengthened the wheelbase to about the same size as that on the Mercedes, in an attempt to combine the fast-circuit aerodynamic efficiency they were lacking with their strong low-speed, high-downforce package.It is not yet clear whether it has worked. And while the Italian team entered last season with an obviously fast car, this year's seems to be a step behind the Mercedes - in the region of 0.3 seconds or so - and nip and tuck with the Red Bull.For the sake of a competitive season, Ferrari's pace in Australia will be watched with both interest and a degree of apprehension.Ferrari at least go into 2018 with an engine that appears sufficiently competitive with Mercedes' power unit.The same cannot be said for Red Bull and their Renault engine, which is still a step behind the top two manufacturers.Reliability concerns mean Renault will not be able to run the engine in as aggressive a way as they would like. All three of its teams, which also include the factory outfit and McLaren, will be investing a lot of expectations in an upgrade to its hybrid system that it is hoped will come on stream at the fifth race of the year.Meanwhile, the intra-team battle at Red Bull promises to be as diverting as ever, with Daniel Ricciardo seeking to re-establish himself in the face of Max Verstappen's growing momentum, not least because the Australian is out of contract at the end of the year.Whether the likeable and super-fast Ricciardo sticks or twists - with potential openings at Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault - will be one of the major narratives of the year.Ferrari's propensity to turn the biggest budget in F1 into a car that cannot do the job was what ultimately drove Fernando Alonso away at the end of 2014.It was not the smartest move from either team or driver but there is no doubt that Alonso lost most from it. Following his move to McLaren, a man who in the same car would give Hamilton a run for his money, at least, has spent the past three years wasting his talent in the midfield in a car that, when it ran at all, was nowhere close to competitive.Alonso admitted he considered walking away from F1 last year, so great were his frustrations through the Honda years at being forced to fight way below his level. Now, though, the 36-year-old has hopes his nightmare might end, following McLaren's decision to end the partnership with Honda and switch to Renault engines.The year has not started well, with a sequence of reliability problems in testing which have inevitably set the team back. But a fast lap from Alonso on the last day in Spain recalibrated expectations of a car that had looked destined to be, if anything, an initial step backwards.McLaren have a major upgrade coming for Australia - and more to come after that. It looks like they will initially be competing to be the fourth fastest team along with surprise package Haas and Renault.That's not enough for Alonso, but it's not a bad starting point from which to work.And almost everyone with an interest in natural justice hopes McLaren can live up to their promises and enable one of the greatest drivers to spend the twilight of an illustrious career back where he belongs - competing somewhere close to the front.If he is not, it won't only be Alonso who is unhappy.McLaren claimed last year that they had one of the best chassis and needed only a good engine to be competitive.Before testing, their stated aim was to be competing with Red Bull. Now, pressure is already mounting on them. If they are not running with Red Bull by mid-season, after a few races' grace to sort out their car with a new engine, questions are likely to be asked, and someone may end up paying the price.Will the halo device distract and detract from the action on track? For some - including a minority of drivers - it is an abomination, a betrayal of the very ethos of F1, and an unnecessary addition into a sport already perceived to be relatively safe.For others - including the majority of the drivers, nearly all the top ones, their representative body the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, and governing body the FIA - it is a vital protection against the last controllable mortal risk and introducing it is a responsibility the sport cannot shirk.The only consensus is it does not look great - a titanium cage stretched around the driver's head, rendering him more invisible than he already was.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBut the teams have done their best to integrate it into their colour schemes and it is remarkable how quickly you become used to it when looking at the cars repeatedly.The only thing that can be said for certain, however, is the halo - and whatever developments of it follow to improve both aesthetics and function - is here to stay.Political rows are an intrinsic part of F1. They contribute to the complexities that make it such a fascinatingly rich sport to follow. And this year they are likely to take centre stage.The contracts that bind the teams to F1 run out in 2020. Talks about new ones have already started and appear to be going not very far, fast.A number of particularly thorny, and intermingled, issues need resolving.Prime among these are the engine formula, revenue distribution and attempts to introduce spending limitations.There is not the space to go into them in detail here. But suffice to say the engine manufacturers have objected to an initial proposal on rules for 2021, three of the four own teams, and F1's new owners are trying to reduce the amount of money they pay to the competitors while the sport's income suffered its first ever drop last year.This, in an environment in which it is becoming increasingly hard to find external sponsorship, and TV viewing figures are going down because of the shift away from free-to-air television.In that context, the battles off the track are likely to be just as fiery as those on it."
sport	Formula 1: Williams finalising Sergey Sirotkin 2018 drive		"Williams are close to signing Sergey Sirotkin as the final piece of the 2018 grid falls into place.The team are finalising a contract with the 22-year-old, who established his credentials in a test in Abu Dhabi after the end of last season.The Russian, who has a reported budget of €15m (£13.3m), was faster than rival Robert Kubica after the team had fully analysed all the data from the test.Sirotkin and Lance Stroll would be the least experienced line-up on the grid.Sirotkin will be making his F1 debut as partner to a 19-year-old who has raced for only one season.Williams had been intending to sign Kubica for a return to F1 seven years after the Pole suffered life-changing injuries in a rally crash in February 2011.But the team's interest in the 32-year-old cooled after he tested their 2017 car in Abu Dhabi alongside Sirotkin.Sirotkin has a bigger budget than Kubica by a factor of about two, but the team insist the decision is primarily performance-based.Although there is understood to be no impediment to the Sirotkin-Williams deal, no announcement is expected for at least the next 10 days as the team take their time to complete the details of the contract.Meanwhile, Canadian Nicolas Latifi has joined Force India as test and reserve driver for the 2018 Formula 1 season.The 22-year-old will take part in what the team say are ""a number"" of Friday practice sessions, as well as the two official 'young driver' tests this year.Latifi - who finished fifth in Formula Two last season, winning one race - said: ""I'm really excited about the opportunity and eager to show the team what I can do.""The Toronto native, who brings with him to Force India a significant budget, has previously been linked to a similar role at Williams.Latifi is also expected to do another year of F2 alongside his F1 commitments.It will be his fifth season in the category, which changed its name from GP2 to F2 last year.Media playback is not supported on this device"

sport	Formula 1: FIA boss Jean Todt responds to halo criticism	Progress on engine regulation deal	"Motorsport boss Jean Todt has hit back at criticism of the new halo head protection device.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said last month that he would take a chainsaw to the halo if he could.But Todt, the president of motorsport's governing body the FIA, said it had been introduced to save lives and at the request of drivers' body the GPDA.""I am amazed to hear some people say: 'OK, motor racing is dangerous, if it happens, it happens,'"" Todt said.""Can you imagine how we would all feel if something happened and if we would have had the halo it would not have happened?""And he dismissed critical comments from Wolff by saying: ""I will not react. It is a childish game. It's very inappropriate, whoever you are, to publicly deny something which is introduced.""The halo has been under development for several years, and has emerged as the most effective of the designs tested at protecting the driver's head from impact with large external objects.But Todt pointed out that the process that led to its adoption in Formula 1 was kick-started two years ago by the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.He said its directors Alex Wurz, Jenson Button and Sebastian Vettel had written to him in December 2015 ""urging us to decide for head protection for the drivers"".And he said that before a meeting to decide on its adoption in July 2016, the GPDA said: ""Don't be weak and please respect what we have asked you on safety.""Although a majority of drivers are in favour, some have said they are opposed to the idea of it, while others have raised objections surrounding the difficulty of getting in and out of the car and identifying drivers on track.""If we are able to find something better, I am sure we will be able to over the years,"" Todt said.""Honestly, I am not disturbed with what I see. I read somewhere we do not see who is driving. We have been complaining for years that we do not see who is driving the car; we don't see the name. You need to be a big expert. For me it could be a facilitator to know who is driving the car.""He said that he had heard no criticism of the halo in Formula Two, which is also using it this season, or the all-electric Formula E series, where it is being introduced in 2019.Todt, speaking at a news conference in London, also said that he was confident of reaching a solution on new engine regulations needed after 2020. The basis for these would be the current turbo hybrids, he said.""The whole idea is to work on what are the engine rules now and make them better,"" he added.The engine manufacturers in F1 have put forward a counter-proposal, after objecting to an initial plan made by the FIA and F1 Group in November.Todt refused to say what had been proposed, and said he wanted to be ""fair"" to the existing manufacturers. But he emphasised that all parties in F1 had agreed unanimously to make the engines cheaper, simpler rev higher, sound better, remove restrictions on fuel flow and ensure the regulations facilitated new entrants.In a wide-ranging discussion of the fact that F1 is in the process of negotiating new commercial contracts with the teams for post-2020, Todt said he was personally not in favour of Ferrari maintaining its contractual veto over rule changes.But he added that he had also been opposed to this the last time contracts were negotiated and backed down because all other parties had been in favour of it.And he defended Ferrari receiving more prize money than other teams.""Is it normal that Leonardo DiCaprio gets more money than an actor from a TV series?"" he said rhetorically. ""It's normal."""
sport	Lewis Hamilton, Formula 1 champion: Breaking records & veganism	"What was your best qualifying lap of the year?The poles in Silverstone, Monza in the wet and Malaysia seem to stand out - would you agree?Did the 2017 cars bring what you expected?What about the experience of driving them and the increased cornering speeds?What have been the best corners this year, with the faster cars?Can you describe what it is like to drive these cars on the limit?Do you keep your knowledge of the limit in certain corners in the memory bank and the use it in qualifying?At the Japanese Grand Prix, you said the Esses were ""insane"". So are the cars approaching the physical limits of human beings? If they were any faster would you struggle to cope?Why do the cars not seem to slide as much as they did, say, 20 years ago?Where do you stand on the argument about track limits?You've talked about changing your diet and trying to go vegan this year. How has that changed you?Can you still go in a steak restaurant but just eat other things?What led you to the decision?"	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceLewis Hamilton carved a special place in Formula 1 history this season with his fourth world title and a new all-time record for pole positions.In what was arguably the best season he has driven in his 11 years in F1, Hamilton won nine races in his Mercedes, set 11 poles and clinched the title with two races still to go.Hamilton also changed his lifestyle to pursue a vegan diet and became more outspoken on global issues.It was a historic season for other reasons, too - F1 introduced major rule changes that made the cars wider, faster, more dramatic, and also harder to race.Here, the 32-year-old reflects on some of the key subjects of 2017, starting with the 11 pole positions that moved him past Ayrton Senna and then Michael Schumacher in the history books.Dude, I can't remember. I can barely remember the last few days.There have been some very special laps, though.Monza was very tough. I was really surprised that the others (were so far away)… Malaysia; it was a real surprise to be on pole there.I'd have to go and look at them (to give a definitive answer) because there are ones that felt better than others. Individually, they have not felt the same.Malaysia, for example, I thought: ""I'm probably not going to get pole today but I'm going to give it everything anyway."" Then somehow you hook up a lap. Because there were moments in that lap where there were drifts and you just held onto it and somehow hit the apex, still the drift, it actually set you up - which you weren't planning but you take it.They brought exactly what I expected - worse racing.I didn't really have an expectation. But they've been a big step in the right direction, much more enjoyable. Another step like this would be good - and bring some of the noise back.There's some great qualities of it but we need to put better bits in. For example, following (other cars) this year has been worse, naturally. They (F1's bosses) know the issues and I think they should utilise us (the drivers) and speak to us.Some of these guys - every guy, most likely - that's on the board haven't driven an F1 car and don't know why it's so hard to get past. But they're also very smart and know stuff we don't.Pouhon at Spa - the high-speed corners this year have been, phwoar. The best corners of the season are generally Austin - Turns Three-Four-Five-Six-Seven. They are awesome. Silverstone - Copse and then Maggotts and Becketts. Suzuka - the Esses. They are the special ones.For some reason Austin is the best set-up because there are different lines you can take within that. Suzuka, it is very hard to have a different line and race. That's why I love Austin. Somehow the layout; I don't think they planned it but it's enabled it to be a track you can overtake on. It's one of my favourite tracks, actually, and I don't like new tracks usually.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt's difficult to describe. It's like trying to describe how you felt when the baby came out.The exciting thing is being on the limit. It's getting out there and discovering the limit faster than everyone else and then when you get to that limit, playing with the limit. Then balancing on the edge. Controlling it. I love that.For sure. That's part of the discovery through practice. Which is how you see often in qualifying I can pull out a little bit more. You keep those things. I love the qualifying because you're always trying to pull out another card. You can't always do it.Yeah, but I want that. The problem is you build yourself. The human body's quite remarkable because you can build the strength. So make the cars another three seconds faster; it's going to be a challenge but F1 should push you so much to the limit physically. I love that. That's where we should be. I hope we move more in that direction.The tyres are not so forgiving. Back then, there was a lot less aero(dynamic grip), more mechanical. Which I think is what we need.It's like karting. With karting you don't have (tyre) degradation. And with all the aero on the cars, you get that slide, and you often can't get the heat out of the tyre (afterwards). The key is to keep temperatures down, minimise wheelspin. Any slip you have... it feels good but you know it's going to affect you two corners later.The FIA have done an amazing job but they've really got to stop with these run-off areas. You shouldn't be able to cut a corner like you see.What I love about the olden days - of course you don't want to crash, but if you go wide, you've got to lose time. But now you can approach a corner knowing that if you go in 5% too much you can go wide and come back on. I don't love that.Other tracks I used to love were Oulton Park and Donington Park. Donington - the Old Hairpin was a nightmare. You have to come off the brakes and run the speed in, use the downforce.Then up the hill and the second right-hander before the back straight (Coppice). You can't even see the white line. There is a white line and then gravel and the gravel sucks you off - oh man.Finding the limit there, that corner is way harder than all the corners in F1. That's the sort of corner F1 is missing. If we had that back in F1, it would bring another level to the challenge.I do have more energy but before I had more than enough energy anyway. I just feel cleaner. I don't feel bogged down, don't have problems with my stomach like I used to have, just feel cleaner.It's hard to stay on the diet I'm on. Not at all the temptation. It's actually really weird, once you get across that side. The other day I was at dinner and my friends were eating meat and I look at it and I'm disgusted and I used to love meat.Media playback is not supported on this deviceI actually wouldn't go. I was invited to a meal recently and I said: 'Look, I'm really trying to stick to his diet I'm on and I don't believe in supporting that restaurant.'Struggling in finding foods that you love as much as foods you used to love is what it is. I live on salads. I have a lot more carbs now, which is weird because before I had cut my carbs completely and had a high protein diet but now I'm on salads, a lot of breads, pancakes.So some things are really enjoyable but I'm still discovering. It does change your life. But I feel the best I've ever felt.I met people, friends who were vegans, who exposed me to some of the things that were happening that I was completely oblivious to.It affected me so much when I saw these things (that meat-eating does). So bit by bit I weaned off it. Came off red meat two and a half years ago, stopped eating chicken at the beginning of this year and was pescatarian.Then the final thing was seeing this one documentary. I'd seen a couple, but this one was, 'OK, I'm done'."
sport	Renault critical of Japanese GP disqualification		"Renault have criticised their Japanese Grand Prix disqualification as ""not proportionate"" and ""inconsistent"".But the team will not appeal against the penalty for using a driver-aid system to avoid ""investing further time and effort in a sterile debate"".Renault's brake-bias adjustment system contravened rules dictating that the car must be driven alone and unaided.The team said the penalty was ""not proportionate to any benefit the drivers derived"".They added that the decision was ""subjective"" - but that they were not appealing because they had ""no new evidence"" to add to the case.Renault had until 16:00 BST on Thursday to decide whether to appeal against the disqualification of Daniel Ricciardo and Nico Hulkenberg from sixth and 10th places at the race at Suzuka on 13 October.Renault's statement referenced the contradiction in the ruling by FIA, which said that the system complied with the technical regulations by ""exploiting certain ambiguities"" within them but contravened sporting regulations outlawing driver aids.The ruling hinged on the details of what officials described as ""innovative solutions"" to adjusting the brake bias - the balance of braking from front to rear - around a lap.Renault said they believed their disqualification from the race result was ""inconsistent with previous sanctions for similar breaches"".It added: ""However, since we have no new evidence to bring other than that already produced to demonstrate the legality of our system, we do not wish to invest further time and effort in a sterile debate in front of the International Court of Appeal concerning the subjective appreciation, and therefore sanction, related to an aid that reduces the driver workload without enhancing the performance of the car.""Formula 1 will always be an arena for the relentless search for the slightest possible opportunities for competitive advantage. It is what we have always done and will continue to do, albeit with stronger internal processes before innovative solutions are brought on track.""The ruling was made on the grounds that Renault's brake-bias adjustment system ""acts as a driver aid by saving the driver from having to make a number of adjustments during a lap"".Brake bias is changed by drivers using controls on the steering wheel.Details of the operation of the system were not included in the ruling because it contained Renault's intellectual property and should remain ""confidential in nature because (the stewards) evaluate data worthy of protection""."
sport	Formula 1 testing: Fernando Alonso says McLaren issues under control	McLaren's ongoing problemsThe pace-setters	"McLaren's Fernando Alonso insists there is ""nothing fundamentally wrong on the car"" after the team suffered more problems in testing.Alonso was delayed for nearly seven hours after his car broke down because of an oil leak.Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton set the pace on day two of the final pre-season test in Barcelona.""The issues we had are well under control,"" said Alonso.It was the latest in a series of reliability problems for the team.Alonso managed less than a third of the laps done during the day by Ricciardo and the Mercedes and Renault drivers.""From a team, point of view, we are more or less OK,"" he added. ""Unfortunately we keep discovering small things every day but it is putting us in a strong position for Australia in the way we are reinforcing [how to fix] all the small issues.""Alonso did 47 laps in the morning before stopping out on track after just over two hours of the day's running. The team said they would get him out later in the day - but managed to do so with only 13 minutes to go.He was on track for only eight minutes before the day was brought to a premature end when rookie Charles Leclerc went off in the Sauber.Alonso's problems made it the fourth of six days of pre-season testing so far on which McLaren have lost significant track time as a result of technical issues.The team are hoping to be close to the front this season following their switch to Renault engines after three difficult years with Honda.Alonso has one more day in the car on Thursday before the first race, but he said: ""We probably need the last day to do some laps and some long runs to check extra things you keep discovering about the new car - but in terms of fundamental answers you need over the winter they are already OK.""I don't need the last day, to be honest. I will be in the car, but if Australia was tomorrow it is OK.""McLaren racing director Eric Boullier insisted the team were on track, and that they were simply suffering the sort of niggles that can be expected in pre-season.""We are on top of this and it is a new partnership with Renault - new packaging, completely new packaging for the car as well. This is testing, give us time - it is fine,"" Boullier said.McLaren are not yet close to achieving the main ambition set by Boullier for this week of completing a race distance.Alonso, who has said he expects his team to be able to challenge for podium positions this season, did set the fifth-fastest time of the day, but he was using the 'hyper-soft' tyre and was 1.8 seconds behind Ricciardo's pace-setting best on the same rubber.Ricciardo edged out Hamilton by 0.353secs for fastest time, but the Mercedes was substantially quicker when the cars were on equivalent tyres.Hamilton did not use the hyper-soft tyre, although his team-mate Valtteri Bottas did after taking over the Mercedes for the afternoon session, and was 0.6secs slower than Ricciardo on it.Hamilton was 0.5secs quicker than Ricciardo on the ultra-soft tyre, and 0.8secs ahead on the medium tyre.The times are not necessarily directly comparable because the fuel loads and engine modes being used by the car are not made public by the teams and can make a significant difference to performance.Ricciardo said it had been a ""good day"" and added: ""The Mercs still look pretty quick.

sport	Formula 1: McLaren ringing car changes to 'close the gap' after Shanghai	Key car updates soonIs the car too 'draggy'?Is it easy to fix a draggy car?	"McLaren say they are struggling to understand why their car lacks pace this season - especially in qualifying.Fernando Alonso is sixth in the championship after three points finishes.But both McLaren cars have qualified outside the top 10 at all grands prix.""We need to understand why we are slow in qualifying, why we are better in the race and why we are behind the other Renault teams,"" racing director Eric Boullier said.McLaren had expectations of battling for podium finishes and even wins this season following their switch to Renault engines from Honda, having claimed last season that they had one of the best chassis but were being held back by their engine.But Alonso's best qualifying position so far was 11th at the opening grand prix in Australia, and he was 13th on the grid in both Bahrain and China. He finished fifth in Melbourne and seventh in the other two races.Team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne has qualified behind Alonso in all races and scored points in ninth and eighth places in Australia and Bahrain.Alonso said of his seventh place in China: ""A good Sunday for us. Fridays and Saturdays are a little bit worse but the points are given on Sunday. So far, so good.""The two-time champion said Daniel Ricciardo's victory for Red Bull in Shanghai ""shows us the potential of the [Renault] power-unit. It gives us confidence that with this power-unit we will be able to fight if we do a good job on the chassis side.""We are not quite there and we need to close the gap and work hard and bring some updates in the next races.""Boullier has blamed reliability problems in pre-season testing for a delay in the production of upgrades that had been due for the opening races.These are now scheduled for the fifth race, in Spain next month. Boullier said: ""From that point we will see performance-wise where we are.""But he also said at the Chinese Grand Prix that McLaren might have set their performance targets too low during the design process of this year's car.""The car has matched all the targets, so maybe that means the targets were not the right ones and we need to revise in terms of ambitions what we need to achieve.""McLaren's rivals did not share their view of the quality of their car last year.Engineers from rival teams believed that the McLaren was quick in the corners because the car was running with too much drag - and that this was at least as much to blame for its lack of straight-line speed as the Honda engine.Events so far this year suggest that McLaren could have misinterpreted the quality of their chassis - it is still the slowest in the speed traps despite switching engines.Boullier said: ""This is obviously one of the issues but it's not the only one.""If it were a question of just drag in the car it would be easy to fix so we have to address - I'm going to use the word fundamentally - all aspects of the car to make sure we are where we should be.""The amount of aerodynamic downforce a car has is one of the key determining factors in its performance. But, for a complex series of reasons, more downforce does not necessarily mean better lap time. One of these reasons is that downforce creates drag, which slows the car on the straights.So all teams are trying to find the optimum balance between downforce and drag - which means they seek to create downforce in the most efficient way possible.If the car has too much drag, a team cannot simply reduce it, because that also reduces downforce. They have to find a way to create the same - or more - downforce while also producing less drag.McLaren's performance suggests their car's downforce is not created in as efficient a manner as that of teams with faster cars.If the team's Spain upgrade package does not deliver a significant improvement, fixing that could take months because of the lead time involved in researching and making new aerodynamic parts."
sport	Lewis Hamilton: Bahrain overtake up there with the best in Formula 1?	What happened?'Quite risky' - what Hamilton said'He breezed past them all'What you said on #bbcf1Five of the best - stunning overtakes from the past	"""Now he's going to try to take three cars into one corner... what a move by Lewis Hamilton!""Jack Nicholls' voice said it all.Commentating on Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix for BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Nicholls' tone got steadily higher as he watched Hamilton turn ninth into sixth in one stunning move.Of the 42 overtakes in Bahrain, Hamilton's was undoubtedly the pick of the bunch.Hamilton started ninth on the grid after a five-place penalty for a gearbox change in his Mercedes.He made a great start and speared between the Force India of Esteban Ocon and Renault's Nico Hulkenberg in front of him, but chose to back off and play safe before the first corner and finished the first lap ninth.A virtual safety car period to recover the retired Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo paused the race, and after the restart Hamilton swept past Fernando Alonso's McLaren on the pit straight before - seemingly with the braking zone fast approaching - deciding to dive past both Ocon and Hulkenberg into the first corner.Running sixth by lap five, Hamilton passed Kevin Magnussen's Haas a lap later, then Pierre Gasly, and moved into fourth by lap eight, before finishing third after Kimi Raikkonen's retirement.""It is not an easy manoeuvre to pull off - it was quite risky,"" said the Briton.""I tried to be cautious. I had a lot of people ahead and a long race. I was trying to take it easy, but lost a lot of ground at the start and was trying to come back.""Ex-Renault Formula 1 driver Jolyon Palmer on BBC Radio 5 live sports extraThis is brilliant for him. The race has unfolded perfectly for him after a tough start. Hamilton had more straight-line speed in a treble tow and breezed past them all.Shaun Bristow: Hamilton overtakes three cars in one go. Just another day at the office.Sho: Three in one for Lewis! Wow!Josh Earl: Hamilton passing three cars at once, brilliant.Mansell vs Piquet - 1987 British Grand PrixAsk Nigel Mansell if driving at your home grand prix helps you discover energy reserves that you didn't even think you had, and he would agree.The 1992 world champion produced some magical moments in front of the British fans, none more so than his ruthless hunting down and stunning overtake of Williams team-mate Nelson Piquet at Silverstone in 1987.""That race was just pure dynamite,"" said Mansell. ""The fans were getting into it. I could see the fans stand up every time I went round. It meant so much to me and you could tell how much it meant to them.""Mansell famously chased down Piquet's 29-second advantage before producing a breathtaking overtake on the Brazilian with two laps to go, selling him a dummy before diving down the inside into Stowe Corner.""It was like a chess game and I was doing maths for the last 28 laps thinking, 'If I do X amount of qualifying laps, can I find 29 seconds and catch him? And then if I catch him, is there enough time to pass him?'"" added Mansell.Alonso vs Schumacher - 2005 Japanese Grand PrixFernando Alonso is the sort of special talent who is both capable and brave enough to go where few other drivers dare go.That was very much the case in 2005 when a young Alonso not only took on Michael Schumacher but did so at one of the most challenging corners in Formula 1, Suzuka's famous 130R.Alonso had been running nose to tail with Schumacher for several laps before finally grasping the opportunity to strike, sweeping around the outside of Schumacher at full speed - 207mph - to put himself on the way to a third-place finish.Mansell vs Berger - 1990 Mexican Grand PrixSome moves are so good even the driver who does it can't quite believe it happened.Mansell's manoeuvre at the 1990 Mexican Grand Prix was one of those.The Briton once showed his fearless streak with a 300km/h (186mph) pass on Gerhard Berger around the outside of the hugely intimidating Peraltada corner on the penultimate lap to take second.""I think, did I really do that?"" said Mansell. ""Because in that day if it went wrong, you were going to get seriously hurt. So you've got to be a bit mental to take it on.""Crazy or not, the fans loved it and the corner was renamed 'Mansell's corner' in his honour before the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix.Hakkinen vs Schumacher - 2000 Belgian Grand PrixAt the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix, Mika Hakkinen pulled off one of the greatest overtaking manoeuvres in F1 history to win from Michael Schumacher.The German led coming into Les Combes on the 41st lap and in the way was Ricardo Zonta's BAR-Honda, which the pair were about to lap.Hakkinen said: ""I thought to myself, 'Whichever way Michael goes, I'll go the other.' He went to the left, so I went to the right, braking as late as I dared, off-line, on a still-damp track, at 300km/h (186mph). As I turned in, I had done it; I had passed Michael.""Hakkinen finished first, with Schumacher second, although the German would beat the Finn to the world title.Ayrton Senna vs Alain Prost - 1988 Japanese Grand PrixIn the Japanese Grand Prix of 1988, Ayrton Senna stalled on the grid but recovered to be involved in a spectacular battle with McLaren team-mate Alain Prost.On a wet surface, Senna got past his rival with a brave move down the inside that enabled him to win the race and become world champion.While it may not seem to be one of the higher-risk passes, given what was at stake it was beautifully executed and we would eventually realise just how rare it would be for Senna and Prost to actually get around each other without it ending in a title-deciding shunt."

He's always had a great smile on his face and happy to shake your hand afterwards,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Stephen Nolan.King, 25, a former British Formula 3 champion who also races in IndyCar in the United States, added: ""I spoke with him three, four hours before the race, and we were actually at the fanzone in Formula 1, and we raced with a couple of fans on the Playstation game, and we had quite a good race on the game, so that will probably stick in my memory for a long period of time as it's so recent.""He also remembered some of his races with him, saying: ""I had a great race with him in France at his home grand prix, and had a great race with him in Barcelona as well, where we were wheel-to-wheel so, those real things will stick with you for a long time for sure.""When asked about safety in motorsport, King said: ""Racing now is the safest that it's ever been, so in some instances that is amazing, and it's meant we're kind of numbed to the danger of the sport. Obviously we now have very few big accidents because of how safe the sport is, but when it happens it hits home harder.""He added: ""On the back of every ticket it says 'motorsport can be dangerous', so people do need to have a lot of respect for this sport because it's not a walk in the park.""Hubert's death was confirmed by motorsport's governing body the FIA soon after Saturday's Formula 1 support race at the Belgian circuit.He had suffered a huge impact from the car of American Juan Manuel Correa at the Raidillon swerves.Correa was taken to Liege hospital by helicopter and is in intensive care, but his condition is stable after surgery.The 20-year-old suffered fractures to both his legs and a ""minor spinal injury"" in the crash.The race was stopped after the crash and cancelled within a few minutes when the potential seriousness of the accident became clear.Formula 2 later announced that Sunday's sprint race at Spa was cancelled ""out of respect"", though the Formula 3 race will go ahead.Hubert, who drove for the BWT Arden team, was lying eighth in the championship and had scored two wins this season, in Monaco and France.He was also was part of Renault F1's young driver programme."

I think it will be examined in a very detailed way which is correct and what everyone would expect but to draw any conclusions now is probably not right, we need to have a full picture of a lot of elements.""I'm a fan of holding races in Spa because it's a great track which has a great history and a lot of the corners are unique, but for sure after what happened we need to have a very close look and take some time to understand exactly what happened.""Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were the last drivers to die during an F1 race weekend at Imola in 1994.

On the other hand, every time I'm going into the car I am going in with the same mindset, and I think we are all trying to do that even with what happened on Saturday.""When you are getting in your car you are trying to be in the zone, trying to think about what you need to do and you need to race as hard as you can to finish as high as you can.""The use of asphalt run-off areas has also been questioned in the days following Hubert's crash, with some arguing that gravel traps would limit the risks drivers are prepared to take and also possibly prevent a car from bouncing back on track after a crash.""Some of it is true, the Tarmac run-off areas do invite us to keep pushing because it doesn't have an immediate consequence,"" said Renault's Nico Hulkenberg.""There always needs to be the right balance somewhere, and maybe we should have some customised solutions for corners like Eau Rouge in the way that we don't really see that corner until you come up the hill."""
sport	Formula 1: Force India and Sauber withdraw 'anti-competitive' complaint		"Force India and Sauber have withdrawn their complaint to the European Union regarding anti-competitive practices in Formula 1.The teams lodged the complaint in 2015, claiming former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone had set up an ""unfair"" governance structure and split of revenues.But the teams say they are ""encouraged by dialogue"" with F1's new owners.US group Liberty Media bought F1's commercial rights last year.Under new boss Chase Carey, who ousted Ecclestone last January, they are conducting a thorough review of F1 and plan to make changes to many aspects of its governance and structure over the next few years.Among the changes being pushed are a cap on the amount of money teams can spend, a fairer revenue split, simplifying engines to help generate a more competitive field and changing the technical rules to encourage closer racing and make overtaking easier.The statement from both teams on Thursday said Carey and his new management team had ""brought a new culture of transparency to the sport and illustrates willingness to debate fundamental issues such as the distribution of the prize fund monies, cost control and engine regulations"".It added: ""We are encouraged and reassured by the even-handed and fair negotiating approach taken by the new management of Formula 1 to all the teams and their issues.""While the concerns leading to the complaint were fully justified, we believe this new approach provides the necessary degree of assurance that our concerns will be looked at objectively, and we prefer to resolve the issues facing the sport through dialogue rather than a legal dispute.""We want to support this transformational process in F1 and have thus resolved to withdraw our complaint with immediate effect."""
sport	Tim Murtagh: Ireland bowler retires from international cricket	Murtagh made Ireland debut in 2012Balbirnie to captain Ireland in all formats	"Ireland bowler Tim Murtagh has retired from international cricket after making 97 appearances.The London-born 38-year-old has signed a two-year contract extension with Middlesex and will play in all formats for the county side in 2020.His final Ireland match was July's historic Test against England at Lord's when he got on the honours' board with a superb 5-13 on the opening morning.""I've had eight great years playing international cricket,"" Murtagh said.""This is a day that I have known has been coming for a few years since the ECB changed their regulations, but it hasn't made the decision any easier. It's sad that it has come to an end but a decision that I have made my peace with.""He added: ""A Test match at Lord's against England is a great way to finish my international career and a game I will always cherish.""I wish the lads all the best for the winter tours and very much hope to help out and be involved in some capacity in the future.""Murtagh made his international debut for Ireland in 2012 after a conversation with Ed Joyce about his Irish ancestry led to the Middlesex man declaring for Ireland.He claimed 142 wickets across all formats at an average of 25.54 and had his best year with Ireland in 2018, when he took 28 wickets in 11 matches at an average of 16.32.That year also saw Murtagh have the honour of delivering the first-ever ball for Ireland in Test cricket at Malahide against Pakistan.""It's sad to see such a great player leave our ranks, but Tim has been a model professional and a great asset to have in the dressing room,"" said Ireland head coach Graham Ford.Murtagh's Ireland retirement came as it was also announced that Andrew Balbirnie will assume the team's T20 captaincy following his recent appointment as Test and one day skipper.Balbirnie takes the T20 role after Gary Wilson opted to stand down following 18 months in the post.""I'm very much looking forward to continuing as a player and working with Balbo in the future,"" said Wilson.""I think it will prove to be a great appointment and believe that it is important that he, as a captain, has control of all three sides and gets to take it in a direction that he sees fit.""Wilson steps down after captaining the Irish during their successful T20 World Cup qualifying campaign in the United Arab Emirates in October.Ireland's head coach Graham Ford said Wilson had been ""an exceptional leader of this young squad over the last 18 months"".""It is a mark of Gary's professionalism that he has understood the interests of the team, and wholeheartedly committed his full support to Andrew in his newly consolidated leadership role,"" said the Ireland coach."
sport	England in New Zealand: 'Hosts show Joe Root's side how to play Test cricket in impressive win'		New Zealand have just shown England precisely how to play Test cricket.It is no coincidence that four years ago in the World Cup it was also New Zealand who showed England how to play one-day cricket.By beating the tourists by an innings and 65 runs in the first Test at Mount Maunganui, they have done it again, this time in the longest format.The Black Caps lost the toss on a flat pitch and lost the first day as England closed on 241-4.But the hosts kept fighting, kept their discipline, kept their patience and won the match.It is the exemplary way to play Test cricket and England have been taught an object lesson.Regardless of how outstanding New Zealand were and how much England have to learn, it is still very disappointing that Joe Root's side could not bat out just under four sessions on a pitch the opposition scored over 600 on.People will watch the highlights of England's second innings and scratch their hands at the some of the shots played.Late on day four, Dom Sibley pushed at a wide ball, Rory Burns played a sweep at a bad time and Jack Leach walked off without reviewing, given out caught to a ball he hadn't nicked.On day five, Root played a very indecisive stroke and prodded a tame catch to gully, Jos Buttler played no stroke to a ball that hit the base of off-stump and Ollie Pope could barely reach a wide, slow full toss from Neil Wagner but hit it to cover.Mistakes can happen when a batsman is in a defensive frame of mind and so England did have to keep the scoreboard ticking along, but they still had to do everything at minimum risk in order to save the game.Chasing low full tosses outside off is not smart.The likes of Pope and Sibley are young and will learn from this experience though.Root's captaincy was good at times in this Test but some of the bowling plans were bewildering.England talk about a patient, disciplined batting approach but that should also be the case for the bowling.Why on earth was Plan A on day three bowling bouncers on a slow pitch with three men on the boundary? I don't understand that.Plan A should be trying to hit the top of off-stump or just outside.Instead, when number eight Mitchell Santner came in, England did not have a slip in - that was really strange and he went on to make his maiden Test century.Even before Santner arrived, New Zealand were 224-5 after lunch, still trailing by 109 runs as England took the new ball.It was a key moment in the game and one that should have seen Jofra Archer called upon, but instead Sam Curran was given the responsibility.England wanted to see if the ball would swing for Curran because that makes him more effective but that also then lessens Archer's effectiveness.Archer is a special bowler and not just a bouncer bowler - he's much better than that.He bowls an aggressive pace on a good line and length and should be getting people caught in the slips, not bowling bouncers hoping someone is going to flog it to deep square leg.In contrast, if you look at the fields New Zealand set on day five, they were unorthodox but were set to encourage the bowling of a full length.They had three men in an arc catching close in on the off side to the quick bowlers. It meant that if a batsman got it slightly wrong on a two-paced pitch they were going to get caught. It was a really well thought out field for the conditions.Root made just 13 runs in his two innings, the lowest total he has scored as England captain in a Test, and as soon as a batting captain starts to struggle people start to talk about his position.The worry is he gets so concerned about his batting average that his captaincy suffers or vice-versa.It can be a vicious circle, though Root told the Test Match Special podcast that he does not believe the captaincy is affecting his batting.He is not batting well at the moment and he trying a different trigger movement but got out to two poor shots in this game.He is, however, a fine player and just has to find some form because when he does he'll make the opposition pay.You just have to hope that it doesn't begin to weigh too heavily on him.
sport	Liam Livingstone: Lancashire's former captain rejects IPL offer to play Championship cricket	'Lancashire must hit ground running'	"Ex-Lancashire captain Liam Livingstone has rejected an offer from Indian Premier League side Rajasthan Royals to concentrate on Championship cricket.The 26-year-old Cumbrian, twice capped by England at T20 level, missed the start of last season in England to play four IPL games for the Royals.But this time he has opted to play red-ball cricket for promoted Lancashire.""I still have hopes of playing Test cricket. The best way to achieve it is to impress in Division One,"" he said.""I loved the experience of playing in the IPL. But I have decided to put a renewed focus on first-class cricket next summer. I am committed to improving my game in all formats.""I hugely enjoyed being part of the County Championship side last season. The lads played some exceptional red-ball cricket and I am optimistic about what we can achieve.""Lancashire went through the 2019 Division Two campaign unbeaten and won the title by 45 points.""To have Liam available for the start of the season is welcome news. He is a senior member of the changing room and undoubtedly improves our side,"" Lancashire director of cricket Paul Allott said.""With an enhanced focus on County Championship cricket in the early months of the 2020 season, we need to ensure we hit the ground running on our return to what will be a competitive Division One.""Like many of the country's top players, Livingstone will take a break from red-ball cricket to play in the T20 Blast for this summer's beaten quarter-finalists Lancashire, as well as in the Hundred for Birmingham Phoenix, with whom he was awarded a £125,000 contract in the draft in October.Livingstone stepped down as Lancashire skipper in November 2018 after just one season, in which the Red Rose were relegated back to Division Two.That enabled him to spend three months away from February to May playing for Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League followed by four games for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL,Having missed Lancashire's opening match, after a mid-season rib injury, he ended up playing in 11 of the 14 matches, making 599 runs and taking 10 wickets at 24.90.This time he will be available for all of Lancashire's 14 Championship games back in the top flight - and, having mutually parted company with the Royals, he will not enter the IPL draft in early December.He is one of a number of English players to be released from IPL franchises, including Sam Billings, David Willey, Sam Curran and Joe Denly.Livingstone has been playing with Moeen Ali, Dale Steyn and Quinton de Kock for Cape Town Blitz in the Mzansi Super League in South Africa."

Six were making their senior debut. They're forgiven for being a bit nervous.""By the time they got through that first 10 or 15 minutes, they grew into the game and looked quite competent.""Hector opened the scoring after latching on to a long ball forward to fire past Owen Evans, before setting up striker Theophanous to double the lead.Bennett tapped in to make it 3-0 two minutes after the break after a Theophanous shot hit the post and the latter then netted his second after rounding Evans, putting Kingstonian into the second round for the first time since 2000-01.Macclesfield confirmed the tie would go ahead on Saturday after first-team players announced their intention to go on strike.The club's place in the competition for both this season and 2020-21 would have been at stake had the game been called off, and Silkmen boss Daryl McMahon was forced to name an inexperienced side - handing senior debuts to six players as he made eight changes to his starting XI.Several supporters boycotted the tie and protested against owner Amar Alkadhi outside Moss Rose, with 255 Kingstonian fans making up more than a quarter of the total attendance.The travelling supporters also joining in chants aimed at Alkadhi which were started by Macclesfield fans who did go through the turnstiles.""It's been a tough week,"" boss Daryl McMahon said.""Everyone knows what's been happening, but all I can do is focus on the pitch and try to get a team out to try to win games. These lads have acquitted themselves well, I'm really proud of them.""It was a great experience for these lads, it was the youngest side we've ever had in a game, I think the oldest player was 21, most were about 16. I thought some showed real promise, we'd like to look and see if we can develop them.""The strike is the latest move taken by players against the League Two club.Macclesfield have previously been taken to court by players over unpaid wages and, in May, under then-manager Sol Campbell, they considered boycotting the final match of last season for similar reasons.Local businessman Joe Sealey, the son of former Manchester United goalkeeper Les, told BBC Radio Manchester on Friday he had put an official offer in to buy the financially-beleaguered Silkmen.Macclesfield offered little going forward as they were eliminated at the first round stage of the FA Cup for the third consecutive season, with Kingstonian taking £36,000 in prize money for progressing.""We didn't know if the game was even going to be played, and even when it was established we would be playing, was it going to be their established team?"" said Kingstonian boss Hayden Bird.""We had to prepare for two very different scenarios but the players got the job done. We were worthy winners.""When you have moments like this you want more, hopefully we'll get a favourable draw and can continue to look forward to playing in the FA Cup.""It's one of my best days as a manager, we've come to a Football League club and won convincingly. You have to enjoy these moments and I definitely will be.""Match ends, Macclesfield Town 0, Kingstonian 4.Second Half ends, Macclesfield Town 0, Kingstonian 4.Attempt saved.

I don't understand why you have to stop playing for the demands.""Bangladesh's two-match Test tour of India in November is under threat if the dispute cannot be solved in time.The strike action also includes the ongoing National Cricket League first-class tournament, with the next round of matches due to start on Thursday.""When the demands are met, normal service will resume,"" said star all-rounder Shakib, who is also Bangladesh Twenty20 captain.""All of us want cricket to improve. Some of us will play for another 10 years, some for four-five years, but we want to create a good environment for the players who will come after us, so Bangladesh cricket can move forward.""Hassan said ""the doors are open"" for discussions between the players and the board but claimed that players were not responding.""This is shocking - I can't even imagine that our players can do something like this,"" added Hassan.""We'll find who is behind this conspiracy.""The players are demanding the salaries in first-class cricket are raised to 100,000 Bangladeshi Taka (£912) per match - an increase of about 300%.They also want the BCB to increase the salaries of groundsmen, local coaches, umpires, physios and trainers as well as investing more money to improve grounds, indoor nets, gyms and equipment throughout the country.The demands include several proposed changes to domestic competitions, with the players wanting the Twenty20 Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) to return to a franchise-based model and the 50-over Dhaka Premier League (DPL) to allow players to choose their team and negotiate salaries again.The group also want the leadership of the Cricketers' Welfare Association to step down, with players permitted to vote to elect the next committee.The international players' union Fica released a statement on Tuesday in support of the striking players.""Fica commends the players in Bangladesh for their unity and for taking a stand together in order to secure fair conditions applicable to them as professional cricketers,"" said executive chairman Tony Irish.""This has happened despite the challenging environment for players to collectivise in Bangladesh and it is a clear indication of the need for change in the way players are treated in what we regard as an important cricket country.""Shakib also raised the issue of corruption at lower levels of cricket in the country.The BPL was suspended in 2014 after an investigation into match-fixing in the tournament, which led to administrators and players, including former Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful, being banned.""The players sometimes get to know about the result of the match even before stepping onto the field,"" he said.""This is really disappointing and needs to be fixed because it concerns the career of a player."""

This is engaging at a different level, that is something we should embrace and it is not a threat. It is a much greater threat to say everything is fine as we are.""Last weekend the Hundred saw an American-style draft system to determine which players would represent each new team, the first such draft in British sport.Players such as West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell, Australian opener David Warner and Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan will feature alongside England stars including Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes.""We have 1.1m who regularly attend cricket and 10.1m who are followers, we have got to bridge that gap,"" Harrison added. ""It's to encapsulate the new audience but keep the existing audience happy.""This summer England won the World Cup for the first time and a captivating Ashes series finished level at 2-2.""We had 3.15m into grounds in this country, the most successful summer we have had for domestic cricket,"" Harrison said. ""We have an enormous pocket of fans who are not embracing the opportunities as they exist at the moment. An average English cricket fan is 50 years old, with a 77% male bias, 82% towards white British. We have got an awfully big opportunity if we get it right to get a diverse and multi-cultural audience.""ECB chairman Colin Graves added: ""We are changing cricket, you get resistance because nobody likes change. I played cricket for 40 years in Yorkshire and I understand where they are coming from but the game has got to move on.""Everything we have done has been in consultation with our members and counties. We have 80,000 members who have been talked to. Nothing has been imposed. They could have voted it down - they didn't.""Asked what was wrong with T20 cricket for a new event to be launched, Harrison said: ""Absolutely nothing, it has been a phenomenal format which has an amazing role. It's a fantastic format with eight consecutive years of growth and we are continuing to invest.""The competition will be on free-to-air television, with the BBC screening 10 men's matches from The Hundred and up to eight live matches from the women's competition, including both finals.""If we hadn't had the new tournament terrestrial broadcasters would not have been back at the table,"" Harrison added. ""We believe there is a market there for a new tournament.""We want to bring down the barriers, make cricket more accessible. It's not just about linear channels, it's about the One Show, CBeebies, Asian Network, the enormous digital engagement the BBC brings us. If the men's World Cup taught us anything it is that the game is enormous in this country."""

There's going to be some quality players, it can go places but I'm happy to watch.""Meanwhile Hogan says Glamorgan need more consistency in the Championship if they are to improve on their fourth place in division two in 2019.""There's still a bit of work to go, we've improved a lot but in terms of consistency in pressure moments against big teams, we need to adapt better against big sides but hopefully we can move forward again,"" he said.Hogan could find himself opening the bowling with a player half his age after Wrexham-born fast bowler Walker, 19, was awarded a new two year contract.Newport batsman Taylor, who like Walker made his limited-overs debut in 2019, and second-11 all-rounder Joe Cooke have agreed new one year deals."

And we quickly got things done and dusted,"" said Kerrigan, who spent the 2019 season playing club cricket for Northern League side Fulwood & Broughton.""Since I left Lancashire, Minor Counties has definitely been something that's interested me.

sport	The Hundred: How to build a cricket team from scratch	Step one: Pick a team nameStep two: Design a kit and logoStep three: Pick your playersStep four: Turning a group of players into a team	"From choosing a team name to building a squad, creating a cricket team from scratch is far from straightforward.What will they be called? What colour will they play in? What will their badge look like? Who will play for them? And so on.Those were all decisions that had to be made when The Hundred - a new 100-ball competition to be played for the first time next summer - was conceived.The competition - complete with team names and kits - was launched earlier this month, and the playing squads will be finalised on Sunday when the world's top players will be snapped up by the eight new teams in the UK's first major sporting draft.But how have we got here? BBC Sport looks into the process of building a team up from nothing, to play in a competition which is completely different to anything seen on a cricket field before.In a major change for cricket in the UK, the new teams are franchises based in seven UK cities - London, Manchester, Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham, Southampton and Cardiff. Once that was decided, the next step was to assign names and build a brand.The decision to step away from the traditional 18-county format of domestic cricket meant new identities had to be created for the teams.To begin with, the England and Wales Cricket Board commissioned research into each of the seven competing cities and the surrounding areas, firstly targeting people aged 16-24 - the age group the ECB hopes The Hundred can attract - and then those aged up to 50.That research gave the ECB a report on each team, pulling out various themes, which were taken forward by a branding company.Southern Brave, for example, the team that will play in Southampton, were named after it was found young people in the area had an affinity with the region's countryside.Manchester's moniker is the 'Originals', which is a nod to the city's role in shaping the music scene of decades gone by - from The Hacienda nightclub, New Order and the Stone Roses to Oasis.Trent Rockets are so called because the River Trent runs through all three of the Nottingham-based team's catchment counties - Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire - and the Invincibles name was given to The Oval-based franchise as a subtle reference to Invicta, the motto of Kent - one of the counties which will feed into the team.When it came to designing kits, colours that were already associated with local football teams were ruled out, meaning Manchester Originals, for example, will play in black - the city's role in the Industrial Revolution impacting on the choice of shirt colour.The centrepiece of the Manchester strip is the Originals' hexagon-shaped logo, which represents a bolt from the city's industrial past, and a beehive - a reference to Manchester's worker bee symbol.Designers have also created a new alphabet with letters made from notable Manchester landmarks and symbols which will be used in posters and advertising around the team.Elsewhere, Birmingham Phoenix will play in orange, a colour selected as a mix of two local flags - the yellow of the West Midlands and the red and yellow of the city of Birmingham.It also incorporates the chevrons of the city flag in the design of the shirt while Birmingham batsmen will wear Indian Premier League-style gold helmets, an attempt to appeal to a South Asian audience - another key aim of The Hundred.But what are team names and kits without players?One of the final steps before the tournament begins next summer - it will run in the school holidays from 17 July to 16 August 2020 - is Sunday's men's player draft.Each team has so far selected one England red-ball contracted player and two local icons, and they will fill up the remaining places in the 15-man squads in a televised draft in London.Many of the world's leading players are available, including Chris Gayle, Steve Smith and Mitchell Starc who have all set their reserve price at the maximum £125,000. Each team will take it in turns to select with all squads to contain two players in each of the following pay brackets: £125,000, £100,000, £75,000, £60,000, £50,000, £40,000 and £30,000.Former England opener Marcus Trescothick has been working with Welsh Fire, alongside head coach Gary Kirsten, to help identify potential signings and will be at the event on Sunday.""I think the pitches will be fairly decent and made for entertaining cricket,"" the former Somerset batsman said.""The basis of it will be similar to what T20 cricket looks like already but it is then about trying to think quickly on your feet.""Trescothick said he expects all teams to need a ""mystery spinner"", a ""high-class all-rounder"", ""a couple of very good fast bowlers"" and ""very good top order players"", with Welsh Fire having already secured England's Jonny Bairstow, Somerset's Tom Banton and Glamorgan's Colin Ingram - all of whom play at the top of the order.With those picks in mind, Welsh Fire will focus on other areas in Sunday's draft.""We are not going to go into the draft looking for two openers,"" Trescothick said. ""We would be silly to.""We will try to pick out certain people we have identified that will be in key positions in the Hundred.""There is a difference of opinion on how the tournament will play out, however, with experienced franchise cricket coach Trent Woodhill predicting more traditional players and skillsets will come to the fore.""I think this competition will redress the balance between bat and ball,"" said Woodhill, a high-performance consultant for The Hundred.""The format lets players bowl 10 balls in a row and that will allow bowlers to get on top and stay on top, so batsmen such as Kane Williamson, Steve Smith and Joe Root are going to be pivotal.""Equally, opening bowlers who swing the ball - the likes of David Willey, Mitchell Starc and Mohammad Amir - will be successful.""The job is far from done post-draft, however. How do you get 15 players who have never played together to mould into a team and buy into making their new franchiser a success on the pitch?Oval Invincibles women's head coach Lydia Greenway says that ""blank canvas"" is ""really exciting"".""I am very clear on the people I want involved and the type of players as well,"" the former England batter said.""What I hope happens is that whatever cultures are built, they are the same for the men's and the women's teams.""Hopefully it is not just a women's team feeding off a men's team or a men's team feeding off a women's team. It is a joint up approach and you try to present yourself in a way that that reflects the people you have involved."""

sport	Agnew's masterplan for English cricket after fantastic World Cup & Ashes summer	Draw up the Root blueprintStart blooding the youngstersNo more batting line-up luxuriesProtect Broad and AndersonOne England coach - but give them a restEmbrace the new fansCelebrates the heroes - unlikely or not!Make the Championship one division	Media playback is not supported on this deviceI've been involved in professional cricket for 44 seasons, and I have never, as a player or commentator, experienced a summer like this.I have got a bigger kick out of cricket this summer than I ever have done before. It has been absolutely incredible.England would have loved to have won the Ashes, of course, but when you take into account what a pressurised and exhausting summer it has been, this has been a more than acceptable outcome.Now, with a new coach coming in, England are going to have to make some decisions about how to really invest in Test cricket and ensure England prosper.Media playback is not supported on this deviceJoe Root, now he's through this summer, has got the chance to stamp his authority on this team, and start planning to get those Ashes back in two and a half years.It seems to me that when a new coach is appointed, they slip in underneath the captain, and vice-versa. Root has a chance here to strike up a relationship with this new coach and absolutely set out a blueprint as to how he wants this team to play.That's not entirely how it's been up until now. They have been too reckless; they have tried to attack too much.A disciplined, patient, defensive period in a Test match is not old fashioned and boring - it's essential.The tour of New Zealand this winter is a really important two-Test series.It's not in the World Test Championship so it represents a big opportunity to look at some younger players - potentially openers Dominic Sibley or Zak Crawley - and bring back Ollie Pope to the middle order.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThey will be really challenged - it will be early summer in New Zealand so the ball will move around and they have very fine seam bowlers - but England really have to take the opportunity to play the youngsters.It also gives Jofra Archer a couple more games in his development and a chance for James Anderson to prove his fitness for subsequent tours to South Africa and Sri Lanka, which are in the World Test Championship.Root needs to work out where he wants to bat - and how he wants his team to shape up.They have to find a way of getting Sam Curran into the side and it is now time to start bedding in the youngsters for the next Ashes series.They'll also have to look at the wicketkeeping situation - although it's ironic that just when people start talking about Jonny Bairstow relinquishing the gloves, he pulls off a fine stumping at The Oval.He's a good keeper but with Jos Buttler in the XI can England really afford the luxury of having two wicketkeepers who bat more or less the same way? It might be that Bairstow has to compete for a batting spot at six with Pope, or three or four with Joe Denly or Sibley.At the moment, it's a little bit of a luxury.Stuart Broad and I spoke at the start of every Test this summer and there's no doubt he felt really quite detached from all the World Cup euphoria.He and Anderson both know the clock is ticking, and I know Broad has felt a little bit uncertain about his future. We had a long conversation and I think we agreed that, if he were dropped in the course of this series, he wouldn't come back.I advised him to break it down week by week - don't look any further ahead than each week. He's bowled better than ever in this series and he's shown he can lead the attack in the absence of Anderson.Root and England will need to manage their workload carefully - but they have so much experience to give, and wouldn't it be fantastic to see Broad, Anderson, Archer and Stokes all playing together?It's easier when you have one coach across the formats - then you have a structure and they have so many deputies. I think the problem England have is actually attracting someone to do it. Any decent coach can make more than enough money just doing three or four T20 leagues.There are three tours this winter - I don't think, if you're England coach, you should be expected to do all three. Give people more of a break.I was really interested to see how Trevor Bayliss would go this summer, preparing two squads to win a World Cup and an Ashes. How could one man do it? He's had a lot of support and he is always the first to credit the players and coaches around him, but the one man coaching set-up has worked.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt has been a brilliant summer, with so many things that give you reason to be very cheerful.More people are talking about cricket and the issue now is how you now maintain that interest. And that has to be about making it as widely available as it can possibly be.It is everyone's duty - broadcasters, writers, whoever they may be - to get it out there. People can be a bit frightened of it, because it's a very technical game, but really, when you boil it down, it's just who can score more runs. When people experience it, they get it very quickly.Do we actually 'need' another one-day tournament? Of course, the answer is no. Is The Hundred going to serve a purpose? Hopefully.It's not about attracting a new audience; it's about connecting with the cricket lovers who are out there but don't come and watch mainstream cricket. We saw them at the World Cup - they are out there!I'm always very protective of Test cricket and the Headingley Ashes Test showed everything that is so brilliant about it. It was something we will never see the like of again.I love the individual characters that cricket produces and, more than most other sports, the unlikely heroes.We have a very big hero in Stokes but also a very unlikely one in Jack Leach, who now gets cheered every time he comes out to bat after his dogged performance at the other end while Stokes was clattering his match-winning century.It's lovely. It's something cricket provides that I don't think other sports do. People connect with that - so let's embrace it.I want as much focus and energy to go into Championship cricket as has gone into one-day cricket and driven us to a first World Cup win.I've always been against two divisions in the Championship; it's always been wrong.It means that when there are good overseas players signed - for example, when Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne came to play for Worcestershire and Hampshire - only half our players play against them.Media playback is not supported on this deviceI think players in the second division are largely unselectable for Test cricket because the standard simply isn't good enough. County members can shout at me all they like, but we see the evidence when they get picked for England.Inevitably, any good player will go and play for a first division club, because they know they won't get picked in the second division, and that then creates a further imbalance.If we are looking to go forward, and we have these new, centralised teams, it may be that we have to build a structure around that.Maybe we do have 12 teams, which are really, very carefully geographically located. You have one division, everyone plays each other and you have fewer, better, players.That would be something I would really strongly consider doing - but it'll never happen!Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Amy Lofthouse.

It's different to the style of cricket we've had to play in our home conditions,"" Root said.""The most important thing for the young players is not to look too deeply into this or get too down about it.""Draw a line underneath it, be aware of where we can make improvements but also recognise the good things we have done.""We have made quite a big shift and mental approach to how we play our cricket and we have to give that time to work and be patient.""The second Test at Hamilton begins on Thursday at 22:00 GMT.England had been well set at 277-4 on the first day of the Test but a collapse of four wickets for 18 runs limited their first-innings total.They then spent 201 overs in the field as BJ Watling ground out a double century and Mitchell Santner made 126.Only three England batsmen made half-centuries and all three came in the first innings, with Denly's 35 the top score in the second innings.""Trying to bat longer will not happen overnight. The key is not to look too deeply into it,"" Root told Sky Sports.""It's a mindset thing - we have to learn from mistakes like this game and move on quickly.""We have to do what we did well for longer.""It was a frustrating first Test away from home for Jofra Archer, who was below his best and finished with figures of 1-107 from 42 overs.Former England bowling coach Mark Ramprakash previously said Root had tactically misused Archer on the third day.""Jofra's a hugely exciting talent and he has a huge amount of skill but he has to learn there are certain spells where he needs to ramp it up more,"" Root added.""He may have to bowl shorter spells. The energy and effort have to be there all the time.""He's taken international cricket by storm but having too high an expectation of him at the start of his career is a dangerous thing.""Root, too, was asked about his own form and whether captaincy is taking its toll on his batting.He averages 39.70 as Test captain compared to 52.80 when he is not in charge.""I'd say that is an easy thing to look at,"" said Root.""Sometimes players go through phases of their career where they are not as consistent or make the scores they would like.""That seems to marry up with the fact I have taken on the captaincy but it wouldn't be a question at a different phase of my career.""I'm not too worried about it and this game in particular I found two dreadful ways to get out but I'm not far away."""
sport	Ben Stokes: 'Country stands behind him' over row with Sun, says cricket chief	Ben Stokes' statement in fullWhat does the Sun say?Was the story justified?	"England cricketer Ben Stokes has the support of ""the whole sport and the country"" after criticising the Sun over a story it ran about his family, a leading cricket chief says.Tom Harrison, chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), added he was ""disgusted and appalled"" by the newspaper's actions.Stokes has called Tuesday's front-page story ""utterly disgusting"".But the Sun has defended its journalism.It pointed out it had received the co-operation of a family member and said the events described were ""a matter of public record"" and ""the subject of extensive front-page publicity in New Zealand at the time"".The story prompted a statement from Stokes, the England and Durham all-rounder. The 28-year-old said it was the ""lowest form of journalism"" which dealt with ""deeply personal and traumatic events"" that affected his New Zealand-based family more than 30 years ago.Stokes was born in New Zealand and moved to Cumbria with his family aged 12.He won the Cricket World Cup with England this summer, then made an unlikely 135 not out in the third Ashes Test against Australia at Headingley last month to keep England in contention in the series.His comments on the story drew support from various figures in the sport and public life, and team-mates including England captain Joe Root.""We, like the wider sporting world, are disgusted and appalled at the actions taken in revealing the tragic events from Ben's past,"" Harrison said in the ECB's statement.""We are saddened that an intrusion of this magnitude was deemed necessary in order to sell newspapers or secure clicks. Ben's exploits at Lord's and Headingley cemented his place in cricket history this summer - we are sure the whole sport, and the country, stands behind him in support.''Today the Sun has seen fit to publish extremely painful, sensitive and personal details concerning events in the private lives of my family, going back more than 31 years.It is hard to find words that adequately describe such low and despicable behaviour, disguised as journalism. I cannot conceive of anything more immoral, heartless or contemptuous to the feelings and circumstances of my family.For more than three decades, my family has worked hard to deal with the private trauma inevitably associated with these events and has taken great care to keep private what were deeply personal and traumatic events.On Saturday the Sun sent a 'reporter' to my parents' home in New Zealand to question them, out of the blue, on this incredibly upsetting topic. If that wasn't bad enough, the Sun think it is acceptable to sensationalise our personal tragedy for their front page.To use my name as an excuse to shatter the privacy and private lives of - in particular - my parents, is utterly disgusting. I am am aware that my public profile brings with it consequences for me that I accept entirely.But I will not allow my public profile to be used as an excuse to invade the rights of my parents, my wife, my children or other family members. They are entitled to a private life of their own.The decision to publish these details has grave and lifelong consequences for my mum in particular.This is the lowest form of journalism, focussed only on chasing sales with absolutely no regard for the devastation caused to lives as a consequence. It is totally out of order.The article also contains serious inaccuracies which has compounded the damage caused. we need to take a serious look at how we allow our press to behave.A spokesperson for the Sun said: ""The Sun has the utmost sympathy for Ben Stokes and his mother but it is only right to point out the story was told with the co-operation of a family member who supplied details, provided photographs and posed for pictures.""The tragedy is also a matter of public record and was the subject of extensive front page publicity in New Zealand at the time.""The Sun has huge admiration for Ben Stokes and we were delighted to celebrate his sporting heroics this summer. He was contacted prior to publication and at no stage did he or his representatives ask us not to publish the story.""There was no justification for the Sun story beyond selling papers, according to press regulation campaign group Hacked Off.Board member Steve Barnett - who is a lecturer in communications - told BBC Radio 5 Live that the story was ""graphic evidence"" of a newspaper ""driving a coach and horses through their own code of conduct"".""He's done absolutely nothing wrong and his own family history is dragged through the mud. I can't see any justification for this other than the fact it will sell papers. It was a brutally commercial decision which took no account of their own code of conduct, which says everyone deserves respect for their private and family life.""He also questioned the newspaper's defence that the information had come from a family member, saying giving ""carte blanche for any family member to come forward and say 'I've got some dirt or story or can give you some inside track on some tragedy'"" was ""not a good way to run a journalistic operation"".""Ben Stokes himself said if it was about him he could stand up and take it. He's man enough to say I'm in the public life and will take whatever's coming - but to do that to your family, to people who have never done anything apart from be related to you, is unforgivable,"" he added.Ian Murray, the executive director of the Society of Editors, told the station: ""I know there will be a lot of people who agree with Ben Stokes in what he said and will side with him. There will be a lot of journalists who will find this actually distasteful.""It's not for the Society to say whether it is distasteful or not but what we will do is defend a free press in this country.""Was it editorially justifiable? Evidently the paper thought that it was.""I'm not defending the Sun - what I am defending is the principle and saying let's be very careful about what we do. We have freedom of expression in this country to a large extent - there are lots of regulations there, there are lots of laws. We have a free press. It's such a jewel in the crown of any free society. And there are always the sharks circling, the politicians, the rich, the powerful who would like to see that free press closed down.""New press regulation was introduced after the Leveson Inquiry into press standards in 2011 and 2012. It saw a small number of publications joining Impress, a self-regulatory body set up to be ""Leveson-compliant"".However most newspapers signed up to Ipso, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, and abide by their own Editors' Code of Practice."

We lost our way early in the comp and never recovered.""Glamorgan saved their best batting of the tournament for the final game with Ingram (44) and David Lloyd (40) pummelling four sixes each, while Chris Cooke then smashed 45 in the closing overs.""It's a relief getting a win on the final day, giving the fans something to sing about and hopefully a bit of momentum going into the end of the season,"" said Cooke.""A terrible campaign though, we've been quite a consistent white-ball team and it's a bit out of the blue. We didn't start well and lost confidence, but if we can play like tonight there's no reason why we can't be back in the quarter-finals next season.""Wrexham-born seamer Walker, 19, claimed three for 38 against Hampshire in only his fourth senior match of any sort.""It's been really good, it's about learning about margins of error in these first-team games since the standard you've got to get to is really high,"" said Walker of his late chance.""It would be nice to break in a bit more frequently over the season from April onwards, but that's up to me to get myself into those positions.""Glamorgan lie fourth in the Championship Division Two as they return to red-ball action away to Worcestershire on Tuesday 10 September.They are expected to announce an overseas replacement for Shaun Marsh shortly to cover the final three games of the Championship season, with both Western Australia's Marsh and Queensland batsman Charlie Hemphrey back in Australia."
sport	Glamorgan Cricket: T20 a 'tough slog', says captain Ingram	'No lack of trying'	"Glamorgan captain Colin Ingram admits the T20 campaign has been a ""tough slog"" after a seven-wicket defeat at home to Sussex left them still winless with one to play.Sussex qualified for a quarter-final home tie while Glamorgan have eight defeats from nine completed games.""When things are tough it's tricky to hold it together,"" admitted Ingram.""Credit to our dressing-room environment, it's been really good, but it's been a tough old slog.""In sharp contrast to recent years, when Glamorgan have either qualified for the knock-out stages or come close, the 2019 season has seen them earn just one point from a tie with Gloucestershire in addition to the four no-result points.""It's not easy on individuals missing out at times, at some stages we've been really close and at others we've been a long way off,"" Ingram told BBC Sport Wales.Twenty players have been used in the campaign, including debuts for batsman Callum Taylor, 21, spinner Prem Sisodiya, 20, and seamer Roman Walker, aged 19, allowing Ingram a crumb of comfort after seeing his side demolished by Sussex's Australian World Cup player Alex Carey, who hit 61 off 30 balls.""It's been exciting to see some of the younger players come through, seeing Prem bowl nicely with a daunting task with the new ball, Roman bowling nicely again in his second game, and it's pity we didn't see more of Callum Taylor who's an exciting prospect.""In a season where some of the more experienced players have not delivered consistently, David Lloyd tops the run charts with 318 while spinner Andrew Salter has 14 wickets.""The boys are working their socks off through the week to get that first win, it's not through a lack of trying,"" reflected Salter, who has played at T20 Finals Day in 2016 and in the 2013 one-day final at Glamorgan.""We've had a couple of close games, the sort we can win and have won in the past, and we've got a game on Friday against Hampshire to put it together.""It's putting that whole package together where we've only done it bits of the time.""Despite the ruins of their worst T20 campaign, Glamorgan lie fourth in the second division of the Championship with three matches to play and could still salvage their season with promotion in the four-day format."
sport	England in New Zealand: Hosts on top in second Test	England bowlers battle on difficult dayMitchell and Watling show the way'Our opportunity is there to win this Test' - what they said	"England lost two wickets late on day two to leave New Zealand on top in the second Test in Hamilton.New Zealand posted 375 thanks to Tom Latham's 105, debutant Daryl Mitchell's 73 and 55 from BJ Watling, while Stuart Broad took 4-73.Dom Sibley and Joe Denly both made four as England reached 39-2 - trailing by 336 - in the 18 overs possible before the close.New Zealand lead 1-0 in the two-Test series.Sibley, in his second Test, was hit on the helmet by a Tim Southee bouncer before he was trapped lbw playing across the line to a delivery that would have cannoned into leg stump.Matt Henry dismissed Denly as he induced a thick outside edge, with wicketkeeper Watling taking a good, low catch diving to his right.Rory Burns, dropped on 10 and 19, will resume on 24 and captain Joe Root six not out.Play will start half an hour early at 21:30 GMT for the remainder of the Test, to make up for time lost to rain on Friday.Having won the toss, Root will be hugely disappointed that England were not able to bowl New Zealand out for less.While the bowling was fairly tidy and they restricted the run-rate well for the majority of day two - the Kiwis only added 86 to their overnight 173-3 in the first 44 overs - the tourists went long periods when they rarely threatened.They started excellently as Latham was bowled by Broad leaving the ninth ball of the day. Sam Curran then had Henry Nicholls caught at fine leg hooking seven overs later as England got the early wickets they needed.However, the tourists, who spent 201 overs in the field in the first Test, then went 53 overs - including 36 with the second new ball - without taking a wicket before Broad had Watling caught at gully on the stroke of tea courtesy of a lifter.Broad, who was given two warnings for running on the pitch, had the superb Mitchell caught at fine leg before Southee gloved an excellent Chris Woakes delivery behind.Jofra Archer and Curran finished the innings off as England took the final five wickets for 60 runs.There were times when it looked like England needed a spin option to offer variation, with the decision to leave out a frontline spinner yet to be fully vindicated as the pitch and conditions offered their five-man seam attack little.One positive for England was the fitness of Ben Stokes. The all-rounder struggled with his left knee in his two overs on day one, but he bowled 11 overs with much more freedom on Saturday.After New Zealand's shaky start to the day, Watling and Test debutant Mitchell shared 124 for the sixth wicket.The partnership was built on patience and was again a lesson for an England side looking to adapt the way they bat in Test cricket.All-rounder Mitchell was initially cautious before growing into his maiden Test innings. He played the short ball particularly well during his four-hour stay at the crease.Having grown up in Perth in Australia, 28-year-old Mitchell will be used to handling short-pitched bowling and he played numerous crunching pulls. England kept on feeding the shot despite a lack of pace in their attack and Mitchell's obvious ability off the back foot.The tactic eventually worked, but ultimately it was a poor shot from Mitchell rather than a good piece of bowling that proved his undoing.Fresh off the back of his 205 in the first Test, Watling was again a thorn in England's side. The wicketkeeper played each delivery on its merit, left the short ball well and scored frequently behind square on the off side.It was almost a surprise when he fell, although, in mopping up the tail in quick time, England's bowlers exposed their top order to Southee and Henry.England bowler Stuart Broad on BBC Test Match Special: ""We're pretty happy - 375, in England if you win the toss and bowl, you'd be disappointed, but in this part of the world you have to manage your expectations.""Our opportunity is there in this game. If you're a batsman, you'd fancy your chances tomorrow, getting through that first hour and going on.""That's our way to win this Test - bat once and go past them. The next three days will be the best time to bat on this pitch and we need to make the most of that.""New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell: ""To be able to put on the black cap was pretty special. You are not human if you are not nervous. It was nice to get some runs.""Being sent in on this pitch, if you said we would make 370 we would probably have taken it. Getting two poles tonight is a massive bonus. Hopefully we can build some pressure in the morning, maybe get a couple of quick ones and really put some heat on them.""Ex-England batsman Mark Ramprakash: ""New Zealand will be very happy. Their bowlers exerted the pressure and asked the England batsmen questions.""The batsmen are having to cope with the physicality of being tired and lots of overs in the field, and then the mentality to come with their game plan.""England and Middlesex bowler Steven Finn: ""The bowlers stuck to their task pretty well. They copped a little bit of criticism in the last Test for chasing the game.""They were patient and when they needed to change their plans, they did. They may rue a couple of missed opportunities yesterday."""

A week later, she's preparing to represent her country on the international stage.The 14-year-old has been named in Scotland Women's cricket squad for their World Cup qualifiers after impressing with her performances in the Netherlands earlier this summer.Despite it being term-time, Katherine's school have allowed her more than a week off in order to play for Steven Knox's side in the eight-team tournament, with a place at next year's T20 World Cup in Australia on the line.BBC Sport Scotland caught up with the Edinburgh schoolgirl ahead of their first game against the United States in Dundee on Saturday.Although she's only in third year at The Mary Erskine School in Edinburgh, Fraser has been playing cricket for 10 years.She credits her family's love of the game for getting her into it, though her classmates are not overly impressed.""My mum has always loved cricket, so we played in the back garden and that's where I found my love for the sport,"" she said.""I've been playing since I was four, just in the garden. I got involved with Boroughmuir Cricket Club when I was 11, got into Scotland Under-17s at the age of 12. I got called up to the Wildcats in the winter and I've been playing for them throughout the summer.""My friends aren't really big cricket fans so are not that interested.

I do have people I can talk to about cricket and they won't tell me to shut up.""Fraser had only just returned to school when she got the news that she was going to be a part of the Scotland squad.Though she was not taking anything for granted, her parents had already decided to inform the school that her inclusion was a possibility after she impressed in Scotland's women T20 quadrangular series.""I was absolutely delighted. It was something she was thinking could possibly happen and when it did we were all over the moon,"" said mother Veronica.""The school were incredibly supportive and have been very kind in allowing her time off, with the proviso of her catching up, which I know she will do.""Despite being the youngest member of the squad by a few years, Fraser says she feels at home among her team-mates and is looking forward to competing.Though she still has plenty of time to decide her future, she says she hopes she can maintain a work-cricket balance in the future.""I'm very, very excited, it's going to be a great experience. Having the home advantage and a good run of form going into these games is very beneficial,"" she said.""I think our dressing room is a really good atmosphere to grow up in. They are all very supportive and I feel very much like one of the team.""When I'm older I'd like to go down a science or engineering route.

sport	England in New Zealand: 'Patient approach pleasing but tourists could be busier'		It was pleasing to see England finally adopt a more patient and disciplined approach to Test-match batting on the first day of the first Test in New Zealand.It's nothing new but it's something England have not done well in recent years.They've been determined to play very positively and seize the initiative but that often doesn't work in Test matches.I've not been alone in saying I would much rather see a more measured style where the batsmen respect the bowlers if they're in control, knowing if they do hang in there it will get easier and you can score your runs.That's what England did in reaching 241-4 in Mount Maunganui.Though, without being critical, the tourists could have been a bit busier.Over the past five years, a side that bats 90 overs in a day scores an average of 83 singles and England scored 60. That is some way down and suggests they could have been more proactive in pushing the ball into gaps and running.Being busy is not about smashing the ball around or playing loose shots, it's keeping the scoreboard ticking with singles and that will come to England as they learn this approach.There was a lot of leaving the ball, which was good. New Zealand bowled deliveries around off stump that England were edging during the Ashes against Australia this summer, but here their judgment was better.It helps that openers Dom Sibley and Rory Burns have a more watchful natural game, while Joe Denly has a similar approach but also showed his range of shots in making 74.A top three batting sensibly sets up a free-scoring middle order.England have expressive batsmen in their middle order - they don't want them to be batting away at 30-4, they want them to come in and build on a foundation, which the top order provided here.Sibley looked like he enjoyed himself on his debut and has obviously got a very good temperament. It showed in his confidence to clip his first ball away for four and it wasn't a bad ball at all.He is quite open in his stance, which means he has to work on getting his front foot across to the off stump and not reach for the ball with his hands away from his body, as he did in nicking off for 22.This is a big step up for him against a fine New Zealand attack but that four was a lovely way to start.Ollie Pope played very well on his return to the Test side - he has that busy approach and wasn't fazed by it being the last over of the day when he dispatched a Tim Southee bouncer for four.He is really determined to take his second opportunity in Test cricket by the horns, having being dropped after his previous two Tests against India in summer 2018.The 21-year-old Surrey batsman is a prolific scorer in county cricket and is certainly good enough to score runs at this level.Together with Ben Stokes, who showed proper Test technique again but may look to play a bit freer on day two, Pope will want to drive England on towards 400.England captain Joe Root got a bit stuck in making just two off 22 balls. He has changed his batting technique and is now making a movement across with his back leg but it wasn't very fluent, though he didn't have much time at the crease in the warm-up match.And New Zealand bowled very well to him. This is a very good seam bowling attack, one of the best around.Root will be disappointed with how he batted and it was a poor shot to get out to, guiding it straight to second slip, but he is a very fine player and he will come good.This was the first ever day of Test cricket at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, and it's a really lovely spot.It's part holiday area, part industrial - there cannot be another Test cricket ground with a salt-processing plant on the boundary edge.But it's very laid back, with people sitting on the banks, and is a thoroughly enjoyable place to watch cricket.Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Jack Skelton.

Hopefully we can get our season back on track in the T20, it's nice to be back playing and hopefully contributing to the team.""Marsh's main target will be to help Glamorgan retain their position among the promotion places in Championship Division Two, with a tough match against leaders Lancashire at Colwyn Bay on Sunday, 18 August.""It's been great to see their four-day cricket has been outstanding and they're well and truly in the competition so I'm looking forward to getting out there against Lancashire.""It's great to see (Marnus Labuschagne) come over here (scoring 11-hundred Championship runs), he's a fantastic young player and I was really thrilled for him to push for Ashes selection."""
sport	Glamorgan Cricket: T20 batting not firing, admits Maynard		"Glamorgan coach Matthew Maynard admits his side's batting has failed to fire after a 41-run defeat to Hampshire in the T20 Blast.They were bowled out for 87 with spinners Liam Dawson and Mason Crane each taking three wickets on a used pitch.Glamorgan have just two points from six games at the bottom of the South Group.""Progression from here is going to be really tough,"" Maynard told BBC Sport.""We know we've got a good batting line-up but it's just not firing at the moment.""I don't think we've clicked as a unit in any game, we've missed opportunities even though we were excellent in the field tonight.Glamorgan bowled tightly on a used wicket to restrict Hampshire to 128-7, with Pakistani spinner Fakhar Zaman a successful wild card as he took 1-15 in his four overs.There were two wickets each for Graham Wagg and Marchant de Lange, with only James Vince (25), Liam Dawson (23) and Lewis McManus (23 not out) making any real contributions.But David Lloyd (26) was one of only three Glamorgan players to reach double figures as the spinners turned the screw.""We've got a lot of potential within the group, Jeremy Lawlor and Owen Morgan have come in and shown glimpses, it's about doing that for longer but it's the same for the senior players,"" Maynard said.""We wanted one to put their hand up and get a 60 today, unfortunately that didn't happen.""Kiran Carlson is likely to come into the squad for his first T20 appearance of the season as Glamorgan travel to Sussex on Tuesday 6 August, needing seven wins out of eight to stand a realistic chance of making the knock-out stages."

sport	Ashes 2019: Ben Stokes performs the impossible to give cricket another golden chance		Media playback is not supported on this deviceMuch changes for all of us in the aftermath of great sporting deeds. They have a long, lovely tail. You float along happily in their wake, wanting to stare from all angles all over again.You don't really want to move on because it was all so good that everything else seems a little tame in comparison.Car journeys where the radio channel had been angrily changed. Dogs already walked taken out for another. Phones lobbed on to the sofa and TVs switched over to the footballYou got the sense from Ben Stokes, in the giddy hours after his extraordinary solo rescue mission at Headingley on Sunday afternoon, that he hasn't quite realised how much has changed for him.When sportsmen and women pull off superhero displays like that, it no longer matters in some ways what they do next. They've cracked it. They have defined a day that those in the nation intoxicated by sport can never forget.Nothing can take it away. Maybe Edna Mode can design him a new costume. The rest of it is already sewn up.Ian Botham after Headingley '81, Jessica Ennis-Hill after Super Saturday at London 2012, Andy Murray after that baking July day at Wimbledon in 2013.All three would go on to further triumphs - Botham in Ashes series home and away, Ennis-Hill winning back her world title after time out for the birth of her first child, Murray winning a second Wimbledon singles title at a dreamy canter three years on.Each was wonderful but the summit had already been scaled, just as whatever Stokes may do after this summer could surely only buttress what he has built rather than top it.For those who were in the ground on Sunday it will be the same. Any late-night anecdotes about sporting occasions experienced will always have to begin with one particular 'I was there'.Richie Benaud famously described one of Botham's mighty sixes 38 years ago as going straight into the confectionery stall and out again. Stokes' reverse-sweep six into the Western Terrace went straight into the sweet spot too.To be in the ground was to be part of a collective agony and ecstasy that no-one present will leave behind. To be following on radio, TV or phone was to abandon anything else that was meant to be happening, unless of course you took the logical step of walking away with 73 still required and Jack Leach walking in.Just as there are Manchester United fans who left the Nou Camp in 1999 before Sheringham and Solskjaer ripped up the night and Manchester City supporters who fled Wembley before Horlock and Dickov intervened that same mad May, so there are England cricket fans who knew nothing of Stokes' heroics until well after they were complete.Car journeys where the radio channel had been angrily changed. Dogs already walked taken out for another. Phones lobbed on to the sofa and TVs switched over to the football.These memories are as much a part of the communal experience because they underline the impossibility of it all. The frozen moments of hope and fear as another six skimmed the outstretched hands of Aussie fielders, the shared horror of the run-out that never was and the lbw that should have been.Through it all was the disbelief. A man at one end who had scored two runs from his first 50 balls hitting 74 off his last 45. The control of nerves and situation, the mad acceleration of a man gone from patiently putting in place the corner pieces of a jigsaw to suddenly bulldozing the house.A man at the other who was not only wearing glasses but had to keep polishing the condensation from them, who has a batting average in the County Championship this season of a couple of decimal points above four.Disbelief everywhere but at that striker's end. The stubbornness of refusing to accept it was all over. The pure determination: this is my match, not yours.Media playback is not supported on this deviceStokes is at that rare point where he has the ability to create accidental sweet magic in little improbable moments - the two that became a six in the last over of the World Cup final, the ramp shot off a flat-out fast bowler that sailed for another six in the dying moments on Sunday.It shouldn't be possible but with Stokes it can be. It's why there are those comparisons with Botham and with Don Bradman at the same ground as he and Arthur Morris chased down 404 in 1948.Which was better? You risk taking the lustre off any of them by finding any faults. When Botham came to the crease in 1981 England were five down and still 122 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat. Bradman and Morris stuck on 301 as part of the biggest run-chase in Test history.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThen there is Brian Lara's 153 not out in Barbados in 1999 when the West Indies - humiliated 5-0 in the preceding series - needed 308 against an Aussie attack spearheaded by Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne. The home side had appeared cooked at 105-5; Lara dragged them close and then found the last 63 runs in the company of his numbers 10 and 11, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh.Botham, Bradman and Lara. It should be fanciful or sacrilege but those are the parallels that make statistical sense. Stokes has made the jump.Maybe England have to win the Ashes from here to ensure his 135 not out is remembered as catalyst rather than glorious resistance.Botham went to Edgbaston after his century in Leeds and took five wickets for one run in 28 balls as Australia, chasing just 151, were blown from 105-4 to 121 all out. He made another century in the fifth Test at Old Trafford and took 10 wickets in the final Test at The Oval.Maybe Kevin Pietersen's 158 in south London in 2005 wouldn't mean the same had Ashley Giles perished early and Australia snatched a win from the jaws in the final session instead. Bradman's team were the Invincibles for a reason. Headingley was their finest hour but they garlanded the whole long summer.Maybe we should just be grateful for what we have. In a nation saturated by football, front pages as well as back have been about cricket. The grassroots game is withering but kids in the street are talking about someone most had never heard of a year ago.Stokes cannot single-handedly save cricket in this country. The Test grounds are full but you step outside the bubble to indifference and ignorance. A continual failure to reach beyond private schools or truly exploit the British Asian love for the game leaves it a sport at the heart and within the reach of too few.But that was as true before Sunday as it was afterwards. Stokes has rescued England and he is giving cricket another golden chance.Media playback is not supported on this device

sport	ICC suspend Zimbabwe Cricket for political interference	Concussion replacements approved	"The International Cricket Council (ICC) has suspended Zimbabwe for failing to ensure there is no government interference in its running of the sport.ICC funding has been withdrawn and the country will be barred from participating at ICC events.Zimbabwe are due to take part in a T20 World Cup qualifier in October.""We must keep our sport free from political interference,"" said ICC chairman Shashank Manohar.""What has happened in Zimbabwe is a serious breach of the ICC constitution and we cannot allow it to continue unchecked.""The ICC issued the punishment after the entire Zimbabwe Cricket Board was suspended by the government sports and recreation commission last month and replaced with an interim committee.The ICC says it will review its decision at a board meeting in October.Zimbabwe's Test status was suspended by the ICC in June 2004 after 15 players dropped out of the squad after the then captain Heath Streak was sacked.They played eight Test matches in 2005 after the suspension was lifted, but would then not play another Test match until 2011.They failed to qualify for this year's Cricket World Cup in England and Wales.In March, former Zimbabwe Cricket director Enock Ikope was given a 10-year ban from the game after being found guilty of breaching three counts of the ICC's anti-corruption code.His suspension followed a 20-year ban for Rajan Nayer, a former Zimbabwe cricket official, for attempted match-fixing in March 2018.Meanwhile, the Croatia Cricket Federation and the Zambia Cricket Union have also been suspended for failing to meet ICC criteria while the Moroccan Royal Cricket Federation has been expelled for continuing to remain non-compliant.The decisions were taken at the ICC annual conference in London.The ICC has also approved the use of concussion replacements in all forms of the game following a trial in domestic cricket.Decisions on replacements will be made by the team's medical representative and the player must be a like-for-like replacement approved by the match referee.The ruling will come into force from 1 August, meaning the first game for which they will be available will be the first men's Ashes Test at Edgbaston.In another decision approved by the ICC on Thursday, a captain will no longer be suspended for serious over-rate breaches, with all players taking equal responsibility and being fined the same amount as the captain.In the World Test Championship, which is due to start next month, a team that is behind the required over-rate at the end of a match will have two points deducted for each over it is behind."
sport	Scotland see off PNG for second time in Cricket World Cup League 2		Scotland made it three wins from four in the first round of the new Cricket World Cup League 2 by beating Papua New Guinea by 38 runs in Aberdeen.Richie Berrington top scored with 81, while captain Kyle Coetzer made 62 as the Scots reached 242-7.PNG were restricted to 204-9 from their 50 overs, with skipper Assad Vala hitting 48.Oman, who stunned the Scots in the opening match, can match Scotland's total of six points if they beat PNG.Berrington, who was also the highest scorer in Sunday's revenge win over Oman, struck six sixes as he reached his 81 in 64 balls.And this victory was more straightforward than Saturday's three-wicket success against the same opponents, despite a late flourish from PNG tailender Damien Ravu who finished on 38 not out.Scotland are competing alongside Oman, Papua New Guinea, Nepal, UAE, Namibia and USA in the new qualifying tournament.Each will contest 36 one-day internationals over the next two-and-a-half years.

sport	England in New Zealand: 'Tourists must not think about Ashes now'	What style will England play?Curran or Woakes?New roles for Buttler & Leach?Coping with New Zealand's impressive attack	England's series in New Zealand does not count for World Test Championship points, but it is still an important one for Joe Root's side.For England, with new coach Chris Silverwood, this series is about getting those building blocks into position for the winter tour of South Africa and then beyond.We hear a lot of England talking about the Ashes and going to Australia, but that is two years away. They should not even be thinking about that at the moment.The Ashes is down the line. There is a lot more important cricket to play before we get there, and there are things that have got to be sorted out.I like what I am hearing from England.It sounds as if they are going to try and be a little more measured in their approach, especially with the bat, and look to play a five-day Test as a five-day Test.Last winter, especially in Sri Lanka, we heard a lot about seizing the initiative from the bowlers when they are on top, but that is not really the way in a Test.You have got to be careful. You have got to give respect to the bowlers. You have got to see the bowlers off and wait for them to tire.Certainly captain Root and Ashley Giles, the director of men's cricket, have both talked about refocusing on the way Test cricket is being played, and that is very obvious in the top order, with Root going back again to number four, and their new-look opening partnership.The one-two-three seems set to be Dom Sibley, Rory Burns and Joe Denly. They are not going to be the sort of batsmen who empty bars; these three players are of a temperament and a style that are suited to Test cricket.Are they good enough? Burns has given indication that he has been, Denly ended last season well and Sibley looks the part and scored a century in the first warm-up match.Test cricket is a very different challenge but at least as far as England's outlook is concerned, that looks to be more measured.Batsmen are going to have to be prised out. Batsmen will have to be patient. If the ball is presenting difficulties, the batsmen are going to try and see it through.Can England finally nail that down?Curran has a golden arm. He gets people out - caught down the leg side, hitting a catch to point - however it may be, he has got that knack. He has got that different angle, too, with being a left-armer.Does he have the pace for Test cricket? Does he need the ball to swing in order for him to be effective because he does not quite have that pace and height?The answer is yes, as we saw in Barbados, when he was picked - wrongly - ahead of Stuart Broad. England thought the ball would swing there with the cross breeze and it did not.The warm-up matches in New Zealand have been played with a Kookaburra ball. On a very green pitch, it did virtually nothing, but Curran still picked up three wickets.Woakes does not have a good record overseas; again we go back to the ball and again, he needs the ball to swing.It looks as though Curran has got his nose ahead but that position is far from nailed down and it could change in the course of the series.Jonny Bairstow is pretty mortified at having been left out of the Test squad but his figures recently simply did not support his inclusion.I know he is working hard at his game - he has been showing me various videos of the kind of footwork he has been practising to try and make sure that he does not get bowled as often as he had been - but he is going to have to sit back, wait and watch.Jos Buttler will be keeping wicket now and he scored a good hundred in the final warm-up match against New Zealand A. That will give him confidence, but it is not an easy challenge to score hundreds and keep wicket.As for Jack Leach, I am not sure he can expect much in the way of spin in these two Test matches, but he has got to do a tight holding job.He must allow Jofra Archer particularly and Broad to have a bit of a breather, so they can come in hard. Leach showed a lot of patience in the warm-up match.He is gaining in confidence; his batting in the summer might have given him that.It is going to be very interesting to see the two bowling attacks, because that really is what this series is all about.The word from the locals is the Bay Oval pitch is likely to be flat and hard work. New Zealand have an attack of Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Neil Wagner, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry - they are all fine bowlers who can cause England problems.Ferguson has not played a Test but he impressed in the World Cup and he has some speed. If he plays, it makes a direct head-to-head with Archer, which is fascinating.I suspect New Zealand will want Boult and Southee to open because they both swing the ball and there is a nice cross-breeze on this ground. Wagner will come rushing in and bowl his bouncers, to try and hurry the batsmen up and make them play false shots.Their captain, Kane Williamson, is head and shoulders above the rest of the New Zealand batsmen, but he has not played much cricket because of a hip injury. It will be interesting to see how he gets on.It is the first Test to be played on the ground here. There are plenty of England supporters here, looking for their badge of honour of watching a Test match on a new ground. It is something that we all like to do - it does not happen that often.
sport	Glamorgan Cricket: Star Salter 'deflated' after T20 tie with Gloucestershire		"Glamorgan all-rounder Andrew Salter admits his side were left feeling ""deflated"" after being held to a tie by Gloucestershire.Spinner Salter's 4-12 was his second career-best in eight days after 4-23 against Surrey.The visitors hit 33 off the last two overs to reach 172-7 and deny Glamorgan a first win of their blast campaign.""It's a deflating feeling, we were in a good position but we've got to pick ourselves up tomorrow,"" said Salter.Visitors' fast bowler Andrew Tye clubbed 38 off 18 balls to leave Glamorgan on two points after five games as they travel to face Hampshire.Glamorgan's batting was a marked improvement on recent displays as Fakhar Zaman top-scored with 58 off 43 balls in their 172-5.David Lloyd (35) helped Glamorgan get off to a flying start with 75 for the first wicket but the innings stuttered at times before Chris Cooke pummelled 42 not out off just 21 balls.The home side were on top for most of the Gloucestershire innings but could not maintain their advantage despite Salter's heroics, as he came to the fore after spending most of the season in the second team.""Delighted (with the career-best) but it's a bitter-sweet feeling, I want to put in performances that win us games. I love being back playing with the boys, and fingers crossed one of these performances will get us a win,"" said Salter.Glamorgan captain Colin Ingram said: ""I felt like we got ourselves into a position where we had some wriggle room and then Andrew Tye hit a couple out of the ground, which put us on the ropes.""It went right down to the last ball, we were right in it, so we were disappointed not to win but some really good signs going forward."""

sport	England v Ireland: The ultimate Test in Irish cricket odyssey		"For one team an Ashes warm-up as they chase a second triumph of the summer - for the other a momentous match in a magical arena, and the big prize after a long battle for Test status.Ireland come to Lord's this week hoping for an unlikely victory in their first Test against England, but the significance of the game far outweighs the outcome.It's been a long and often frustrating journey for the Irish to secure the chance to play the longest form of the game.We have to go back to 2006 and the appointment of Warren Deutrom as chief executive of Cricket Ireland - he started as one of just three employees and was indeed the only executive.Deutrom's drive and ambition brought new possibilities for the sport on the island but, vitally, it coincided with a golden generation of Irish cricketers.Ireland qualified for their first World Cup Cup in 2007 and the rest is history - a shock win over Pakistan on their tournament debut and then stunning England four years later in Bangalore.Everything was clicking on and off the field but, when an application for Test status was made in 2012, it was considered a long shot.Tough and exacting requirements were set to gain entry to what was viewed as an exclusive club of Test-playing nations.However, Deutrom's tenacity was rewarded in 2017 and Malahide hosted Ireland's debut Test against Pakistan last year.A first away five-dayer, with Afghanistan their opponents, was ticked off in March but after two defeats now comes a game which must have been pretty close to the top of Ireland's bucket list when Test cricket came into view.Lord's is tradition, the Long Room, egg-and-bacon ties, the slope, picnics, the Nursery End and that unique hum - a sound of summer.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWhether through television or tuning in to Test Match Special with the legendary John Arlott and then 'Blowers and Aggers', it has enchanted cricket lovers throughout the world.Irish connections to the hallowed ground in St John's Wood start with the groundsman - Karl McDermott was recruited from Hampshire but comes from Dublin.Deutrom may have split loyalties come Wednesday morning as the Englishman grew up supporting the national team and his beloved Middlesex at Lord's.It's also familiar territory for Ireland's big-hitting opener Paul Stirling and veteran seamer Tim Murtagh, who are both on the Middlesex staff.And, of course, an Irishman led England to World Cup glory at Lord's just over a week ago - would Dubliner Eoin Morgan have been playing in the thrilling final if Test cricket had been on offer in his native land as a youth?Boyd Rankin was another to make the switch to England in search of a Test career, but the big paceman has returned for Ireland and he will spearhead their attack against England.William Porterfield debuted for Ireland in 2006 and the captain is relishing leading the team down those famous Lord's steps.""Test match cricket is what we've dreamed about - to play at the home of cricket against England is a pretty special occasion,"" he said.""Warren's been unbelievable and he's pushed things forward - it was an ambitious plan but I think you've got to be ambitious and we are starting to reap the rewards now.""There's going to be a massive opportunity for future generations of cricketers in Ireland to perform on the big stage.""We have to enjoy the occasion and take it in, because if you don't you'll look back in a few years and regret it."""

To go down to the last ball, it's tough. It's devastating.""Williamson was named player of the tournament after scoring 578 runs in 10 innings.In a tournament in which New Zealand's batting has rarely fired, Williamson was the key man in many of their victories - and they came within one run of a famous win on Sunday.""New Zealand are a great cricketing nation,"" former England captain Michael Vaughan told Test Match Special. ""What they bring to the game in terms of hard work, togetherness, smartness.""They get the best out of themselves - and that's a lesson for everyone.""After scoring 241, New Zealand had reduced England to 86-4 with some clever bowling on a slow pitch.However, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler put on a 110-run partnership, and a fortuitous throw that ricocheted off Stokes and went for four overthrows was ultimately decisive in forcing a super over.Left-arm seamer Trent Boult bowled well in the super over and Jimmy Neesham hit a six to move New Zealand within touching distance of the title, but Martin Guptill was run out from the final ball to confirm England's win on most boundaries scored.""While the emotions are raw, it is pretty hard to swallow,"" said Williamson. ""The rules are there at the start.""No-one probably thought they would have to sort a result by some of that stuff.""Guptill and Neesham, the two batsmen sent out to play the super over, were consoled by the England players as they fell to their knees at the conclusion and the team were greeted warmly by the crowd at the presentation.Asked at his post-match news conference whether he thought ""everyone should be a gentleman like you"" Williamson laughed and replied: ""Everybody is allowed to be themselves, and everybody should be a little bit different as well.""That is probably my best answer - just be yourself and try and enjoy what you do."""
sport	Steve Smith: Why Australia's batting hero is more than just a cricket obsessive	'A cricket machine with a human interior''An obsessive focus from an early age''You don't want to be in Smith's head'	"If you'd never seen him play before, you might have looked at Steve Smith batting at Edgbaston and asked ""Who on earth is this?""A batsman who twitched between deliveries as though suffering mild electric shock. A batsman who wandered with apparent aimlessness while the ball was bowled. A batsman who remained unbeaten, scoring and scoring again, while those around him with conventional approaches fell away.If you'd started watching Test cricket recently then you might never have seen Smith play. You would have fallen in love with the game while a disciplinary suspension - for his part in 2018's ball-tampering scandal - cost him 16 months out of it.From a home-team perspective, the same question would have arisen: who is this? How did he learn to play this way? What is he doing to England, and can someone please make him stop?We can't help with that last question. With the others, Steven Peter Devereux Smith is most frequently depicted as a cricketing machine, implacably calculating velocities and angles. But, on the contrary, there is an entirely human interior.As Smith explained in his book The Journey, published when he was on top of the world before that suspension, being Australia captain meant surviving scrutiny.His obsession with kit was demonstrated in his teenage stint in England, when he strewed a club kit to all corners to find pads that were worn enough, gloves roomy enough, a bat light enough. But he made a hundred and won them the gameIt meant learning that ""there was a camera on me at all times, either television or photography, and so I had to control my emotions to a far greater degree than I was used to doing… my answer was to push my hands deep into my pockets and squeeze my thumbs hard. I found it offered a little relief for any pent-up feelings.""He's still terrible at hiding them. When he doesn't hit a shot where he means to, he gestures angrily at the intended gap. When he's dismissed, he shouts himself off the field. When he's fielding and an edge flies safely, he groans and knots his fingers over his head.Smith is far from a robot. He's just emotionally attuned to cricket above anything. Take the 2018 Ashes Test in Sydney, when Mitchell Marsh struck his hundredth run and tried to stop mid-pitch to hug his brother Shaun. They were so caught up in the moment that they nearly caused a run-out.On the players' balcony, every Australia player laughed. Except Smith, who panicked, pointing wildly at the end of the pitch, yelling for the players to get back to their ground. Of course they couldn't hear him, and Australia had a massive lead, but nothing was more distressing to him than the possibility that someone might not be playing cricket perfectly.This emotion gives Smith incredible focus. He's probably genuine when he says he didn't notice England supporters jeering during Australia's first-Test win at Edgbaston last week, because all he was aware of was his own batting.It's only when that concentration pauses that emotions break through. When he spoke to the BBC's Jonathan Agnew about his comeback century, Smith said: ""My first thought was, don't burst into tears.""It reflected an innings that his parents recalled way back when he was playing under-10s cricket, when he assumed his run-machine form to make 93 not out in a run chase while battling dehydration on a scorching day, then became a child again and cried torrents after sealing the win.Right from this age, Smith had the same obsessive focus. It would take him two hours to choose a bat, and he didn't care which brand was being endorsed by which player. It was all about the pick-up of the bat, how it felt in his hands.Smith's father Peter explained his junior regime: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays were an hour's training with Dad. The local club had training on Tuesday and a 50-over game on Saturday, while the shire junior association trained on Thursday with a 50-over game on Sunday. Sometimes after a match Steve would ask for another hour with Peter.A kid who hadn't started high school had cricket seven days a week, including 200 overs on the field. As he progressed to his mid-teens, senior grade cricket came into the picture as well.""When I wasn't around he used to go into our garage at home and hit a ball that I'd suspended from a beam in the ceiling,"" said Peter. ""In the end I had to place a piece of board over a part of that ceiling that had been pock-marked and worn away by the ball…""Smith was lucky to have a father who could bowl inswing, outswing, medium pace, off-breaks and leg-breaks, to keep testing him against different styles.Indoor cricket taught Smith to flick off his stumps to the leg side, a trait that exhausts England bowlers to this day. His proficiency against spin may have started with a shaved-down bat against a composite ball that skidded or skipped up on paving stones in his backyard, meaning he had to watch carefully out of the hand and off the surface.His obsession with kit was demonstrated in his teenage stint in England, when he strewed a club kit to all corners to find pads that were worn enough, gloves roomy enough, a bat light enough. But he made a hundred and won them the game.That relentless focus continued during his year's suspension, banned from all Australian international and domestic cricket. The Indian Premier League gave him the boot and there was a strong implication that English county cricket would also block him.So Smith played wherever he could. The Canada Global T20 tournament in Toronto. The Caribbean Premier League. The Bangladesh Premier League. First-grade cricket in Sydney, in red-ball and white-ball forms.In many ways it seemed an opportunity missed, with Smith passing up the chance to get out of cricket and broaden his horizons. An ongoing issue in his life has been the absence of much else.He left school early after deciding it was ""a waste of time"". His online posts are the definition of anodyne. When his agent once told him to get a hobby, Smith bought shares in a couple of horses that he has never seen race.In recent years he's had the odd hobby, like flying a camera drone or playing guitar, but nothing that has seemed major. He's well liked by team-mates, and is sufficiently social outside extra sessions in the nets, but he's more likely to reflect a group's agenda than set it.His colleagues have always found his methods amusing: the extra batting, the kit bag full of gloves, the moves. When Smith was asked at Edgbaston why he added an elaborate flourish to some of his leaves, fellow centurion Matthew Wade jumped in.""Dangerous question trying to get in Smudge's head,"" he laughed. ""You don't want to be in there.""At the same time, his team-mates for that Test were full of admiration and awe at his twin centuries in his first match back. Perhaps most telling was bowler James Pattinson, who said that, while he was impressed, he wasn't surprised. He thought it was exactly the kind of thing Smith would do.And why not? The kid who faced hundreds of thousands of deliveries had the best chance. And once he returned from his break, he was still the most prolific scorer per match since Sir Donald Bradman, continuing on his way."
sport	Cricket World Cup semi-finals: Andy Zaltzman's guide	Key phase one: The beginningKey phase two: The middleKey phase three: The endKey phase zero: The pre-beginningKey phase -1: The pastKeyest key phase: Key phase two - the key middle overs	In the grand modern tradition of sporting articles highlighting the blindingly obvious, here is my guide to the key phases of the Cricket World Cup semi-finals. With added numbers.You do not need to be a rocket statistician to know that starting your innings well in a cricket match is, broadly speaking, a good idea.Successful opening partnerships have been strikingly influential in this World Cup.In 41 completed matches, the side batting first has added 50 or more for the first wicket 17 times - and ended up winning 16 of those games (Afghanistan's 66-run opening stand against New Zealand - the 16th best opening score by a team batting first - was the exception). They have lost 13 of 24 when losing a wicket before reaching 50.Chasing teams have won six of eight when they have added 50 for the first wicket, and lost 25 of 33 when they have not. The average opening stand for winning teams this tournament has been 70.2; for losing teams, 20.1.For comparison, in between the last World Cup and this one - all stats for this period refer only to games between the 10 teams who have played in this tournament - the average first-wicket stand for winning teams was 53.4, and for losing teams, 28.2.Teams with 50-plus opening stands batting first won 117, and lost 51. A good start has been considerably more influential in this World Cup than in recent one-day international cricket in general.The semi-finalists highlight the importance of starting well. Australia safely negotiated the first 10 overs in six of their first seven games, before losing two wickets in each of their final two.England lost no wickets four times and one wicket twice, and went on to win all six of those games. In their three defeats, they lost two in the first 10 against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, then three against Australia.India have lost just four wickets in eight matches inside the opening powerplay. When batting first, they have scored 352, 336, and 314 after 10 overs with their first wicket still intact.When they lost a wicket in the first 10 batting first, they managed scores of 268 and 224. Until their rapid start in their final game against Sir Lanka, India had been the second-slowest-scoring team in the opening powerplay, but the most secure.New Zealand have bucked the trend somewhat in their early run of low-scoring victories. They have been the second least competent side with the bat in the first 10 overs of innings, losing 13 wickets in their eight innings (only West Indies equalled that tally). They lost at least one wicket in seven of their matches.The only times they did not lose an opening-powerplay wicket were in the two games that propelled them into the semi-finals - their 10-wicket clouting of Sri Lanka on the first weekend of the tournament, and their crucial-point-acquiring abandoned game against India, when rain deprived them of the chance to bat disappointingly at the top of the innings.With the ball, India have been the tightest bowling team in the first 10 overs - 3.90 per over. Their only defeat came in one of the only two matches in which they did not take a wicket inside 10 overs.Australia won all six matches in which they took at least one wicket in the first 10; and lost two of three when they took none. England lost both games in which they failed to strike early; and won six of seven when they did.Overall, it has never been harder to take early wickets in a World Cup. This tournament, all teams collectively have averaged 43.9 for opening partnerships.In 2015, it was 30.7. In 2011, it was 34.1. For the three tournaments before then, it was between 28 and 30.In other words, early wickets are important. You can have that one. My shout.Having started well, most strategists concur that your best plan is then to continue playing well.With the ball, the four semi-finalists are well clear of the rest in the table of wickets taken from overs 11 to 40 - Australia 44 in nine innings; England 40 in nine; India and New Zealand 38 in 8. Next on the list is South Africa (32 in 8).The other five eliminated teams each averaged below 3.4 middle-over wickets per innings.The semi-finalists also lost the fewest middle-over wickets when batting - Australia, England and New Zealand exactly three per innings, India 21 in 8. The other sides averaged at least 3.3 middle-over wickets lost per innings.A nine-matches-per-team group stage, in which several matches were lost to rain, is a relatively small sample size for ODI statistics.It is notable, however, that the semi-finalists do not all stand out statistically in the opening and closing powerplays, but have been the four best wicket-takers and wicket-preservers in the unglamorous middle overs.Ending well might not always be an option when it comes to life in general, but it is a considerable help in ODI cricket.England (8.74 per over), Australia (8.37) and India (7.88) have been the first, second and fourth fastest-scoring teams in the death overs.The four semi-finalists have all been in the top five most economical with the ball, with England (6.27) leading the table.England's power with the bat, aside from their two-match chase-induced wobble against Sri Lanka and Australia, was expected.Their death-over excellence with the ball - they also have the best team bowling average (15.9 runs per wicket) in the last 10 overs - has been a significant bonus, with Archer and Wood particularly effective.Over the previous four years, England's bowlers had had only the eighth best economy rate in the final 10 overs (7.71), and seventh best average (23.9).There are, aside from these three absolutely key phases, which could each be key to the key task of winning the key matches, the following key subsidiary phases:Winning the toss is a good plan. Teams batting first have won 16 of the past 20 matches (having won 11 of the first 21 completed games).Almost all of these victories have been of the higher-ranked team against lower-ranked opposition, so we might be reading too much into the bald numbers - but, even so, it has become barely conceivable that a team would choose to chase.The recent run of results is another bucking of the pre-tournament trend.In between the last World Cup and this one, the side batting first won 46% (142 out of 306 completed matches, with three ties and 161 defeats).In England, that figure was 37% (19 wins, 1 tie, 31 defeats).The past has proved absolutely critical for New Zealand, who roared into the semi-finals like a half-eaten kebab into a food waste bin on a Saturday morning.They find themselves two matches from glory - unlikely, but not inconceivable given a couple of waspish Boult opening spells, some Ferguson middle-over pace mayhem, a belated Guptill clonk - thanks to two results from five weeks ago that irredeemably shunted the (unfit for purpose) net run-rate calculations in their favour, and an unfortunate/magnificent (delete according to level of New Zealand-ness) bout of bad weather soon after that skewed the entire tournament.Has any team in any sport ever (a) gone into a semi-final in worse form, after three defeats, including two stodgy surrenders with the bat; or (b) so obviously set themselves up for a sensational against-the-odds, no-one-gave-them-a-chance phoenixing from some very unimpressive ashes?Obviously, a team's innings needs a good beginning, middle, and end. Like a novel. Or a train. Or a meal. Or a shark. Or major surgery. Or a celebrity marriage. Or a space mission. Especially a space mission.The middle overs have been especially influential this tournament.The ability to maintain and resist pressure in the central chunks of the knockout matches may well prove to be the decisive factor in determining who gets to (a) have the crowning moment of their career interrupted by an unnecessary blast of ear-bleeding pop music; and (b) lift the trophy.Or it might be an early clatter of wickets. Or a pyrotechnic final 10 overs. Or a ridiculous run-out, a physics-defying catch, an opportune fluke, a great player touching greatness at the vital moment, a journeyman squad member Grant Elliotting his way to knock-out immortality. Or the random will of Zeus.Or, most likely, a combination of the above. Thanks be to sport. Amen.

sport	Australia v Pakistan: David Warner century gives home side control		David Warner made his first Test century since his year-long ban as his 151 not out gave Australia control against Pakistan in the first Test.The 33-year-old appeared to be caught behind on 56 at the Gabba, but 16-year-old bowler Naseem Shah's delivery was ruled a no-ball on replay.Warner survived another scare on 93 when he was nearly run out by a direct hit from the deep in Brisbane.But Australia ended the day on top, 72 runs ahead with nine wickets in hand.Warner, who scored just 95 runs in 10 innings in last summer's Ashes series, last made a Test century in the 2017 Boxing Day Test against England.He has spent much of the intervening period on the international sidelines after being banned for 12 months for his part in the ball-tampering scandal against South Africa.He was ably supported by fellow opener Joe Burns, who fell three runs short of his own century after being deceived by Yasir Shah's leg break.That opening stand of 222 pulled Australia within sight of Pakistan's first-innings total and Marnus Labuschagne's assured 55 not out pushed the game further out of the tourists' reach.Find out how to get into cricket with our inclusive guide.

"England cricketers no longer share rooms on tour. Dom Sibley's new team-mates are probably quite relieved.""He would clean up the kitchen if he made a mess. His bedroom was another story,"" says Will Rhodes, his Warwickshire team-mate and former flatmate.""Me, Dom and Olly Stone lived together last year. As the eldest, Olly was chief cleaner in the flat. Let's just say, if he needed a helper, he would ask me rather than Sibbers.""It is a theme that runs through Sibley's career.While playing grade cricket in Australia in 2014-15, he worked in a sports shop two days a week.""He was hopeless,"" says Stewart Walters, Sibley's captain at Midland-Guildford in Perth. ""He didn't know how to work the vacuum cleaner.""Like most young kids, he had grown up with everyone doing everything for him. He had no sense of living properly.""Rhodes says Sibley has improved - up to a point. ""He might have made fajitas for us a couple of times, but he takes more of a supervisor's role in the kitchen.""It is also probably wise not to leave him in charge of your car keys. Last year Sibley was filmed trying to rescue team-mate Ian Bell's keys after dropping them down a drain.""He got them out in the end,"" says Rhodes.If Sibley's domestic skills leave a little to be desired, his productiveness with the bat is unquestionable.He scored 1,324 runs in County Championship Division One this summer - no-one else managed 1,000 - at an average of almost 70 and will make his England debut in the first Test in New Zealand starting on Thursday (22:00 GMT, Wednesday).With two double centuries and three hundreds, Sibley was the stand-out performer in domestic cricket in 2019, but the 24-year-old is far from a household name among England fans.In the words of Rhodes, Sibley is a ""football fanatic"" who will try to watch every Premier League game that is on TV. He even won the Fantasy Premier League competition at his local cricket club once. ""He loves Manchester United and he will try to get to games when he can.""""That's the only cross against his name,"" says former England captain and Chelsea fan Alec Stewart, who has known Sibley since he was 13 and saw him progress through the Surrey age-group system before he left for Warwickshire in 2017.""Easygoing"", ""quietly spoken"" and ""modest"" are common descriptions of Sibley from those who know him.""He's pretty chilled and doesn't take himself too seriously,"" says Rhodes, Sibley's partner in the County Championship's most successful opening alliance this summer.Nick Hill, chairman of Sibley's local club Ashtead, adds: ""I've got no stories of him smashing bats against walls.""He's a sociable guy. He would always stay and have a couple of beers after a game. You wouldn't hear him going around telling people about himself. It was only when people asked him about Surrey that he would talk about it.""Rhodes says Sibley has a dry sense of humour, ""good banter"" and a taste for R&B and hip hop. ""He rates his music - and he rates his dancing. It's not immaculate, but it's better than some lads in the dressing room.""As impressive as Sibley's County Championship stats were this season, quite possibly the most important figure the England selectors discussed was the number of balls he faced: 3,024.It was 50% more than the next most obdurate batsman, former Test captain Alastair Cook - arguably England's greatest and a man who forged a career on being prised from the crease.Batting for long periods is a skill Sibley has had since childhood, and one which was evident again when he made 100 in England's opening warm-up match against a New Zealand XI.""He just loves batting. His biggest strength is his appetite for run-scoring,"" says Surrey director of cricket Stewart.""You knew he was going to play for England - it was just a question of when.""As head of cricket at Whitgift School for 21 years, David Ward watched many of Sibley's finest innings during a school career in which he averaged 63, 50, 63 and 89 in successive summers.""He set his stall out just to bat,"" says former Surrey batsman Ward. ""If it was a 25-over game, he would try and bat 25 overs. If it was 50 overs, he would try and bat 50 overs.""What made him the player he is today is the basic will to bat time. We see very, very few lads coming through at school level who are prepared to do that.""Hill says: ""Some of the players in our league, if they have a Surrey contract, they might not treat it that seriously. It does not seem as important to them.""Not with Dom - I can't remember him giving his wicket away once.""At first glance, Sibley's route to the top appears well trodden: precocious youngster scores mountains of runs for school; signs professional contract at 17; represents England Under-19s; scores heavily in county cricket; makes Test debut.However, there were moments of extraordinary brilliance - and the occasional mishap - along the way.As a 15-year-old, Sibley scored a double century for Ashtead in the Surrey Premier League, only the fourth player to achieve the feat.Six balls into his senior Surrey debut in 2013, he was carried off on a stretcher after injuring himself diving to complete a run.The following month, aged 18 and playing only his third first-class match, he made 242 against a Yorkshire side containing seven current or future Test cricketers, becoming the youngest player to score a double hundred in the County Championship. Only WG Grace has scored a maiden first-class century in England at a younger age.However, Sibley never came close to matching those feats in subsequent seasons with the county, and spent half a season on loan at Warwickshire in 2017 before turning down a new Surrey contract to move to Edgbaston on a permanent basis in search of more opportunities at the top of the order.""As much as I did not want him to leave, I respected him for his decision,"" says Stewart, who lives close to and remains friends with the Sibley family.""Well done for making that tough call. That speaks volumes for him as a character.""Sibley's averages were more eye-catching than his strokeplay in his early years.""I don't remember one particular innings or season,"" says Ward. ""It was more like 'Dom got runs again' after every game. That was what was extraordinary.""Walters, who captained Sibley in two of his four winters in Australia from 2014 to 2018, says: ""He was really defensive when he first came over. He didn't have that many shots.""Sibley's game was transformed by Neil 'Noddy' Holder, whom Walters describes as ""the best batting coach in the world"" and who worked with former Australia players Justin Langer and Mike Hussey and India's Gautam Gambhir.""Noddy simplified everything for Dom,"" says Walters. ""It was a mental thing - he made him believe he could do it. He came out of his shell.""After a barren run in 2018, Sibley spent time with Gary Palmer, one of Cook's former coaches, and adopted a more front-on stance. The result: six centuries in six first-class matches across 2018 and 2019.Nowadays, according to Warwickshire coach Jim Troughton, Sibley ""can pull, he can cut, he can play inside out off the spinners - he's got the shots"".The penultimate game of last season against Nottinghamshire summed up Sibley's progress. He batted for nine hours in carrying his bat for 215, then hit a brilliant 109 as Warwickshire chased 271 in 55 overs to win on the final evening.""We are looking for people at the top of the order who can bat a serious amount of time,"" England director of cricket Ashley Giles said when Sibley was named in the England squad.England have never found a reliable replacement for Andrew Strauss, who retired in 2012 - a week after Sibley got his GCSE results.He is the latest in a long line of players who will attempt to solve a problem that has been made more acute by England's tendency to collapse in recent years.""What Dom has done, through sheer weight of runs, is to smash the door down, to say 'you cannot not select me',"" says Troughton.""Once he got mentioned in columns and on TV, his game actually went up a level. It didn't faze him. That shows that he thrived on it.""Stewart, who played 133 Tests for England from 1990 to 2003, says: ""You need mental strength, ability, technique - and you have got to be run-hungry. Dom has all the credentials.""Sibley looks set to walk out to bat for England alongside Rory Burns, his opening partner at Whitgift and also when he made his second XI and first-class debuts for Surrey.""They are good mates. They used to live five minutes from each other,"" says Stewart. ""Sibley and Burns could be England's opening partnership for a while to come.""Just like Dom has patience, I hope England have the patience to give him a run in the team."""

sport	England reach Cricket World Cup final with thrashing of Australia	England revel in Edgbaston partyMagnificent England peaking at the right timeAustralia blown away'I'm speechless, it was an incredible performance'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland surged into their first World Cup final for 27 years with a sensational eight-wicket demolition of Australia at Edgbaston.The hosts will have the chance to lift the trophy for the first time when they meet New Zealand at Lord's on Sunday.A first win in a World Cup knockout match since 1992 was secured over the defending champions on a day that will live long in the memory, justifiably alongside anything from the 2005 Ashes or the 2010-11 tour of Australia.It was built on a riotous opening seven overs, when Australia were reduced to 14-3 by the new-ball brilliance of Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer.Steve Smith, so often England's nemesis, held Australia together with 85, helping them to a total of 223 that at least gave them something to bowl at.But home nerves over the menacing presence of Mitchell Starc were allayed by a prolific opening partnership between Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, who added 124 for the first wicket.Roy crashed 85 before Joe Root and Eoin Morgan took England to their target with 17.5 overs to spare.The ease of England's progression to the final was such a contrast to the group-stage defeat by Australia that left them on the brink of elimination.Since then they have beaten India, New Zealand and turned in this, their best performance of the tournament to date.They will start the final, which will be shown as free-to-air on Channel 4, as firm favourites to be crowned world champions.Media playback is not supported on this deviceUntil Saturday's final round of group games, England were set to play India in this match.Although they would never admit it, the opportunity to play their oldest enemies at a ground where Australia have no win of any kind since 2001 and England had won their previous 10 matches was absolutely perfect.The toss seemed like a huge boost for Aaron Finch's men - batting first has been a big advantage in the tournament - but that was to discount the carnage that would follow.Edgbaston exploded with noise as Finch, David Warner and Peter Handscomb were removed, cheers that were matched in volume by the boos for Warner and Smith.Although Smith ensured what the crowd knew could have been a tricky chase - they cheered as Roy defended Starc's first over - Roy injected belief with an outrageous flick for six off the left-armer.As it became clearer that England were strolling, the party moved through the gears.Starc was serenaded with the song that tortured Mitchell Johnson, and the Hollies Stand howled as Smith was launched for three consecutive sixes by Roy.By the end, as the rain fell, the whole of Edgbaston was telling the world that cricket is coming home.This was a complete display by England, who were magnificent with the ball, sharp in the field and dominant with the bat.Woakes (3-20) and Archer (2-32) nipped the new ball around on a full length. Archer trapped Finch lbw with his first ball, Woakes got one to climb that Warner fended to first slip, then bowled Handscomb through the gate.Archer also left Alex Carey needing stitches from a blow to the chin, but the left-hander recovered to make 46 in a stand of 103 with Smith.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAt 117-3, the game was delicately poised, before Carey needlessly holed out off Adil Rashid, who removed Marcus Stoinis in the same over and later had Pat Cummins caught at slip in a lovely spell of 3-54.Smith remained through it all, only to be run out by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler's direct hit that somehow went between the batsman's legs - an action symptomatic of a day when everything went right for England.After the dangerous Starc's early overs were negotiated, Roy cut loose with fearsome power - the third of his sixes off Smith was a monstrous hit into the top tier of the stand.Although Bairstow was trapped leg before by Starc for 34 and an angry Roy was wrongly adjudged to have hooked Pat Cummins behind, Root and Morgan were untroubled in an unbroken stand of 79.After the match, Roy was fined 30% of his match fee and given two demerit points for showing dissent at his dismissal.Media playback is not supported on this deviceGiven their team for this tournament only really came together at the last minute, it is to Australia's credit that they made the semi-finals with such ease.But here they were ambushed by England and now must regroup before the Ashes begin on this ground on 1 August.As his team-mates crumbled around him, Smith stood tall, blocking out the abuse to accumulate with his trademark fidgety efficiency.Indeed, had Carey hung around, England's task could have been difficult but, after he departed, wickets fell with regularity.When Smith was beaten by Buttler's throw to become the eighth man out, he shook his head all the way to the pavilion, unable to conceal his disappointment.To stand any chance, Australia needed early wickets and when they failed to materialise, they were powerless to prevent Roy's awesome hitting.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland captain Eoin Morgan: ""This final is a huge opportunity for us.""Looking back to where we were in 2015 compared to now it's such a dramatic improvement and everyone in the dressing room deserves a huge amount of credit.""Making the most of it would be brilliant but getting to the final alone is awesome.""Man of the match Chris Woakes, who took 3-20 in eight overs: ""I'm pretty speechless. It was an incredible performance from the whole team.""It started with the bowling performance and then the way they knocked that off was outstanding.""There were some nerves around this morning but that's natural going into a semi-final.""The way we produced the goods just showed how good we are and where we are at as a team.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceFormer England captain Alastair Cook on Test Match Special: ""I can't believe I have just watched that.""You always think there will be a twist in the tail but there was no twist.

The way they set the tone with the ball in those first 10 overs was a huge part in the game.""You always want to win the trophy but there have been a lot of positives""A lot of hard work has gone in from a lot of people.

""It doesn't get much bigger than England v Australia in a World Cup semi-final.""The fans are always entertaining down there (Edgbaston). It is going to be a fantastic atmosphere.""Chasing 326 for victory, Australia fell to 95-3 and lost Usman Khawaja to a hamstring problem, but David Warner's imperious century gave the defending champions hope of a win.Wicketkeeper Alex Carey hit out in the final 10 overs as he scored a fine 85 but, with 51 needed from 28 balls, he holed out, and Australia could not regain the momentum.South Africa's total had been set up by a fine ton from captain Faf du Plessis and 95 from Rassie van der Dussen.Australia, meanwhile, will travel to Birmingham with injury concerns over three key players.Khawaja did come back out after going off early in Australia's innings but could barely run, Marcus Stoinis had treatment on his side while batting and Mitchell Starc appeared to feel some discomfort while bowling.Australia, who also face England in an Ashes series after the World Cup, looked downbeat as they left the field - something that will not have gone unnoticed by England.""If England have to take a snapshot of today, it would be at the end - Australia's batsmen consoling each other, the team as a whole looking dejected with hands in pockets,"" noted BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew.""They have got to lift themselves up now.""Australia topped the group before Saturday's match but this defeat means they will now have to face England at Edgbaston - where they have not won a match in any format of the game since 2001.Eoin Morgan's England side had their top order blown away in the group stages by Australia - but they will have watched today with interest.South Africa got off to a fast start with their aggressive play in the opening stages. By taking advantage of an off-colour Starc, they forced captain Finch into early changes. For the first time, Australia looked unsure of where the breakthrough would come from.Australia used eight different bowlers in the opening 20 overs. If England, who have such a destructive top order, can do the same and play with careful aggression, they can put Australia on the back foot.Warner, though, was superb.South Africa should have run him out from the third ball of the innings but Kagiso Rabada threw to the wrong end and from there Warner barely looked back.Warner is not as aggressive as he was before his ban for his involvement in 'Sandpapergate' but the power is still there. England cannot afford to feed his strengths.There are opportunities for England, though. Carey has been a standout for Australia but he is the strongest link in a brittle middle order and Australia's innings subsided once he fell.There are the injury worries, too, for Australia: Khawaja could not run and had to retire hurt, Stoinis had three separate physio treatments on his side and Starc was gingerly touching his leg during his bowling spell.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe Proteas have had a poor tournament but they continued their winning run over Australia - they have now beaten them in eight of their past nine one-day internationals.With opener Hashim Amla missing with injury, Aiden Markram and Quinton de Kock came out flying, and Du Plessis capitalised to hit the first century by a South African at this tournament.Van der Dussen manipulated the field and Australia's fearsome pace attack and, although he holed off the last ball going for the six that would have taken him to a century, he looks a good prospect for the future.De Kock was superb behind the stumps, affecting an audacious run out of Stoinis by flicking the ball on to the stumps, and he took a good catch to dismiss the dangerous Glenn Maxwell.While their death bowling is a concern - Chris Morris was flogged for 17 runs by Starc and Khawaja in the 48th over - they ultimately held their nerve to secure a consolation win.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAustralia captain Aaron Finch: ""We would have liked to have got the win. There were some positives with the bat.""We fought out of a hole. Davey Warner with a magnificent hundred and Alex Carey played a brilliant knock to get us close but it was not quite good enough.""Finch on the injury concerns: ""It doesn't look ideal for Usman Khawaja. He will have a scan in the morning. Marcus Stoinis, we are not sure at the moment.""South Africa captain Faf du Plessis: ""I think India will be happy we won today. I think it'll be an England v India final. India and Australia play the big games very well so I'd back one of those two on the biggest stage of all."""

It wasn't a great wicket to play shots on - it was a little bit slow - and we saw that in the Sri Lanka innings as well.""When you have got a couple of teams with some very good batters who are struggling to time the ball, it tells you the wicket was probably a little bit slow.""Bayliss says he is unsure whether Jason Roy will be fit to face Australia and will not rush the batsman back into his side.Roy tore his hamstring in the defeat of West Indies last Friday and has missed the matches against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.""If someone of Jason's ilk is not playing, of course you're going to miss them,"" said Bayliss.""That's the game. He's injured and I'm not exactly sure when he'll be back, but we are looking forward to him coming back.""We're not going to risk him, that's for sure.

sport	Cricket World Cup: India fans travel from Singapore to England	'Paint the world red'Through snow, hail, wind and rain to HeadingleyRoom for the World Cup on way home?	"At 46 days, the Cricket World Cup is among the longest of sports tournaments, occasionally conjuring up thoughts of what else you could complete in that time.For three generations of one cricket-mad family, almost the same number of days have been used to complete the road trip of a lifetime.Totalling just under 14,000 miles, visiting 17 different countries and crossing two continents from Singapore to England via the equator and Arctic Circle, these India fans hope the journey ends with their country lifting the World Cup at Lord's on 14 July.The Mathur family - from three-year-old daughter Avya to 67-year-old grandfather Akhilesh - left Singapore in their seven-seater people carrier on 20 May and, 48 days later, reached London on Thursday night.After watching India's victory against Sri Lanka at Headingley on Saturday, perhaps the greatest challenge of their trip remains - getting hold of tickets for the semi-final against New Zealand at Old Trafford on Tuesday.So why spend seven weeks in a car - going through snow, hail and desert storms - to watch your country play cricket when a direct flight would be so much easier?""Back in March, we knew the World Cup was coming and we thought we must be there to support India,"" father-of-two Anupam told BBC Sport.""The easiest way to do it would be to fly, but then we thought, 'no, let's do something special for the country, let's include everyone'.""That aim to include everyone means Anupam's parents Akhilesh and Anjana and his six-year-old son Aviv have come along for the whole ride while his wife Aditi, 34, and younger daughter Avya have also been passengers for a considerable chunk of the journey.And this is not the first time Anupam has decided to get behind the wheel and see the world.A quick look through the family's blog reveals that he had travelled just under 60,000 miles (96,000km), driving through 36 countries before this latest trip.Now another 22,000km can be added to that total, with the following countries all passed through on the cricketing quest.""Since childhood, my dream has been to drive and do long distance driving trips,"" Anupam said. ""The ultimate dream was to drive around the world.""I've been keeping track of all my road trips on a blue map of the world that doesn't show borders and painting a red line on each one.""The ultimate goal is to paint the world red!""The morning after they reach London, I meet the Mathur family just a Rohit Sharma pull for six away from Lord's. Rather than looking world weary from seven solid weeks of travelling, they are beaming having finally arrived at the World Cup, taking in the atmosphere as Pakistan and Bangladesh fans walk past ahead of the day's group gameFrom London they are excited to be making the relatively short trip up the M1 to Leeds in time to watch India against Sri Lanka the next day.Every inch of the trip has been covered in their seven-seater people carrier, a vehicle that comes complete with Anupam's custom paintwork on the exterior, illustrating the route and the countries they have visited.""We call ourselves AMX Paint It Red,"" Anupam says as he talks me through the vehicle. ""AM because that's all our initials in the family and X because the number of us has changed throughout the trip.""A strategist for a banking group by day, Anupam and his family are originally from Chennai but he has lived and worked in Singapore for 14 years.But what gave him to spend all the time on the road just to see some cricket?""I started to look at how we could do it by road, what countries we needed to go through and I then I realised that it was all connected,"" Anupam said.""Then we started planning it in super detail, applied for what felt like a million visas and and it's all come together.""Luck has certainly been on their side, they only had to change route once to safely cross borders through south east Asia and they have stuck almost perfectly to the itinerary, only having to cancel one hotel reservation because of delays.""Some of the countries like Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are some of the most beautiful places and landscapes I've ever seen, but before this trip, I hadn't even heard of them"" Anupam says.""We've been fortunate to have had some really experienced guides with us in some countries, who've been absolutely invaluable.""We also took a bit of a detour in China, so we could visit the southern-most point of the mainland and the western-most point.""With the Arctic Circle, we also did something similar where we went just beyond it so we could cross off Sweden as another country we'd visited and see the Ice Hotel too, which was incredible.""All these things have been to do with the passion of driving and all the way, we've been thinking - we're doing this for the country and for cricket.""To fuel such a journey needs support from family and friends.Anupam's parents Akhilesh and Anjana have not only helped navigate along with older son Aviv, but have also helped set up a roadside kitchen when needed to keep perked up with the comforts of home.That proved invaluable in remote parts of China where more familiar foods were hard to come by.""I was unsure about the idea at first in my mind because of health and the long journey,"" father and grandfather Akhilesh said.""But then I decided we'll go and with full zeal so that we can see and experience new places.""That's how we've approached it and it's been absolutely incredible.""Mother Anjana added: ""The exciting part has been the fact people are the same everywhere.""They spread love and I also want to spread peace and love for my country and for the world. Supporting India has also been a huge joy and now we're here, it's exciting to see them in action.""""It's been a once-in-a-lifetime trip, life-changing,"" Anupam added. ""We have learned so many new things and also about how to lead our lives.""I'm just grateful we've been able to do it. We set off with 17 bags and when he flagged us off in Singapore, the High Commissioner to India told us to leave space for an 18th so we can bring back the World Cup!""All that remains now is for the family to get their hands on those elusive semi-final tickets and possibly some for the final as well."
sport	Cricket World Cup final: Kane Williamson inspires New Zealand's 'miracle' run		Of all the logical explanations you can find for the illogical progress of New Zealand to the final of the Cricket World Cup, nothing is as persuasive as their skipper Kane Williamson.Persuasive is precisely what Williamson is, because in a tournament that was supposed to be about big hitting and blockbuster totals he has been the unassuming conductor of its gentle low-fi reality.In almost two months of low scores, slow wickets and half-baked chases, Kane has been able in ways others have not. In the process he is a game away from pulling off the most unexpected triumph since Sri Lanka pinch-hit their way to glory 23 years ago.A win at Lord's on Sunday would be close to miraculous, not just for the barriers New Zealand have cleared but also for the problems they have caused themselves.Thrashed by England in the group stage by 119 runs, by Australia by 86 runs and by Pakistan by six wickets. A nation of 4.3 million people beating one of 1.3 billion in a semi-final that most assumed was lost at the innings break, a country with a national sport whose own World Cup does not begin until September in Japan.A tournament that was about the Big Four that is now down to two, Williamson and Root. A semi-final that was supposed to be a tale of the two threes, in which the quiet man from the Bay of Plenty overwhelmed the superstar from the land of many more.Virat Kohli cannot leave his house in Mumbai without armed guards. He cannot walk down the street without being mobbed. Williamson could turn up at Lord's in his tracksuit and still need to show ID to get past the stewards.It is Williamson who has gone further and had the greater influence. Across nine innings in this World Cup he is averaging a remarkable 91 with the bat. Kohli is back on 55, Joe Root 69, Steve Smith 38.Kohli has had the blistering support of Rohit Sharma and his five centuries. Three India batsmen ended with a higher average than their captain. Four Australia batsmen have a superior average to Smith. Root has been buttressed by Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and Jason Roy.Williamson is personally responsible for almost a third of his team's total runs. He has done that behind openers who have produced the lowest average stand for the first wicket of any team in the tournament.Martin Guptill was the top scorer at the last World Cup. Four years later he has five single-figure scores and a solitary 50. Williamson has shouldered that burden and strode on regardless.Three times he has been at the crease before the end of the first over. He has arrived in the second over, the third, fourth, sixth and ninth. Almost always he has prospered: the century against West Indies after both openers had gone for golden ducks; the endlessly patient 67 in the semi-final as wickets fell and runs dried up all around him.Kohli was expected to be the one heading to Lord's with his team on the brink. Kohli was supposed to steer India to what looked like a straightforward total at Old Trafford. This is a batsman who has produced 23 of his 38 one-day centuries in run-chases.His dismissal instead for just one had a lot to do with Trent Boult's inswinger and just as much with the fielding trap that his skipper had set. It means that in six innings in the knockout stages of three World Cups the Indian great has compiled just 73 runs at an average of 12.It has been easy to miss Williamson's parallel domination. His predecessor as national captain, Brendon McCullum, was all about attack, then some more attack. If that didn't work he attacked some more. It was cricket from some glorious liberated future and it inspired all England have wanted to be across the past four years.McCullum the batsman was all knockouts and hammer blows. Williamson gets there with jabs. Williamson wears you down in such undemonstrative fashion that you don't even realise you're cut until the referee waves it off.Across the tournament he has hit a grand total of three sixes. Rohit blasted 14, Aaron Finch 18, Eoin Morgan has hit 22. Against India he gently nudged his team to an underwhelming 28-1 after 10 overs, the slowest start of the entire tournament. At one point he went 13 overs without a boundary.It seemed like the most supine way to let a critical game slip away. He was there for 32 overs, his 67 taking 95 balls, with most observers in the ground agreeing this was powder-puff when power was required. This World Cup was going to be about innings as wrecking-balls not careful construction.Only as wickets tumbled in India's reply did the innings' true value become apparent. These curious pitches across the country have fooled plenty. Williamson has repeatedly judged them to perfection.We shouldn't be surprised. Williamson has been doing this for the best part of a decade. He averages 53 in Tests and 47 in one-dayers, scored a century on his Test debut and went past 3,000 Test runs at a younger age than Don Bradman.He also has reason to be grateful for the clause in the regulations that gave such weight to net run-rate, and so saw New Zealand qualify for the last four in front of the more dashing Pakistan. One 10-wicket win in their opening match had far greater significance than anyone realised at the time.But he deserves to be there, his captaincy following the same discreet pattern as his batting - and being just as significant.Kohli is the great showman in the field, Williamson the restrained manager. He has marshalled his limited resources and kept them calm through the most intense pressure.As a skipper he did everything right in those extraordinary first four overs as India lost three critical wickets. When the squeeze came on at the end and MS Dhoni and Ravi Jadeja looked like pulling off the great escape, he brought the right bowlers on at the most apposite time and kept the tourniquet tight with his field.Only 12 runs came from the 12 balls before Jadeja holed out. Dhoni had to wait until the 70th delivery he faced to find his second boundary. He was run out two balls later.And so to the closing miracle. When New Zealand reached their only previous World Cup final, Williamson was caught and bowled by Mitchell Johnson for 12 after McCullum had gone for a duck in the first over. That was almost the game gone.On Sunday Williamson will go again. Once more another team will be favourites.The quiet man is quite happy with it that way.
sport	England's World Cup win: 'My greatest day in cricket' - Michael Vaughan	'All the ingredients to be an incredible team'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceFormer England captain Michael Vaughan says Sunday's World Cup win against New Zealand at Lord's was ""the greatest day I have had in cricket"".England won their first World Cup by virtue of more boundaries after an incredible contest in which both the match and the super over were tied.Vaughan led England to victory in the memorable Ashes series of 2005.Asked about Sunday, he said: ""I was a nervous wreck because for us in this country we needed a World Cup win.""On Monday, the England team held a victory celebration at The Oval and then travelled across London to have a reception at 10 Downing Street with Prime Minister Theresa May.""Our heroes we have been watching for the last four years needed that reward, our sport needed it,"" Vaughan said on BBC Radio 5 live's Tuffers and Vaughan programme. ""I have never felt like that since I retired. It was so nerve wracking because you can't do anything.""We've all had great days in cricket - that's the greatest day I have ever had in cricket.""It's because I'm a bit older and wiser and I could see the players. They don't know what they have done yet, they don't know the impact they are going to have. In a few years the players are going to get stopped in the street and told by people, 'We only got into cricket because of you. My son or daughter started playing because of you.'""We get that still from 2005 and they are still the best moments - when people come up to you and say they only started playing because of '05.""Those lads yesterday, both teams - they were both tremendous - are going to get that for the rest of their lives. People will stop them in the street and say, 'Thank you for that day.'""There are diverse cultures in the England dressing room, it's a team everyone can relate to, they're a really good set of lads, they have coped with the pressure brilliantly. I don't think there has ever been a greater game of cricket and what they can do as a group is transform the way people look at cricket in this country.""A truly unbelievable finish at Lord's - only the fifth tie in 432 World Cup matches - saw England require 15 from the last over of the regular match. The drama intensified when a throw from the deep ricocheted off the bat of Ben Stokes as he dived for ground and was inadvertently deflected for four overthrows.Incredibly, both teams then scored 15 from their super over.""England have played this glorious flamboyant game for four years and on the ultimate pressure day they were asked to do something they don't necessarily want to do,"" Vaughan said.""To play in the old fashioned way, almost like saying, 'Can you do it on a Tuesday night at Burnley when it's raining?' Can you play smart and go against your natural grain of trying to whack it into the stand?""Jos Buttler calmed everything down, whenever he is out there I take a nice deep breath. When he got out I thought we'd lost the game, he reads the game better than anybody.""This England side have got such an opportunity. If they can stay level and really drive what they have done over the last four years and go again, they will have a team that's very competitive in four years and for the T20 World Cup next year.""We need to see this England side use the last six weeks and really get the Test team playing with consistency. They have got all the ingredients to be an incredible cricket team across Tests, 50 overs and T20.""I don't think there has ever been a better set of England players to sell the game and make sure all the kids are in their gardens trying to copy them."""
sport	Cricket World Cup: Australia thrash New Zealand at Lord's	Australia show versatility in victoryBoult hat-trick caps off fielding blockbusterReaction	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceAustralia threw New Zealand's bid to reach the World Cup semi-finals off course as they beat their old rivals by 86 runs.The Black Caps made a poor fist of chasing 244, bowled out for 157 after a Trent Boult hat-trick earlier restricted Australia to 243-9.Usman Khawaja (88) and Alex Carey (71) were the only batsmen to settle for the defending champions, adding 107 for the sixth wicket.But New Zealand struggled to build partnerships in reply as Australia strangled them with disciplined bowling, Mitchell Starc taking 5-26 to lift his wicket tally for the tournament to 24.In a repeat of the 2015 final, Australia emerged victors over their Trans-Tasman neighbours once again.But having already booked their semi-final place with victory against England on Tuesday, this win maintained momentum in their bid to retain the trophy.New Zealand's second defeat in a row after going unbeaten for the first six games of the tournament leaves them still uncertain of reaching the knockout stage.Their final group game comes against hosts England at Chester-le-Street on Wednesday, where both sides could need victory to reach the last four.Having been edged out by Pakistan last Wednesday by six wickets, this defeat may well have left a few mental and physical scars after an impressive display in the field seemed to put them on course for victory.David Warner headed off to hospital not long after the game to join his wife Candice, who is set to give birth to their third child either later tonight or overnight.For the first time since West Indies had them in disarray at Trent Bridge in their second game, Australia's top-order batting failed to fire.It left them, through some much-needed runs for number three Khawaja and another impressive effort by wicketkeeper Carey, to set New Zealand a modest 244 on a baking-hot June evening.But back at the scene of their impressive win over England and on the same pitch where their seam bowlers better-exploited the conditions, it was a real team effort in this victory.Captain Aaron Finch decided to use eight different bowlers, potentially to find out what alternative plans could be called upon in the semi-final.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBut left-armer Jason Behrendorff (2-31) helped set the tone with another fine spell that accounted for openers Martin Guptill and Henry Nicholls while Starc again proved too hot to handle.However, surprise appearances with the ball from both Finch himself and Steve Smith - bowling in an ODI for the first time since January 2016 - helped turn the screw.Smith's occasional leg-spin saw him dismiss big-hitting Colin De Grandhomme for a golden duck and effectively ended New Zealand's hopes.Earlier in the contest, it all seemed set up for a New Zealand victory after an eye-catching display in the field.Despite losing the toss and fielding first on the hottest day of the year, the Black Caps were straight into the much-vaunted Australia opening pair of Finch and Warner.The tournament's two leading run-scorers were back in the pavilion inside the first 10 overs for eight and 16 respectively, two dismissals which set up some show-stealing moments.Martin Guptill, who had earlier put down two tough chances when Finch and Khawaja were both on nought, clung on to arguably the catch of the World Cup so far.Media playback is not supported on this deviceNot for the first time Steve Smith was on the receiving end.He launched a full-bloodied pull shot off Lockie Ferguson, but Guptill clung on full stretch at short fine leg with a spectacular one-handed grab to bring the Lord's crowd to its feet.Not to be outdone, Jimmy Neesham joined the party by snaffling a superb caught and bowled low down to his left that accounted for the dangerous Glenn Maxwell for just one.But the man to steal the show would be Trent Boult.He took on the last over of the innings from the Nursery End and with it the wickets of Khawaja, Starc and Behrendorff with searing yorkers to complete the second ODI hat-trick of his career.Walking off with a very tidy 4-51 and with Australia restricted to 243-9, the Kiwis seemed set for the win they needed.But even that feat of fine left-arm bowling would later be upstaged by his opponents from across the Tasman.Australia captain Aaron Finch: ""I'm very happy, from 92-5 a great partnership from Alex Carey and Usman Khawaja to get us to a really competitive total on a wicket that we knew was really going to slow up and turn.""It was important that we tried to get some time in the middle, but not in the way that we did. It was a difficult surface to start on but I thought the way that Alex played, to strike the ball in the middle, was a really great innings.""Mitchell Starc got the chocolates today and Nathan Lyon was as good as you would see in those conditions.""On Smith's unlikely wicket-taking contribution: ""There was a bit of discussion - JL (coach Justin Langer), Punter (Ricky Ponting), myself, Smudge himself - he was confident, Brad Haddin as well. A lot of ideas go into planning meetings, it was nice one of them worked.""New Zealand captain Kane Williamson: ""Obviously it was a fairly challenging surface. We were able hit the wicket hard and put the ball in the right areas to get some rewards. It was a position of strength at the halfway stage of the first innings. A lot of credit goes to them for the way they rebuilt the innings and got to a competitive total.""It was a tough old surface. Australia adapted better than we did with the big lads who hit the wicket hard.""As we saw in the first innings, we needed one major partnership of 100 plus to soak up pressure and turn momentum. It wasn't to be today. We need to improve and we move on quickly.""Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc: ""We keep learning when we have to bowl second. But as a unit today, we were fantastic to keep such a good side to under 160.""It was a fantastic effort from everyone. The fantastic thing with all 15 of our squad is we've got guys ready to go if called upon.""Those picked today did a fantastic job and we're finding ways to scrap and restrict teams. I think we're improving with every game and we've executed really well over the past few games.""We probably had the rub of the conditions bowling second, but we knew we had to take wickets throughout against a powerful batting line-up."""
sport	West Indies batsman Nicholas Pooran banned for ball-tampering		"West Indies batsman Nicholas Pooran has been banned from his country's next four Twenty20 internationals after admitting to tampering with the ball.The 24-year-old was caught on camera using his thumb to scrape the ball and seam during the final match of the 3-0 one-day series win over Afghanistan.Pooran has since accepted the charge under the International Cricket Council's (ICC) code.The batsman will return to Yorkshire as an overseas player during 2020.Pooran has signed to play in the majority of next year's T20 Blast, having featured for the county in that competition in 2019.A statement from the ICC, cricket's world governing body, read: ""Pooran was charged with violating Article 2.14 of the code, which relates to 'changing the condition of the ball'.""He will now miss the next four T20I games for the West Indies and will have five demerit points added to his record."""
sport	Jonny Bairstow: England batsman sets tone in Cricket World Cup		"Media playback is not supported on this devicePanic over, for now. As one English sporting team exit at the semi-final stage of one World Cup, a second has fought its way into the last four of another.The knockout stages of this cricket World Cup do not technically begin until next week, yet England find themselves inadvertently ahead of the game.A win over India when defeat would have felt terminal, now a demolition of New Zealand by 119 runs in what was effectively a quarter-final.It is quite some turnaround on a week ago, a revival through adversity that mirrors that of their dominant batsman.Jonny Bairstow was out for a golden duck in the shock loss to Sri Lanka and holed out for a skittery 27 as defeat followed against Australia and England's much-vaunted campaign began to plummet at pace.In the past four days he has now made as many World Cup centuries as England managed in 16 years from 1987.It is characteristically Bairstow and it has come just in time. A week ago, the 29-year-old was railing against critics of his side, saying that people were waiting for them to fail so they could ""jump on their throats"". In response former England skipper Michael Vaughan called that a ""negative, pathetic mindset"".A row often works for the feisty Bairstow and it has worked for his team. England have won two tosses, batted first each time and won through aggression with the bat and parsimony with the ball.Where there was doubt there is fresh belief. The only jumping in the capacity crowd on Wednesday was up and down.At a warm, sun-smeared Riverside Bairstow played once again like a man jabbing his finger in your chest as his mates hold him back.In the first over he faced from Tim Southee he crashed one four through cover off the back foot and another over point with his front foot planted down the track.In Southee's next over he hit three boundaries in succession - a full one drilled through mid-wicket, a lofted drive over cover and a slashing pull off his chest.That was the muscle. Later he would finesse Colin de Grandhomme for two fours in the same over with the sort of delicate late cut that used to define an in-form Ian Bell.Together with Jason Roy, whose return from injury has brought its own liberation, Bairstow took what had begun as a nervy affair and turned it into raucous knees-up.England had 25 on the board after three overs and 48 by the end of the sixth. By the time Roy hit a tame catch to cover midway through the 19th, the two aggressors had stuck on 123 off 113 balls, and the plot lines were set.""He likes a bit of fire in his belly,"" Bairstow's captain Eoin Morgan had noted after his 111 against India on Sunday.Some batsmen at their best isolate themselves from the bedlam all around to play as if enjoying a net. Bairstow likes to bring the noise. Bairstow is bedlam.Adversity has always brought the best from him. He is the kid who was let go by Leeds United having played in the same youth team as Danny Rose and Fabian Delph for seven years only to forge an alternative sporting career.His first Test century took 36 innings to arrive. When he celebrated that landmark against South Africa he dwelt on the words of his critics and doubters and thought to himself, ""Right, you can stick that where the sun doesn't shine"".His 110 in the third Test against Sri Lanka last winter came after he had been left out of the side despite recovering from injury. He has been dropped six times from the Test team and yet will be an essential component in next month's Ashes.Even with his county Yorkshire he had scored 19 fifties before he got his first hundred.There is a theory from one former player close to Bairstow that as a young man, stricken by the suicide of his father David, he was occasionally given too much leeway by those around him, desperate as they were to help him through such an appalling time.If that sounds unduly harsh there is something about the adult that can still seem at odds with the world. He is often blunt and always honest. Sometimes he can be awkward.Not many other players would have thought it sensible to greet Australian batsman Cameron Bancroft with a headbutt before the last Ashes series down under.That incident left him feeling misunderstood but there was no room for confusion on Wednesday.His century came up off 95 balls with 14 fours and a six, on a ground with as distant a boundary on one side as the one at Edgbaston on Sunday had been short, and he celebrated with abandon: helmet off, arms outstretched, soaking up the cheers and the applause and retribution.At that point England were 194-1 with 20 overs still to come. They never quite kicked on after he played on, driving expansively, for 106 the over after his friend and Test captain Joe Root had been caught behind, but the damage had been done.This England team are more comfortable batting first. They like to pile on the runs and then wait for their opponents to wilt under the weight of them.Bairstow, and his alliance with brother-in-arms Roy, allows them to do that. When he scores big runs he wounds the opposition attack and sets free the batsmen who follow to play the same attacking game.England's middle order struggles to fire when it is exposed early and wickets are on the board. Its batting line-up is about bullying rather than patient accumulation.Bairstow sets the pace and sets the tone. On Wednesday he scored 46 runs more than Roy and 64 more than the next highest-scoring English batsman.England could afford to go 56 balls without a boundary in the later part of their innings because the walls had already been breached.Two wins on the spin, confidence beginning to flow. Even in the field England look a different team: Jos Buttler's one-handed diving take to dismiss Martin Guptill, compared to his fumbled stumping a week ago against Australia; Adil Rashid's one-handed pick-up-and-throw to run out Ross Taylor, when the ground fielding at Lord's had included fumbles and over-throws.A semi-final at Edgbaston against Australia or India awaits.It is England's first at a World Cup in 27 years. Long may the adversity last."
sport	England v Australia: Cricket World Cup hosts excited for semi-final	Morgan deflects Pietersen's bouncer criticismFinch expects 'parochial' atmosphereWorld Cup or Ashes?And finally... the weather forecast	"Captain Eoin Morgan believes his England side could not be better prepared for their World Cup semi-final against Australia at Edgbaston on Thursday.The hosts lost to Australia in the group stage, but reached their first semi since 1992 with wins against India and New Zealand.""The last two games we managed to produce something near our best performances,"" Morgan told BBC Sport.""That's extremely encouraging.""England began the World Cup as favourites and the number-one ranked team, but were on the verge of going out after being beaten by Australia at Lord's.To make it to the last four, they had to defeat both India and New Zealand, the two sides that contested the other semi-final.""We're delighted to be here,"" added Morgan, whose side are bidding to face New Zealand in Sunday's final at Lord's.""Throughout the group stage, it looked in question, but I don't think we could be better prepared. We're extremely excited and looking forward to it.""Looking back, it hasn't worked out badly at all.""While England have not won a World Cup knockout game for 27 years, Australia have won four of the past five tournaments.When they met at Lord's, England were outplayed to lose by 64 runs, but Morgan claimed his side are a different proposition now.""I don't think we can completely ignore it, we do have to learn a little bit about Australia,"" said the Dublin-born batsman. ""But, given it was three games ago, we look a different team.""During that game, Morgan was out hooking a bouncer from Australia pace bowler Mitchell Starc.At the time, former England batsman Kevin Pietersen tweeted that Morgan looked ""scared"".The following day, Pietersen again tweeted, saying: ""I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was showing his stumps because Starc attacks them. I may be wrong though? Or I may be right?When asked about Pietersen's comments, Morgan said: ""When Kevin Pietersen comes out with a comment, it's very similar to comments I address from Geoffrey Boycott.""They are not ones that are considered good for a team environment and don't take the best interests of the team or the player at heart. Guys are trying their heart out to do well for their country, trying to learn, trying to get better.""We have critics being critics. They need to do that, that's their job, so let them be.""Australia were top of the group for most of the round-robin phase and were set to play in the first semi-final at Old Trafford until they were beaten by South Africa on Saturday.They now must play at an Edgbaston ground where England have won 10 consecutive matches across all formats and where Australia have not won a one-day international since their famous 1999 World Cup semi-final against South Africa - and even that was tied.On the reception his side will receive, Australia captain Aaron Finch said: ""It's a great crowd to play in front of, regardless whether you are on the receiving end of some good banter.""It is always a great atmosphere and a pleasure to play here. I think although they can be quite parochial at times, it is always good fun, they sing some good tunes out there.""Australia have already confirmed that batsman Peter Handscomb, in the squad as a replacement for Shaun Marsh, will play his first game of the tournament.Matthew Wade has also replaced Usman Khawaja and could come into the side.England are likely to be unchanged, meaning Liam Plunkett continues as one of four frontline pace bowlers and off-spinner Moeen Ali misses out.There have been some concerns that Edgbaston may not be full given that it seemed likely that India were set to be in this semi-final, only for their fans to have to turn their attention to Old Trafford.The International Cricket Council have urged fans with unwanted tickets to resell them on their official site.As of Wednesday afternoon, there were still tickets available on the ICC website.England and Australia meet in the World Cup semi-final just three weeks before the first Ashes Test, which is also at Edgbaston on 1 August.But which would Australia prefer to win?Former Australia captain Steve Waugh told the Test Match Special podcast: ""I think if you asked the coach, Justin Langer, he would prefer the Ashes over the World Cup but having said that he would love to win the World Cup and so would all of the players as well.""I don't think it will be crucial [for the Ashes to win the World Cup]. They are totally different games but it doesn't hurt if you win the World Cup.""Confidence will be high in the camp. It is a long tour. It is important to keep winning on long tours so it is important for Australia to do well here.""BBC Weather's Billy Payne: ""It's now looking mostly cloudy through both the morning and afternoon with occasional light showers possible, but a few bright or sunny interludes may develop.""Highs of 22C (72F). Winds W to SW'ly at 10-12mph."""
sport	Mark Wood on Cricket World Cup, Durham and England v Australia	Jury out on my songwritingHome comfortsI want to make the country proud	First, some personal news.I've signed a new three-year contract with Durham, the county that first gave me a chance when I joined their academy at the age of 17.I'm passionate about the club and have a lot of pride when I play for them. I'm delighted to sign a new deal.It comes after our last World Cup group game, the win over New Zealand, was at my home ground in Chester-le-Street.Here, I'll tell you why that was one of the best days of my career, how my first club Ashington have been helping me prepare for the semi-finals, and what it will be like to face Australia at Edgbaston.One of the reasons I wanted to stay at Durham was because of occasions like the New Zealand game, which, apart from my Test debut, was the proudest I've ever been on a cricket field.To sing the national anthem on my home pitch, with my mam and dad, wife and so many friends watching was an incredible feeling.Not only that, but it was a beautiful, sunny day, the ground was packed and we put in a brilliant performance in what was effectively a quarter-final.Lots of people have talked about the run-out of Kane Williamson, where I stuck out a hand in my follow through and got a fingertip to the ball before it hit the non-striker's stumps.Kane doesn't know how unlucky he was to be out like that - because I have tiny hands. However, he's one of the best I've ever bowled to, so I'll take getting him out whatever way I can.After the game was won and we had secured our place in the last four, to walk off the field and be able to wave to everyone I knew was great.Then, after the match, everyone in the team was buzzing that we had played so well. Often, when we play at home, people will drift off after games because they are keen to get to their own beds, especially with a place like Durham being such a long drive for most of the lads.This time, everyone stayed behind for a drink at the hotel bar. It was lovely to be able to reflect on what we had done. With having more than a week between games, we were able to enjoy the moment, rather than have to start thinking about the next game really quickly.The other thing that came out of the New Zealand match was the Barmy Army singing the song I wrote about Liam Plunkett.If I'm honest, that song has had some mixed reviews, so the jury is still out on my skills as a songwriter.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSince the last game, I've made my debut on the Tailenders podcast with Jimmy Anderson, Greg James and Felix White.I don't think we talked about cricket once, but focused more on the songs that Jimmy and I came up with during the 2015 Ashes, when Trevor Bayliss asked us to write one for the team to sing. It was a fun show, and you can listen to it right here.With there being such a long gap between games, I needed a way to keep up my bowling rhythm, so I went to bowl some overs at Ashington, the club where I first played.Bizarrely, they had a free week on Saturday, so I asked the groundsman if I could bowl there, then went through my routine under the watch of Stevie Williams, who first coached me when I was eight years old.Stevie took me right through the juniors, then into the first team. He still says the same things and brings me back down to earth.There will be lots of people who play club cricket, wondering what it is like to become a professional and play for England.I can honestly say that I would still be playing for Ashington if I wasn't lucky enough to bowl fast.Yes, the quality is different, the pressure is higher and the scrutiny is more intense - but dressing rooms rarely change.Whether it's England, Durham or Ashington, the dynamic remains the same. Each team has its characters, bad jokes and banter.I like to think that I'm still one of the lads at Ashington, especially because a lot of my friends are still there.On Sunday, the second team had a cup semi-final at Jesmond & Newcastle - the 'posh club', as our lads call it. I went along to watch and loved seeing them get the win.That has been the cricket side of my life since the last game, but even in a World Cup there are still normal things to do - tidy the garden, visit the dentist, search B&Q for some new doors.On Saturday night, I went to a wedding of some friends of my wife. I didn't know loads of the guests there, but I still got plenty of support.People were wishing me luck and telling me to make sure we beat the Aussies. Even at a wedding, you can't switch off, but it's brilliant that so many are interested in what we are doing and wanting us to do well.And so to Edgbaston and a World Cup semi-final against Australia, which will be the biggest game of my career.The hosts against the old enemy; the defending champions against the team that started out as favourites.I've been asked if it's better that we're playing Australia rather than India, but I really didn't mind who we got in the last four.Regardless of the opponents, the whole team would have felt the same - up for it, a little bit nervous, desperate to do well.What is exciting is to be playing at Edgbaston, which has become a bit of a fortress for us. We managed to beat Australia in the Champions Trophy here a couple of years ago, so hopefully we can have the same result this time around.We're actually staying in the same hotel as the Australia team. You're always polite when you see the opposition around, especially because the various Twenty20 leagues around the world mean you get to know players.For example, there was a bit of back and forth between me and Shane Watson before the 2015 Ashes, but I've since played with him for Chennai in the Indian Premier League and found out that he is one of the nicest blokes.Similarly, David Warner once played for Durham. I was on the academy at the time, but I know that he was really well received.They are just normal guys.However, all of that gets left behind when we get to the ground. The pleasantries will be discarded and we will have to be ready for the Aussies to be in our faces.That's fine, because we know if we play our best cricket, we can beat anyone.We are two games away from winning the World Cup. Is that nerve-wracking? It's actually a greater feeling of excitement.I want to give it a good go and get stuck in. Not only that, but I want to make my family proud, the fans proud and the country proud.Mark Wood was speaking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.
sport	Mark Wood on Cricket World Cup, Liam Plunkett & Northumberland's beaches	Life's a beachTeam meeting spurs India winWriting songs for the Barmy Army	You can talk of pressure or nerves, but it's actually a great feeling knowing that a win against New Zealand on Wednesday on my home ground will put us into the World Cup semi-finals.Although it's a group game, it's effectively a quarter-final and if we allow ourselves to dream big, we are three games from lifting the trophy.It's a different feeling to a week ago, when I was pretty flat after we lost to Australia.Here, I'll tell you how I got over that loss, how a team meeting got us on track to beat India and why I've been writing a song for the Barmy Army.This England team has not been used to losing one-day matches, so to lose two back-to-back, against Sri Lanka and Australia, hurt.Throughout the World Cup, I've been keeping tabs on the rest of the teams. Watching a bit of a match, checking scores, seeing what's been happening.After we lost to Australia at Lord's, I did none of that. I didn't want to think about cricket.I often consider how the opposition have played. On that occasion, I had to give credit to Australia, because they bowled very, very well.We were a bit unlucky with the ball and later did a good job of pegging them back, but what they did was better. They deserved to win.In the few days that we had off, I came home to the north east. In general, I love getting outside into the countryside or, as I did on this occasion, going to the beach in Northumberland with my wife.Now, you could think that I should have been resting with my feet up, but she had me playing bat and ball.You know the type - the wooden bats that look like tennis racquets, where you have to keep the ball up because it dies if it hits the sand.The most we got up to was 50, which was a decent effort, but not even close to the 449 I managed with strength and conditioning coach Phil Scott in Barbados earlier this year.When we met up at Edgbaston before the India game, we had a squad meeting led by David Young, the team psychologist.The honest chat that we had got things back on track and felt like a weight had been lifted off our shoulders.We have spoken with each other like that in the past. We did something similar at a training camp in Wales at the beginning of the summer.We talk about expressing ourselves, enjoying each other's successes, being brave, playing smart cricket and always taking the positive option.I'm not saying we didn't do those things in the losses to Sri Lanka and Australia, but it was nice to revisit the values that have made us such a successful team.Not only that, but it's such a positive to be able to be open with each other. I'm not sure that every team has the benefit of such honesty.We broke off into small groups and talked about the way we were feeling about the World Cup, the ways that it is different and how it can make you feel nervous.It was good to hear that some of the senior, experienced players are going through the same things, because sometimes you can look at someone and think he is bulletproof or impervious to the emotions we all have.And that is the bottom line about this team; we're all good friends. There is no bluster, but a realism about who we are and what we are trying to achieve. We are all in the same situation of being desperate to win the World Cup for England.Refreshed, we went into the India game, which their fans made feel like stepping into the lion's den. They made so much noise, the atmosphere was like an IPL match.To come through that match, not only against a strong team, but such a partisan crowd, was a real positive for us. It will stand us in good stead if we play them again later in the tournament.However, we didn't celebrate any more than the previous games, because we know there are still big obstacles to overcome.After that game against India at Edgbaston, I noticed on Instagram that the Barmy Army weren't happy with their song for my mate Pudsey, Liam Plunkett.So, to the tune of Gina G's Ohh Ah, Just A Little Bit, I've written one for them. I tried to get Pudsey to sing it, but he was having none of it.Therefore, I'm on vocals and he's dancing in the background. Check it out...Media playback is not supported on this deviceNot only am I pleased with my songwriting, but I'm excited to be back at the home of cricket, Chester-le-Street, for the game against New Zealand.I'll be honest, it's a game I've had my eye on since the beginning of the tournament, albeit I had hoped we might have qualified by now.Both myself and Ben Stokes have been trying to get as many tickets as we can, because we've had so many requests. I think half of the town of Ashington are going to be there on Wednesday.I'll be excited and a little bit nervous, but I'll hopefully use that little bit of extra adrenaline to do well.For me, it doesn't get any better. To play for England in a must-win World Cup game in front of my wife, family and friends will be pretty special.Mark Wood was speaking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.

sport	Jimmy Neesham: New Zealand all-rounder on cricket, politics and cattle		"Eighteen months ago, Jimmy Neesham was trying to convince farmers to buy iPads.Today, he is preparing to play in a World Cup semi-final.And that is merely one part of the story of what might be cricket's most interesting man, who uses Twitter to air his views on President Trump and climate change, and has also sat a university exam during New Zealand's run to the last four.The all-rounder was good enough to make centuries in each of his first two Tests. In this World Cup, he has a score of 97 not out and a five-wicket haul to his name. When the Black Caps won the match of the tournament so far against West Indies, it was Neesham who held his nerve to take the final wicket.But around the Christmas of 2018, when he was out of both the New Zealand team and domestic side Otago, Neesham was, in his own words, ""fed up"" with cricket and looking for a proper job.""I suppose it becomes the only option when you don't want to play cricket any more, but you've got a mortgage,"" he explained.He took up a part-time post as a communications assistant with Halter, a company dealing in electronic collars for the remote herding of cows.""I know about 500 times more about cows than I did a year ago.""One of the things I really enjoyed about working was that how much you got out was pretty much equal to what you put in.""In cricket, if you hit 10,000 balls in a week and you go out on a Saturday and nick off first ball, you feel like all your efforts are going down the drain.""Neesham, though, is a self-confessed ""cricket tragic"". As the game seeped back into his consciousness, he came to the conclusion he would not be comfortable with giving it away.First with Otago, then Wellington, culminating with an international return, all with a fresh approach to the game.""I'd be amazed if 95% of international cricketers, if they were being honest, wouldn't say 'I've been fed up with cricket' at some point because it is a sport that is so steeped in failure day to day.""These days, I try to disconnect the effort I put in from the results I expect out. I turn up at training and do what I feel is appropriate and once I walk out on the field, I accept what comes my way.""Still, time in the real world has left its mark on Neesham, who is ""very slowly"" making his way through a communications degree. Even playing in a World Cup has not disrupted the studying and an exam had to be sat remotely, moderated by the New Zealand team manager.When he explains that the degree is being taken with half an eye on a post-cricket career as a TV or radio presenter, it's not hard to imagine the transition.Talking among each other, journalists will often ask if an interviewee is a 'good talker' or not. Does the conversation flow, or is getting a decent answer as difficult as the Brexit negotiations?Neesham is in the Premier League of talkers. Eloquent and verbose, he says he doesn't want to be pigeon-holed as someone who can only work in cricket. When Andrew Flintoff's transformation into a Top Gear presenter is mentioned, he clicks his fingers and says that would be ""right up my street"".His charisma is evident on his Twitter feed, a page full of jokes at the expense of himself and his team-mates, or sideways musing on everyday life.For example: ""Why is it called almond milk? It doesn't make sense. Call it what it is, nut juice.""He explained: ""A lot of people fear social media and see the trouble you can get into on it.""There are three options you have. One is not go on it at all, the second is put bland, generic statements out there and not pay attention to anything that goes on.""The third is to treat it like a massive joke. I've got no problem with anyone who chooses the first two options, but I have a little bit of fun with the third one.""But it's not all jokes from a man who says he still remembers where he was when he heard that Donald Trump had been elected.""I think it's important for role models to be informed about what goes on around us,"" he said. ""We've seen recently with Israel Folau how role models and social media can end up in a negative light.""There's an argument about whether sportsmen should be role models, but the reality is that we are.""So, as role models, it is important to keep abreast of what is going on and have at least a passing knowledge of global social issues like politics and climate change.""Still, Neesham is aware that a tendency to be outspoken can be at odds with an understated New Zealand team culture. He admits that it has ""occasionally"" got him into hot water.An unusual social media profile, an awareness of the world beyond cricket and studying for a future career sets Neesham aside from the majority of sportsmen. That sits just fine with him.""I'm really enjoying having cricket as a part of my life, but not 100% my life. It can be hard explaining that you're still 100% invested in succeeding in a World Cup, while also spending a bit of time studying in your room.""I'll train the way I've trained, prepare the way I prepare and try to fit in the best I can. If that takes us to winning the World Cup, that's fantastic. If it doesn't, I'll be disappointed, but life will go on.""But a passed exam and a winners' medal would be a fantastic double."""
sport	Pakistan beat Afghanistan in Cricket World Cup thriller at Headingley	The over that lost Afghanistan the match?Pakistan keep their nerveA glimpse of what might have been'We will be watching England tomorrow' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this devicePakistan survived a scare to beat Afghanistan by three wickets with two balls remaining in a thriller at Headingley that moves Sarfaraz Ahmed's side above England in the race for a World Cup semi-final spot.Chasing 228 for victory, Pakistan fell to 81-3 and 156-6 as Afghanistan turned the screw and, with 48 needed from 36 balls, it looked out of Pakistan's hands.However, a disastrous 46th over by Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib went for 18 runs to put Pakistan back in control.Despite Shadab Khan being run out with 22 runs needed for victory, Imad and Wahab Riaz held their nerve, with Wahab striking the first six of the innings to take the rate down to a run a ball.In an astonishing finish, Imad drove Gulbadin to the boundary to reach an unbeaten 49, tie up victory and move his side ahead of England in the table.It makes it more likely that England will need to beat both India on Sunday and New Zealand on Wednesday to reach the last four.Afghanistan, meanwhile, are still winless - and just as they did against India, they have come tantalisingly close to a stunning victory.With Pakistan needing 46 runs from 30 balls, Gulbadin brought himself back on to bowl to Imad Wasim - a decision which swung the momentum back to Pakistan.Before the over, Pakistan had been struggling; they were limited to singles, had hit just two fours in the previous 18 overs and the vociferous crowd had been silenced.However, such a costly over put things firmly back in Pakistan's favour.Wahab, batting with a broken finger, hit 15 from nine balls, with one four and one six, to settle any nerves after Shadab was needlessly run out going for a second.After that, the game was done.This had been, up until the final hour or two, a meandering game before it was sparked into life by the introduction of Mohammad Nabi.Pakistan lost Fakhar Zaman lbw to the second ball of their reply but Nabi claimed two wickets in two overs, having Imam-ul-Haq stumped as he charged him, before the in-form Babar Azam was bowled around his legs.Once Haris Sohail fell, caught going back into his crease against Rashid Khan, Pakistan's middle order was exposed.Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was run out while trying to make a second run that was never on offer, leaving Wasim, Shadab and Wahab to display the necessary calm heads.Wasim, though, was fortunate - he should have been out lbw early in his innings but the appeal off Rashid Khan was turned down and Afghanistan had used up their review.At 145-5, it might have proved terminal for Pakistan. As it was, they will take heart from the way they came through a tight situation - something their biggest semi-final rivals England have yet to do.Afghanistan were competitive against Pakistan, which has not always been the case during this World Cup.They have not had a settled side, have rarely performed with the bat, and their fielding has been poor.At Headingley, they tantalised, putting in their best batting performance and following it up with a good bowling performance that imploded in the 46th over.None of their batsmen were able to pass 42, however, as Pakistan's young left-arm quick Shaheen Afridi (4-47) once again impressed.Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed: ""Thank you all the fans, they cheered every ball. It is a great win for us on not an easy pitch.""We know it was not an easy target. Their bowlers used the conditions very well. Everyone chipped in, it was good team work.""We all know that it is not easy to win our last four games, we go match by match. We will all be watching India v England tomorrow.""Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib: ""We fought really well, the boys gave 100% but in the end we missed an opportunity to win the match. Credit to Pakistan, they controlled their nerves.""It was bad luck [when I went for 18 in an over]. Hamid Hassan was injured, it was very difficult for Pakistan to chase that total on a turning wicket. It was the turning point."""

sport	Cricket chiefs to meet MPs over TV rights, England's World Cup win and the Hundred		"Cricket chiefs are to be questioned by MPs on how they can capitalise on England's World Cup triumph.England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves and chief executive Tom Harrison will appear before the Digital, Culture Media and Sport Committee on 23 October.MPs plan to discuss how the triumph can boost participation in the sport, broadcasting rights and revenue.England's win over New Zealand was live on free-to-air television on Channel 4.The broadcaster agreed a deal with rights-holder Sky to show the match - England's first men's 50-over World Cup final since 1992.Live cricket has not been available on free-to-air TV in the UK since England's famous victory over Australia in the 2005 Ashes Test series.The committee will also ask about plans for the Hundred tournament.The new competition has been described by Harrison as ""a huge opportunity"" to bring cricket to a wider audience.It will take place over a five-week period from July 2020, with some matches televised live on the BBC.Purists have questioned the format, which has 100 balls per innings and a change of ends after 10 deliveries."
sport	Cricket World Cup final: 'Fire-breathing England can go all the way'		"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEnglish sporting semi-finals have not been happy experiences in the past 12 months. Too much heartbreak, too many what-ifs, too many next times.The only what-ifs at Edgbaston were what England might have scored had they batted their full 50 overs. The heartbreak was all Australian. The next time is a World Cup final at Lord's on Sunday.On Monday, Australia's players had taken their shoes and socks off and walked the outfield here. The idea was to feel the positive energy coming out of the earth. On Thursday England took their pants down for them too.Some of it came from England's outstanding opening bowlers, who produced a combined spell of 3-27 off their first 11 overs.Even more came from Jason Roy, smashing 85 off 65 balls to turn a run-chase into a run-romp, crashing Steve Smith for three consecutive sixes, the last somewhere into Solihull.It came fizzing back at Australia from the stands, because there are few places as fun to be as an England supporter than Edgbaston when Australia are in town.It had been 9,989 days since England last beat Australia in the World Cup, but it has also been 26 years since the dominant cricketing nation of that quarter-century have won at this ground.England come here and to Trent Bridge like a team transformed from the one that has routinely been rolled over at Lord's across the same period, to the one that was comprehensively beaten by Aaron Finch's men in north-west London just a fortnight ago.On Thursday morning, Australia won the toss. That was supposed to be half the battle in this tournament of faltering chases and slow pitches. David Warner then clattered the opening delivery from Chris Woakes through extra cover for four.As auguries go it was a giant raspberry. Almost nothing Australia did from that moment on went right. Almost everything England touched turned to gold.Australia's openers had produced 43% of their side's runs in the tournament to this point. The partnership of Finch and Warner has averaged 127 a match. Finch had four centuries in his previous nine innings against England.This was different. This was Edgbaston, this was England - the souped-up, fire-breathing, chest-beating England.Jofra Archer bowled full and fast to trap Finch lbw for a golden duck. Woakes produced pace and bounce to get Warner snagged in the slips.Media playback is not supported on this deviceA game that was to end with choruses of ""cricket's coming home"" had its course set. Even then few in the jubilant home support could have envisaged just how one-dimensional the plot would be.No fourth-act terrors, no jeopardy, no crisis for the hero to fight his way through. It was a summer blockbuster in which the evil nemesis turned out to be a pantomime dame. England fans first booed and then laughed.World Cup semi-finals are not supposed to be like this. For starters, Australia usually win them. Since England last reached the last four of the World Cup Australia have actually won the thing four times.They are also not meant to resemble Test cricket in their opening exchanges, but that is how Edgbaston felt under the high clouds: three slips in, a batsman left bleeding and in need of stitches after having his helmet knocked off by a fast bowler, a team limping to 27 off the first 10 overs.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe third Australia wicket went down with just 14 runs on the board, which, given Australia's record in this competition, was actually being used as a promising sign by some. The only time they had endured a worst start to a semi-final - slipping to 8-3 in Mohali in 1996 - they still went on to win.But this is not the Australia of then and this is not the same old England.The story of this team's rise to the world number one ranking has predominantly been one of blistering batting. When runs have come fast the team have bullied their opponents into submission.On Thursday the bowling was fast and it was unrelenting.Peter Handscomb had last batted against Gloucestershire second XI 12 days ago. It was nowhere near the sort of preparation he required to face Archer breezing in to deliver 90mph howitzers.His stumps had bolted long before he closed the gate between his bat and front pad against Woakes.It is not just about raw pace with Archer. He has now bowled 338 dot balls in the tournament, more than any other bowler. Together with Woakes he produced 45 scoreless deliveries from the first 60 bowled.There is artistry too: the knuckle-ball that foxed Glenn Maxwell into spooning a catch to Eoin Morgan at cover, a ruse so effective that the number seven was still blaming the pitch when he was halfway to the pavilion.Archer finished with 2-32 from 10 overs, a blend of parsimony and raw terror that was complemented first by Woakes' 3-20 off eight and then Adil Rashid's three wickets as Australia threatened a fightback that never came.A target of 224 might have been tricky to overhaul. No-one has been able to chase in this World Cup. Mitchell Starc had taken 22 of his 26 wickets bowling second.Instead the total went up in smoke and the party kicked upwards and on. Starc ended up being serenaded by the same song that had been used to torment another fast-bowling Mitchell Johnson. If that hadn't ended well for England, Roy and Jonny Bairstow turned the volume up and cut loose.Seldom was this slogging. It was a calculated assault that married risk to reward with supreme balance.When Nathan Lyon came on in the 11th over, the ball having turned appreciably for Rashid, Roy lofted his first ball over long-on for six. A single apiece, then a reverse-sweep for four.It was thrilling and sensible at the same time, and that was before Finch had gambled on spin at the other end from Smith.A single, a wide, a single, a deep breath. Six down the ground, six down the ground, six almost out of the ground.Media playback is not supported on this deviceRoy may have been deprived his century by a howler of an umpiring decision but England could not be stopped.When Morgan clattered the winning runs just after 17:00 BST his side were 114 runs ahead on Duckworth-Lewis. They had 107 balls to spare. That's almost an entire Twenty20 innings.As Morgan and Joe Root embraced in the middle, the galleries at Edgbaston serenaded them with half-cut abandon. A semi-final at last had been a staging post rather than the finish line.Sixteen days after England teetered on the brink of elimination, maybe - just maybe - there is more to come yet."
sport	England lose to Australia in Cricket World Cup at Lord's	England wilt in Lord's pressure cookerEngland fall shortAustralia getting it right again'They've won nothing' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland's World Cup hopes hang in the balance after a demoralising defeat by Australia at Lord's.The 64-run loss means they might need to win their last two games, beginning with India at Edgbaston on Sunday, in order to make the last four.Much will depend on the results of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, who can all overhaul Eoin Morgan's men.The hosts began the tournament as favourites, but now have little margin for error, with this loss following Friday's shock reverse to Sri Lanka to make a total of three defeats in seven games.They actually did well to restrict Australia to 285-7, especially after captain Aaron Finch's century helped his team to 173-1.However, that target was always going to be a challenge against the dangerous Australia attack in conditions ideally suited to pace bowling.So it proved. The heart was ripped out of England's top order and, at 53-4, their chase was in tatters.Just as he did against Sri Lanka, Ben Stokes played a virtually lone hand for 89, but after he was bowled by a searing Mitchell Starc yorker, England subsided to 221 all out.Now they face the prospect of having to beat at least one, maybe both, of India and New Zealand - two unbeaten sides and, in the case of India, the best team in the tournament.Media playback is not supported on this deviceA meeting between cricket's oldest rivals, on its grandest stage and with the World Cup jeopardy feeling very real, all contributed to a supercharged atmosphere.Indeed, almost a month after it started, this felt like the day the tournament really began.For England, overcome by the tension of it all, it may be one step closer to the end.Might they rue the decision to field first? Given the conditions, it was entirely understandable, but the suspicion remained Australia would be less comfortable chasing, in addition to the fact that England's two prior defeats had also come batting second.Yes, Chris Woakes had no luck with the new ball, but Jofra Archer and Mark Wood struggled with their length, even if both men played their part in England's admirable fightback.However, they were later given a lesson in the benefits of a full length by the Australians, who removed James Vince and Joe Root with swing and were gifted the wickets of Eoin Morgan and Jonny Bairstow, both caught on the pull.In the end, it was like England's 50-over dominance of the past four years had never happened, and usual service against Australia, whom they have not beaten in the World Cup since 1992, had resumed.All this comes in the run-up to an Ashes series that England are in danger of having extra time to prepare for.England can rightly say they could have taken more than one Australia wicket with the new ball - Woakes had Finch edge over second slip and narrowly escape being lbw on review, while Vince got his fingertips to a spectacular flying effort at point off Archer.But for every occasion England beat the bat, there were more that their lengths were poor, and they were punished by an opening stand of 123 between Finch and David Warner.England were visibly frustrated, their fielding scruffy, as when Jos Buttler missed the opportunity to stump Usman Khawaja off Adil Rashid.Gradually, they got it together, however. The bowling improvement was collective, the fielding showed greater intent. Wickets fell at regular intervals as Australia wasted their platform.Even then, a good start with the bat was needed, not Vince playing all around a Jason Behrendorff inswinger to the second ball of the innings.Root was trapped by Starc; Morgan, then Bairstow, holed out. Stokes and Buttler then added 71 before Khawaja produced a superb running catch on the boundary to remove the latter.Stokes was already battling an injury to his left leg by the time he heaved two sixes off the same Glenn Maxwell over, his stand of 53 with Woakes gradually restoring belief to Lord's.It was sucked away by an almost unplayable delivery from Starc and, as Stokes kicked his bat in frustration, the game was up.A year ago, in the wake of the sandpaper scandal, a chaotic Australia were hammered 5-0 in an ODI series in this country.Now, with Warner and Steve Smith restored, captain Finch and coach Justin Langer moulding the side and their fast bowlers firing, they are in hunt to retain their title and win a fifth World Cup in six.This win, their sixth from seven games, takes them to 12 points, top of the table and assured of a place in the semi-finals.Home captain Morgan said before the game that he would not discourage the crowd from booing Smith and Warner, and the Lord's crowd duly made their feelings known at every opportunity.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAustralia, though, were undeterred. First Finch played drives and pulls, as well as thumping the spinners over the leg side, to take his tournament run tally to 496, just four behind Warner, whose 53 made him the first man to 500.Their bowlers found swing rarely seen with a white ball and also induced England mistakes with clever use of the short ball.Pat Cummins was excellent, Behrendorff claimed 5-44, but the biggest danger was the loose-limbed Starc, whose 4-43 restored him to the position of the tournament's leading wicket-taker.It was all backed up by Finch's smart captaincy and some sharp fielding, especially when Maxwell brilliantly offloaded to Finch to have Woakes caught at cow corner.Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS: ""We've got to stop saying that this style of play has made England successful. They've played great cricket and got to number one in the world but they've won nothing.""India on Sunday might be a 250 wicket - can England get that target by playing a little bit smarter? It's about playing cricket to win the match. England have to do that. I don't care how they do it. They've got to win.""Australia captain Aaron Finch: ""You don't win the tournament if you don't reach the semis. That's the first bit ticked off.""England are a stand-out side; they are a team that can take you apart at stages. We found ways to keep getting wickets.""England captain Eoin Morgan: ""We're not feeling the pressure of being favourites. We are in charge of how we go from here on in.""We win two games, we definitely go through. It's a matter of producing that performance in one, if not both of those."""

sport	Cricket World Cup: England must not shy away from final - Eoin Morgan	'I'm still pinching myself'The day the nation stopped working	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland must not ""shy away"" from the World Cup final against New Zealand on Sunday, says captain Eoin Morgan.The hosts thrashed Australia by eight wickets at Edgbaston to secure their first final appearance since 1992.""It's a day to look forward to,"" said Morgan.""We've created the opportunity to play in a World Cup final and it will be a matter of trying to keep doing the same things - produce what we can in a performance, but also enjoy the day.""England swept aside the defending champions with a magnificent performance in Birmingham, reducing Australia to 14-3 through some brilliant new-ball bowling by Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer.Although Steve Smith's 85 took Australia to 223 all out, England galloped to their target, winning with almost 18 overs to spare after Jason Roy crunched 85 of his own.""Today was close to a perfect performance,"" Morgan told BBC Test Match Special. ""Right from the two bowlers up front - Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer bowled a hell of a spell.""They put pressure on with early wickets and allowed us to stay on the front foot.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland's group-stage defeat by Australia left them on the brink of going out, but they have since beaten India, New Zealand and produced their best performance against their oldest enemies in front of a raucous crowd.""We've got better and better as a group over the last three games,"" added batsman Morgan, who made 45 not out.""We knew we had to do that to be contenders. Today was a step further in the performance.""Everyone on the field and in the changing room loved every ball that was bowled. There was no lack of commitment, application. We had a bit of a day out.""It's cool when it happens like that, particularly when the bowlers bowl like that. It's awesome.""England's run to the final is part of a remarkable turnaround from the previous World Cup, when Morgan's men were dumped out in the group stages.""If you said to me we would reach the final after we had been knocked out of the 2015 World Cup I wouldn't have believed you,"" said Morgan.""It sums up how far we have come in the last four years. Everyone in the changing room - the squad, all of the coaches, the backroom staff - should take a huge amount of credit.""Joe Root, who finished 49 not out as he and Morgan took England to victory, said after the game that he was ""still pinching"" himself.""It's an amazing feeling - from the second ball of the day we put Australia under a lot of pressure,"" Root said.""That hundred partnership to start things off is irreplaceable. When those two boys play in that manner, it makes it very difficult for any side.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceArcher, who dismissed Australia captain Aaron Finch with his first ball of the day and finished with figures of 2-32 from 10 overs, said England were ""determined"" to perform after their defeat by""We didn't play half the level of our ability there and everyone wanted to put that behind us and do it better today,"" said Archer, whose 19 wickets in tournament is a record for an England bowler at a World Cup.""I think that's the first time I've ever got a wicket with my first ball. It just makes me feel like today was the day to do something special.""It's up there with one of the best days in my career, but then Sunday might be the best so I'll save it for then.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceMore than 500,000 people were following the game on the BBC Sport live page when Morgan hit the winning runs, with millions tuning in throughout the day.Thousands of you got in touch with us and a text from Ethan summed up what many England fans were thinking...The day was historic - England's first knockout win at a World Cup since 1992 - and certainly memorable for all England fans, even if less stressful than many expected...Ben Wire: Best day since 2005 and the Ashes!

sport	Ashes 2019: Australia's Steve Smith says he has found his love of cricket again after century		"Media playback is not supported on this deviceAustralia batsman Steve Smith says he has rediscovered his love for cricket after wondering if he would ever play again during a ban for his part in the ball-tampering scandal.Smith marked his return to Test cricket by scoring 144 on the opening day of the Ashes series at Edgbaston.""I'm really grateful to be in this position now, playing for Australia again and doing what I love,"" he said.""I want to play for Australia and make people proud.""Smith, then-captain of Australia, was banned from international cricket for a year for his part in a plot to rub sandpaper on the ball during the tour of South Africa in March 2018.During his time away, he had surgery on his elbow and revealed that was when he was at his lowest ebb.""There were times throughout the last 15 months where I didn't know if I was ever going to play cricket again,"" he explained.Media playback is not supported on this device""I lost a bit of love for it at one point, particularly when I had my elbow operation. It was really bizarre that it was the day I got the brace off my elbow, I found a love for it again.""I don't know what it was, it was like a trigger that just said 'right I'm ready to go again, I want to play'.""And, while Smith said the tampering incident in Cape Town was ""all in the past"", he was frequently reminded by the Edgbaston crowd, who booed throughout his innings, waved sandpaper and sang ""you're gonna cry in a minute"" - a reference to his tearful news conference in the wake of being banned and stripped of the captaincy.""It doesn't bother me,"" he said. ""I know I've got the support of the boys in the dressing room and, for me, that's all that really matters.""They went beserk on the balcony when I got to my hundred and just looking up at them, it sent shivers down my spine.""It's been a long time coming, getting another Test hundred, it was just a huge moment. I'm lost for words, I don't really know what to say.""Smith's innings was remarkable not just because of his personal circumstances, but for the way he dragged his team out of trouble.From 122-8, Smith added 88 with number 10 Peter Siddle and then another 74 with last man Nathan Lyon.Smith was on 85 when he was joined by Lyon but, after passing three figures, flayed the bowling to all parts to leave England with all nine fielders on the boundary.""Today we saw one of the great, great innings,"" said former England captain Michael Vaughan.""Where Steve Smith has come back from, after an emotional rollercoaster, for him to deliver this is incredible.""This one innings is winning Australia the Test match.""Media playback is not supported on this device"
sport	Pakistan beat South Africa in Cricket World Cup at Lord's	Babar and Haris propel PakistanProteas' fire fails to ignite'We're making the same mistakes over and over' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceSouth Africa were knocked out the World Cup as Pakistan inflicted a fifth defeat on the struggling Proteas to keep their own semi-final hopes alive.In the must-win meeting, the 1992 champions won by 49 runs to register just their second win from six games.Haris Sohail's entertaining 89 and 69 from Babar Azam saw Pakistan make 308-7 after they won the toss at Lord's.Despite 63 from captain Faf du Plessis, South Africa never got up with the required rate and finished on 259-9.Beaten semi-finalists in 2015, South Africa were ranked fourth coming into the tournament.But a wretched showing, with just a solitary victory against Afghanistan to date, means they now have just pride to play for in their remaining two games, against Sri Lanka on Friday and Australia on 6 July.Pakistan, meanwhile, who have flitted between impressive and woeful in their six games so far, can still make the semi-finals themselves after climbing two places to seventh.They may still need to win all three of their remaining games, starting against group leaders New Zealand at Edgbaston on Wednesday, and hope other results go their way.Top four go through to semi-finalsMedia playback is not supported on this deviceAfter Saturday's two World Cup games had served up a couple of last-over nail-biters there was hope a sell-out Lord's crowd would be treated to a similar story.Ultimately, however, they witnessed a fairly comfortable victory for a Pakistan team which could yet pip England to a semi-final place.Well supported by their vibrant fans, they set off like a train, their top order seemingly determined to put in a strong performance after the previous Sunday's heavy loss against fierce rivals India.Fakhar Zaman and Imam ul-Haq (both 44) put on an entertaining 81 for the first wicket.Fakhar, however, was handed a reprieve on 28 in a controversial moment that saw a catch at deep square leg claimed by Imran Tahir given not out.It was a decision that split the opinions of players, pundits and supporters inside the ground, but there was not enough definitive evidence for third umpire Chris Gaffaney to overturn the on-field umpire's assertion the ball had bounced into the 40-year-old's hands.Media playback is not supported on this deviceTahir (2-41) was to get a degree of revenge, though, claiming the wickets of both openers, including Imam with a brilliant one-handed low catch off his own bowling.Tahir was the only threat as a largely blunt South Africa bowling attack was unable to remove Pakistan's middle order after that, allowing Sarfaraz Ahmed's side licence to go big in the latter stages.Their last 10 overs saw 90 runs added as they raced from 218-3 to 308-7.Haris was the chief tormentor, hitting nine fours and three sixes in his 59-ball 89 as he shared quickfire partnerships of 81 from 70 balls with Babar and 71 off 40 with Imad Wasim.South Africa's already difficult task became even more problematic just seven balls into their run chase.Mohammad Amir's first ball from the Pavilion End cut back enough down the famous slope to trap Hashim Amla on the front pad, a not out decision being overturned on review.Opening partner Quinton de Kock had already survived falling for a first-ball duck when Wahab spilled a chance at mid-on off Hafeez.For a while, the wicketkeeper looked like he would make Pakistan pay as he and skipper Du Plessis laid a platform with a second-wicket stand of 87.But just as Tahir's low catch at deep square leg had gone against them earlier in the game, there was to be no reprieve for De Kock when Imam took a two-handed grab off Shadab Khan, also at deep square leg.De Kock's failure to produce a match-winning innings was replicated by Du Plessis.His failure to find a consistent run-scoring tempo, despite registering his highest score of the tournament so far, came to an end when he presented a simple catch to Sarfaraz off a mistimed pull shot.With just over 20 overs to go, it left his side still needing 173 at almost nine an over.When they needed a lead actor to steal the show, all they got were cameo roles.Rassie van der Dussen (36) and David Miller (31) both cleared the ropes but Amir (2-49) and Wahab (3-46) ensured South Africa fell well short.South Africa captain Faf du Plessis: ""It was frustrating, I feel we keep making the same mistakes over and over again.""It started with the bowling today. It was a below-par performance and 30 runs too many to concede.""It was the same thing with the bat with some good starts and then people losing their wickets at crucial stages and being able to build partnerships.""I feel like I'm saying the same thing over and over and it's frustrating.""Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed: ""We made some changes today for the good of the team. Haris Sohail came in, he was hungry to play in the match and the way he batted was a turning point. You see Jos Buttler play that type of innings so the way he played was fantastic.""We have to work hard on our fielding, we dropped so many chances today. So we have to work hard on that because all our matches are very crucial.""It was a complete bowling effort, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir, Shaheen Afridi all did their bit. That is what has been missing in previous matches."""

sport	Afghanistan beaten by Australia in Cricket World Cup	Warner and Smith return to competitive actionA bowling conundrum for Australia?Afghanistan show promise but naivety with bat'Warner played incredibly well' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceDavid Warner led holders Australia to a routine seven-wicket win against Afghanistan with an unbeaten 89 at the start of their World Cup defence.Chasing a below-par 208, Warner steered his side to victory with 91 balls to spare after captain Aaron Finch helped set the tone with 66 off 49.Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa took three wickets apiece as Afghanistan were bowled out for just 207.Najibullah Zadran (51) impressed, however, with some powerful strokeplay.Australia, who came into this tournament in resurgent form with overseas series victories against India and Pakistan, have now won nine one-day internationals in a row.The last time that happened was during their victorious 2015 World Cup campaign; a run which began with a 275-run win against Afghanistan.The five-time World Cup winners will take that form into their next game against West Indies on Thursday at Trent Bridge, while Afghanistan take on Sri Lanka in Cardiff on Tuesday.Afghanistan, winners of last year's qualifier and in just their second World Cup appearance, were roared on by enthusiastic and colourful support all around the ground with many neutrals also siding with the relative minnows.But any hopes of an upset were dashed by a stuttering display with the bat before some sloppy fielding and erratic bowling.Another sub-plot was the long-awaited returns to competitive Australia action for Warner and Steve Smith - the pair having served their respective bans for their roles in the sandpaper scandal of March 2018.Smith received a hostile reception from the crowd during his century against England in the World Cup warm-up match in Southampton last Saturday and that theme continued, if less pointedly, when he came out to bat alongside Warner in the closing stages.Two rather inventive spectators did catch the eye in the crowd with full-body suits fashioned to look like pieces of sandpaper.Coach Justin Langer's call before the game for crowds to show the pair ""respect"" during this summer does not appear to have registered quite yet.Smith played his part in the field initially; taking a smart catch at cover to dismiss Rahmat Shah off Zampa and manufacturing the run out of Mohammad Nabi.He fell just before the conclusion for a sedate 18 off 27 balls and the tempo of that innings was largely matched by Warner.The left-handed opener made somewhat serene progress as Australia were always in command of the run-chase and was happy to play second fiddle to Finch's power hitting in an opening partnership worth 96.While the batting looked to be firing for the holders, there would have been some things for captain Finch and coach Langer to mull over in terms of the balance of their bowling attack.While leg-spinner Zampa's 3-60 off eight overs may look good on paper, it was littered with some loose and erratic deliveries.He went for 22 in one over while all-rounder Marcus Stoinis also came in for some punishment, conceding 21 to Rashid's long-range hitting.The frontline seamers of Starc, Cummins and Nathan Coulter-Nile were more potent as they chose to bowl short more often than not - potentially taking inspiration from some of the dominant spells of fast bowling seen already in this tournament.But the absence of spinner Nathan Lyon from their line-up, as well as Finch opting not to use Glenn Maxwell's off-spin, drew some bemusement from members of the Australian media.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThere was a bit of surprise around the ground when Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib won the toss and elected to bat first on what appeared to be another bowler-friendly wicket with plenty of live grass on top.He may have been regretting that call as soon as three balls in when Mitchell Starc knocked back Mohammad Shahzad's off stump with a searing yorker before a run was on the board.It got worse five balls later when Pat Cummins dismissed big-hitting opener Hazratullah Zazai, also without scoring - caught behind by Alex Carey to leave Afghanistan 5-2.By 20 overs, they were in deep trouble at 77-5.But there were a number of promising partnerships that showed glimpses of what power their batting may produce in this tournament.Rahmat Shah struck six fours in his 43 off 60 balls and then the exciting talent of Najibullah added 83 for the sixth wicket in 77 balls with Gulbadin (31).Najibullah's half-century came off just 46 balls, with seven fours and two sixes, before Rashid Khan took up the mantle at number eight with two fours and three sixes in his 27.But those cameos were all too frequent and missing one anchoring innings that may have pushed them closer to a score in the region of 250.Australia captain Aaron Finch: ""There was a bit of nerves - we've been training for so long, we were probably ready to go three or four days ago.""It was a very important innings for David (Warner). He was struggling with his timing early on but he kept hanging in there. That was great for him to kick on and do really well for us.""On whether net run rate was a consideration: ""I think when you get into a winning position then you think about that, but it's important you don't look too far ahead. They have some very good spinners so if you don't take that into consideration you are playing with fire.""Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib: ""Playing against this kind of team we can learn lessons. They don't give you any chance to recover from your mistakes.""I have a lot of respect for Warner and Smith and we can't do anything about the crowd's reaction to them. Warner played incredibly well to ignore that and play as well as he did.""If we have the sort of audience that we do backing us in the stands, we take a lot of positive things from that.""There were a huge numbers of Afghans in the crowd that give us great energy out in the middle plus many of the neutrals seemed to be behind us too."""

sport	Cricket World Cup: What to do about the rain?	Build a roofCover the whole playing surface in a sheetReserve daysJust play in the rainDon't hold the World Cup in England & WalesReader suggestionsBut in the end, is it all down to luck? - analysisAnd what about the next week?	"It has been a very wet week in the Cricket World Cup.India's match against New Zealand at Trent Bridge on Thursday was the fourth match of the tournament to be abandoned so far, and the third to be called off without a ball being bowled.This has already surpassed the previous highest number of washed-out matches in a World Cup - two in 1992 and 2003.Frustrated fans and bemused onlookers have been offering up solutions - but how feasible are they?A common request, especially in light of Wimbledon adding a retractable roof to Court One in addition to the one over Centre Court in time for this year's Championships.But putting a roof over a cricket ground would be much more complex and costly - tennis stadiums are smaller and most are level, whereas cricket grounds in England and Wales have different-sized stands.It cost an estimated £100m and £70m to build the respective roofs at Wimbledon, which crucially is also the sole location for that entire tournament.It is unfeasibly expensive to build roofs at the 11 cricket grounds hosting a World Cup fixture, even before adding in the cost of first adapting the grounds into a shape that would hold a roof.If you watched England's tour of Sri Lanka last autumn you will have seen the host groundstaff sprinting to cover the entire outfield in a massive tarpaulin whenever it started to rain.This has the advantage of preventing wet patches forming on the outfield and means it should be quicker to resume play when the rain stops - India against New Zealand never got under way, in part because of muddy areas that did not dry.It also could prevent a match starting late because of rain on previous days. So why not invest in some big sheets?As Cricinfo points out, this system needs a lot of groundstaff to be successful and grounds over here may not be able to afford employing the amount of people required.Such a covering has also been used in the UK before - Edgbaston had the 'Brumbrella' from 1981 to 2001, but it was banned after the ECB found flat covers encouraged 'sweating', making the pitches damper and therefore much more difficult to bat on.Reserve days were used the last time England hosted the World Cup in 1999, but there are none during the group stage this time round, only for the semi-finals and final.""We put men on the moon so why can't we have a reserve day?"" asked Bangladesh coach Steve Rhodes after his side's match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday was abandoned.ICC chief executive David Richardson responded by saying reserve days ""would be extremely complex to deliver"" and increase the length of an already long tournament.Unfortunately this is always going to be a no-go.The rain drastically alters the playing conditions and would give sides an unfair advantage or disadvantage.The ball becomes almost impossible for bowlers to grip and it is dangerous to field on a slippery outfield.You do know it rains in other countries, right?We asked you for your ideas on how to settle abandoned matches instead of no result. Here are the serious...Phil Smith: Why not have two pre-planned reserve days, and fit washed-out games into that time with reduced overs if necessary?Alex Hall: Penalty shootout style bowl-off to decide rained off games - you score if you hit the stumps, best of five (select five bowlers) then sudden death! All XI players must take part.Lucas Abbott: Why not have a 'Super Over Day' (one innings per side) at the end of the group stages? Any abandoned matches can all be settled on the same day and it would be a bit of quickfire entertainment....and the not so serious...Mlgraham73: The classic cricket dice game Howzat? would be a great way to settle matches and make good radio. ""Cottrell now from the radiator end, he's up to the table, he rolls..."" etc.Scott Cameron: Pretty simple really - Brian Lara Cricket '98.Barb: How about a dance-off? My rated teams: NZ with (of course) the Haka. Windies and India close contenders. England need to start practising their Agadoo!Chris Edwards: A fellow teacher once settled a rain-cancelled school cup fixture with the toss of a coin. He called and lost, which was no surprise as it took place over the phone.Simon King, BBC Weather, speaking on Test Match Special podcast on WednesdayDavid Richardson mentioned the 100mm rainfall we had earlier in the week and how unseasonable it was.He's right in that 100mm rain in 48 hours is unseasonable, but that was only affecting very small areas in the south east of England and Lincolnshire.Actually, in Bristol and Southampton where the matches were, the weather wasn't unseasonable for June. It was fairly typical really. We just had some rain.Last year he mentioned we had 2mm and it was warm and sunny, but that was unseasonable. It was a very, very dry month.It's all down to luck. If you had Monday's game in Bristol and Tuesday's game in Southampton, you'd have had a result.It's just bad luck, but it's been fairly typical June weather.You can get a full, more detailed and up-to-date weather forecast here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather"
sport	Pakistan's Cricket World Cup revival has uncanny echoes of 1992 triumph		"""Fight like cornered tigers, because nothing is more dangerous than a cornered tiger.""Imran Khan, now the prime minister of Pakistan but then the captain of their cricket team, used that image to inspire his players to go on and win the 1992 World Cup in Australia, one of sport's greatest underdog success stories.Now, 27 years later, the same mantra is being applied to another improbable Pakistan charge towards World Cup glory.Halfway through the group stage of the current competition, Pakistan were ninth and had suffered a heavy defeat by their neighbours India.Four matches later, they have the momentum, are occupying a semi-final spot in the table at the expense of hosts England and, once again, are on the cusp of something quite remarkable.Saturday's last-over victory against Afghanistan - a thriller that had no right to be as close as it was - was pure theatre; true backs-against-the-wall cricket, a win that will give Pakistan even more belief than they already had.Are we set for 1992: the 2019 remix?Yes, the 1992 tournament had nine teams, and this one has 10. But go with me here.Pakistan's first eight results in the 1992 tournament went as follows: lost, won, washout, lost, lost, won, won, won. They then qualified for the semis, where they beat New Zealand, and in final they beat England.In this year's tournament, Pakistan's eight results have been: lost, won, washout, lost, lost, won, won, won.In 1992, Pakistan's opening match was against West Indies, which they lost. In 2019, their opening match was against West Indies - which, you guessed it, they lost.It could just be that Pakistan are slow starters. In the Champions Trophy in England two years ago, they lost their first match to India by a whopping 127 runs.Fourteen days later, they were crowned champions after beating India in a superb final at The Oval.This might just be what Pakistan do.England fans are eternal pessimists. When things get tense - as they are now, with the hosts probably needing to win their next two matches to leapfrog Pakistan - the fans assume the worse.With Pakistan, it is almost as though their fans expect them to get into a tight situation, and get themselves out of it.On the walk to Headingley on Saturday morning, there were thousands of fans draped in Pakistan flags. One had a handmade sign: 'Never ever write off Pakistan. I am Pakistan and I will rise again. We have and we will.'So many fans were wearing 1992 replica shirts, as though some of that magic would find its way into this match. Banners and flags bearing the image of a tiger were being waved by supporters of all ages. The words Imran used to rally his team all those years ago are being heard again.As Ramiz Raja, a member of that winning side, said: ""It's like 1992 in the sense we're finding new heroes too. In that tournament, it was Wasim Akram; now it's the likes of Babar Azam and Shaheen Afridi.""It's all looking in good shape. They have the combination of that spirit, talent and the fans behind them. They have to just express themselves.""And they have. Shaheen has been a revelation against New Zealand and Afghanistan, while Babar scored a stunning century at Edgbaston when Pakistan could have faltered.Media playback is not supported on this devicePakistan have stumbled across their World Cup XI, rather than honed it through years of planning. Mohammad Amir did not feature at all in the one-day series in the build-up to the World Cup; he was not even named in the original 15-man squad. Shoaib Malik was taking up a place in the team despite struggling for runs. Wahab Riaz was not added to the squad until late on.In Amir, they have one of the leading wicket-takers in this World Cup. Wahab bowls fiery spells that highlights reels love and, against Afghanistan, provided some late impetus that got them over the line. And once they replaced Malik with Haris Sohail, they shored up a middle order that had looked fragile.They even have a 2019 Inzamam. In 1992, Inzamam-ul-Haq was a young up and comer; now, he is chief selector and his nephew opens the batting.The players and staff themselves are neither ignoring nor embracing the similarities - bowling coach Azhar Mahmood insists that ""every match is a final"" for his side - but for the fans, for those who sit in rapt attention watching the game and live every moment, the spirit of 1992 is alive and well."

One really poor game and you're really battling to recover.""I'd like it to be number of wins and then head-to-head and then net run-rate in the future that determines places when points are level.""Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed: ""Unfortunately we played very good cricket in the last four matches but we have not qualified.""Only the one match will cost us in the whole tournament (the heavy defeat by West Indies). We played very good cricket. The way we responded after India, we played very well in all three - batting, fielding and bowling.""The way Shaheen is bowling is very good. Today it was one of the best bowling performances I have seen in a long time.""Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza: ""The whole team is disappointed, but on the other hand with the way we've played, we could've finished higher in the table.""A few things have been very good, but others have not been very good. Little things in games do make a huge difference.""On Shakib Al Hasan's performances in the World Cup: ""He has been absolutely brilliant in this tournament and I feel sorry for him that the team have not been able to back up those performances.""I think he has put in one of the best performances in the history of this World Cup and hopefully next time the boys will step up with him."""

When guys present the seam as well as Woakes and Archer do you expect the ball to move off the seam.""We lost a couple early and had to rebuild for a while and just when we were building towards that 35-40 over mark we lost a couple of key wickets at the wrong time.""Media playback is not supported on this devicePrior to this match, 64% of the games in the tournament had been won by the side batting first but England openers Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow ensured it was not a nervous chase with a tremendous partnership of 124 off just 104 balls.""On a ground like this against such an aggressive side you have to take wickets,"" said Finch.""We looked to do that and when you're aggressive with the ball and they're aggressive with the bat it can go one of two ways pretty quick.""Finch added he was pleased with his side's one-day resurgence, having been whitewashed 5-0 by hosts England in an ODI series last year.""Over the last six months or so we've come a long way from where we were when people were writing us off, so I'm really proud but disappointed at the same time,"" he said.BBC Test Match Special commentator Jim MaxwellEngland exposed Australia's weakness in the middle order, which has been there all tournament.Looking to the Ashes, Australia can go gung-ho with their pace attack and play Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson, but if they don't get it right on these grounds they will go around the park.Australia may need to look at bowlers like Peter Siddle to hold the game up.If Jason Roy plays in the Test series - I'm sure they'll pick him - and gets a start, look out folks!

sport	England suffer shock Cricket World Cup defeat against Sri Lanka	Headingley tension revives World CupStokes left strandedMathews crawls Sri Lanka to victory'If we had won, we would have been robbing Sri Lanka' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland were strangled into a shock 20-run defeat by Sri Lanka that dented their hopes of reaching the World Cup semi-finals and breathed life into the tournament.Chasing 233 on an increasingly difficult pitch, the hosts were smothered by a brilliant Sri Lanka bowling performance in a compelling contest at Headingley.When Ben Stokes was joined by last man Mark Wood, England still needed 47, but Stokes clubbed 23 from eight deliveries to make a deafening crowd believe.Wood, though, edged Nuwan Pradeep behind to leave Stokes stranded on 82 not out and England 212 all out.They had earlier restricted Sri Lanka to 232-9, with Angelo Mathews' painstaking 85 proving to be a match-winning innings.England stay third in the 10-team table, but their three most difficult group games - against Australia, India and New Zealand - are still to come.Sri Lanka climb to fifth, only two points behind England, their unlikely hopes of reaching the semi-finals still alive.Top four go through to semi-finalsMedia playback is not supported on this deviceBefore this match, there was the danger England, Australia, India and New Zealand would pull away to leave the elongated group stage nothing more than a procession towards the semi-finals.On a sun-kissed day at Headingley, amid unbearable tension in front of a crowd fully invested in the action, Sri Lanka produced a display full of fight and spirit.In doing so, they delighted their noisy pockets of fans that included a brass band that played non-stop, as well as injecting much-needed intrigue into the tournament.At the same time, they have raised questions about an England side that hit a world record 25 sixes in demolishing Afghanistan at Old Trafford on Tuesday, but that failed to adapt to the difficult batting conditions in Leeds.Some, like James Vince and Moeen Ali, fell in infuriating fashion, while Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler were fooled into playing across the slingy Lasith Malinga, who claimed 4-43.Just like when their fielding cost them against Pakistan, England helped engineer their own downfall and, as it stands, will have to find at least one win from their remaining games if they are to make the last four.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAlthough England were finding run-scoring tough against the probing Sri Lankan bowling, there was no panic while Joe Root was moving towards 57 in the company of Stokes.When Sri Lanka called for a review that revealed Root was caught down the leg side off Malinga, England unravelled.After Buttler was pinned, Moeen, playing his 100th ODI, brainlessly looked for his second successive six off Dhananjaya de Silva and was caught at long-off.In his next over, the spinner had both Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid caught behind, while Jofra Archer holed out to long-off in a collapse of 4-16.Through it all, Stokes remained, unflappable, but now having to farm the strike with only Wood for company.He was dropped in the deep on 57, then launched back-to-back sixes to draw noise that rocked Headingley to its foundations.However, he left Wood to face the final ball of Pradeep's 10-over spell. The number 11's poke nestled in the gloves of the wicketkeeper, and England were beaten.While England were putting in an excellent display with the ball and in the field, Mathews crawled along, looking entirely like a batsman whose previous highest score in this tournament was just nine.Only late on did he show any intent, but by that time he was rapidly running out of partners.When Sri Lanka were 3-2 after winning the toss, the day could have been short, only for Avishka Fernando to sparkle for 49, including two sixes pulled off Archer.After he uppercut Wood to third man, England spinners Moeen and Rashid bowled in tandem to suffocate Sri Lanka.It was Rashid, looking back to near his best, who had Kusal Mendis well held by Eoin Morgan at mid-wicket and then, next ball, Jeevan Mendis caught and bowled.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWood and Archer worked through the lower order, with Wood particularly impressive - his yorker to bowl Malinga was clocked at 93mph.All the while, Mathews plodded on. At no point was he interested in playing the modern, ultra-aggressive one-day game, but he had the application to battle with both himself and the England bowlers.Ultimately, he ground Sri Lanka to a memorable victory.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland captain Eoin Morgan: ""In the chase we didn't do the basics of getting substantial partnerships going.""We had a couple of good individual performances but Sri Lanka thoroughly deserved to win.""We didn't do enough to win the game and even if we had nicked it then it would have been us robbing the game with an outstanding individual performance.""Former England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on Test Match Special: ""England will know their performance today hasn't been good enough to win the game and it is a game they should be winning.""(Head coach) Trevor Bayliss talks lot about smart cricket and at times they did not play smart cricket.""They don't make excuses. Eoin Morgan will call it as he sees it. There won't be any shouting or finger pointing but there will be some quiet conversations with some players about their modes of dismissals.""Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne: ""It was a close one, we were under pressure but it was teamwork in the end - all the batters and bowlers did great work.""We thought this wicket looked like a 300 pitch but it was slower than we thought. We knew we couldn't get 300, so wanted 250-275 until we lost some wickets but Angelo Mathews batted really well.""With a score on the board the bowlers knew what to do on this wicket.""The Root wicket was the turning point. We were not confident but thought we would go for the review and thankfully for us that was the turning point."""
sport	Cricket World Cup: Kohli, Shakib and Rihanna - best of the group stage	Best matchBest playerBest inningsBest shotBest catchBest deliveryBiggest disappointmentBiggest villainBiggest mysteryBiggest surpriseBest moment	"When the World Cup began, Liverpool had not yet been crowned champions of Europe, Rory Stewart still had a chance of being the next prime minister and the Love Island villa was not yet full of potential couples.Now, after 45 games over 38 days, the 10 teams have been whittled down to four semi-finalists.While England have been riding their own rollercoaster, the rest of the World Cup has seen immovable bails, a skirmish in a curry house, plenty of rain and a pop princess.But who have been the winners and losers?In a World Cup not blessed with tight finishes, New Zealand and West Indies served up a barely believable thriller on 22 June - one that was still undecided when Carlos Brathwaite sent the ball into the Old Trafford night.Chasing 292, the Windies were all but beaten at 245-9, only for Brathwaite to begin a furious assault in the company of last man Oshane Thomas.A century to his name and with six needed to win, Brathwaite bet the house. Launching the bowling of Jimmy Neesham towards long-on, the ball, and the match, hung up in the air. Six or out? Win or lose?Trent Boult, tip-toeing round the boundary, clung on. Brathwaite sunk to his knees. New Zealand had won an incredible game.Nods must go to Mitchell Starc, leading wicket-taker four years ago and on course for the same again, and Rohit Sharma, with his five centuries.But for all-round excellence, Starc is pipped by Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan, who almost single-handedly kept an unlikely semi-final bid alive to their penultimate game.Shakib's total of 606 runs is bettered only by India's Rohit and Australia's David Warner, and he has also added 11 wickets with his left-arm spin.A megastar in Bangladesh, but far from a household name elsewhere, he would stroll into any other team.Do you prefer a classical concerto or heavy metal? There is no right or wrong answer; they both have their place.If it's the former, then stylish, composed centuries made by Babar Azam and Kane Williamson at Edgbaston are for you. Babar kept Pakistan's World Cup alive with victory over New Zealand on 26 June, seven days after Black Caps skipper Williamson got his team home in a nipper against South Africa.At the opposite end of the batting scale, Eoin Morgan's 17 sixes on a riotous afternoon at Old Trafford was part of an England total of 25 maximums against Afghanistan on 18 June. Both are one-day international records.In a World Cup where batting has been more difficult than anticipated, Morgan's superb ball-striking had fielders straining their necks and spectators ducking for cover.Players such as Williamson prove that one-day cricket does not always have to be crash, bang or wallop. There is room for piano players alongside the piano movers.In his aforementioned hundred against South Africa, Williamson's New Zealand needed 12 to win from seven balls.At that point, the temptation would have been to swing for the fences. Not for Williamson, who showed the touch of a surgeon to play the most delicate open-faced run to third man for four. It was breathtaking not only for its brilliance, but for having the thought and nerve to play it in the first place.Sure, the swept six in the next over made the match safe, but plenty can swipe the balls into the stands. Williamson is an artist.There are plenty of contenders for this one.Steve Smith and Martin Guptill have taken fine reaction grabs, Chris Woakes has been having a contest all of his own with an array of diving efforts on the boundary, while West Indies' Sheldon Cottrell's throw-up-and-catch, over-the-boundary-and-back show against England was probably the most difficult of the lot.But it is not all about difficulty. It's about the moment, and Ben Stokes provided one of the moments of this or any World Cup.In the very first game on 30 May, with the hosts wanting to start with a bang, Stokes' spectacular backwards tumble to hold South Africa's Andile Phehlukwayo on the leg-side boundary was absolutely wonderful and bettered only by the celebrations of the disbelieving fans behind him.Starc is a death-bowling phenomenon, a loose-limbed force of nature with the ability to crush toes through heat-seeking yorkers.To make tailenders dance is one thing, but the yorker he produced to demolish the stumps of Stokes at Lord's on 25 June was as close to unplayable as it gets.And here's the rub. Stokes was well set on 89 and batting beautifully.Even he was powerless to resist Starc, who will stalk English batsman throughout the coming Ashes series.Mentions for South Africa, who were as good as out in the first week, and West Indies, who promised much but delivered little.However, the real let-down has been the performance of Afghanistan, who were tipped to trouble the big boys, but have instead been scuppered by their own chaos.Pre-tournament wrangling led to a baffling change of captain, coach Phil Simmons tweeted his displeasure and there was the curious incident of a scuffle with a member of the public in a Manchester curry house.In a 10-team World Cup, they did well to be here at all. Yes, they showed spirit in some games, but to go away winless is a huge disappointment.Smith and David Warner have been booed in all corners of the country, while back-to-back hundreds have earned Jonny Bairstow forgiveness after his ""people were waiting for us to fail"" comments.However, the biggest baddie in this World Cup has been the British weather, which caused four abandonments in the space of a week.That more rained-off games than at any previous tournament - and Pakistan can rightly feel that the loss of the chance to play Sri Lanka cost them a shot at the semi-finals.Spare a thought too for Bristol, the ground where two of the games were completely wiped out.Empty seats have been a recurring theme and have certainly been a puzzle, especially when we were told that so many games were sold out.However, they are out-flummoxed by the gravity defying case of the immovable zing bails, which at one point seemed to be staging a sit-in protest and refusing to fall from their grooves.On at least six occasions, the ball thwacked into the stumps only for the bails to remain unmoved.So common was the problem that the International Cricket Council was forced to defend the troublesome bails which, latterly, have been much better behaved.The World Cup has been devoid of genuine shocks, with England's freeze against Sri Lanka certainly the most unexpected result.The biggest surprise, though, came off the field, when pop royalty Rihanna turned up in Durham on 1 July to watch West Indies play Sri Lanka.From Barbados, Rihanna went to a school that produced plenty of cricketers and was even taught by Windies assistant coach Roddy Estwick.The connection was there, but was anyone genuinely expecting one of the most famous people on the planet to turn up in Chester-le-Street?It's hard to imagine what it must be like to be Virat Kohli. The weight of a billion people on your shoulders, rarely able to go out in public without attracting attention.And most things that Kohli does are a moment. Giving himself out against Pakistan, complaining about the boundary against England, fielding like a malfunctioning jack-in-the-box.There was, though, one moment that was just lovely.In the maelstrom of a World Cup, Kohli was able to take time out to meet 87-year-old India fan Charulata Patel after the game against Bangladesh at Edgbaston on 2 July.The resulting images were nothing less than heart-warming."

It would be played at Edgbaston and feature eight teams.The sport's only previous inclusion in the Commonwealth Games came in 1998, when South Africa won a men's 50-overs-a-side competition in Kuala Lumpur.""We are absolutely delighted that women's cricket has been nominated for inclusion in Birmingham 2022 - it would be a real honour to become part of the Commonwealth Games family,"" said ICC chief executive Manu Sawhney said.His predecessor, David Richardson, has previously said Birmingham was the ""perfect place"" for it to return as ""23% of the city's residents have links to cricket-playing nations outside the United Kingdom"".If cricket's inclusion is confirmed, it would be another major boost to the sport in the UK after England won the Women's World Cup in 2017.Ian Reid, chief executive of Birmingham 2022, said: ""Our recommendation of adding women's cricket, beach volleyball and Para-table tennis is the result of a thorough review and we believe these sports would help us to enhance the existing programme and reach new audiences, while showcasing the sports to our local community, spectators and fans across the world watching on TV.""It's also a selection that could help ensure that the 2022 Commonwealth Games will be the most inclusive in history, with a potential for the largest-ever Para-sports programme, and more female medallists than ever before, representing a great story not just for Birmingham 2022, but for women's sport in general.""The exclusion of shooting could cause some controversy, with the sport contested at every Games since 1966, with the exception of 1970.It means there will be no place at Birmingham 2022 for David Calvert, Northern Ireland's most successful Commonwealth Games competitor. He has been to 11 consecutive Games since his first in Edmonton, Canada, in 1978.Calvert, a two-time winner of the Queen's Prize at Bisley, has accumulated eight medals at Games, four of them gold.British Shooting said missing out on the 2022 programme was a ""huge disappointment"" that would leave its athletes feeling ""let down"".One of those athletes, Amber Hill, won a silver medal at Gold Coast 2018.

We'll give everything for it.""England's transformation from being dumped out of the 2015 World Cup in the first round has been built on the power of their batting line-up.That was evident in Tuesday's win over Afghanistan at Old Trafford, where captain Eoin Morgan hit 17 sixes as part of a team total of 25 - both records for one-day internationals.""Once we get going, it's almost unstoppable and that's the great thing about the team,"" added Worcestershire's Moeen.""The likes of Morgan, Jos Buttler and Jason Roy - we have so many players, almost everybody in the top eight can do it.""Moeen returned to the side for the defeat of Afghanistan having been left out of the victories over Bangladesh and West Indies.He struck an unbeaten 31 from nine balls and is in line to play his 100th ODI at Headingley.""When I look back, I think back of the fun that I've had,"" said the 32-year-old. ""All of a sudden, 100 games have come almost in the blink of an eye. It's been an amazing journey and hopefully we can finish it off with the World Cup.""Moeen's time out of the side coincided with the birth of his second child, a daughter named Haadiya.""It's obviously amazing, great to have an addition to the family,"" he said. ""She is sleeping, but I've not seen her a for a few days. My wife is doing all the hard work.""It has added an extra bit of happiness in my life with everything that is going on. It is an amazing miracle and you realise how important family is to you.""You know how hard it can be for the mother and you have to be there to be supportive. You put cricket and the World Cup to the back seat as much as you can.""A win on Friday would be England's fifth from six World Cup games and would put them on 10 points, possibly enough for a place in the semis.From Leeds, they move on to play Australia, India and New Zealand; the other members of the top four and the teams likely to make up the semi-finals.Sri Lanka have won only one of their first five games, but have four points because two of their matches have been abandoned.Media playback is not supported on this device"
sport	England win Cricket World Cup: A golden hour ends in a champagne super over		Media playback is not supported on this deviceOn a grey Sunday evening the sun came out at Lord's and the golden hour came.When you love sport, you understand how it can take you to places little else can. You could watch it all your life and never quite fathom what happened between 6.30 and 7.30pm in two sun-kissed rectangles of grass seven or so miles apart across England's capital city.A World Cup final that might just be the greatest game of cricket in history, a Wimbledon men's final longer than any that has come before.Because this was summer's sporting day of days, they stepped hand in hand. You couldn't watch and you couldn't look away. You hated it and you loved it and you lost yourself completely to it.No-one had ever seen Lord's like this, a beautiful sedate museum turned into a cavorting mess. No-one had really seen cricket like this.There is a line often brought out when sport does these sorts of things - you couldn't write this - and a hoary riposte: haven't you seen Star Wars, or read Harry Potter?On a day when sometimes nothing appeared to make sense, both these contradictory positions became true. You couldn't write it, because it was a plotline too twisted to make dramatic sense, too confusing, too remote from what has gone before.We're OK with spaceships and child wizards because they have been imagined before. Plenty had dreamed of England winning the World Cup. That's where logic waved farewell.Media playback is not supported on this deviceA match that ended in a tie to produce a tie-breaker that also ended in a tie. A final over that contained a six that was a six and also contained a six that wasn't a six at all but actually a two and a four, which meant the final over wasn't the final over any more either.When you try to navigate your way through those 60 hallucinogenic minutes you keep coming up against these impossible riddles: New Zealand's Martin Guptill facing the first ball of the match and the last one too; a tournament that England's men had never won before won with a winning margin that wasn't even a winning margin.Seven weeks of cricket and it came down to the final dusty half-metre at the spiritual home of the sport. A final that for so long was slow-motion cricket ending at a pace that took the breath from your lungs and the strength from your legs. Cricket that was a throwback to 20 years ago suddenly leaping into the unknown.It was unprecedented and it was also a very English way to win a World Cup.Media playback is not supported on this deviceExtra time at Wembley in 1966, extra time in Sydney in 2003. A champagne super over in London, that strange comforting familiarity of feeling absolutely awful watching England do something you had always hoped they might.Eoin Morgan's men were supposed to be rompers in this tournament. They were the demolition men who took on big totals and danced across the finish line.You knew deep down it was never going to be easy. It never is with England. You just didn't know it was going to be this hard.There were scoring rates from the late 1990s and an innings perfectly pitched to that fragile, panicked era of England one-day batting, as if the cavalier swordsmen of the current team had been replaced by a cricketing historical re-enactment society.Romp? It was like a four-hour penalty shootout, at least until it became a shootout, at which point England's final over felt like a lifetime and then produced one more for each side that took another half-hour.Panic on the posh streets of London, panic in the living-rooms of the nation.As the contest swung one way then the other and then back again, Lord's was awash with pacers - men and women walking, hopping, striding purposely to nowhere at all. As Ben Stokes dragged England to the brink, into the abyss and then out again, a country had long forgotten that watching sport is supposed to be fun.All the while, horrible sums. 100 needed from 88. 80 from 66.65 off 48, people standing up to cheer a wide.It was 44 from 26 as the final hour began. Men in crisp cotton shirts and chinos swigging pink champagne direct from the bottle. 39 off 24, 34 needed off the last three overs, 24 off two.The 50th over began at 6.55. 15 runs required. Two balls later, 15 needed from four, and then, in two balls and four minutes, came 12 impossible runs.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAt 7pm, England needed two to win. Mark Wood was run out by a mile, and so the final act began: a World Cup into its first ever super over at the same time as a Wimbledon final went into its first ever fifth-set tie-breaker.Both teams thought they had it won and lost in the tumult of the final 12 balls, just as both Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer could feel the Wimbledon trophy in their hands.At some distant forgotten point in the afternoon the hero was going to be Liam Plunkett until it was Colin de Grandhomme, at least until Jos Buttler took over, and then the super over began and it was suddenly Stokes until it was Buttler, except it was then Jimmy Neesham and then Jofra Archer and then Jason Roy and Buttler all over again.You realised as that final throw came in from Roy to his wicketkeeper to leave Guptill and New Zealand that tiny, vast distance short that you were lucky to have seen it and that cricket was lucky to have conjured it.Fourteen long years since the last live England game on free-to-air television, a day for the converted to testify, a chance for a whole new generation to feel the unique horrors and joys of watching England play cricket.You felt like putting an arm around the new devotees in the giddy aftermath. It's not always like this. But it can do exactly this to you.It was awful for New Zealand, fancied by no-one, so close to pulling off one of the great upsets with a brand of cricket that felt archaic until it made perfect sense. It was no sort of compensation for the brilliant Kane Williamson to be awarded man of the tournament.But it was wonderful for England, four years on from their humiliation in Adelaide at the last World Cup, and it was redemption for all those who have followed them and hoped and suffered along the way.So much happened in the golden hour that you struggle to hold on to discrete images. But there is one England supporters will never forget: 11 men in pale blue, chasing wild circles on the green Lord's outfield as the stumps lay splattered and Guptill knelt beside them, the ancient pavilion dancing, the shadows stretching, the World Cup - after 44 long years - finally won.Media playback is not supported on this device
sport	England win Cricket World Cup: Ben Stokes stars in dramatic victory over New Zealand	Unbelievable finale sets up super overSlow burning final builds to unforgettable climaxBuzzing Lord's plays its part in historyEngland's journey ends in glory'Written in the stars for Stokes' - reaction	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland beat New Zealand to win the men's World Cup for the first time after one of the most amazing games of cricket ever played was tied twice.In an emotional and electric atmosphere at Lord's, both sides scored 241 in their 50 overs and were level on 15 when they batted for an extra over apiece.It meant England were crowned world champions by virtue of having scored more boundary fours and sixes - 26 to New Zealand's 17 - in the entire match.That it even got to that stage was astonishing in itself and came as a result of a barely believable conclusion at the home of cricket - the first tie in a World Cup final.England required 15 from the last over of the regular match. Ben Stokes hit a six and then benefited when a throw from the deep hit his bat and was deflected for four overthrows.He could not get the two needed from the last ball - Mark Wood was run out coming back for the second - but ended 84 not out and joined Jos Buttler for the super over.In glorious evening sunshine, they were roared on by a febrile crowd that belted out Sweet Caroline in the change of innings.When New Zealand replied, Jimmy Neesham hit Jofra Archer's second ball for six, then scrambled to leave Martin Guptill needing two from the last delivery.As Jason Roy's throw came in from deep mid-wicket, a diving Guptill was short when Buttler removed the bails, sending England and the whole of Lord's into delirious celebration.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland were all but out of the game at 86-4, squeezed by New Zealand's skilful bowling, sharp fielding and smart tactics.Gradually, they were dragged back into contention by Stokes and Buttler through patience, calmness and a little fortune.Buttler was the more fluent, scooping and driving, but when he was caught at deep point for 59, England still needed 46 from 31 balls.It was at this point that Stokes, the man who was hit for four sixes in the final over in England's 2016 World T20 final defeat and was cleared of affray 11 months ago, took control.After Liam Plunkett was held at long-off in Neesham's 49th over, Trent Boult carried the ball over the boundary for a Stokes six before Archer was bowled.That left 15 needed from Boult's final set. Two dots were followed by a heave over deep mid-wicket, then came the outrageous moment of fortune.Diving for his ground to complete a second run, Stokes' bat was inadvertently struck by the throw and deflected the ball for four overthrows to make six in total.With three runs needed from two balls, Adil Rashid was run out coming back for a second. When Wood suffered the same fate from the final ball, the match was tied.Media playback is not supported on this deviceMedia playback is not supported on this deviceThe drama of the finale was at odds with almost all of the match, which was an attritional affair on a tricky surface.New Zealand stuck doggedly to a plan that centred on batting patience. Henry Nicholls' 55, and 47 from Tom Latham, held things together in the face of some probing England bowling.The value of the Black Caps' pragmatism in reaching 241-8 was shown when England came to bat.Matt Henry had Roy caught behind, the miserly Colin de Grandhomme ensured Joe Root suffered a similar fate, Lockie Ferguson got Jonny Bairstow to play on, then took a wonderful catch to hold Eoin Morgan at deep point.England were floored, then came Stokes, the tie, the super over, and an unforgettable conclusion.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt can be argued that in just getting to the final, and therefore ensuring that it would be broadcast on free-to-air television, England had already given cricket in the UK an invaluable boost.But those who did watch witnessed the greatest World Cup final of all-time and one of the most memorable moments in British sporting history.As spectators streamed from St John's Wood station on Sunday morning, they were greeted by drummers, jugglers and dancers on roller skates.Media playback is not supported on this deviceInside the ground, they saw parachutists land on the Nursery Ground before the spine-tingling spectacle of the national anthems.That, though, was nothing compared to the emotion of the final hour, one of the most dramatic passages of sport you could ever wish to see.The explosion of noise when England sealed victory was deafening and as the trophy was lifted, the crowd rightly sang that cricket was coming home.This was the day that English cricket had been building to for four years, going back to when England were dumped out of the last World Cup in the first round.Off the field, a renewed focus was placed on one-day cricket through the vision of former director of cricket Andrew Strauss.On it, captain Morgan and coach Trevor Bayliss gave the players a new freedom and they responded with some spectacular performances, particularly with the bat.They began the World Cup as favourites and the number one ranked side, but at one stage found themselves one defeat from elimination.Morgan's men reversed their fortunes and swept into the final with three successive victories, including a memorable semi-final demolition of Australia.In the final, the rollercoaster continued, only for the heroics of Stokes to leave England as worthy champions, matching the achievement of the England women's team on the same ground two years ago.And Morgan, the architect of it all, joined immortals Bobby Moore and Martin Johnson as men to have lifted a World Cup for England.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland batsman Joe Root: ""Wow! It's hard to sum it up. What a day, what a tournament. Everyone has done everything asked of them. We have performed under pressure.""It was almost written in the stars for Ben Stokes. He's had such a tough time. I'm so proud of him and pleased for him and his family.""England bowler Jofra Archer: ""I was pretty sure I was going to bowl it [the super over]. My heart is still racing! It's the biggest thing I've ever won. A great bunch of fellas, a really good family to me.""England captain Eoin Morgan: ""There wasn't a lot in that game. I'd like to commiserate Kane Williamson and his team. The fight they show is worth aspiring to, the example they set is commendable to all. It was a hard, hard game where people found it hard to score.""This has been a four-year journey, we have developed a lot. We find it hard to play on wickets like that and today was about getting over the line. Sport is tough at times. I was being cooled down by Liam Plunkett, which is not a good sign! I was up and down like a yo-yo."""
sport	Cricket World Cup: India beat Australia by 36 runs	Brilliant Dhawan lights up packed OvalAustralia toil in sluggish chase'India look like the team to beat' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceIndia claimed an impressive 36-run win over Australia at The Oval in the first heavyweight clash of the World Cup.Shikhar Dhawan's fine 117, coupled with 82 from captain Virat Kohli and an entertaining 48 by Hardik Pandya, helped India post 352-5 in front of a boisterous crowd.Australia, facing what would be a World Cup record chase, struggled to accelerate despite Steve Smith's 69 as David Warner spent 84 balls making 56.With wickets falling and the run-rate rising, Alex Carey hit a 25-ball half-century but it was not enough to stop Australia sliding to their first defeat of the tournament.Bhuvneshwar Kumar removed Adam Zampa with the last ball of the match to finish with 3-50 and Jasprit Bumrah took 3-61.The end result might look like a tight scoreline but for almost the entire run chase Australia never looked as though they would come close to their target.It was only in the late stages that they began to give India and their fans any mild concern, that courtesy of late cameos from Glenn Maxwell and Carey.Australia face Pakistan at Taunton on Wednesday, while India, who have won their first two games, play top of the table New Zealand at Trent Bridge on Thursday.Media playback is not supported on this deviceFrom the moment the teams came out for the national anthems, to KL Rahul hitting the final ball of the innings for four, India's players were cheered by a sell-out, vociferous crowd.The drums beat as Pat Cummins ran in to bowl the first ball of the day. There was a huge roar as Rohit Sharma worked the first runs of India's innings through point. Even a Dhawan defensive shot was cheered in the opening stages.The openers played carefully against the pace of Cummins and Mitchell Starc but after Rohit was given a life on two - dropped at square leg by a leaping Nathan Coulter-Nile - they cut free.Dhawan went after Coulter-Nile, taking three fours from his first over, and when Zampa's leg-spin was introduced, Rohit thrashed his first ball for four.They both reached 50, sharing a 127-run stand, before Rohit was caught behind trying to guide Coulter-Nile over the keeper.Captain Kohli, who had spent the opening stages of the match standing in the dressing room, glued to the TV coverage, was cheered loudly to the crease.The Australians were booed when they appealed against him, but Kohli struggled at first, settling for manipulating the field after a handful of wild drives against the seamers.Media playback is not supported on this deviceDhawan brought up his hundred thanks to an overthrow - he was given an extended ovation - and, even after he was caught at deep mid-wicket off Starc, India did not let up.Pandya was pushed up the order and dropped first ball by a diving Carey, but slog-swept Zampa and Maxwell for sixes before slapping Cummins through backward point.Pandya holed out at mid-off off Cummins, MS Dhoni fell to a stunning caught and bowled by Marcus Stoinis - the seamer sticking out his right hand in his follow-through - and Kohli fell to the penultimate ball of the innings.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSmith and Warner might be used to the chorus of boos that greets them in England but it was Kohli who intervened when the India fans barracked them.Smith was jeered as he fielded in the deep; Kohli asked the fans to quieten down and applaud instead, which Smith acknowledged by shaking his hand.In front of such a partisan crowd, every Australia boundary was greeted with silence. Not that there were many, as Australia made an odd start to a chase that never really accelerated until the 37th over.The opening partnership of Finch and Warner was solid if not explosive, worth 61 before Finch, the more fluent of the two, was run out by a fine throw from Kuldeep Yadav at deep point having been called through by his partner.Warner has looked scratchy since his return to international cricket but this - a blockbuster game in front of a sell-out crowd with Australia needing a record total to win - seemed made for him.However, it was an oddly subdued innings. His 77-ball fifty, met by silence from the crowd, was his slowest in one-day cricket.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWarner hit only five fours and with India's spinners operating in tandem struggled to rotate the strike. When he was eventually dismissed, caught at deep mid-wicket off spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, it felt like an anti-climax.Smith seemed unable to hit out, although Khawaja struck a six in his 42 before he inside edged on to his stumps.Maxwell added the impetus that had been missing. His first ball from Bumrah was hammered for four and he hit Kumar for back-to-back boundaries in the next over.Smith also accelerated and for the first time, the capacity crowd fell silent.But there was too much for Maxwell to do and wickets fell quickly. Smith and Stoinis fell in the space of two Kumar deliveries, Maxwell was caught in the deep trying to force the rate and once Coulter-Nile, who made 92 off 60 balls against West Indies on Thursday, was caught at deep mid-wicket, the crowd found their voice again.Former England captain Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special: ""That was an outstanding performance from India - the best team I've seen so far at the tournament. They haven't let this huge support down and look like the team to beat.""I'd advise Australia to change their approach - a very old-school way of playing. They could be a bit riskier, a bit more aggressive. It looks like we've gone back 25 years to the way one-day cricket was played.""India captain Virat Kohli: ""A top, top win for us - especially after losing the series (against Australia) in India. We had a point to prove to beat this side. They are playing really good cricket in the two games.""We came with intent. The opening partnership was outstanding, I got runs, Hardik got runs, MS. It was the perfect game for us. We were very professional again and that pleases you as a captain.""Australia captain Aaron Finch: ""They got 120 runs off the last 10 overs which is a lot. We didn't bowl our best stuff and struggled to get wickets early on, which was the key.""We could have been a bit straighter. You want to get wickets early as they bat very deep.""It was just one of those games - they just outplayed us."""

None of those are current players.""The people we've charged are administrators, senior administrators, board members, coaches, ex-players and an analyst - people on the edge of the squad, not people currently among the player group.""In addition to the people we have charged, we've also disrupted more than 30 corruptors who are outside our code but we, nevertheless, pursue them.""We've built up a good picture of who the main corruptors are and we are sharing that information with the squads and the players at this tournament.""This is a very tough event for corruptors to come near."""
sport	England v New Zealand: Where Cricket World Cup final will be won and lost	The tossThe first 10 oversThe Williamson factorThe fast laneFielding	After four years of planning and 40 more of waiting, England's men can win the World Cup for the first time on Sunday.Standing in their way at Lord's will be New Zealand, runners-up in 2015 and surprise finalists this time around.England will start as big favourites, but that is to not discount the Black Caps, who stunned India in the semi-finals.Where will the final be won and lost?The flick of the coin has probably lost a little of its significance since England won their semi-final against Australia batting second, but it is still true that almost two-thirds of the completed games in this World Cup have been won by the team batting first.And, even then, the hosts' win wasn't a run chase per se, more a canter after their bowlers took advantage of some early movement to restrict the Aussies to 223. On that occasion, it can actually be argued it was a good toss to lose.Lord's is likely to be different and will probably be at its best for batting early. In the four games hosted here so far at this World Cup, not one has been won by the team batting second.If England get the opportunity to bat and bully New Zealand from the off, like they did when the two sides met in the group stage, the final could be over before it has begun.However, Eoin Morgan's men will also back themselves whatever they do first, especially given their pre-tournament reputation as a side that can chase any score.The toss seems more important to New Zealand's chances. In the semis, they battled to a score against India, then squeezed with the ball and in the field. That may well be their best hope here.It is no coincidence England got back to their best in this tournament when Jason Roy returned from a hamstring injury to reprise his spectacular opening partnership with Jonny Bairstow.In fact, the difference between the opening pairs in this final is as vast as the distance between London and Auckland.On the one hand, Roy and Bairstow can lay claim to be the best of all time. Of every opening pair to have added 2,000 runs in ODIs, no partnership has a higher average than the Roy-Bairstow mark of 69.46.In this tournament, they are averaging of 91.33, with four century stands at a rate of almost seven runs per over.On the other, New Zealand's first-wicket average of 27.62 is better than only West Indies and Afghanistan.In the three games England have lost, one of their openers has been out in the first three overs and twice it has been within two balls (one of which was James Vince, who played when Roy was injured).In fact, on each occasion that Roy and Bairstow have opened together and survived the first three overs, they have gone on to add more than 100. If they are still together after 10 overs on Sunday, New Zealand are in trouble.However, England must still beware of Martin Guptill in particular. Though he has had a miserable tournament - passing 35 only once - he was the leading runscorer four years ago and his 237 in the quarter-final against West Indies in 2015 is the highest World Cup score of all time.If he can get a start, he could match anything Roy and Bairstow do.England have a batting line-up oozing runs. Five of their top six have made centuries in this World Cup and the only one who hasn't, Ben Stokes, has three scores in excess of 80 and another of 79.Even though Ross Taylor is ranked fifth in the world ODI batting rankings, the class act in the New Zealand team (and arguably the tournament) is skipper Kane Williamson, with his gossamer touch, command of geometry and absolute-zero temperament. If Roger Federer played cricket, he would bat like Kane Williamson.The Black Caps might have shown tenacity, character and togetherness to get to the final, but they have also relied heavily on Williamson's runs.His average of 91.33 is higher than every other batsman in the tournament and, in terms of runs off the bat, Williamson has been responsible for nearly a third of everything New Zealand have scored.It is likely someone else will have to chip in for New Zealand on Sunday but even if they do, it is hard to imagine Williamson lifting the trophy without also doing some heavy lifting with that bat.If England can get Williamson early, it could be a mortal blow to the Black Caps' hopes.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThis has not been a World Cup for spinners. While England have Adil Rashid, the leading bowler in ODIs between World Cups, and New Zealand the canny Mitchell Santner, who was outstanding in the defeat of India, not one of the 16 leading wicket-takers is a slow bowler.This has been the World Cup of the fast and furious, with two batteries of pacemen going head-to-head in the finale.In reality, England have greater collective depth and quality. Jofra Archer has justified the hype with more World Cup wickets than any England bowler before him, Chris Woakes has been reliable and skillful with the new ball, Mark Wood a pacy, injury-free revelation, and Liam Plunkett a potent threat in the middle overs.All of this has been backed up by Stokes, a fifth seamer in name only.That is not to say New Zealand do not have weapons. Lockie Ferguson will match Archer's pace and has only one fewer wicket, while an improving Matt Henry was man of the match in the semi-final.And, in Trent Boult, they may just have the best bowler on either side. A prodigious swinger of the ball, he has the natural advantage of being a left-armer - when England lost to Australia at Lord's in the group stage, they lost nine wickets to left-arm bowlers.Having said all of that, it may not be the out-and-out fast men that make the telling contribution.Jimmy Neesham and Colin de Grandhomme bowl nagging medium pace for the Black Caps and have a habit of winkling wickets. New Zealand will look to them to apply the squeeze.In a tight game, the outcome can often be decided by which team holds its nerve in the field. A fumble, a missed run out, or just failing to hang on to a half-chance can be the difference between immortality and obscurity.For the majority of this tournament, New Zealand have been characteristically excellent in the field (except for, ironically, a sloppy day against England).In the semi-final, two moments of magic contributed to their famous win - Neesham's outrageous catch to snaffle Dinesh Karthik, and Guptill's direct-hit run-out to remove MS Dhoni that effectively won the game.England have had their ups and downs in the field. In their first defeat, against Pakistan, they were awful, while minor mistakes have cropped up with regularity.In the semi-final against Australia, they were back to somewhere near their best. The ground fielding was sharp, all catches were taken and Jos Buttler somehow got the ball between Steve Smith's legs for a run out.If, then, these two sides are evenly matched in this department, it may well come down to a slice of fortune.When they met in the group stage, England had a huge slice of luck to remove Williamson. As the ball was driven back by Taylor, bowler Wood stuck out a hand, got a fingertip to the white leather and left Williamson short of his ground as it cannoned into the non-striker's stumps.On such moments can the biggest games be decided.

Hmmm.Initially, Richard's text was greeted with a mixed response.

""It's a World Cup and we are trying to make the most of it.""England will now play their semi-final at Edgbaston next Thursday against either India or Australia. New Zealand will finish fourth in the table and qualify for the semi-finals unless Pakistan beat Bangladesh by a near-impossible margin.For Morgan, the week-long break before England's next game is welcome.""I can't wait to get away from a cricket field,"" said the Dublin-born batsman. ""The last few weeks have been extremely intense.""We've gone through the highs and lows of winning and then performing at different stages. We'll have a few days off and everyone will be encouraged to get away from the game.""England's resurgence has been on the back of batting first in the games against India and New Zealand, while their three defeats in the tournament have come when batting second.However, over the past four years, England have preferred to chase, and Morgan insisted that his team can still win batting first or second.Speaking on Test Match Special, former England captain Michael Vaughan said he believes England will be world champions if they win the toss and bat in the semi-final and final.But Vaughan said he had doubts over England in the pressure of a chase.Of the decision to bat or field first on winning the toss, Morgan added: ""All of the wickets in the tournament have got slower and lower so batting first has been the theme of the tournament.""If that continues we will continue to bat first."""

sport	Cricket World Cup: Bangladesh beat Afghanistan to boost semi-final hopes	Bangladesh keep themselves in the mixAfghanistan batsmen struggle again'It's still wide open. You never know' - reaction	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceBangladesh moved a point behind England and the World Cup semi-final places as they beat Afghanistan by 62 runs at Southampton.All-rounder Shakib al Hasan starred again for Bangladesh, taking 5-29 from 10 overs after contributing another half-century with the bat.In doing so, Shakib became just the second man to make a fifty and take five wickets in a World Cup match, following India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh against Ireland in 2011.Mushfiqur Rahim anchored the Bangladesh innings with 83 from 87 balls as they posted 262 from their 50 overs.The Bangladesh spinners, led by Shakib, then suffocated the Afghanistan batsmen in their run chase.Captain and opener Gulbadin Naib made 47 from 75 balls, and Samiullah Shinwari 49, but Afghanistan never gained control of the required run-rate.The professional win means Bangladesh are now fifth in the World Cup table, one place behind England with the top four teams progressing to the semi-finals.However, they have played at least one more game than all the teams above them and England can increase their cushion with victory against Australia at Lord's on Tuesday.Top four go through to semi-finalsBangladesh have impressed in this tournament and were one of the teams to benefit from Sri Lanka's win over England on Friday opening up the battle for a semi-final places.Against Afghanistan, they were solid if unspectacular with the bat but posted a good total on a used pitch on which it was difficult to score.Shakib regained his place as the World Cup's leading scorer, moving to 476 runs with a steady 51 from 69 balls - his fifth score over 50 in the tournament.After he fell lbw to spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Mushfiqur took on the scoring with an innings of quiet accumulation, hitting only five boundaries - the highlight a six over long on.The Tigers seamers made a scrappy start with the new ball but the introduction of their impressive spinners decided the contest.Left-arm off-spinner Shakib took a wicket in his first over with opener Rahmat Shah caught at mid-on trying to hit over the top.After a period of hesitant rebuilding by Afghanistan, Shakib returned for a second spell and claimed the key wickets of Afghanistan captain Gulbadin caught at short extra cover, the dangerous Mohammad Nabi bowled through the gate second ball, and batsman Asghar Afghan caught at deep midwicket for 20.Najibullah Zadran and Shinwari shared a 43-ball seventh wicket partnership of 56 to suggest a unlikely win was possible but Shakib returned again and dismissed Najibullah to seal his second five-wicket haul in ODI cricket.Bangladesh have a difficult run-in against India and Pakistan as they bid to qualify for the semi-finals but can take heart from having beaten Pakistan in each of their past four meetings.Bangladesh's total proved too much for Afghanistan but their bowlers would have been relatively pleased at the halfway stage.Mujeeb took 3-39, again impressing with his variations, and Afghanistan kept things tight through a period of 12.2 overs without a boundary in the middle overs.But, the game was played on the same pitch Afghanistan failed to chase down a target of 225 against India and again they struggled to find a suitable pace of scoring.After a solid start, reaching 48-0 after 10 overs, the innings stalled badly with number three Hashmatullah Shahidi making a torturous 11 from 31 balls and Afghan 20 from 38 balls.Media playback is not supported on this deviceTheir confused approach was perhaps not helped by the fact they made a fifth change to their opening partnership in the tournament with Rahmat partnering Gulbadin on this occasion. It is the sixth time they have failed to bat out their 50 overs in seven matches.Afghanistan may also look back on the decision to bowl first at the toss on a used pitch which only got more difficult to bat as the game went on.They have two games remaining, against Pakistan and West Indies, to try and gain a first win of the tournament.Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan: ""I think the five wickets gave me greater pleasure, it was important. But I had to work really hard with the bat and without Mushfiqur and lots of little innings that really contributed we wouldn't have got that total.""It was a team effort with the bat - we knew it would be tough with their three quality spinners. We had to bat really well to get those runs.""There are two more important matches for us, two big teams to play and we have to play at our best to win.""Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza: ""Shakib has been fantastic throughout the tournament, he's been phenomenal.""We'll try our level best against Pakistan and India. It's still wide open. You never know.""Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib: ""Obviously we played two tough games and today we missed something. Our fielding gave away 30-40 runs extra.""The wicket was very slow and it helped our spinners. It wasn't too much tougher in the second innings but Shakib bowled really well."""
sport	Cricket World Cup: England happier to play Australia than India, says Michael Vaughan		"England will be happier to play Australia rather than India in the World Cup semi-final and should go on and win the tournament, says former captain Michael Vaughan.Australia's defeat by South Africa in their final group game on Saturday set-up a last four clash with the tournament hosts at Edgbaston, where they have not won since 2001.""They won't admit it, but England will be quietly quite happy to play Australia,"" Vaughan said on the Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show.""It's going to be a difficult game but if you had to pick one of the two you would pick Australia at Edgbaston, knowing you won't have to play them at Lord's.""England have won their last four one-day internationals at Edgbaston including against India last week to help secure their place in a World Cup semi-final for the first time since 1992.They also knocked Australia out of the Champions Trophy with a 40-run victory in Birmingham two years ago.However, they were convincingly beaten in their group game against Australia at Lord's last month.""Edgbaston and Trent Bridge are two of the grounds where you arrive feeling very, very comfortable as an England player, so England will be delighted to play there,"" added Vaughan.""The fact England have won two must-win games on the trot must stand them in good stead that they can cope with that pressure. But they also know Australia gave them a good hiding a few weeks ago.""I just look at left-arm seam bowlers and I look at Lord's in particular. Australia have two left-arm quicks. Because of the slope it can be a real advantage to have left-armers, so they are playing at a ground where I don't think it plays a bigger part.""England began the tournament as favourites despite a poor recent record at World Cups.They have never won an ICC 50 over tournament and have not won a knockout match at the World Cup in 27 years.Despite that record, Vaughan feels England's form in the years leading up to the World Cup means anything other than winning the tournament will be classed as a failure.""England over the course of the past four years have managed to beat everyone in all conditions and now it's time to show they can do it under the utmost pressure,"" he said.""Failure for England for me is not winning. They are such a good team. They are favourites, they have to go on and win it."""

Our intensity was much better.""He (Tahir) can get wickets at any stage. Even on wickets like this today, he still finds a way - and that separates the good from the great.""You want Hashim to try and push on towards the end, but more important for him is finishing a game off and getting some runs under his belt. I'm happy for him to get a not-out and get some confidence.""Man of the match Imran Tahir: ""I really enjoyed that. It's nice to have that first victory. We were up for it. As long as I take wickets I'll keep on celebrating.""Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib: ""We didn't expect that spell from Tahir. We did well against the seamers but the batsmen didn't take responsibility in the middle.""We need a good total on the board so we needed a partnership. We made a lot of mistakes.""Former New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney on BBC Test Match Special: ""South Africa have done the job. They might have done it more quickly with more confidence, but they wanted this victory so badly. There will be relief."""
sport	Cricket World Cup: David Warner hits 166 as Australia beat Bangladesh	Need for speed in Aussie batting?Closing stages the differenceWarner batting 'under the radar'	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceDavid Warner's accomplished 166 was the bedrock for a 48-run win that took holders Australia top of the World Cup table and damaged Bangladesh's chances of making the semi-finals.Warner found some explosive form late on to push Australia to their second-highest World Cup score of 381-5.Bangladesh chased gamely but could not kick on in the closing stages.The four semi-finalists look set already - with 19 matches of the group stage still to play.Australia look likely to be joined in the last four by hosts England, India and New Zealand, although fifth-placed Bangladesh will hope to take advantage of any slip-ups.Warner now has scored two centuries in eight days - a fine return after serving a year-long ban for ball tampering - and becomes the first player in World Cup history to pass 150 twice.Bangladesh, set a World Cup record target to chase, saw Mushfiqur Rahim bring up his 100 in the penultimate over as the two teams amassed the most runs in a men's World Cup game.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe scorecard accurately suggests an ultimately comfortable win for holders Australia - but they may yet have to up their game, and their scoring rate, in the knockout stage.They were steady in laying the foundations for their mammoth score, picking up just 53 runs in the first 10 overs and taking 164 balls to score their opening 150 runs on the batting-friendly pitch that saw England score their world record 481 last year.After captain Aaron Finch was out in tame fashion, steering a ball to short third man, Usman Khawaja joined Warner at the crease. The pair combined for a huge partnership of 192, but both players were in cautious mood for the bulk of their innings, with fans and former players alike questioning their intent.Australia legend Shane Warne criticised their ""conservative approach"" and said that their late-innings acceleration came 20 overs too late, while former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Steve Smith should be batting at number three ahead of Khawaja.There were signs of Warner's old flair, who switch-hit a four and then opened up once he passed the 100 mark from 110 balls, eventually pummelling five sixes as he moved level with all-time great Adam Gilchrist on 16 ODI hundreds for Australia.By contrast, Warner now boasts the two highest World Cup scores for Australia, adding to his knock of 178 against Afghanistan four years ago, but has also scored two of the four slowest hundreds in this year's tournament.Australia went from 300 to 350 in just 17 balls as Warner was replaced by Glenn Maxwell, who powered to a decisive 32 off just 10 deliveries and looked set to take Australia to an even bigger total before he was run-out by Khawaja's reluctance to take on a quick single.They paced their innings well in the end, scoring 173 from the last 15 overs, a total only bettered so far by England against Afghanistan, and also hitting Rubel Hossain's 46th over of the day for 25 runs - the most in a single over at the World Cup so far.Media playback is not supported on this deviceRoared on by a passionate support, Bangladesh set off on their record pursuit in confident mood. After all, the Tigers have accomplished two of the top three run-chases in World Cup history.The underdogs were always in touch but lost key wickets at key times to derail their hopes on a good batting wicket.Mahmudullah's late surge of sixes raised hopes of a historic victory but he was eventually caught at deep mid-wicket trying to hoist another shot into the crowd.Ultimately it was a failure to match that Australian flurry of runs late on which proved the difference, as Bangladesh were ahead of the required rate at 30 overs but needed 14 an over by the 40-over mark.Shakib Al Hasan, in great form in this tournament, was in the running for a third successive hundred but was deceived by a slower ball and caught by Warner on 41, silencing Trent Bridge.Their eventual total of 333 surpasses the highest run chase at a World Cup and is one short of the highest second-innings total in defeat - posted by England against Pakistan earlier this month.Top four go through to semi-finalsMedia playback is not supported on this deviceFormer England spinner Graeme Swann on TMS, speaking about Warner: ""My over-riding feeling is that it's like watching Ben Stokes bat at the moment - it's about David Warner wanting to go under the radar.""A moment of brashness has put them out on a pedestal and they've been ripped to pieces for it. He does look a much better batsman. It looks like you have to bowl a really good delivery to get him out at the moment.""He looks so much better and compact outside the off stump. The slowness of his batting doesn't matter if he's going to convert like today.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceAustralian commentator Jim Maxwell: ""The changes to his game, I think, are partially deliberate and partially forced because of his elbow injury and what's happened to him. He's coming out of a pretty grim period.""A lot of people around Australia said he shouldn't play for Australia again. I was at a function at Lord's in September last year and Eoin Morgan said he should never play again and a lot of people had that feeling and thought he brought a bad odour to the game."""
sport	Cricket World Cup: Pakistan shock England at Trent Bridge	The day the World Cup came to lifeRoot and Buttler tons not enoughSlapdash England punished'A great advertisement for the tournament' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland suffered a stunning upset at the hands of inspired Pakistan in their second World Cup match at Trent Bridge.The hosts and favourites were surprisingly lacklustre in the field as Pakistan, roared on by their noisy and vibrant fans, posted 348-8.Even though England have made a habit of overhauling such targets, they were still faced with having to pull off the most successful chase in World Cup history.And they were denied by the rejuvenated Pakistanis, who had lost their previous 11 one-day internationals including a 4-0 series defeat by England prior to the tournament and then a humiliation against West Indies on this ground on Friday.Despite Joe Root's 107, the first century of the tournament, and a 75-ball ton from Jos Buttler, England were restricted to 334-9 to lose by 14 runs.In a tournament where the 10 teams play each other once to determine the semi-finalists, there are plenty of opportunities for England to get their campaign back on track, starting with Bangladesh in Cardiff on Saturday.Pakistan, renowned for veering from shambolic to sublime in global tournaments, will look to continue their resurgence in Sri Lanka in Bristol on Friday.After England opened their tournament by beating South Africa at The Oval on Thursday, captain Eoin Morgan asserted that they will not go through the competition unbeaten.Similarly, on Sunday, Pakistan bowling coach Azhar Mahmood defiantly claimed his side could reverse their fortunes and beat Morgan's men.Both were right.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIndeed, both sides were almost entirely transformed from their first matches. Whereas Pakistan improved immeasurably, England were inexplicably shoddy.Not only that, but England often let their frustrations boil over in the field and there were a number of noticeable moments of tension between the two sides when they came to bat.All of this was played out in an electric atmosphere, created mainly by Pakistan fans, whose near constant din was only dimmed when Root and Buttler were together.The tension of the contest and energy of the crowd amounted to a wonderful occasion. This was the day that the World Cup came to life.Media playback is not supported on this deviceOn a slow pitch, England's top order struggled for impetus against the tricky spin and hostile pace of Pakistan.Like South Africa on Thursday, Pakistan opened with spin and saw Shadab Khan trap Jason Roy lbw. When Ben Stokes edged Shoaib Malik behind, it meant Buttler arrived at 118-4 with 231 required from just under 28 overs.Media playback is not supported on this deviceHe was immediately into his destructive stride, heaving sixes over the leg side and driving through the covers. At the other end, Root, who was dropped by Babar Azam on nine, accumulated runs with dabs and nudges.While they were at the crease, England were on course for victory, but both fell just after reaching three figures.Root sliced Shadab to short third man, Buttler (103) fell in almost identical fashion to the pace of Mohammad Amir.Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali turned an equation of 61 from 39 balls to 29 from 14, but when both fell in successive Wahab Riaz deliveries, the game was up.By the metric of their own team analyst, England put in their best fielding performance for four years in defeating South Africa. This must rank as one of their worst.Media playback is not supported on this deviceNot only was the ground fielding littered with errors, but Roy put down the most straightforward chance off Mohammad Hafeez on 14. Hafeez went on to make 84.Woakes at least equalled a World Cup record with four catches, three superbly taken on the boundary, but he was one of a number of disappointing bowlers - his 3-71 made more respectable by some improved death bowling.Adil Rashid and Jofra Archer were expensive as only Moeen, who claimed 3-50, and Mark Wood, in the side for Liam Plunkett, provided any sort of control.Pakistan, who were blown away by a barrage of West Indies bouncers on Friday, cashed in.Openers Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq added 82 in 14 overs, with Babar then particularly harsh on Rashid in his 63. Hafeez was the most aggressive, while captain Sarfaraz Ahmed favoured the leg side for 55.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland captain Eoin Morgan: ""It was a very good game of cricket and a great advertisement for the tournament. We're bitterly disappointed to be on the wrong end of the result though.""Trent Bridge is a high scoring ground, we felt the wicket was good, the outfield was rapid and we thought if we got partnerships going, 350 was in our grasp.""Joe and Jos kept us in the game. If we could have got a substantial partnership earlier, we might have got over the line.""Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed: ""It was a great team effort. The bowlers bowled really well today.""We tried a couple of different things - we started with Shadab because we know their openers are not good against spin.""Fielding is a very important part. In the last ODI series it was different. Today we fielded better and we bowled better.""Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS: ""England's fielding certainly cost them 30 or 40 runs.""Full credit to Pakistan - the support they've had, the atmosphere they created. I think we're in for a fantastic tournament because of all the support.""I think we're going right to the wire."""

sport	Cricket World Cup: Sri Lanka's semi-final hopes dented by South Africa	Sri Lanka fluff their linesSouth Africa's best showing comes too late'We finally did ourselves justice' - reaction	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceSri Lanka's hopes of reaching the World Cup semi-finals were dented as South Africa thrashed them by nine wickets at Chester-le-Street.Victory would have taken Sri Lanka level on points with fourth-placed England, but they stay in seventh.No player scored more than 30 as they were bowled out for a turgid 203 in the final over of their innings.South Africa won with 76 balls to spare, with Faf du Plessis making 96 not out and Hashim Amla an unbeaten 80.Sri Lanka remain two points behind England and it is likely they will have to win both of their remaining matches, including beating unbeaten India, and hope other results go in their favour if they are to overtake Eoin Morgan's side.The biggest threats to England's top-four place are now likely to be Pakistan and Bangladesh, with the former playing Afghanistan on Saturday.South Africa were already eliminated, and this was just their second victory in the competition.Before their surprise win over England on Friday, few expected Sri Lanka to challenge for a semi-final place - and this performance saw them revert to their form at the start of the tournament.They made a terrible start, losing captain Dimuth Karunaratne to the first ball of the match, before recovering to reach 67-1 in the 10th over.Kusal Perera and Avishka Fernando both made 30, but Sri Lanka never recovered from their departures in a 10-ball spell.Only Karunaratne, who fended an aggressive Kagiso Rabada bouncer to second slip, could claim he was dismissed by a good delivery, and the rest of the batsmen struggled to find an appropriate pace at which to bat.There were 187 dot balls, the most in any innings in the tournament, and South Africa were always able to apply pressure.Sri Lanka were then toothless with the ball, with the Proteas' measured approach showing their score to be well below par.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSouth Africa's only other win in this tournament was a laboured nine-wicket defeat of Afghanistan, which briefly revived their hopes after beginning with four consecutive defeats.This was a much more composed all-round display, but captain Du Plessis admitted it was ""bittersweet"" with his side already eliminated.All-rounder Dwaine Pretorius, selected for the first time since the opening match, bowled accurately and was rewarded with economical figures of 3-25.Chris Morris also took three wickets, and Rabada belatedly found some form to finish with 2-36.When South Africa batted, opener Quinton de Kock was bowled by a perfect Lasith Malinga yorker in the fifth over, but Du Plessis and Amla saw them home.Amla, who had scored only 123 runs in the tournament's first seven games, hit two boundaries off Malinga in the opening over, and afterwards looked far more composed.His only moment of concern came as he was given out lbw to leg-spinner Jeevan Mendis, but a review showed the ball pitched outside leg stump.Du Plessis was similarly unflustered, hitting nine fours and a big six. He finished on South Africa's highest individual score of the tournament, with Amla's the next best.Media playback is not supported on this deviceSri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne: ""The wicket was a bit slow and South Africa bowled well, they kept it tight and kept building pressure. We couldn't get the singles so we had to keep going for the big shots.""We needed to take wickets to stand a chance of winning and build pressure. We've got to think about that - how we can build pressure and create mistakes.""South Africa captain Faf du Plessis: ""It feels like it's a long time coming - we finally did ourselves justice.""It was set up by a very good bowling performance. We've been trying to get Dwaine into the team so badly but we couldn't find the right combination.""It feels bittersweet, it doesn't feel like it means too much."""
sport	Cricket World Cup: Jofra Archer adds to England weapons		The opening days of the World Cup have seen aggressive, short-pitched fast bowling come to the fore.In an era when the bat has been dominating and the poor bowlers have been afforded precious little movement from the white ball, bouncers are a legitimate tactic.You might ask why this is different to Test cricket where, if a batsman chooses (and is able to), he ducks and weaves the bumpers until the bowler gets fed up and tries something else.In one-day internationals, the batsman is under pressure to get on with run-scoring and does not have the luxury of leaving too many deliveries.He is almost compelled to go after the short ball. It is difficult to master the skill of scoring runs from a 90mph delivery that is dug into your armpit or is fizzing past your nose.It remains to be seen if this trend continues. A lot will depend on pitches and conditions because on a slow wicket or an overcast day when the white ball may offer a hint of swing, it would not be a good idea to be banging it into the middle of the pitch.If, however, short-pitched bowling becomes a necessity, England are well stocked in the shape of Liam Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer.Along with Ben Stokes, Archer was the standout performer in England's opening win against South Africa on Thursday. He took three wickets and rattled the grille of Hashim Amla, forcing one of the finest players in the game to retire hurt.Archer has an incredible talent. He is one of those fast bowlers who makes it look easy.You will see others having to charge in, arms and legs pumping, in order to generate high speed.Archer has a loose-limbed approach in a run-up that is not very long. He gets into a good position at the crease and releases the ball late from a very high action. He snaps the ball down at genuine pace.He has rhythm to his bowling. That is a hard a thing to define but very difficult to find if it is not there. It is when everything is working in perfect harmony - the run-up, action, release and follow-through all click and flow into one another.For Archer, it looks like all of that comes naturally.Not only that, but he is an extremely relaxed character, one who has taken to international cricket as easily as anyone I have seen.That might be because of his experience in Twenty20 leagues around the world, where he has become used to playing in front of big crowds and delivering under pressure.Should England and their fans be excited about him? Absolutely they should be, not only for what he might achieve in the World Cup, but then in Test cricket during the Ashes and beyond.While Archer has been bowling with the unresponsive white ball, it is difficult to know what he might do with the red version.However, it is not hard to imagine him being a handful when he gets the chance to tear in with three slips and a gully waiting to snaffle an edge.For years England have been crying out for genuine pace when they have played away from home.Remember the last Ashes in Australia, when they were simply outgunned? Now, with Archer and hopefully a fully fit Wood, they have weapons of their own.That, though, is the future. The present is the World Cup and Monday's game against Pakistan, who were hammered by West Indies at this same Trent Bridge ground on Friday.Impressive as England were against South Africa, there is still room for improvement. The fact that four batsmen passed 50 but none went on to make a hundred will be something they have looked at.Eoin Morgan's men will have also noted how uncomfortable the Windies' fast bowlers made life for Pakistan, who can certainly expect England to deliver some more chin music.Pakistan have now lost 11 consecutive one-day internationals and, when you get into a negative roll like that, it can be very hard to break free.Remember, this is tournament play, where every opponent will want to be ruthless in their one match against you. It is not a five-match series where your opponent might rotate players or take their eye off the ball for one or two games.It will take a lot for Pakistan to come back and I expect England to win.Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.
sport	Cricket World Cup: England's Jos Buttler 'responding well' to treatment		"England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler is ""responding well to treatment"" on a hip injury before Friday's World Cup game against West Indies.The 28-year-old suffered ""heavy bruising"" while batting and did not take to the field in Saturday's win over Bangladesh.England said Buttler will train with the squad on Wednesday and will be ""reassessed later this week"".England play West Indies in Southampton.Buttler seemed to sustain the injury when hitting a six and, although he made 64 from 44 balls, it affected his running between the wickets.Buttler, who scored 103 in England's defeat by Pakistan in their second game, is the second highest run-scorer in the tournament with 185 at an average of 61.66.He is a key member of an England side who are favourites to win the World Cup."
sport	Australia v Pakistan: Bowler James Pattinson suspended for first Test		"Australia captain Tim Paine says fast bowler James Pattinson has ""let himself down"" after being found guilty of his third code of conduct breach of 2019.It means Pattinson will miss the first Test against Pakistan in Brisbane for disciplinary reasons.Cricket Australia took action after the 29-year-old used abusive language towards an opponent during Victoria's defeat by Queensland last week.""I made a mistake in the heat of the moment,"" said Pattinson.""I'm gutted to miss a Test match, but the standards are there for a reason and the fault is mine.""The exact details of Pattinson's latest offence have not been revealed, but he was found guilty of a level-two breach relating to personal abuse of a player, which was enough to trigger a one-match ban.In a statement, the governing body said the bowler ""apologised immediately and unreservedly to the opponent and the umpires, and did not contest the charge"".""He knows he's let himself down,"" added Paine.The first Test starts on Thursday (00:00 GMT), with the concluding match in the two-Test series taking place from 29 November in Adelaide."
sport	Cricket World Cup: England's Jason Roy to miss next two matches	'England defeat would be biggest upset in World Cup history' - analysis	"Opener Jason Roy will miss England's next two World Cup matches, with captain Eoin Morgan not ruling out calling up Alex Hales later in the tournament.Roy tore a hamstring in Friday's win over West Indies, while Hales was dropped in April for reportedly failing a recreational drugs test.""If [national selector] Ed Smith felt that Alex was the best option, we would have to assess how that would sit in the changing room and the stigma it would bring,"" Morgan told BBC Sport.Roy will be replaced by James Vince for Tuesday's match against bottom side Afghanistan at Old Trafford and Friday's meeting with Sri Lanka at Headingley.Morgan himself may be fit for against Afghanistan after suffering a back spasm against West Indies.When Hales was dropped from the World Cup squad after serving a 21-day suspension, Morgan said it was because of ""complete breakdown in trust"" between the batsman and the rest of the squad.Although Morgan said there has been no discussion of replacing Roy, he did not deny that Hales would be considered should the need for batting cover arise.Morgan added: ""It's not a conversation that we have had with Ed Smith or [coach] Trevor Bayliss.""We have not considered replacing any players yet. When we did the original selection, we outlined a number of players that could replace players if they got injured, but since then we haven't spoken to the selection panel.""Roy missed seven weeks of action after suffering a hamstring injury earlier this year.He was injured while fielding at Southampton, did not bat in the England innings and had an MRI scan in London on Saturday.""I certainly believe Jason will play again in this tournament,"" said Morgan.""He might be back against Australia or maybe for the following game. It depends how he responds to treatment and medication.""I'll be very conscious of not pushing it, but that will also be dependent on results, how we're going in the tournament and what games we need to win to get into the semi-finals.""Morgan hobbled off in the eight-wicket victory over West Indies, but said he is now ""moving freely"".""The response to the treatment has been very good, but we don't know how we'll pull up tomorrow,"" he said.If Morgan is unfit, his place could go to off-spinning all-rounder Moeen Ali, who has missed England's past two games.Moeen could also return if England opt for a second spinner instead of their recent tactic of four frontline pace bowlers.England are fourth in the 10-team table, having won three and lost one of their first four games. Afghanistan are bottom with four defeats from four matches.The top four sides qualify for the semi-finals.Cricket correspondent Jonathan AgnewNot only have Afghanistan not won a single game, but they haven't come close, their batsmen failing on every occasion.Although their bowlers are useful on a used pitch such as the one they will be playing on at Old Trafford, England should deal with them comfortably enough.If England slip up it would rank as the biggest upset in the history of the World Cup."
sport	Cricket World Cup: England's final against New Zealand live on free-to-air TV		"England's Cricket World Cup final against New Zealand on Sunday will be shown live on free-to-air television on Channel 4.The broadcaster has agreed a deal with rights-holders Sky to show the match - England's first men's 50-over World Cup final since 1992.England reached the final by thrashing Australia at Edgbaston on Thursday.There will be also Test Match Special radio commentary, plus clips on the BBC Sport website and app.The Lord's final is part of a bumper day for British sport which also features the Wimbledon men's final and the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.Channel 4 will show Sky's cricket coverage from 09:00 BST before coverage moves to More 4 at 13:15 while the British Grand Prix airs on Channel 4.

sport	Cricket World Cup: England's Jason Roy on the art of opening the batting	When the captains go out for the toss, do you always want to bat first?What was it like to open the batting in the opening game of the World Cup?Do you have a routine when you get ready?What do you chat about when you go out into the middle?What's that adrenaline like when you are batting for England and the crowd are cheering you on?Do you always want to face first?If you see out the first few overs, do you and Jonny have a chat in the middle?Do you break your innings down very precisely - get to five, get to 10 etc?What's the key to a good opening partnership? Do you have to like your partner?	Media playback is not supported on this deviceAs England's World Cup campaign lurched perilously close to disaster, the fitness of one man occupied the thoughts of so many connected to the England team.Jason Roy's torn hamstring, sustained days after a thunderous 153 against Bangladesh, appeared, from the outside at least, to acutely affect England.Eoin Morgan's men lost against both Sri Lanka and Australia before returning to winning ways against India on Sunday - a victory built on a 160-run opening partnership between Roy and Jonny Bairstow.Here, speaking to the Test Match Special podcast, Roy explains how he prepares to open the batting, the relationship with his opening partner and what it feels like to represent England at a World Cup.No, not at all. You want to do the best for the team and then once you know whether you are batting or bowling you can get your head round the job. I don't put too much emphasis on what happens at the toss.I walk into the changing room and ask the lads what we're doing. If we're batting then cool, I stay nice and relaxed, get my gear on slowly and make sure I'm not ready too early. I then chat away to try to dust down the nerves a bit.That game was probably the most testing mentally I've had in my career. I had a lot more time with my thoughts than I wanted.We went in a little bit early so I had a bit too much time to prepare. So I just took myself away, chatted with the physios then started to get pads on when I felt it was the right time.It was a bit different, but again you've got to adapt.The fact you're facing the opening ball of the tournament goes through your head but you have to keep imagining positive thoughts and positive shots.Usually from bottom to top. So I start with my pads, front pad first more often than not, box, thigh pad and then make sure when the umpires are on their way or when I cross that line I have all my gear on - gloves, helmet, bat - and I'm ready to work.Jonny Bairstow has his own way. We don't change next to each other and I think he likes to take himself away a little bit more.We then chat just before we go over the rope and go to work.Normally when we are walking out and the crowd is going mad, emotions can sometimes get the better of you if you let them. So we say each other 'let's enjoy it, let's have fun', get ourselves in and reassure each other that it's just another game of cricket.At the start of my career I would play a shot and hear the crowd. When I'm out there now it's a very strange feeling - I don't hear a single murmur until I'm at the other end.But it's an extremely nice feeling when you get in and go big and the crowd are going ballistic. It's a feeling like no other.I tend to face first as I feel I have a better record facing first. I played a year with Hashim Amla and we took it in rotation and I felt like I batted better when I took the first ball.You have to take a ball at some stage, so why not the first one?We have a chat at the end of every over.It's more about reassuring yourself of what you're trying to achieve. Then when we get drinks brought to us we relay messages back to the changing room such as what a good score is, how the pitch is behaving, what to look out for, which way the wind is blowing etc.But it's about trying to stay as relaxed as possible, especially in World Cup games. When I'm at the other end not facing I tend to look into the crowd. It's nice to switch off completely and see what you're bringing to the game; it gives you a really nice feeling.I don't do it that strategically. If I'm feeling good I'll keep playing strong shots and play nice and aggressively.Sometimes I'll need a few more balls to get myself in.It's recognising that the deeper we take the game, with the firepower we have in the dressing room, we can score plenty.It's also about reassuring myself. Sometimes when I was younger I may have tried to force it too early but now I take each ball as it comes.You don't have to like each other, though it does help, but you do have to work well together. You also have to know your partner well, know their likes and dislikes.Then when you're in the middle you feed off each other, give feedback and make sure you looking after each other.

sport	England win Cricket World Cup: Did Jofra Archer predict most nail-biting match in history?	Let's rewind - how did we get to the super over?'My heart is jumping out of my chest''Oh great. Penalties!'	Media playback is not supported on this deviceA few months ago the World Cup wasn't even on the radar of England's new bowling star Jofra Archer. The Barbados-born paceman wasn't eligible to play.But on Sunday, the 24-year-old found himself charged with the responsibility of bowling a super over in the World Cup final for England against New Zealand at Lord's.Yet he might just have predicted it all. In true Nostradamus style.The bowler's old tweets seemed to foresee the dramatic events we witnessed on Sunday - as England won after the most thrilling climax - with spooky accuracy.First of all, he knew that one day he would be part of the England side way back in early 2014, when he was just 18 years old....He also knew that, one day, England would send the nation into a nervous frenzy as the drama unfolded at Lord's...We know how you feel, Jofra!A year later, the then 19-year-old even knew what was coming - predicting a super over.A six-week World Cup came down to this.New Zealand had to score 16 from six balls to win the tournament. Did Jofra know that all along? This tweet from 2013 is again uncanny...Playing in just his 14th international match, Archer was the one chosen by England captain Eoin Morgan to bowl the crucial six balls.Archer looked calm and composed while the rest of us were shaking, too nervous to function normally.Again, it was one of the bowler's old tweets that told it best...England sent out Stokes and Buttler to bat. Lord's roared in anticipation.The duo stayed calm. They hit two boundaries on their way to posting 15-0 from their six balls.The drama had everyone gripped. Cricket was gaining new fans. For others it was too much...After all that had gone before, the final over was never going to be easy.A wide from Archer increased the English doubts and made the Kiwis believe. Then a huge six from batsman Jimmy Neesham. Was it going to be agony for England?But Archer wasn't done yet and neither were England. He corrected his lines.New Zealand needed two to win from the final ball. One run would not be enough for them.Archer bowled full. Batsman Martin Guptill pushed into the deep. Lord's held its breath. The batsmen turned for the second run. This is it. Here comes the throw. GONE!Ecstasy for England!Media playback is not supported on this deviceEven the most experienced of players, and cricket lovers who thought they had seen it all before, did not know what to do.Laugh, cheer or cry? Maybe all three at once.For New Zealand, though, it was the agony of defeat in one of the most painful ways possible.Again, Archer had predicted - in 2014 - how the Blackcaps would feel....It was the most incredible finish cricket - perhaps all sport - has ever seen. And it concluded a match that had absolutely everything.It had us all gripped, nervously watching through our hands or from behind sofas with hearts thumping in our chests.Nerves were jangling throughout the day as England edged closer and closer to their target of 242, which looked so distant when England slipped to 86-4.A truly remarkable ending took its first twist when, in the penultimate over, key England batsman Stokes was caught on the boundary by Trent Boult - but there was a 'catch'.Boult had inadvertently stepped on the boundary rope when grasping the ball. That meant, rather than Stokes having to slump back to the famous Lord's pavilion, six more runs were added to England's total and Stokes survived.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEngland needed 15 from the final over to win. For Stokes, this was his chance of redemption. He has had difficult times on and off the field in recent years.In 2016 he was the bowler hit for four sixes by Carlos Brathwaite in the final over of the World Twenty20 final as West Indies beat England. Sunday's final also came 11 months to the day since he was cleared of affray in court.From the third ball of the final over, the all-rounder sent Lord's into delirium. He swept fast bowler Boult into the stands for six more. England needed nine from three balls.Stokes then flicked two into the deep. It didn't look like being enough but as the throw came in, the ball hit the bat of the diving Stokes and deflected to the boundary.It was the strangest of six runs, unlike any Lord's had seen. Unlike anything cricket had ever seen.Media playback is not supported on this devicePerhaps, BBC Sport reader Adam summed it up best...But despite those runs, two run-outs came next.Nobody could believe it. After 100 overs, the teams could not be separated. The match was tied. A super over - the best of six balls - was needed to decide who would take home the trophy.While journalists up and down the land checked the specific rules, fans drew parallels with some of English sport's other nail-biting moments.At the same time, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic were battling it out in a final-set tie-break across London. The way both events built to simultaneous crescendos was impressive.It was as if the sporting gods - and Archer - had planned it all along.

sport	Cricket World Cup: David Warner hits century as Australia beat Pakistan	Cricket at last as Taunton dazzlesWarner's returnAmir's excellence in vainAmir's performance with ball was 'astonishing' - what they said	"Media playback is not supported on this deviceDavid Warner scored his first international century since serving a year-long ban for his part in the ball-tampering scandal in Australia's tense 41-run World Cup victory over Pakistan.Warner, transformed from the man who struggled in Sunday's defeat by India, busied his way to 107.With captain Aaron Finch also clubbing 82, Australia should have posted more than their 307 all out, only to lose their last six wickets for 30 runs thanks mainly to Mohammad Amir's 5-30.Facing a more reachable target than they would have once feared, Pakistan were well placed at 136-2 when their own collapse of 4-24 sucked the life from the chase.Hassan Ali hammered 32 from 15 balls and Wahab Riaz 45 from 39 balls to revive their vociferous fans, but after Wahab was given out caught behind on review off Mitchell Starc, Pakistan were bowled out for 266.Pakistan stay eighth in the 10-team table and move on to play arch-rivals India at Old Trafford on Sunday knowing that another defeat would go a long way to ending their involvement in the tournament.Australia join New Zealand at the top on six points, having played a game more than the Kiwis.Media playback is not supported on this deviceNot only was it a relief for cricket to return after two days of abandonments, it returned with a magnificent contest that fluctuated throughout.Despite the grey and chilly conditions, this was a wonderful spectacle. The intimate setting is unique for a tournament mainly being played at large arenas and the vocal spectators filled the boutique venue with noise.The match itself - played on a juicy surface that offered encouragement for the pace bowlers - was rarely lacking in entertainment.The early Australia charge was helped by some poor bowling and fielding, with Pakistan's resurgence first led by Amir and followed up by a third-wicket stand of 80 between Imam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Hafeez.After Imam gloved Pat Cummins behind, the Pakistan implosion left the crowd silent, only for raucous hope to return through the hitting of Hassan and Wahab.Just as Australia were getting desperate, Starc asked for a review against a hopping Wahab. It detected the faintest edge and, eight balls later, the game was over.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEven without the hullabaloo of the hostility that Warner's return to international cricket has attracted, the left-handed opener is having an eventful tournament.On Saturday, he was left shaken when a stroke he played in practice struck net bowler Jaykishan Plaha on the head and, the next day, his ponderous 56 from 84 balls against India drew criticism.Before this game, he was backed by Finch and responded with a characteristic performance of punchy strokes, bustling running and the occasional display of power.Finch, dropped twice, hit four leg-side sixes in their opening stand of 146 before offering a leading edge to Amir.Warner took over. When he edged Shaheen Afridi between keeper and slip, it took him to three figures and sparked an emotional celebration of his trademark leap and prolonged gestures towards the Australia dressing room.He was dropped on 104 but holed out soon after, part of an overall slide of eight wickets for 84 runs, wickets falling regularly because of Australia's inability to kick on and Pakistan's improvement.Media playback is not supported on this deviceAmir's performance was all the more outstanding because of its contrast to that of his team-mates who, bar fellow left-armer Wahab, offered little support.Ignoring fielding littered with mistakes and other bowlers who dropped too short, Amir skillfully exploited the movement with a full length and changes of pace.When Pakistan finally began holding their catches, Amir got his rewards to move to 10 wickets in the tournament, more than any other bowler.Even with Australia checked and the Imam-Hafeez partnership proving difficult to dislodge, there remained the feeling Finch's men were only ever a wicket from taking charge.So it proved. After Imam was strangled, Hafeez swept a full-toss from part-time spinner Finch to deep square leg, while both Shoaib Malik and Asif Ali edged behind.Hassan's hitting seemed nothing more than a consolation, but a stand of 64 between Wahab and Sarfaraz Ahmed left Australia in serious peril and Pakistan's supporters louder than ever.As the game got tighter, Finch took some persuading to review the decision against Wahab. He was vindicated, leaving the lethal Starc to bowl Amir and Glenn Maxwell to end the match with a direct-hit run-out of Sarfaraz.Former England batsman Michael Vaughan on TMS: ""We have seen some wonderful bowling in the tournament but that was an exhibition from Mohammad Amir. It was a masterclass of how to bowl on a pitch that was doing a bit.""It was his skill that outdid the batsmen not the conditions: 5-30 in this era is astonishing.""Ex-Pakistan bowler Waqar Younis on the TMS podcast: ""Because Amir wasn't picked initially for the World Cup, it was hurting him a lot and luckily for him some of the other fast bowlers didn't perform well against England in the World Cup so Pakistan had no choice but to pick him.""He had a point to prove and he's been bowling extremely well. That five-for will take him a long way in terms of his confidence.""Media playback is not supported on this deviceGeoff Lemon, Australian broadcaster on TMS: ""Australia have been lucky on a couple of occasions now.""Mitchell Starc saved them against West Indies and he did it again here. They were short despite hitting 307. From where they were, they should have got closer to 400.""Their batting is disjointed too. Usman Khawaja ended up coming in at number six - he's never batted at six in a List A game, let alone a World Cup match!""Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed: ""I'm very disappointed. We lost three wickets in 15 balls and that's why we lost.""We conceded too many runs in the first 20 overs apart from Mohammad Amir. We came back and restricted them well but it was a 270-280 pitch.""We made some runs and got starts but we've got to convert them and go long. If you want to win matches your top four must score runs."""
