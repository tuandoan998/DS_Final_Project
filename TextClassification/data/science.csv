science	Plastic pollution: How Ibiza is tackling its problem with waste	So, what can be done to solve the problem?	"Ibiza generated half a tonne of waste per person this year, which is 14% higher than the rest of Europe.According to figures from the Ibiza Preservation Foundation, this is double the amount per person than Spain produces as a whole.Part of the problem is that Ibiza thrives on its tourism, and in 2018 more than four million people landed on its beaches - a quarter of these were from the UK.But, campaigners say, after all the cars, crowds and yachts disappear, a huge strain is left on resources, nature, and the beauty of Ibiza.Plastic ends up in the sea and on the beaches which is harmful to the marine environment and endangered species.DJ and producer Blond:ish is popular on the Ibiza clubbing scene, but she is also well known for being a sustainability campaigner in the music industry.When she is not behind the desks, she uses her time to educate DJs, clubs and clubbers about single-use plastics, in the hope that one day she will DJ at zero-plastic shows.She says the music industry is a big source of waste, which is a particular problem on a tiny island like Ibiza.""In the summer, we can play every day and the footprint can be huge. DJing is actually a really small part of it, really we are just travellers.""Blond:ish says DJs can often travel from island to island, country to country, playing sets and urges the industry to ""take small steps like offsetting our carbon"".Offsetting carbon means travellers pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight.The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount.However, some activists criticise carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour.""We are partying in paradise, and paradises have sensitive ecosystems which can't withstand the city lifestyle,"" says Blond:ish.Through her campaign group, Bye Bye Plastic, Blond:ish also encourages artists to go plastic-free on their riders, which is the food and drink they request for backstage and in the DJ booths when they play.She said: ""Bye Bye plastic upgraded our riders to be single-use plastic-free."" She says this is a ""tiny step"" but that if DJs, agents and clubbers all pitch in, it will eventually influence the clubs.But some clubs in Ibiza are already proactively tackling pollution.Iconic night club Pacha is the first club to sign up to the Ibiza Preservation's plastic-free star rating system, gaining the first star.The scheme hopes to phase out single-use plastics in Ibiza by 2023, and rewards nightclubs that commit to banning plastics with a star.Its chief executive, Nick McCabe, says the the venue gets through more than 400,000 plastic straws, and a similar number of plastic bottles on an annual basis.Founded in 1973, Nick, says: ""Pacha is as much Ibiza as the sand and sea."" He says he hopes it continues to evolve with the island.It has already managed to eliminate straws, plastic cutlery, laundry bags and plastic food containers, but Nick says finding a solution to plastic bottles is challenging from a ""safety perspective"".He said the star rating system is an ""interesting way to feel like there is some kind of reward for companies who get board for what we should be doing anyway"".Tourists are getting involved, too.Ed Pronc is Dutch but has been holidaymaking in Ibiza with his partner for years.He was shocked into creating a ""plastic-picker catamaran"" after he and his partner went for a ride on their boat, and ended up finding a sea turtle trapped in plastic.""We let it free,"" he said, ""but after that, we noticed there was a lot of plastic floating around.""Now, Ed and his partner go out with a team of volunteers every single day to collect rubbish.After only an hour of picking, Ed says he can typically find every type of plastic imaginable, from plastic bottles, to food sacks, wiring, ropes, razors and tooth brushes.He said they also find ""refrigerator doors occasionally"" too.""I know if we hit the right spots we can collect 10, 20, 30 bags of plastics every day,"" says Ed.He notes that 130,000 people live on the island here all year round, and they are saddened by the way it is ""abused"".Ed says anyone with an ""active conscience"" shouldn't be able to throw or even drink from a plastic bottle anymore.Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
science	Cut air pollution to fight climate change - UN	Focus on CO2Double troubleCommon air pollutantsOzone problemChallenges ahead	"Getting countries to cut down greenhouse gases that cause global warming is proving an uphill task.But convincing them to clean their air for public health has been easier - and that could help fight climate change as well, UN officials have told the BBC.They say an international effort to cut down air pollution is showing some promise with regards to warming gases.The global effort to tackle emissions will be debated on Monday at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York.The Climate and Clean Air Coalition was formed by six countries.The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) hosts the secretariat of the coalition, which was formed in 2012 and today counts more than 100 governments as members.""We have seen that countries are forthcoming to join this initiative as it is about immediate public health,"" says Jian Liu, Unep's chief scientist.""And it has co-benefits: air quality and the climate.""So, can we really tackle both problems with a single effort?While some of the gases tick both boxes, others are air pollutants without a warming effect, and vice versa.When scientists talk about cutting down greenhouse gases that are blamed for warming the planet, they are mainly targeting carbon dioxide (CO2).That is because it amounts to nearly two-thirds of emissions and can stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years.Last year, it reached 411 parts per million (ppm) at Hawaii's Mauna Loa Atmospheric Baseline Observatory, the highest monthly average ever recorded.Some experts say 350ppm is the safe limit while others argue 400ppm should be the reasonable target.Burning of fossil fuels, wood and solid waste leads to CO2 emissions. Some industrial processes and land-use changes, including deforestation, also lead to emission of this major greenhouse gas.But because the world's economy still largely runs on fossil fuels, energy politics has severely hindered progress in CO2 emissions reduction to fight climate change.But scientists say there are other gases that pollute the air and also warm the planet.Black carbon and methane are air pollutants that are also responsible for 30-40% of global warming, according to atmospheric scientists with Unep.The sectors that produce the vast majority of greenhouse gases - energy, transport, industry, agriculture, waste management and land use - are also the main sources of these air pollutants.So curbing their emissions, experts say, will help people's health and also that of the planet.They are also known as Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SCLP).""Acting swiftly to reduce SCLP emissions will benefit human health immediately and slow the rate of near-term warming - benefits that will mostly be felt in the regions where emissions are reduced,"" according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO).SLCP emissions could reduce warming by as much as 0.6C by 2050, it adds, while avoiding 2.4 million premature deaths from ambient air pollution annually by 2030.The UN health agency estimates that air pollution inside and outside the home contributes to around seven million premature deaths worldwide.More than four million of these deaths are caused by outdoor air pollution.The most common outdoor air pollutants are fine airborne particles, which are broken down into categories known as PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, based on size.Respiratory infections, heart disease, lung cancer and even brain development impairment have been linked to PM2.5.These are fine particles, measuring one-thirtieth the diameter of a human hair, that can reach lungs and bloodstream if inhaled.While particulate matter counts as an air pollutant, one of its components - black carbon - is a short-lived climate pollutant.Its deposition on snowfields has also been blamed for absorbing sunlight and accelerating melting.There are currently no national or international regulatory obligations to monitor, measure or report releases of black carbon, WHO officials say.Another invisible combination of pollutants is ground level ozone that comes from traffic, landfill, agriculture and other sources.One of ozone's precursors is nitrogen oxide, which comes from fossil fuel combustion. This has been liked to bronchitis in asthmatic children, reducing their lung function.But it is also a greenhouse gas.For more on the UK's efforts to tackle CO2 emissions, download the BBC Briefing on energy. Part of a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, it has input from academics, researchers and journalists and is the BBC's response to demands for better explanation of the facts behind the headlines.""The theory that if you cut down air pollution, it will help in reducing emissions of some of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change is quite sound,"" said Lesley Ott, an atmospheric scientist with Nasa.""So, for instance, if you could make your power plants less polluting, you cut down emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as reduce air pollution.""But you will still have to tackle the issue of cutting down CO2 emissions because that is the main greenhouse gas we are emitting and that remains in the atmosphere for long time.""Experts say the Paris climate agreement does not require countries to report on their steps to reduce SLCPs.Under the agreement that aims to keep global warming well below two degrees compared to pre-industrial times, countries are required to submit reports on their actions to mitigate climate change.It is legally non-binding requirement.""Meeting the targets of the Paris agreement is likely impossible without cutting SLCP emissions,"" said Jian Liu.Although UN officials are glad that countries support cutting down air pollutants that could also lead to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, they admit lack of reporting and monitoring remains a major challenge.Follow Navin on Twitter."
science	Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plastic		"The world is beginning to tackle the threat of plastic waste, according to the renowned broadcaster Sir David Attenborough.""I think we're all shifting our behaviour, I really do,"" Sir David said in an interview with the BBC.Describing plastic pollution as ""vile"" and ""horrid"", he said there was growing awareness of the damage it can do.""I think we are changing our habits, and the world is waking up to what we've done to the planet,"" he said.Sir David was speaking as he and the BBC's Natural History Unit (NHU) were announced as the winners of the prestigious Chatham House Prize for their Blue Planet II series of documentaries.Chatham House, a foreign affairs think-tank based in London, awards the prize to people or organisations making a significant contribution to improving international relations.Its director, Dr Robin Niblett, described plastic pollution as ""one of the gravest challenges facing the world's oceans"".End of Youtube post by BBCHe said Sir David and the BBC Studios Natural History Unit played ""an instrumental role in helping to put this issue at the forefront of the public agenda"".""Blue Planet II spurred a passionate global response and generated clear behavioural and policy change.""The series revealed how plastic items - estimated to total more than 150 million tonnes - are drifting in the world's oceans and causing the deaths of one million birds and 100,000 sea mammals each year.In one of the most moving scenes, albatrosses were seen feeding their chicks a diet of plastic which would doom them to die.The head of the NHU, Julian Hector, said he believed the programmes had ""struck a chord"" with the public because they showed ""the interaction of plastic and the natural world"".""We're emotionally engaging the audience, giving them a connection with life histories, the behaviours, the plans that these animals have got, and how plastic in that case is getting in their way, reducing their chicks' survival.""For Sir David, these sights are ""very powerful - they speak to parental instinct""; and they seem to have helped motivate people to take action.""It's the beginning, and people in all parts of society are aware of what's happening, and it's vile, it's horrid and it's something we are clearly seeing inflicted on the natural world and having a dreadful effect and there's something they can do about it.""So in a way it's a bit of a litmus test to see if the population care about it and people do.""Sir David said that techniques needed to be devised for handling plastic waste.""We still need to know how to dispose of the wretched material, surely if we can invent it, somebody somewhere is going to be able to deal with it, to deal with these mountains of this appalling material.""Also nominated for the Chatham House Prize were Abiy Ahmed, prime minister of Ethiopia, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize; and Katrín Jakobsdóttir, prime minister of Iceland for her commitment to gender equality.Sir David's current series with the BBC NHU - Seven Worlds, One Planet - is broadcast on BBC One on Sunday nights.Follow David on Twitter."
science	Plastic pollution: Flip-flop tide engulfs 'paradise' island		"Close to a million plastic shoes, mainly flip flops are among the torrent of debris washed up on an ""unspoilt paradise"" in the Indian Ocean.Scientists estimated that the beaches of Australia's Cocos (Keeling) Islands are strewn with around 414 million pieces of plastic pollution.They believe some 93% of it lies buried under the sand, say the researchers.They are concerned that the scale of concealed plastic debris is being underestimated worldwide.Nearly half the plastic manufactured since the product was developed six decades ago has been made in the past 13 years, say scientists.Through failings in waste management, much of it has ended up in the oceans, with one estimate suggesting that there are now more pieces of plastic in the seas than there are stars in the Milky Way.This latest assessment will add to the feeling that the world hasn't yet fully appreciated the scale of the problem.The research team surveyed the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, a horseshoe chain of 26 small land masses 2,100km north-west of Australia.Around 600 people live in these remote places, which are sometimes described as ""Australia's last unspoilt paradise"".The researchers found that oceanic currents are depositing huge amounts of plastic on the beaches of these atolls.They calculated that the islands are littered with 238 tonnes of plastic, including 977,000 shoes and 373,000 toothbrushes. These were among the identifiable elements in an estimated 414 million pieces of debris.The scientists believe their overall finding is conservative, as they weren't able to access some beaches known to be hotspots of pollution.Of particular concern to the authors of the report is the amount of material they believe is buried up to 10cm below the surface. This accounted for around 93% of the estimated volume.The lead author Jennifer Lavers told BBC News that, based on what she had seen on the Cocos Islands and what she has found previously on another remote island called Henderson in the Pacific, the world has ""drastically underestimated"" the scale of this problem.The finding may also help explain a significant gap in our understanding of plastic pollution.""Over the years, over the decades, we know how much plastic we put out into the ocean. But when we've done some sampling to try and figure out how much is floating in the surface layers and things like that, there actually seems to be a bit of a mismatch between what we think we've put out there, and what we find,"" said Dr Lavers, from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania.""So there's this missing plastic where we don't actually know where it's gone. So for me, when I found out that so much of the debris on Cocos was buried, I had a little kind of a light bulb moment where I thought, perhaps this is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle.""Valiant attempts to clean up beaches by volunteers are literally, scratching the surface of the problem. Researchers are concerned that this wealth of buried plastic could threaten wildlife living or nesting in beach sediments, such as sea turtles and crustaceans.""It wasn't a huge surprise to me, it's simply that the surveys done up until now have looked at the surface and its obviously a lot of time and effort to dig deeper,"" said Dr Chris Tuckett, from the Marine Conservation Society, who wasn't involved with the study.""Plastic obviously breaks down into smaller pieces over time and smaller pieces will sink through the sand and settle in sub-surface layers. In hot regions, the combination of warm temperatures and high salinity is likely to make plastic items break up into pieces more quickly, although it won't disappear entirely.""Attempts to clear this concealed plastic would require major mechanical disturbance which might prove even more damaging to wildlife.The lead author hopes that her findings will bring home to people that prevention is far better than cure when it comes to plastic pollution.""My hope is that the Cocos provide an opportunity for people to kind of see themselves in the debris on the beach, and feel that sense of connection or ownership and realise that if they changed their behaviour, their consumption patterns, if they kind of fought for policy or legislation, if they went out and helped their neighbour, they could potentially have a beneficial flow on effects.""Dr Lavers says she has avoided plastic in her own life for the past 10 years.""In a decade, I've never used a plastic toothbrush, I don't use plastic bags of any shape, size, denomination or source. I don't do any of these things. And yet, it's no longer a conscious decision. It's just part of my day to day life. It's just who I am.""It's like quitting smoking. At first, it's hard, and you have to think about it. But then you don't think about it anymore. It's just part of your day-to-day actions. You just don't smoke anymore. I just don't use plastic anymore. I just don't.""The new study has been published in the journal Scientific Reports.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	What does air pollution do to our bodies?	Asthma attackGreater challengesBody of evidence	"The countdown has begun to the launch of one of the world's boldest attempts to tackle air pollution.From next Monday, thousands of drivers face paying a new charge to enter central London.The aim is to deter the dirtiest vehicles in an effort to reduce diseases and premature deaths.The initiative comes as scientists say the impacts of air pollution are more serious than previously thought.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC the threat of air pollution, which is mostly invisible to the naked eye, was ""a public health emergency"".He added: ""One of the things that has troubled me is that because we can't see the particulate matter, the nitrogen dioxide, the poison, you don't take it seriously.""But over the last few decades, research has revealed how gases like nitrogen dioxide and tiny particles, known as particulate matter or PM, can reach deep into the body with the danger of causing lasting damage.How polluting are idling cars and buses?Wood burners under fire in clean air planThe most obvious effects are on our breathing - anyone suffering from asthma, for example, is more likely to be at risk, because dirty air can cause chronic problems and also trigger an attack.""I had to stay up one night because my chest was really bad because [of] all the polluted air,"" 10-year-old Alfie told me. ""I couldn't go to sleep and my mum had to stay awake.""""All that polluted air can hurt your lungs, it can even damage you brain, it can damage nearly everything in your body,"" he said.A pupil at Haimo Primary School in Eltham, close to London's busy South Circular Road, Alfie is one of 300 children across the capital taking part in unique research.The project involves each child wearing an air-monitoring backpack, specially built by Dyson and fitted with instruments to measure nitrogen dioxide and the smallest particles, called PM2.5.One motivation for the work is that breathing in dirty air at an early age can have implications that last a lifetime.Research has shown that children growing up in heavily polluted streets have smaller lung capacity than those in cleaner areas - on average by 5% according to a study in London - a limitation that cannot be reversed.And air pollution can exacerbate other respiratory conditions too, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and lung cancer is thought to be linked as well.Dr Ben Barrett of King's College London, who is running the backpack research, says that children born in a more polluted environment face greater challenges in life.""It's not necessarily that there's a particular disease that they develop but their body is less able to cope with those challenges as they go into adolescence and into old age.""Another pathway to harm is opened up when the smallest particles find their way into the depths of the lungs, to the alveoli, from where oxygen is transferred into the bloodstream.It's been established that PM2.5 particles are small enough to make that transition as well, entering the cardiovascular system and circulating throughout the body.The risks of this include the potential for blocking the arteries, increasing the danger of stroke, along with heart disease and heart attacks.Beyond that, there's evidence that the particles can reach the brain so researchers are investigating the potential effects on conditions such as dementia.London's dirty air: How bad is it?Major cities move to ban diesel vehiclesA major Chinese study last year proposed a connection between pollution and lowered cognitive performance, while a British study published last week suggested a link to psychotic episodes in teenagers.According to Prof Jonathan Grigg of Queen Mary University London, a leading figure in research into the effects of air pollution on children, the evidence for wide-ranging impacts is growing.""We're absolutely certain that air pollution is associated with respiratory disease such as asthma and with cardiovascular disease with heart attacks and strokes, and in five years we'll be more certain about other conditions like dementia and obesity.""One new area of research is the hunt for an explanation for why babies in the most polluted areas tend to be born more prematurely and underweight compared with those born elsewhere.A small study, still under way, is investigating placentas and has found black dots that look similar to pollution particles spotted in lung cells.One of the researchers involved in the work, Norrice Liu, also at Queen Mary University, said the placenta would be expected to provide a sterile environment so the sight of black dots was a surprise.""We know what pollution particles look like when they're in the cells elsewhere in the body particularly in the lungs, and the black bits that we're seeing in the placenta are a very similar shape and colour to those what making us think they could be pollution particles.""Their presence does not prove a link with premature birth or lower birthweight but it does suggest a possible mechanism.Fifteen young mothers have so far agreed to donate their placentas to the study, and one of them, Rachel Buswell, told me that of all her concerns while pregnant, air pollution was not one of them.""It's pretty scary,"" she said, ""you protect yourself when you find out you're pregnant in as many ways as you can and that's going to be something people can't protect themselves as easily, living in London especially, it is quite frightening."""
science	Only one in 50 people have nights free from light pollution		"Just one in 50 people in England experiences nights that are free from light pollution, according to the results of a survey.The work, carried out for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), suggests the situation has not improved since it raised the issue 12 years ago.The group says everyone should be able to witness the glory of a starry night.More than half the people taking part said they couldn’t see more than 10 stars in the constellation Orion.The self-selecting survey asked 2,300 people to count the stars in this constellation as a measure of light pollution in their area.But the CPRE can’t be sure how similar the group of people completing the last survey was to the one carrying out this one.Just a 10th of people could count up to 30 stars, whereas the Royal Observatory in Greenwich says that up to 40 could be visible to someone with a sharp eye on a clear night.Only 2% of participants had truly dark skies which allowed them to see more than 30 stars.That’s half the level of the previous Star Count in 2014.A record 2,300 people took part in the count, and the group says government, councils and the public should treat the issue more seriously.Stargazing is not the only reason for craving the darkness: artificial light at night can rob people of their sleep and harm health. It can also have disruptive effects on wildlife.Emma Marrington from the CPRE said the authorities should dim lights wherever feasible.She also urged house-holders not to leave on outdoor lights overnight. Leaving them on has become increasingly affordable with the widespread use of LEDs.Ms Marrington said: “Light doesn’t respect boundaries, and careless use can see it spread for miles from towns, cities, businesses and motorways.“That results in the loss of one of the countryside’s most magical sights – a dark, starry night sky.”Some councils have responded previously by switching off street lights after midnight, which had the added benefit of saving cash.But they often faced accusations of putting people’s safety at risk.The Local Government Association told BBC News it didn’t have a position on light pollution.Highways England said it had revised its policies on lighting. A spokesperson told us: ""We have a better understanding of where night-time accidents occur and the impact road lighting would have, so we can now be more precise about what sections need to be lit rather than a blanket lighting approach.""Risk assessments will be carried out the determine the need for the lighting. If there is no case to keep it will be de-commissioned.""Follow Roger Harrabinon Twitter."
science	Air pollution: How damaging are idling cars and buses?		"Public Health England has been talking about the steps that can be taken to reduce air pollution.One of its recommendations is to stop vehicles idling close to places such as schools and hospitals.There has been relatively little research into how common a phenomenon idling outside schools is.It is clear, however, that when looking at the impact, the sort of vehicle involved is crucial, with considerably lower emissions generally coming from newer vehicles.Many modern cars and buses have stop-start systems, which automatically switch off the engine when a vehicle stops, although those may be disabled.A project commissioned by the Mayor of London's office in 2016 measured changes in pollution after a series of ""action days"", during which teams of volunteers patrolled the streets in four areas of London, asking drivers to turn off their engines.They found levels of black carbon - a pollutant associated with car exhausts, which has been linked to lung and heart disease - were 36% lower after these ""action days"" next to a primary school in Wandsworth.But the results were not so conclusive in every area - in the City of London there was a 33% increase on the first test day and a 22% decrease on the second.The researchers said the Wandsworth location was particularly well-suited to the study, whereas in the more central locations, vans and lorries spread out along the street rather than being concentrated in one location. This made it harder to measure a strong signal.The report said that idling at school gates was ""a problem across the capital and it was pleasing to see the greatest reduction in concentrations"" outside the school.A piece of research in the US, published in 2013, looked at air quality in four schools before and after campaigns to stop vehicles idling.It found that there had been significant reductions in air pollution at the schools with more buses - those with fewer buses did not see a significant reduction in the concentration of air pollutants.Local authorities in the UK already have the power to issue fixed penalty notices to motorists in parked vehicles who refuse to turn off their engines when asked.The emissions consultancy Cambustion has looked at when it is worth switching of engines to reduce emissions.It found that for emissions of nitrogen oxide from a diesel car meeting Euro 5 requirements (that is broadly any diesel car made before late 2015) it is worth switching off the engine if you expect to be stationary for at least 30 seconds.For Euro 6 diesel cars (those manufactured after 2015) it is worth switching off if you are not going to move for three seconds.The company also told the BBC that the most emissions come from a completely cold start at the beginning of the day and for hard accelerating. Speed bumps cause particularly high emissions because of this.The body which produces national health guidance, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, could not find strong evidence that linked changes in driving style to changes in ambient air pollution. But it also agreed that encouraging people to change their driving style was ""unlikely to have any negative effects"".Transport for London says it tells its bus drivers to turn off their engines at bus stands and when regulating the service, and adds that it will ensure all buses in London have zero-emission engines by 2037.FirstGroup, which operates local bus services around the UK, says it encourages drivers to turn off their engines ""where possible"", and that its newer vehicles' engines will automatically cut out if they are idle for a certain period of time.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

science	New hope for one of world's most endangered reptiles		"Baby crocodiles found living in a remote region of Nepal give hope for the future of one of the rarest and strangest reptiles on earth.With its distinctive long thin snout, the gharial is unique but critically endangered, with fewer than a thousand adults remaining in the wild.The discovery of 100 hatchlings is a boost for the potential recovery of the species, according to scientists.The crocodile is clinging to survival in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.Revealing details of the find, researcher Rikki Gumbs of ZSL (Zoological Society of London) said it was amazing to find the baby crocodiles basking on a sand bank in Bardia National Park.""Given the species is limited to around five populations across its entire range, this is such a positive discovery, and a critical step for the long-term recovery of the species in Nepal,"" he said.""After trekking through the jungle for hours to sit on a ridge and finally catch a glimpse of the hatchlings below us - it was an incredible moment to capture,"" said Ashish Bashyal, who leads the conservation project in Nepal.""At around 30cm in size, they look exactly like miniature versions of adult gharials - so incredibly cute,"" he said.The 100 baby crocs, together with three adult females and one adult male, were discovered in June, but details are only now being revealed to aid conservation efforts. The crocodile has not been sighted in the area in 30 years.There is encouraging news in that the hatchlings have recently been spotted again after the monsoon rain.""They've made it through the first big hurdle,"" Rikki Gumbs told BBC News. ""Especially with the threats that are impacting the species, it's very important that these hatchlings can make it to adulthood.""Once present across much of the Indian subcontinent, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is virtually extinct across much of its former range, with fewer than 100 adult crocodiles remaining in Nepal and several fragmented populations in India. Only one other breeding population is known in Nepal, at Chitwan National Park.The crocodile poses little danger to humans. Hunting and egg collection are now prohibited, but severe pressures remain, including loss of habitat due to the construction of dams, as well as pollution, fishing, agriculture and predation from another species of crocodile found in Nepal.Adult gharials are large, with males reaching over 5 metres in length and 250kg in weight. Males develop a lump on the end of their snouts, known as a gharas, which gives the species its name.The gharial is ranked at number 17 on ZSL's EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) of Existence programme Reptiles list.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Watch how air pollution moves across Europe		"This is what pollution looks like on a European scale.The animation shows the concentration and movement through the atmosphere of nitrogen dioxide.NO₂ is a problem gas that is produced primarily by vehicle exhausts and industrial activity via the burning of fossil fuels.The map covers a sample period from 5 to 10 January, and describes the behaviour of NO₂ at ground level on an hourly basis.The worst air quality peaks in the white.This fascinating insight was produced for the BBC by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), which is based at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in Reading.To make this type of animation, CAMS incorporates satellite observations and surface measurements.But as extensive as these data-sets have now become, they don't give a complete, real-time picture.So, the scientists must also marry the sensor information with models - of how the atmosphere moves and what the weather is doing.One of the first things you'll notice in the animation is the prevalence of NO₂ emanating from the ""usual suspects"".""What you immediately see are the larger cities. You see Madrid, you see Paris, you see Moscow, you see London,"" explains Richard Engelen, the deputy head of CAMS.""Then you'll see more industrial areas, like Germany but also in the UK. You'll see too those areas where there are very dense traffic infrastructures, such as the Netherlands and Belgium where you have a lot of traffic from the two main ports at Rotterdam and Antwerp. These are the emission sources that always pop up,"" he told BBC News.Notice also the line of emissions streaming away from the Strait of Gibraltar as ships line up to navigate their passage into and out of the Mediterranean; and look at how the two great mountain ranges of Europe, the Pyrenees and the Alps, act as barriers to the movement of pollution.In northern Italy, the Alps works to trap NO₂ emissions generated in the Po Valley, giving the region among the dirtiest air in Europe.If the animation demonstrates one thing it is that pollution has no respect for national boundaries.CAMS' mission is to deliver a continuous flow of data on the quality of the air - and not just for NO₂, but a range of other pollutants (and greenhouse gases).The service's products will find their way into smartphone apps that the public and businesses can use. And, of course, all the information is made available to policy-makers so they can take steps to clean up the atmosphere.Vincent-Henri Peuch, the head of CAMS, commented: ""We are unique in the world in terms of the observations that we acquire. To deliver the CAMS products, we build on top of all of the observations that are acquired for numerical weather prediction; and the amount of satellite and in-situ data that we get has no equivalent.""It's a very good example of pulling together resources at a European level in order to provide products that no single country on its own could develop.""Copernicus is an initiative of the European Union.The British government has stated its desire to continue its involvement in the programme after Brexit.Under EU law, the average hourly level of NO₂ must not exceed 200 micrograms per cubic metre of air more than 18 times in a year; and the NO₂ annual mean value may must not exceed 40 micrograms per cubic metre.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: China coal surge threatens Paris targets		"While the rest of the world has cut coal-based electricity over the past 18 months, China has added enough to power 31 million homes.That's according to a study that says China is now in the process of building or reviving coal equivalent to the EU's entire generating capacity.China is also financing around a quarter of all proposed coal plants outside its borders.Researchers say the surge is a major threat to the Paris climate targets.China's reliance on coal as a key step in developing the economy led to the fabled ""one coal plant a week"" building programme between 2006 and 2015.But the push had many negative consequences, choking the air with pollution in many Chinese cities and leading to huge overcapacity. Many of these plants were only able to run 50% of the time.In 2015, in an attempt to curb the growth, the national government tried to clamp down on new-build coal. However, it continued to allow provincial governments the freedom to issue permits for new coal plants. That move misfired badly.Local authorities subsequently permitted up to five times more plants than in any comparable period.According to Ted Nace, from coal researchers Global Energy Monitor, it was like a ""snake swallowing a goat"".""This goat that the snake swallowed is still moving through the snake, and it's coming out in the form of another 20% in the Chinese coal fleet on top of a fleet that was already over-built,"" Mr Nace added.The researchers say that through 2018 and up to June 2019, countries outside of China cut their coal power capacity by 8.1 gigawatts (GW). In the same period, China added 43GW, enough to power around 31 million homes.The authors say that right now the amount of coal power under construction or under suspension and likely to be revived is about 147.7GW, an amount that is almost the same as the entire coal generating capacity of the European Union (150GW).Compared to the rest of the world, China is building about 50% more coal plants than are under construction in all other countries combined.The country is on track to top 1,100GW of coal by 2020.The Chinese government has signalled that it wants to rely less on coal for the country's energy production and is making some headway cutting coal's share of total energy from 68% in 2012 to 59% in 2018.However, despite the share going down, absolute coal consumption has gone up in line with overall energy demand.What concerns the researchers is that within China, coal and electricity industry groups are pushing for an even bigger increase in the country's overall coal power capacity.""The thing we are super worried about is that industry has actually organised to keep the whole thing going,"" said Ted Nace.""There are three different powerful trade groups, proposing to increase the coal fleet by 40%. This is sheer madness at this point.""China is also busy financing coal development outside the country, funding over a quarter of all the coal plants outside its borders in countries like South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh.Observers outside of China say they are concerned that by building or permitting these plants, the authorities are locking in a form of power generation that just doesn't make sense economically.""The economics will not be borne out,"" said Mark Lewis, head of climate change investment research at BNP Paribas Asset Management.""I would argue that almost all this new capacity that's being added will never make the economic return on which they have been premised. Those assets that are coming online now will have to be written down; they will be stranded assets essentially.""The bigger question is how this new coal will affect the ability of the world to meet the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement.The researchers say that by 2030, China needs to reduce its coal power capacity by over 40% from current levels in order to meet the reductions required to hold global warming well below 2C.""China's proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris Agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach, even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet,"" said co-author Christine Shearer of Global Energy Monitor.""Instead of expanding further, China needs to make significant reductions to its coal fleet over the coming decade.""Global Energy Monitor was originally known as Coal Swarm and has received funding from environmental groups, including the ClimateWorks Foundation, the Rockefeller Family fund, the US National Resources Defence Council, the European Climate Foundation, among others.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Pollution threatens the future of killer whales	What is the outlook for orcas?The curse of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBsWhy are the animals so exposed?How do we tackle the PCB legacy?Can we help the orcas themselves?	"Killer whales are in deep trouble because of persistent chemical pollution in the environment, researchers say.A new study suggests the long-term viability of more than half of the different orca groups around the globe is now in question.Some populations, such as those around the UK, the Strait of Gibraltar, off Brazil, Japan and California, are almost certainly doomed.The assessment is in Science magazine.The issue is polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.These chemical compounds were once manufactured in vast quantities, and used in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment and sealants. But they are highly toxic and although banned decades ago have amassed in the environment, leaching into the ocean.Killer whales, or orcas, are top predators so they absorb all the PCB pollution taken in by the different prey in their food chain - from fish, right up to seals and sharks.The PCBs stunt the ovaries of female orcas, limiting their ability to produce calves. The chemicals also suppress the immune system.The new study models the future of the killer whales' reproductive success and survivability against the chemical challenge.For those populations living in clean waters, it is positive. Orcas in places like the Antarctic and the Arctic should increase their numbers.But for those living in the most polluted seas, the next 30-50 years will be grim.The killer whales that live on the west coast of Scotland, for example, are now down to just eight individuals and they have not produced a calf in more than 20 years.Paul Jepson, from the Zoological Society of London, says this group will ""disappear in my lifetime"".""Over 50% of the populations that we've got data for will actually collapse in our model,"" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme.""PCBs are such highly toxic chemicals, and they persist in the environment. And it's the killer whales that have by a long way the highest exposures now of any species on Earth; certainly any mammalian species.""Everything in this story works against the killer whales.Not only do they accumulate contaminants because of their position as top predators, but the toxic effects hit them where they are particularly vulnerable - in their ability to reproduce.These are animals that take a long time to reach sexual maturity and even then have perhaps one calf every few years. This puts very precise pressure on a population.In addition, PCBs are soluble in fat - and killer whales are extremely fat-rich animals. A mother's milk will be loaded with PCBs which she will pass on to her offspring during lactation.Most PCBs have yet to be destroyed or safely stored away.Some countries have done better than others. In the US, where federal ""superfunds"" have been used to clean up the most heavily contaminated sites, PCB levels entering the ocean have come down.But there needs to be much more urgency in places such as Europe.""Improper disposal of PCB-containing equipment in landfills may lead to leakage and leaching of PCBs into nearby streams, river, estuaries, and ocean,"" said lead author on the new report, Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, Denmark.""We know that PCBs were used in paints and sealants in old buildings and for outer coating on ships, so if contaminated building materials are improperly disposed of they could also reach the environment, and demolition of buildings may cause PCBs to enter the air.""There is very little that can be done to recover the PCBs once they have reached the ocean. And the robustness of the chemicals means they will hang around in the environment for a very long time.But there are parallel problems we could conceivably fix, said co-author Ailsa Hall from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University, UK.""We should recognise that this is just one of many stresses on the animals,"" she told BBC News.""There are things such as noise, changes in habitat, changes in the availability of prey - that we do have influence over. And if we do something about these factors, maybe we can reduce the overall burden of stress, and perhaps then our predictions won't be so dire.""Paul Jepson added: ""I don't think there'll ever be another PCB story.""I think the chemical industries have learnt the lesson - we know that being fat-soluble is a big risk factor, because that allows things to bioaccumulate.""So, nowadays, no chemical with those properties would be allowed. But PCBs are so difficult to get rid of that we'll be dealing with the legacy for a long time.""Follow on Twitter: @BBCAmos and @Vic_Gill"
science	Climate change: Speed limits for ships can have 'massive' benefits		"Cutting the speed of ships has huge benefits for humans, nature and the climate, according to a new report.A 20% reduction would cut greenhouse gases but also curb pollutants that damage human health such as black carbon and nitrogen oxides.This speed limit would cut underwater noise by 66% and reduce the chances of whale collisions by 78%.UN negotiators will meet in London this week to consider proposals to curb maritime speeds.Ships, of all sorts and sizes, transport around 80% of the world's goods by volume. However they are also responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse emissions thanks to the burning of fuel.Shipping generates roughly 3% of the global total of warming gases - that's roughly the same quantity as emitted by Germany.While shipping wasn't covered by the Paris climate agreement, last year the industry agreed to cut emissions by 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels.This new study, carried out for campaign groups Seas at Risk and Transport & Environment builds on existing research that suggests that slowing down ships is a good idea if you want to curb greenhouse gases.The report though also considers a range of other impacts of a speed cut such as on air pollution and marine noise.As ships travel more slowly they burn less fuel, which means there are also savings in black carbon, sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The last two in particular have serious impacts on human health, particularly in cities and coastal areas close to shipping lanes.The report found that cutting ship speed by 20% would cut sulphur and nitrogen oxides by around 24%. There are also significant reductions in black carbon, which are tiny black particles contained in the smoke from ship exhausts.Cutting black carbon helps limit climate warming in the Arctic region because when ships burn fuel in the icy northern waters, the particles often fall on snow, and restrict its ability to reflect back sunlight, which accelerates heating in the Arctic region.The study also says that a 20% cut in speed would reduce noise pollution by two thirds - while the same speed limitation would reduce the chances of a ship colliding with a whale by 78%.""It's a massive win, win, win, win,"" said John Maggs from Seas at Risk.""We've got a win from a climate point of view, we've got a win from a human health point of view, we've got a win for marine nature, we've got a potential safety gain, and up to a certain point we are saving the shipping industry money.""It is also of course by far the simplest of the regulatory options. Thanks to satellites and transponders on commercial vessels it really is quite easy to track their movements and the speed they are travelling.""Proposals to reduce the speed of ships are among the ideas that will be considered at this week's meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London.Experts believe that in the medium to long term, the industry will move to alternative fuels. But there is considerable pressure, including from many countries and shipping companies, for effective short term measures to curb emissions.One proposal from France would focus on oil tankers and bulk carriers but not container or cruise ships. Denmark is proposing that the industry has a goal-based standard, where it is up to the individual shipping companies as to how they meet it.Many shipping companies are in favour of slowing down.""Slow steaming not only reduces the fuel costs but its application does not require time-consuming procedures as it can be implemented instantly, it requires no investment from ship owners, can be easily monitored and is the most efficient means of slashing CO2 emissions,"" said Ioanna Procopiou, a Greek shipping company owner.But the idea is not supported by some of the biggest names in the trade.""Maersk remains opposed to speed limits,"" said Simon Christopher Bergulf, who is Regulatory Affairs Director with the giant Danish shipping conglomerate.""We rather support the principle of applying power limitation measures. Focusing on power instead of speed limits will help deliver on the CO2 reduction targets set by the IMO, whilst rewarding the most efficient ships.""What gives campaigners hope is that shipping has already tried out the concept of going slow - back in 2008, during the global financial crisis, cargo ships slowed down to cut costs. With average speeds dropping by 12% this helped cut daily fuel consumption by 27%, which equated to a significant drop in emissions.Campaigners believe that whatever decision the IMO eventually comes to will involve slower steaming.""The short term measure, whatever it is, is going to reduce ship speed,"" said John Maggs.""We think the best way to do this most effectively is with a direct speed limit, whether we get that or not is unknown, but ships will have to slow down in the future.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Major sewage pollution incidents increase		"Water companies are still not doing enough to protect streams and rivers, the Environment Agency reports.It says whilst general water quality is higher than it's been for 100 years, the number of the worst pollution incidents has actually grown.Most of these involved raw or partly treated sewage flowing into watercourses.The industry body, Water UK, says its members will have invested around £25bn by 2020 to protect the environment.Pollution incidents have continued, though, and often in the past wealthy water utilities appeared to shrug off relatively small pollution fines.Now, after an appeal by the agency, sentencing has been revised and last year fines for pollution totalled £21m.The agency's new report on England's water courses says urgent improvement is especially needed from South West Water. It also says Northumbrian Water hasn't properly controlled pollution from industries in its area.The report says there is no firm pattern among the pollution incidents. The main factors are inadequate monitoring and management, and shortcomings in risk assessment, operational practice and the attitude of staff.Emma Howard Boyd, the agency's chair, told BBC News: ""Pollution events cause distress to local communities, blight our rivers and beaches and damage the reputation of the industry. The continuing poor performance of South West Water is unacceptable.""Thames Water, meanwhile, was the one company that failed to meet the security of supply measure. This is partly down to on-going failure to plug leaks.The government's infrastructure advisers have warned that more must be done to protect people in the south east from drought as the population grows and the climate warms.Ms Howard Boyd says all firms need to improve their planning for climate change in anticipation of more droughts and more floods through the year.Michael Roberts, chief executive of Water UK, responded: ""This report rightly highlights that the majority of the companies in the sector have a 'good' or 'leading' performance when it comes to protecting and enhancing the environment.""In addition, the water industry has invested well over £2.5bn since the 1990s to protect UK bathing waters, with the result that two-thirds of UK beaches are now classed as excellent, compared with less than a third 25 years ago.""Northumbrian Water says its record on sewage pollution incidents is good. But Richard Warneford, wastewater director, acknowledged: ""Our performance on Discharge Permit Compliance (for firms emitting pollution) was disappointing this (last) year.""But six months into 2018, with zero compliance failures, we are confident in turning previous issues around.""South West Water says the way the statistics are compiled makes them look bad unfairly, but concedes fully the need to do more. It has an action plan in place to drive improvement, the company adds.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
science	50 nations 'curbing plastic pollution'		"More than 50 nations are taking action to reduce plastic pollution, says the UN in the biggest report so far.India will eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022, with an immediate ban in urban Delhi.The pledge from a nation of 1.3 billion people is the most ambitious of the global plans against plastic pollution.The UN report also reveals that the Galapagos will ban single-use plastics, Sri Lanka will ban styrofoam and China is insisting on biodegradable bags.But the authors warn that far more needs to be done to reduce the vast flow of plastic into rivers and oceans.Action against plastic waste has many drivers across the world. In the UK it has been stimulated by media coverage.In many developing countries, plastic bags are causing floods by blocking drains, or they’re being eaten by cattle.The report says policies to combat plastic waste have had mixed results. In Cameroon, plastic bags are banned and households are paid for every kilo of plastic waste they collect, but still plastic bags are being smuggled in.In several countries, rules on plastic exist but are poorly enforced.The report presents an A-Z of 35 potential bio substitutes for plastic. It runs from Abaca hemp (from the inedible banana Musa textilis) to Zein (from a maize protein).The list includes rabbit fur, sea grass and foam made with fungus. It mentions QMilch, a firm that create casein textile fibres from waste milk.It also highlights Piñatex, a plastic alternative made from pineapple leaves.Some policy-makers, though, are wary about hyping the potential of bio alternatives.Early optimism by some environmentalists about biofuels backfired when rainforests were felled to grow palm oil to fuel cars.Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment, said: ""The assessment shows that action can be painless and profitable – with huge gains for people and the planet that help avert the costly downstream costs of pollution. Plastic isn’t the problem. It’s what we do with it.”The report says levies and bans – where properly planned and enforced – have been among the most effective strategies to curb plastic waste.But the authors also cite a fundamental need for broader cooperation from business, including obliging plastic producers to take responsibility and offering incentives to stimulate more recycling.National actions include:Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution?	Chris Packham and OxoWhat do scientists say?	"Plastic bags that biodegrade to nothing. It sounds like one solution to the problems of plastic pollution.One British company that makes so-called ""Oxo-biodegradable"" bags said they break down in the environment ""in the same way as a leaf, only quicker"".The technology is now being widely used across Africa and the Middle East.But if it's so good, why has the EU Parliament passed a directive preventing Oxo products from being described as biodegradable? And why is the EU Commission considering a total ban?Michael Laurier, the chief executive of Symphony Environmental, the biggest producer of Oxo products in the UK, points to a white plastic carrier bag with his company logo printed across it.""This is an insurance policy,"" he says.Symphony makes an additive called d2w, which contains a mixture of salts that is added to raw plastic in the factory.The firm says within two years, and as long as oxygen is present, a plastic bag containing d2w will turn into something with ""a different molecular structure"".""It will biodegrade in the open environment,"" it claims on its website.""If you do just drop it in the ocean, we've shown that versus non-degradable products that it degrades and biodegrades an awful lot faster than conventional plastics,"" Mr Laurier says.Symphony's turnover was £8.2m in 2017, its chairman is the Conservative MEP Nirj Deva and it sells to countries across the Middle East and Africa.Saudi Arabia has even passed a law banning all single use plastic bags except those made with Oxo technology.But the EU Commission is yet to be convinced.In a report published in January of this year on Oxo bags, the commission concluded:The commission is being asked by the European Parliament to consider banning Oxo products by 2020.The EU Parliament also passed a directive in April banning the term ""biodegradable"" in relation to Oxo technology.It concluded: ""Oxo-degradable plastic packaging shall not be considered as biodegradable.""In April environmentalist Chris Packham was a guest on the BBC One Show's special programme on plastics.Raising the issue of Oxo plastics, he said: ""Plastic is always going to escape into the environment. And there are technologies out there, now Oxo-biodegradable plastics, which will break down very rapidly.""The environment secretary was also on the programme.Later in the show, Packham said: ""We have answers now. And we critically need a solution now. When we've got technologies like Oxo-biodegradable.""BBC News later learned that Packham is a paid adviser to Symphony Environmental, the UK's biggest producer of Oxo additives.But he did not declare that fact on air or to the One Show itself.BBC guidelines say a conflict of interest ""may arise when the external activities of anyone involved in making our content affects the BBC's reputation for integrity, independence and high standards, or may be reasonably perceived to do so"".In a statement, the BBC said the presenter appeared ""in his capacity as a naturalist in his own right"". As a private individual he was not bound by those guidelines.The statement also said: ""The One Show did not appreciate the full extent of Chris Packham's involvement with the Oxo Biodegradable industry.""If they had been they would have made it clear on the show.""Packham's agent said his client did not want to comment on the issue.European Green Party MEP Margrete Auken has spearheaded attempts to restrict this technology.""The marketing of Oxo-degradable plastic as an environmentally friendly solution is absurd,"" she said.""If you see anything labelled as Oxo-degradable, burn it. Reusing it will only release more micro-plastic into soil and water resources.""As for the UK government's view, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has asked the chief scientific adviser ""to look at the science behind it"".Mr Gove told the One Show in April: ""It's a potentially exciting development.""But we need to be certain actually, that if we're going to put public money behind some of these schemes that we are absolutely confident that we deliver the results that the inventors and the entrepreneurs behind them are so anxious to deliver.""There have been numerous scientific reports into Oxo-biodegradable technology, but scientific opinion remains divided.For example, a research paper from 2011 concluded it would be possible to create Oxo bags ""that will almost completely biodegrade in soil within two years"".But Richard Thompson, a professor of marine biology at Plymouth University, is sceptical. He has buried Oxo bags underground and suspended them in sea and monitored the results.He showed a BBC team a d2w bag made by Symphony that he said had been under water in Plymouth harbour for more than two years.""It's probably still strong enough to carry your shopping home in it,"" he said.He believes there are two questions: do the bags degrade quickly enough? And when they do break down, do they in reality form microplastics?Under a microscope he showed the BBC a bag that was more than 10 years old and had broken down into tiny pieces.""It's degraded as a carrier bag, that bit's true. But is this an environmental solution, as what we've now got is millions and millions of very small bits of plastic?""Mr Laurier, from Symphony, dismisses that as bad science.""This is going to convert basically, organically to a material similar to a leaf. It couldn't be better,"" he said.It is estimated that 500 billion plastic bags are made globally every year, but only 1-3% get recycled."
science	'Cocktail of pollutants' found in dolphins in English Channel		"Dolphins living in the English Channel are exposed to a ""cocktail of pollutants"", say scientists.A study found some of the highest recorded levels of toxic chemicals and mercury in the bodies of bottlenose dolphins off the French coast.Researchers say more needs to be done to tackle the ""invisible"" problem of lingering pollutants in the oceans.The Channel is home to one of the last remaining large European populations of bottlenose dolphins.Researchers took tissue samples from more than 80 dolphins living in waters off Normandy and Brittany.They found high concentrations of mercury in skin and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in blubber.Other industrial chemicals, such as dioxins and pesticides, were also found in blubber samples, which together may act as a ""cocktail of pollutants"", they said.The chemicals are passed down from mother to calf.""Our results indicated the important transfer of PCBs by females to their young, which may raise concern for the population,"" said the team of researchers led by Dr Krishna Das of the University of Liege, Belgium.The scientists say the bottlenose dolphin's habitat - an area known as the Normanno-Breton Gulf - should become a special area of conservation to protect the population.The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, chimes with data from investigations of strandings, said ZSL's Rob Deaville, of the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme.""As apex predators, bottlenose dolphins are at higher risk of exposure to some of the chemicals mentioned in this study - and as many of the European coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins are relatively small in size, they may therefore be under greater conservation threat,"" he said.PCBs, used in plastics, paints and electrical equipment, were banned several decades ago, but persist in the environment, where they can build up in the blubber of dolphins and whales.The chemicals have been found in the blubber of bottlenose dolphins washed up on beaches around Europe.One killer whale found dead off Scotland in 2016 contained among the highest levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, ever recorded.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Plastic pollution: 'Stop flushing contact lenses down the loo'	Share this chatbot.	"Researchers in the US have been investigating the final journeys taken by disposable contact lenses.They found 15-20% of US users simply flick these fiddly lenses down the drain via the bathroom sink or toilet.The Arizona State University study suggests that much of the plastic material then ends up in waste water treatment plants.The lenses are consequently spread on farmland as sewage sludge, increasing plastic pollution in the environment.Around 45m people wear contacts in the US, while rates in other countries vary, with between 5 and 15% of the population in Europe using them.Over the last decade, the use of softer plastic contact lenses has grown rapidly with people using daily, weekly or monthly disposables in greater numbers than ever before.This new study suggests that in the US at least, around 14 billion lenses are thrown away, amounting to around 200,000kg (441,000lb) of plastic waste every year.The authors of the study surveyed wearers in the US and found that 15-20% of them flick their lenses down sinks and toilets, meaning they will most likely end up in waste water treatment plants.Much of the waste water material ends up as a digested sludge which is then often spread on farmland. The authors estimate that around 13,000kg of contact lens plastic ends up deposited in this way.""They persist during water treatment, they become part of sewage sludge,"" Prof Rolf Halden, from the Centre for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona State told BBC News.""We know that whatever's in sludge can make its way into runoff from heavy rains, back into surface water and that is a conduit to the oceans; there is the potential of these lenses being taken on quite a journey.""The researchers are concerned that this poses an ecological risk and may allow the accumulation of persistent toxic pollutants in vulnerable organisms such as worms and birds.""If earthworms consume the soil and birds feed on it, then you could see that plastic make the same journey as is done by plastics debris in oceans, they are incorporated by biota that are also part of the human food chain,"" said Prof Halden.Contact lenses are often made from a mixture of acrylic glass, silicones and fluoropolymers that allows manufacturers to create a softer plastic material which permits oxygen to pass through to the eye.To work out the impact of waste water plants on these materials, the researchers exposed five polymers in contact lenses to anaerobic and aerobic micro-organisms commonly found in these treatment facilities.""We found that there were noticeable changes in the bonds of the contact lenses after long-term treatment with the plant's microbes,"" said Varun Kelkar, one of the authors from Arizona State University.""When the plastic loses some of its structural strength, it will break down physically. This leads to smaller plastic particles which would ultimately lead to the formation of microplastics.""The researchers want manufacturers to provide information on the label, informing people how to properly dispose of their contacts.Lenses are not generally recycled, although one of the largest manufacturers Bausch + Lomb introduced a programme last year.The authors of the study say that lenses should be recycled where this is possible, but if not they should be disposed of by putting them in with other solid, non-recyclable waste.""The simple fix to this is for people not to put the lenses down the sink or shower or toilet!"" said Prof Halden.""They are a real improvement in quality of life and are a justified use of plastic, so if we decide as a society that we want to use plastic for these purposes, we should also present the consumer with the chance to get rid of these materials in a responsible fashion.""The research has been presented at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston."

For example, current European nitrogen limits may need to be cut by half. Our trees in Europe are not more tolerant than those in North America - their fungi are just suffering more.""The study looked at beech, oak, pine and spruce trees across Europe, including several oak, pine and beech forests in the UK.Fungi receive little protection under conservation policies, which makes it hard to assess which species are rare or declining.Follow Helen on Twitter."

science	Air pollution plans to tackle wood burners	How polluted is your street?What about my wood burner?New powers'Lacking detail'	"Plans to tackle sources of air pollution - such as wood-burning stoves - put too much responsibility on local councils, critics say.The government, as part of its clean air strategy, wants to clamp down on all sources of pollution, including coal-burning and ammonia from farms.Campaigners welcome the consultation, but say it does not go far enough.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said it would be ""disproportionate"" to have a uniform ban on certain fuels.He said the air pollution effects in rural areas of fuels, such as diesel or coal, are significantly less compared to urban areas as they are dispersed.He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: ""What we've got here are a series of proportionate measures which we hope will deal with what is a big public health issue.""Ministers want to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of pollution from fine particles, known as particulates, by 2025.One of the most contentious proposals is to reduce pollution from wood burners, which, along with solid fuels, cause 38% of particulate pollution.But a source at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) told the BBC there was no plan to ban existing stoves - or the burning of coal and open wood fires, which are far more polluting than wood burners.Sorry, your browser does not support this toolSource: MappAir100 by EarthSenseIf you cannot view the postcode search, please click here to reload the page.Farmers, who have largely evaded pollution controls so far, will be told to buy new equipment to reduce airborne ammonia from slurry.The government has been obliged to publish this Clean Air Strategy under an EU rule. It's in addition to the law which has seen the UK taken to court over high levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution.Ministers estimate that their plans will reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated ÃÂ£1 billion every year by 2020, rising to ÃÂ£2.5 billion every year from 2030.They describe air pollution as the fourth biggest threat to public health after cancer, obesity and heart disease.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: ""Air quality has improved significantly since 2010 but 60 years on from the historic Clean Air Act a clear truth remains - air pollution is making people ill, shortening lives and damaging our economy and environment.""This clean air strategy sets out the comprehensive action required across all parts of the government to improve air quality.""All EU nations will have to submit similar plans to cut pollution but Mr Gove says the UK's policies will be carried out beyond Brexit.The legislation will give new powers to local councils so they can solve pollution hotspots. Some councils welcome this approach whilst others think they're being left to do the government's dirty work.Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association said: ""If we're to truly tackle air pollution, we need government support to enable us to deliver effective local plans, and robust national action to help the country transition to low-emission vehicles and power generation.""Green groups are pleased that the plan will be embedded in new primary legislation - and they applaud the decision to halve the number of people exposed to high levels of particulates.But they say the document so far doesn't say how the government will deal with the on-going problem of NOX emissions from cars. And they accuse it of loading too much work on to local councils.Doug Parr from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""The ambition is impressive - but how is it going to be achieved? Lots of councils simply don't have the resources to deal with these issues.""He said the proposal on wood burners was far too vague: ""Will hard-pressed environmental health officers really be checking on wet wood in forecourts?"" he asked.Sue Hayman MP, Labour's Shadow Environment Secretary, said: ""Michael Gove has become the Secretary of State for Consultations - with over 25 consultations published by his department since the General Election and not a single piece of primary legislation brought forward.""Farmers will be supported to cut ammonia emissions through the proposed new farming funding system known as public money for public goods.One technologically-difficult issue is also acknowledged - the contribution to microplastic air pollution and water pollution from vehicle brakes and tyres wearing on the road. The government says it will work with international partners to research and develop new standards.Follow Roger on Twitter.Do you have any questions about tackling air pollution?

science	Pollution blights UK seagrass meadows	Tell-tale signsIn the dark	"Pollution is having a damaging impact on UK seagrass meadow health, a new study has found.Scientists based in Wales have shown that excessive amounts of nitrogen present in sewage and livestock waste is finding its way into coastal waters.This encourages large populations of small algae to thrive and these are depriving the seagrass of essential light, stunting its growth.The research is published in Frontiers in Plant Science.Seagrass meadows are found in sandy and muddy locations around the UK. They are important for maintaining healthy animal populations, says Benjamin Jones from Cardiff University and the lead author on the study.""In the UK alone, they provide a nursery habitat for a diverse range of marine life, which include cod, plaice, pollack and in places on the south coast like Studland Bay - seahorses,"" he told the BBC.There is also evidence that these meadows are important in controlling atmospheric carbon. According to Mr Jones, seagrass is 35 times more efficient at capturing carbon than a typical tropical rainforest. Seagrass also stabilises coastal sediments and prevents coastal erosion.In short, this marine plant performs a number of really important environmental tasks.Given the meadows' coastal location, these key habitats are potentially exposed to nitrogen-rich pollution from human sewage and animal waste. The full scale of this exposure and its effects on the health of seagrass have been unclear, however.To get a better idea of how seagrass was being affected by sewage pollution, Mr Jones and colleagues from the Universities of Cardiff and Swansea studied plant communities in 11 UK locations. Ten of these were located in European marine protected sites.At each sampling site, they collected plants growing at up to three metres under the sea.The researchers focussed on leaves, leaving the roots intact so that the plants could grow back.Once collected, the leaves were analysed in the lab for the presence of different isotopes of nitrogen.An atom consists of a nucleus containing particles called protons and neutrons. Around this nucleus swirls a cloud of electrons.In every neutral atom, the number of electrons and protons is equal. It is this number that effectively defines what the atom is.But the number of neutrons in the same type of atom can differ and these alternative forms are called isotopes.The most frequent version of nitrogen has seven protons and seven neutrons in its nucleus and is called nitrogen-14.Nitrogen-15 differs from this nitrogen because it contains an additional neutron and this makes it slightly heavier.Measuring the levels of each nitrogen isotope present in the seagrass leaves provided important insights into the state of the water where the plant was growing, as Mr Jones explained: ""It allows us to keep trace of where nutrients present in seagrass leaves have come from. Different sources of nutrients have different levels of nitrogen-15"".""The more nitrogen-15 we measure, relative to the amount of nitrogen-14, the more certain we are that the nutrients the plant has been exposed to contain sewage and livestock waste.""When the researchers analysed their data it was clear that the coastal waters of the UK contained varying amounts of the potentially harmful pollutants.Seagrass from Southend on Sea had around three times the level of nitrogen-15 than plants growing at a site off the Scilly Isles.In general, samples collected from sites associated with high habitation had the most heavy nitrogen and were also in a poorer state. There was less plant cover and the leaves of individuals plants were smaller.""Nutrient levels are probably the biggest problem for seagrasses around the UK. The nitrogen levels were around 75% higher in the leaves compared with those analysed from other regions around the globe,"" Mr Jones told the BBC.The team's research also revealed part of the reason why this excess nitrogen was so damaging.It encouraged the growth of tiny marine algae, many of which were growing directly on the surface of the seagrass leaves. These smother the seagrass, effectively starving them of the light they need to carry out photosynthesis.""Seagrass growth isn't limited by nutrients, but is limited by light and in the UK that means that they are usually found down to a depth of only seven metres.""To put that in perspective, the same species grows at depths of 35m in the Gulf of California because the water clarity is so much better,"" Mr Jones said.The authors argue that whole-scale change in the way the UK controls and monitors sewage and livestock waste is needed to improve the seagrass meadows and the coastal environment in general.The researchers have launched a citizen science project and are encouraging people to download an app called the Seagrass Spotter to their mobile devices.This will enable anyone who wants to take part to record sightings of seagrass and upload the observations to the researchers' database."
science	Illegal levels of air pollution linked to child's death	Seal the house	"A nine-year-old girl's fatal asthma attack has been linked to illegally high levels of air pollution.Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25m (80ft) from London's South Circular Road - a notorious pollution ""hotspot"".She experienced three years of seizures and hospital stays before her death in February 2013. During that time, local air pollution levels breached EU legal limits.No individual death has previously been directly linked to air pollution.According to a report by one of the UK's leading experts on asthma and air pollution, Prof Stephen Holgate, there was a ""striking association"" between Ella's emergency hospital admissions and recorded spikes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and PM10s, the most noxious pollutants.His report said there was a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died"".The evidence will be submitted in an appeal to the attorney general to re-open an inquest in to Ella's death.Ella often walked to school along the South Circular Road and Lewisham High Street, a journey that would take 30-40 minutes. Or she would be driven and have to sit for lengthy periods in traffic jams.She was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit that followed a spike in air pollution levels.She was subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times over three years. Many of these coincided with recorded peaks in air pollution.Pollution linked to one in six deaths'Asthma is a killer - it took away my miracle daughter'Asthma patients 'not receiving basic care'Her mother, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, said she had resuscitated Ella between 20 and 30 times while waiting for an ambulance.She said that Ella had been treated in five separate hospitals but no medical professional had ever explained that air pollution could be making her asthma worse.""I need to find out for myself why she died and what the causes are,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said.""I need this for my other children, in order to protect their health.""I also believe there is a public interest in examining her death because if this direct link were made then the health of our children would have to be prioritised over other considerations including the convenience of drivers.""Human rights lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn, from the firm Hodge Jones and Allen, is acting on behalf of the family.She said: ""It doesn't make sense that so much information is now available about the health impact of air pollution and the link to thousands of the deaths in the UK and yet there has been, as yet, no direct link made to an individual death.""Ella's case illustrates the hard-hitting human impact of air pollution.""Prof Holgate, from University Hospital Southampton, chaired the government's advisory committee on the effects of air pollution.In his report, he described exposure to air pollutants as a ""key driver"" of Ella's disease.""Unlawful levels of air pollution contributed to the cause and seriousness of Ella's asthma in a way that greatly compromised her quality of life and was causative of her fatal asthma attack.""He examined records gathered by a government-monitored air pollution monitoring station in Catford, just one mile from Ella's house, and another three miles from her home.According to Prof Holgate, the fact the monitoring stations were so close to Ella's house meant the results, when combined with data from King's College London and correlated with Ella's hospital visits, were ""particularly insightful.""Spikes in air pollution coincided with all but one of Ella's hospital admissions.And she died after one of the ""worst air pollution episodes in her locality.""Prof Holgate examined other possible causes of Ella's condition but concluded the cause of death should be recorded as acute respiratory failure and severe asthma secondary to air pollution exposure.Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said she had noticed Ella's attacks could be worse when she had been near a busy road, that the fumes would affect her breathing.If she had been properly advised, she said, she would have looked at moving to a less polluted area and changing Ella's school.""I would have made every effort to properly seal the house and close the windows when pollution levels were high,"" Mrs Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said.She has younger twins and her son has asthma, although not as seriously as Ella. She believes air pollution affects him.They now walk a different way to school, through a park instead of along the South Circular.According to a government report published in 2018, poor air quality has been classified as the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK.The EU limits on air pollution are set out in Article 13 of the European Directive of 2008. But World Health Organization guidelines indicate that adverse health effects occur at lower levels than the EU limits.Ms Cockburn said: ""The government has willingly presided over illegal EU air quality limits since 2010 and this ongoing failure is costing lives.""There needs to be an immediate sea change in how air pollution is dealt with in our cities.""I believe there are strong grounds for Ella's inquest to be quashed on the basis that her right to life (Article Two of the Human Rights Act) may have been breached by the government's failure to act in relation to unlawful air pollution levels.""The attorney general's office said: ""In considering whether to grant his consent to an application, the attorney general must be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of the application succeeding in the High Court.""Additional reporting by Gem O'Reilly."
science	Are cities bad for the environment?	Sources of carbon emissionsOther types of air pollutionEmissions per person in UK's largest towns and cities*	Our cities are increasingly under scrutiny over their impact on climate change. But in terms of carbon dioxide - one of the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming - could life away from the UK's big towns be doing more damage?According to the most recent government statistics, the UK's 63 largest towns and cities - defined here as built-up urban areas with 135,000 or more people - account for almost half of all of the country's carbon dioxide (or CO2) emissions.London alone makes up 11% of the total.But are these headline stats masking a more nuanced picture about the role of cities as contributors to climate change?If we look at carbon emissions on a per resident basis, it could be that life in smaller towns, villages and the countryside has a greater impact.The European Commission calculates UK emissions at 5.7 tonnes per person. That ranks the UK as one of the lowest carbon emitters per person among major economies. The US produces 15.7 tonnes per resident, while China - despite being the world's largest CO2 polluter - emits a mid-range 7.7 tonnes per person.UK government statistics for 2017 place the average slightly lower, at 5.3 tonnes per head.All but 10 of our 63 largest towns and cities emit below that average, with Ipswich coming out as the greenest major town in the UK from a climate perspective. It emits three tonnes of CO2 for every resident.Even London, despite valid worries about air quality, has the ninth-lowest carbon emissions per resident at 3.6 tonnes per person.Meanwhile, energy-intensive steel and chemicals industries contribute to the Swansea area - including Neath Port Talbot - and Middlesbrough (combined with Stockton, and Redcar and Cleveland) having the highest carbon emissions per person in the UK, at 22.4 and 12.1 tonnes per head respectively.CO2 emissions per person, 2017 (tonnes)Examining the sources of carbon emissions helps us understand why cities produce comparatively little CO2.Though the differences are not huge, on average, homes in large towns emit slightly less CO2 per person than their more rural counterparts. They tend to be smaller, denser and easier to heat.Twelve of the 20 local authorities with the lowest domestic CO2 emissions per person are London boroughs, with Tower Hamlets - which has the second smallest homes of any authority in England and Wales - emitting the least.One of the biggest differences in carbon emissions comes from transport, with CO2 emissions per head 66% higher away from cities. This is probably because more people drive private cars and make longer journeys for work and leisure.Just 20% of British city dwellers travel more than 10km (6.2 miles) to work according to the latest Census, compared with a third of those who live away from major towns. Clearly, a lack of comprehensive public transport outside cities is a major factor.Another significant difference is that economic activity in major towns tends to be more office and service-based, with manufacturing plants largely outside the boundaries of areas classed as cities.For more on the UK's efforts to tackle CO2 emissions, download the BBC Briefing on energy. Part of a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, it has input from academics, researchers and journalists and is the BBC's response to demands for better explanation of the facts behind the headlines.As well as being lower emitters per resident, cities are also decarbonising at a faster rate, cutting carbon emissions by 36% between 2005 and 2017, against 31% for other areas.Although it remains a big polluter, the area around Middlesbrough has seen the biggest fall in emissions - 64% since 2011. This is linked to economic changes, with the closure of its major steelworks likely to have brought down overall emissions.In contrast, industrial emissions in Slough rose between 2005 and 2017, as a likely result of changes to its local economy.Providing high-quality job opportunities while keeping a lid on greenhouse gas production will be a difficult challenge for cities in the future.However, cities cannot be judged by measuring CO2 alone.While emissions from industrial sources fell by 48%, and domestic sources by 36%, the reduction in emissions from transport lagged at just 11%. This has implications for another major environmental concern of our age: air quality.Transport on UK roads accounts for 32% of all nitrogen oxides, for example, which are linked to respiratory diseases, heart disease and lung cancer, according to 2017 figures. Of all roads that breach legal limits for nitrogen oxides, 88% are in cities.More like thisExhaust fumes in cities, where traffic volumes are highest, are trapped in by tall buildings. This also causes nitrous oxides to build up, resulting in air quality that is much poorer than it is in more rural areas.So far only London has taken the concrete step of introducing an Ultra Low Emissions Zone to penalise polluting vehicles in a bid to clear its air.Other cities will need to confirm and implement similar clean air plans if they are to both improve the air that their workers and residents breathe, and continue the fight against climate change.While carbon dioxide is a key focus of climate change policy, it is far from the only pollutant affecting cities. Others include:* The Centre for Cities' measure combines some authorities into one city area. For example, Swansea includes neighbouring Neath Port Talbot.

science	UK referred to Europe's top court over air pollution		"The UK is being taken to court by the European Commission over its long-standing failure to meet EU limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).Germany, France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary have also been referred to the court for breaching pollution levels.The European Environment Commissioner, Karmenu Vella, said the EU ""owed it to its citizens,"" to take legal action.The UK has promised a comprehensive air pollution package shortly.But Britain could face fines totalling millions of pounds, on-going until the problem is solvedThe government has already lost a series of battles in the UK courts on air pollution.Commissioner Vella said it was the Commission's responsibility to ensure people could breathe clean air.He said the member states being taken to court had been repeatedly warned to clean up pollution as soon as possible.""We can't possibly wait any longer. It's high time to intensify efforts and end exceedances (of pollution levels).""Environmentalists say by taking the UK to the European Court of Justice, the EU has demonstrated what will be lost after Brexit.The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, previously promised that governance of the environment would not be diluted when the UK leaves the EU.But he revealed last week that the UK environmental watchdog he proposes after Brexit would not have the automatic power to take the government to court.The Green MEP Keith Taylor welcomed the EC's decision. He said: ""The Commission is being forced to take legal action against the UK because the government remains steadfastly apathetic in the face of a public health crisis that is linked to the deaths of 50,000 British citizens every year.""""Post-Brexit, this is exactly the kind of scrutiny and oversight the Tories plan to escape. Proposals for a so-called environment watchdog that is nothing but a lame lapdog without the legal teeth to take the government to court put this reality in sharp relief.""This is particularly concerning as legal action by the Commission and environmental lawyers, on the basis of EU law, has been the only way to force the UK government to take any action on air pollution at all.""Margherita Tolotto from the green group European Environment Bureau said: ""European air quality laws are being broken on a continental scale.""Everyone in Europe has the same right to clean air, and when national governments fail to deliver EU protections, it's right that the European Commission steps in to protect us from the air we breathe.""Today's announcement should surprise no-one. The countries being sent to court have had too many final warnings.""As the announcement was being made, lawyers for Paris, Madrid and Brussels were in front of the European Court of Justice asking that the three cities be allowed to challenge vehicle emissions regulations set by the European Commissions and agreed by national governments.They are trying to annul the Commission regulation that allows diesel vehicles to exceed emissions limits during road tests, in the wake of the ""dieselgate"" scandal.A Defra spokesperson said: ""We continue to meet EU air quality limits for all pollutants apart from nitrogen dioxide, and data shows we are improving thanks to our efforts to bring levels of NO₂ down.""We will shortly build on our £3.5bn plan to tackle roadside emissions with a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy, setting out a wide range of actions to reduce pollution from all sources.""Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
science	Pollution hotspots revealed: Check your area	How polluted is your street?Five ways to avoid pollution	"Marylebone Road and Hyde Park Corner, both in central London, have the most polluted postcodes in Britain, says a new study on air quality.The data comes from a project to map concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) across the country.However, the results also show that large parts of Britain have relatively clean air.Diesel vehicles are a key source of NO2 gas, which has been linked to respiratory disease.While this study only concentrates on NO2 pollution, scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present.You can see what air quality is like in your area by entering your postcode in the search below.

Pollution is thought to undermine the health of people with heart or lung problems.A new analysis by the company EarthSense shows NO2 concentrations in 100x100m squares across the UK. The company's technical director, Prof Roland Leigh, says it is the most detailed model yet for assessing air quality in Britain.""By focussing it down we can really isolate the hotspots of poor air quality, and better target our solutions.""Prof Leigh says it's important to be aware of bad pollution levels where you live, or near schools or your route to work, but that no areas in Britain are bad enough that people should avoid exercising outside.""Air quality is actually getting better in Britain, and we are in a better state than a large number of countries - particularly across Asia.""In Britain, it's always better to be outside exercising than inside avoiding pollution, even in the worst areas.""In the study, each area is rated on a scale from 1, least polluted, to 6, most polluted. More than four in five postcodes in Great Britain fall into the least polluted category (1).The scale is worked out based on a probability that each area will break the annual legal limit for NO2. Areas fall foul if they average more than 40 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre.Fewer than 1% of postcodes are rated either 4 or 5, and no postcodes in Great Britain fall into the highest category - six - for areas that average over 100 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre.Three-quarters of the postcodes with the worst ratings are in London. Those outside the capital include other built-up areas as well as otherwise rural locations near motorways.The company has largely based its analysis on traffic emissions, the dominant source of NO2 in the UK.In many big cities, such as London, safe limits on harmful particulates and nitrogen oxides, including NO2, are regularly breached.In the last few years, the campaign group ClientEarth has won a number of rulings against the UK government over air pollution. These legal challenges forced ministers to draw up plans to tackle the problem and meet EU targets on NO2.However, a recent study in the journal Nature Geoscience suggested that targets for reducing NO2 pollution could be achieved more quickly than the government expects. This was because government projections did not take into account that as cars age, they produce less of the harmful gas.Updated 8 February 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that the EarthSense study on air quality concentrates only on NO2 pollution. Scientists advise that high concentrations of NO2 are generally a good indication that other pollutant types may also be present.

science	Brexit hits UK science funding and workforce		"The first figures have emerged demonstrating that Brexit uncertainty has adversely affected UK research.They show Britain's annual share of EU research funding has fallen by nearly a third since 2015.The analysis by the Royal Society suggests scientists are choosing not to work in Britain, with a 35% drop in those coming to the UK via EU schemes.Its president, Venki Ramakrishnan, said scientists did not want to ""gamble with their careers"" by working in the UK.He explained: ""They have no sense of whether the UK will be willing and able to maintain its global scientific leadership. UK science has also missed out on around [£440m] a year because of the uncertainty around Brexit.""The potential paralysis of a no-deal Brexit and the current state of chaos are hurting UK science and that is hurting the national interest.""Horizon 2020 is the EU's Research and Innovation programme with nearly £70bn of funding available between 2014 and 2020.UK researchers report that they were frozen out of new Horizon 2020 grant applications soon after the referendum because of the uncertainty over their participation after Brexit. In 2016, then Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed to underwrite EU grants to reduce the uncertainty.But the Royal Society's analysis shows that the former Chancellor's measure did not work. Figures from EU databases show the UK's share of funding fell from 16% of Horizon 2020 funding in 2015, just before the referendum, to just over 11% in 2018.The figures show that the number of UK applications to Horizon 2020 fell from 19,127 to 11,746 over the same period - a nearly 40% reduction.There is also a strong indication that fewer researchers from other European countries are choosing to work in the UK following the referendum. The EU runs a scheme, called the Marie Curie Individual Fellowships, to help researchers and their families relocate to an overseas institution.In 2015, some 515 scientists took up their fellowships to work in UK institutions. In 2018, this fell to 336. Over the same period, the number of fellowships helping scientists relocate to labs in Italy and Switzerland increased by 53 in each case. Spain, Belgium, Norway, Sweden and Ireland also saw increases during that time.It is unclear why applications from UK research groups have dropped off. It is not because of actual rejections because success rates remain high for those who apply. The Royal Society has anecdotal evidence that UK groups have been asked to withdraw from applications by fellow EU collaborators because of the uncertainty their involvement would cast on those projects.It is also possible that the government's commitments to underwriting funds are not sinking in with researchers or are not trusted.Both Theresa May and Boris Johnson have pledged their desire to maintain close links with EU science programmes after Brexit through negotiations with the EU. Last month, Mr Johnson instructed government departments to devise a new fast-track visa system to attract leading scientists to work in the UK.A spokesperson for the department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy, which manages the science budget said that the government ""remains committed to becoming a world-leading place to carry out cutting edge scientific research after we leave the EU.""That's why we have firmly committed to increasing research and development (R&D) investment to at least 2.4% of GDP by 2027 and why the Prime Minister recently announced a fast-track visa route for scientists to come to the UK.""Chi Onwurah, the Shadow Minister for Industrial Strategy, Science and Innovation said that the government was ""wilfully sacrificing scientific progress on the altar of ideology"".""No Deal would be total disaster for science, but the rumoured proposals being cobbled together would still leave us at a significant disadvantage . We need a deal that maintains regulatory alignment, supports collaborative funding bids on major projects, and that means the U.K. welcomes researchers rather than putting up barriers.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Honey fungus secrets fall to science		"Citizen scientists have helped shed light on a ""humungous fungus"" that can kill off common plants.The honey fungus often appears at the start of autumn, when honey-coloured toadstools appear on woody plants.Plant pathologists compared more than 5,000 records of confirmed cases with a previous study into susceptibility by the University of California.They found plants in UK gardens fall into three categories, based on their risk of the disease.Plants in the Myrtales order of flowering plants - including myrtle and fuchsia - and Ericales - including camellia and heather - tended to have low susceptibility, while those in the Saxifragales - such as liquidambar and witch hazels - and Fagales - birch and sweet chestnut - were mostly highly susceptible. A third group of plants were in the middle, including maple, magnolia and rose.Senior plant pathologist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), Matthew Comey, said a database compiled from a large number of confirmed samples supplied by gardeners was behind the findings.""The RHS has long advised on what plants might be best avoided if honey fungus is a known problem on your plot but this new research, for the first time, also accounts for a plant's popularity in gardens and therefore the diseases' likely true impact,"" he said.""Following the planting advice isn't a guarantee against the disease but a sensible precautionary measure akin to practicing good plant hygiene.""Honey fungus has been made worse in recent years by warm, dry summers, which make plants more susceptible to attack.The fungus colonises and kills a variety of trees and woody plants and once present in a garden can be managed but not eradicated.The yellow-brown mushrooms that appear above ground are the fruiting bodies of much larger organisms, which can spread large distances underground.A specific honey fungus measuring 2.4 miles (3.8 km) across in the Blue Mountains in Oregon is claimed to be the largest living organism on Earth.""The honey fungus is part of the recycling of plants,"" said Matthew Comey. ""The dead and dying, the weak, the sick plants, these are the ones that tend to succumb in a forest - and really it's an equilibrium, it's a balance.""If people can try and grow plants naturally so they're comfortable with where they are - they're in the right environment, they're in the right place, everything else is good for them, then they're much less likely to succumb."""
science	Stars align for epic space missions		"Two of the most exciting space missions of the 2030s are likely now to be launched within a year of each other.European Space Agency member states are poised to increase the organisation's science budget on Thursday by 10%.This would make it possible to align projects to build a big X-ray telescope and a trio of satellites to sense the collision of gargantuan black holes.It's important they fly together because the insights they'll bring are highly complementary.When black holes merge, they despatch vibrations across the fabric of space-time - so-called gravitational waves. And being violent events, these unions will potentially also emit high-energy radiation.Scientists want the fullest picture possible and the Athena X-ray telescope and the Lisa observatory give them that opportunity.""The idea is that there is light and sound together,"" said Prof Günther Hasinger, Esa's director of science.""With gravitational waves, we hear the shaking Universe; and the light comes from the matter falling into the black holes - 'the last cry of help' that is radiating in X-rays,"" he told BBC News.Both projects are big technology efforts that will take a decade to prepare. And their complexity is such that Esa would normally only try to launch missions of their kind once every five years.But the budget increase set to be approved here in Seville, Spain, at the agency's triennial Ministerial Council, enables Athena and Lisa to be put on a similar development path.It's hoped the X-ray telescope can launch in 2031 and the gravitational waves observatory in 2032.The uplift in Esa's science funding to nearly €3bn (£2.6bn) over five years was one of the easiest discussions on the opening day of the Council. Research ministers didn't raise a word against the proposal, which means it should go through without issue when the meeting closes on Thursday.The Council is negotiating a wide-ranging package of space programmes valued at €12.5bn (£10.7bn) over three years, or €14.3bn (£12.3bn) when considered over five years.Another of the large ticket items is Earth observation, a key element of which is the recommended expansion of Copernicus, a suite of satellites called Sentinels that monitor the status of the planet.Esa is already producing six sensor systems in this programme and it aims to start the planning for a further six after Seville. The agency asked for €1.4bn from ministers, and at the end of day one's deliberations had already collected bids for €1.7bn, the BBC understands.The numbers could yet change when debate resumes on Thursday but already it's an impressive oversubscription, driven principally by France and Germany.Of interest will be the number finally bid by the UK. That's because Copernicus is, in large part, an EU-backed project and Britain is supposed to be leaving the political bloc in January.It will, though, be possible for the UK to re-join the Union's side of things as a ""third country"" at a later date. Brussels' Commissioner for space, Elżbieta Bieńkowska, said she hoped this would be the case.""We, Europe, are the leaders in fighting climate change; and Copernicus will be the most important tool to do this. We need all of the European countries onboard, and that means we need the United Kingdom as a partner,"" she told reporters.Certainly, any investments Britain makes in Copernicus with Esa will result in similar sized R&D contracts being given back to the nation's space companies.Commenting on a Ministerial Council after its first day always carries a ""health warning"". The size of bids being quoted can - and often do - change overnight. There is usually quite a bit of brinkmanship involved as different countries seek support for their pet projects.In the arena of space safety, for example, Esa has proposed a mission called Hera which would visit an asteroid to learn more about the space rocks that threaten the Earth. In the same portfolio is a concept called Lagrange, a satellite that would stare at the Sun to warn of dangerous outbursts.Germany wants Hera; the UK wants Lagrange.""It's mankind's job to protect Earth against the asteroids, and so our focus is Hera,"" said Thomas Jarzombek, Germany's coordinator of aerospace policy. ""And we believe it's a really hard challenge to do two of these large programmes.""Germany and the UK will be working hard to win the backing of other member states on Thursday."
science	Aide: After Brexit science is No 10's top priority	'Supercharge' science'Small beer'	"The prime minister says he wants science and technology to fuel a ""vibrant"" post-Brexit economy.Boris Johnson made his pledge as he announced a fund to help firms commercialise medical breakthroughs.A source said that science funding was the number two priority - after Brexit - of Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings.But critics say the damage to research caused by a no-deal Brexit would outweigh any benefits.Mr Johnson has given details of a £200m fund which will be matched by a £400m private sector investment. Although relatively modest, it is the latest in a series of positive statements about science emerging from Downing Street since Mr Johnson has taken office.He said that although the UK has a proud history of scientific discovery, too often it was commercialised by other countries.""Today I am changing that. I want the lifesaving cancer treatments of tomorrow to say 'discovered and made in Britain',"" said Mr Johnson.Stian Westlake is a former special adviser to three science ministers including the PM's brother, Jo Johnson. He said much of the ""energy"" for driving science on to Mr Johnson's agenda came from his chief adviser, Mr Cummings.""Those I have spoken to have told me that Dom Cummings' number one priority is Brexit. His number two priority is science and technology funding,"" he said.Mr Westlake said Mr Cummings was directly involved in these announcements.""This is why you are seeing some of the 'burning injustices' in science (such as the visa issue for researchers) being dealt with relatively quickly,"" he said.Since 2010, successive governments have pledged an additional £7bn to UK R&D by 2022. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond also set a target to treble government spending by a further £21bn so that total public and private research spending would increase from 1.7% of GDP to 2.4% by 2027.Prof James Wilsdon of Sheffield University, UK, said the indications so far suggested Mr Johnson was prepared to build on the pro-science policies of the previous Conservative and coalition governments.""The mood music and what has come out of the Johnson government on the science base is, if anything, more enthusiastic than it was from the May and Cameron governments,"" he said.In his first speech as Prime Minister, Mr Johnson cited the life sciences sector and technology as one of the UK economy's ""enormous strengths"".Last week at the UN General Assembly, he railed against ""anti-scientific pessimism"", referring to those opposed to scientific progress. And, most significantly, he vowed to ""supercharge science"" by cutting the red tape for researchers wanting to work in the UK.But Mr Cummings' interest may be a mixed blessing for some who were happy with the relatively recent restructuring of research funding. This involved merging a diverse group of funding sources into one large research council called the UK Research and Innovation Agency (UKRI).In his blog, Mr Cummings writes about how small teams are more creative, and in his view underfunded.""The government spends about £250bn a year with extreme systematic incompetence. If we 'just' applied what we know about high performance project management and procurement we could take savings from this budget and put it into (US-style) high-risk-high-payoff visions including creating whole new fields,"" he writes.He calls for bureaucracy to be removed from the current system, a return to a system where universities and researchers are funded directly and guaranteed work visas for spouses that would make the ""UK a magnet for talented young scientists"".Mr Johnson has already promised Mr Cummings' visa suggestion, seemingly drawing words from the blog when he stated he wants to ""turn the UK into a kind of supercharged magnet, drawing scientists like iron filings from around the world"".His ideas for less bureaucracy and funding for small groups may not be completely in line with the corporate way in which UKRI operates according to Prof Wilsdon.""A large state agency is not naturally aligned with the ideological and intellectual traditions on which someone like Dominic Cummings would draw,"" he said.But Prof Wilsdon added that many in the scientific community believed the limited announcements by the PM to date were small beer compared to the billions of pounds and access to research the UK receives under the current arrangement with the EU.""Politicians and advisors are drawn to big flashy totemic announcements as a way of demonstrating their commitment to research,"" he said.""But at the same time, we need to continually reinforce a sustainable, healthy and balanced research system with less eye-catching, headline grabbing funding sources that are the actual glue that holds the system together.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Climate Change: Are we passing some key 'tipping points'?	Human pressures	"Critical elements in the Earth’s climate may be more likely to break down than previously thought, according to a group of scientists.Their commentary in the journal Nature says there’s growing evidence that irreversible climatic changes could be triggered within a few decades.The authors claim this could lead to a “climatic emergency” in which one shift amplifies another.But other researchers say the argument is speculative.The authors specialise in what’s known as Earth Systems Science, which studies the interactions of elements of the climate system.For several years they have been promoting the theory that the climate may switch suddenly as a result of one climatic shift amplifying other changes.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) introduced this idea of ""tipping points"" two decades ago.The commentary says that at the time these large-scale shifts were considered likely only if global warming exceeded 5C.The authors argue that information from IPCC reports over the past two years suggests that tipping points could be exceeded even between 1 and 2C of warming.They say research has shown that the Amundsen Sea bay of West Antarctica might already have passed a tipping point where the meeting point of ice, ocean and bedrock is retreating irreversibly.One computer model suggests that when this sector collapses, it could destabilise the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet like toppling dominoes - leading to about three metres of sea-level rise on a timescale of centuries to millennia.The authors also point to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.As the elevation of the ice sheet lowers, it melts further, exposing the surface to ever-warmer air in what's known as a ""positive feedback"".Some models suggest that the Greenland ice sheet could be doomed to disappear relentlessly if the world warms by just 1.5C.The commentary says: “Politicians, economists and even some natural scientists have tended to assume that tipping points in the Earth system such as the loss of the Amazon rainforest or the West Antarctic ice sheet, are of low probability and little understood.“Yet evidence is mounting that these events could be more likely than was thought, have high impacts and are interconnected across different biophysical systems, potentially committing the world to long-term irreversible changes.”Co-author Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, says it is not only human pressures on Earth that continue rising to unprecedented levels.“It is also that as science advances, we must admit that we have underestimated the risks of unleashing irreversible changes, where the planet self-amplifies global warming,"" he says.""This is what we now start seeing, already at 1C global warming.“This provides strong evidence for declaring a state of planetary emergency to unleash world action that accelerates the path towards a world that can continue evolving on a stable planet.”But not every scientist agrees with the thrust of their argument. One critic is Professor Mike Hulme from Cambridge University, who is disturbed by the talk of planetary emergency.“Their position is speculative; there are no new research findings presented here.“Their mathematical ‘formula’ contradicts everything that social science and humanities scholarship tells us about public emergencies - namely that they result from political argument, reflection and judgement.“Emergencies are declared by legitimate political actors; they are not calculated mathematically by self-appointed scientists.”Professor Richard Betts from the Met Office says the chances of passing these tipping points increases with the level of global heating.""Therefore, if we want to keep the risks to a minimum, it is logical that global heating should also be kept to a minimum.""Even if we do pass a 'point of no return' (or if we have done so already - which may or may not be the case) we still have a chance to limit the damage if we don't overshoot too far.""Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin."
science	Antarctica: Metal meteorite quest set to get under way		"A team of British scientists has arrived in the Antarctic to try to find the continent's ""missing meteorites"".The group, from the University of Manchester, will spend six weeks scouring a remote region for lumps of iron that have fallen from the sky.These pieces of metal represent the shattered remains of small planet-like objects that were destroyed in the early years of the Solar System.Iron meteorites are rare, however, especially in Antarctica.Less than 1% of all the space rocks recovered in searches on the continent are of the metal type, compared with about 5% elsewhere in the world.But the Manchester researchers believe they know the reason for this statistical deficit.Their modelling work suggests the iron meteorites are out there; they've simply buried themselves in the ice in the Antarctic sunshine.""Iron meteorites have a higher thermal conductivity than chondrites, or stony meteorites,"" explained mathematician Dr Geoff Evatt. ""That means they can warm and melt the ice around them more efficiently. So we expect them to be there, hanging just below the surface,"" he told BBC News.The scientists arrived this week at the British Antarctic Survey's (BAS) Rothera station to begin preparations.They'll be heading out into the field very shortly, taking with them a specially designed metal-detecting system that will be dragged behind a couple of snowmobiles.Whenever this technology is alerted to an interesting signal, the team will jump off its vehicles and dig down into the ice.Over the 15-20 sq km that will be surveyed, the researchers hope to find four or five iron meteorites.This would enable some great science, said Dr Katie Joy.""By looking at the age, structure and chemistry of iron meteorites, we can understand the timing of the processes that occurred in the early Solar System - and the numbers and diversity of these small planets that were forming. And all of that information can help us understand how we got big planets like Earth, Mars and Venus.""The expedition is the culmination of three years' hard graft for the team.After winning the funding to attempt to prove the idea of a buried population of iron meteorites, the scientists then had to design, build and test its detection technology; and identify the most suitable location to deploy it.The snowmobile-dragged array incorporates a lot of the electronics found in standard mine-detection equipment. It has had to be made more hard-wearing, however, to cope with the bashing it will receive when bouncing across solid ice. Operation in sub-zero temperatures was also factored into the design.Dr Evatt successfully put a prototype through its paces at the BAS Sky Blu fuel depot a year ago. At the same time Dr Joy ventured into the Antarctic's deep interior to inspect favourable meteorite-hunting grounds.The continent is helpful to scientists in that the flow of the ice tends to aggregate fallen space rocks against ridges and mountains.Dr Joy picked up more than 30 surface stony meteorites in her travels, and settled on a place now called the Outer Recovery Ice Fields for the upcoming iron quest.""It would be really exciting if we could find a lunar or Martian meteorite. That would be the cherry on the cake. But hopefully we can find about 80 surface meteorites made up of different asteroid types. And if we can find that many, this implies that beneath the ice surface we may have four or five iron-rich meteorites - if our theory is correct.""The Manchester-led project is funded by the Leverhulme Trust with logistic support from BAS.The team is running a blog to report on its discoveries. There will be some audio updates as well on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	UK set for 'active' role at European space meeting	What can €12.5bn buy at Esa?	"It now looks highly likely that the UK will increase its subscription to the European Space Agency.For the past week the long-promised uplift in the country's membership fee had appeared extremely doubtful.Such a reversal would have threatened leadership roles in a number of space missions and denied British industry some lucrative R&D contracts.But the UK government indicated to Esa late on Tuesday that it was ready to move forward with negotiations.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said: ""The UK has a world-leading space industry. As a founding member and one of the main contributors to the European Space Agency, we have sent a UK delegation to the ministerial conference to participate actively in discussions.""It hasn't been confirmed officially, but the BBC understands the UK is set to increase its €355m (£305m) annual subscription by ""more than 15%"".The negotiations here in the Spanish city of Seville should see Esa's 22 member states approve an overall package of programmes worth €12.5bn (£10.7bn; $13.8bn). The final figure will be announced on Thursday.This money will cover a range of activities from new Earth observation satellites to joint missions to the Moon and Mars with the United States.Esa's triennial councils at ministerial level always start with some kind of drama, or argument, and this time it's been the UK's turn to be at the centre of it.The country has been saying for some months that it intended to spend more money in Esa. ""If Esa didn't exist, someone would have to invent it,"" Science Minister Chris Skidmore told this year's UK space conference.But it's understood the Prime Minister's office raised a number of questions last week about the appropriateness of an increased subscription, especially in an election period, and how the subscription would fit with a proposed national space programme.Officials have spent recent days responding to those questions and, seemingly, reassuring No 10.UK industry has been lobbying hard for a subscription increase.Businesses say the R&D investments that flow back into the home space sector are vital to its global competitiveness.Britain builds a quarter of the world's big telecommunications satellites, for example. It's a major reason why Esa also bases its telecoms technical centre in Oxfordshire.Esa is often confused with the European Union. The organisations are actually separate legal entities and although the majority of their member states are the same, there is not a complete overlap.Agency officials are putting a broad package of proposals before member states to approve. Apart from the mandatory contributions to the agency's running costs and its general science programme, nations can pick and choose which projects to back and at what level. These are some of the areas member states can bid into.Human spaceflight and robotic exploration - This is a near-€2bn programme that aims to put Esa directly in the US space agency's (Nasa) grand plan to return astronauts to the Moon - known as Artemis. Member states are being asked to fully fund two propulsion units for the Americans' Orion crew capsules, and to pay to start development work on modules that would attach to a lunar space station called Gateway. Mars exploration also features in this budget line. Esa wants to bring rock samples from the planet back to Earth for study in the laboratory. Technologies for this include a surface rover that UK engineers would very much like to build.Earth observation - The package on the table is worth close to €2.4bn. The key component, valued at €1.4bn, would kick off the next phase of the Copernicus Earth observation programme. This is the most ambitious civil EO venture in the world and has seen a suite of satellites being launched in recent years to take a health check on the planet. The new phase, to be approved in Seville, would start the development of another six Sentinels, as they are known. Copernicus is a complex programme, not least because it's run in partnership with the EU. British industry believes it has the capacity to lead the R&D on two of the proposed Sentinels, but this will very much depend on how much money the UK puts on the table.Telecommunication - This €1.7bn programme has been very successful in the past in leveraging matching private investment. The programme supports the innovations that go into the next generation of commercial telecommunications satellites, which bounce TV, data, phone calls and broadband internet around the world. A key initiative here in Seville is an effort to develop technologies that can transmit information via laser light. Satellites generally make their connections through radio links, but these are becoming something of a bottleneck, especially when compared with the capabilities of the fibre infrastructure on the ground. If satellites could make greater use of optical transmissions, it would keep them on the innovation pace.Space transportation - This line is worth almost €2.7bn. This has been the most fractious area in past Councils as Europe has debated how best to meet the competitive challenge of the US rocket industry. Member state companies - principally in France, Germany and Italy - are working on two new vehicles, one called Ariane 6 and the other Vega C. They'd loft the smallest to the biggest satellites on the market. Crucially, the rockets should be much cheaper to build and operate. This meeting will approve funds to finish their development and to open new R&D projects to boost their future competitiveness. This would include technologies to allow a rocket to be used more than once.Space safety - This area, worth €600m, is all about protection - of space infrastructure and of Earth itself. On the list is a satellite known as Lagrange that would stare at the Sun to warn of outbursts that could damage other spacecraft and interfere with radio communications and power grids on Earth. This project is of primary interest to the UK. At the last ministerial council, member states rejected an asteroid encounter mission. The decision drew criticism because of our need to study objects that could hit - and devastate - the Earth. In response, Esa is putting forward a new mission for subscription called Hera. This small probe would visit a space rock that had previously been bombarded by a Nasa mission to learn more about how threatening asteroids could be deflected.Science programme - Valued at €2.8bn, all member states must contribute to the projects that fall under this umbrella. Science spending in the agency has been depressed at recent councils, receiving only ""flat cash"" settlements. This time, the intention is to give the budget area a stronger-than-inflation rise - at 10%. One of the benefits would be to provide the funding necessary to accelerate some exciting missions a decade from now. Esa is building a big X-ray space telescope called Athena and a constellation of satellites, known as Lisa, that could detect the gravitational waves from colliding black holes. It would be best if they could be flown at the same time to study events in the cosmos in tandem. The money promised at this council should make that possible.The BBC invited Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP and Brexit parties to give their positions on perhaps the most contentious area of the meeting - Copernicus, because of its large EU involvement. The Lib Dems said they were supporters of Copernicus and lauded the ""ground breaking technology"" it had brought to the near real-time detection of flooding; Labour said it too backed continued collaboration on what it called ""vital"" EU programmes. The SNP and the Brexit Party have yet to come back to us.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	PM vows to 'supercharge' UK science with fast-track visas	Open Britain'No limits'No-deal 'damage'Devil in the detail	"Boris Johnson has instructed government departments to devise a new fast-track visa system to attract leading scientists to work in the UK.The PM plans to scrap the cap on ""tier one"" visas for highly skilled migrants - currently the limit is 2,000 a year.He also wants to make the system easier for scientists and their families.Science bodies have welcomed the proposals but warn any benefits to research would be greatly outweighed by the damage caused by a no-deal Brexit.The prime minister made the announcement at the Culham science centre in Oxfordshire which undertakes research on fusion power.The Home Office and the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis) are the departments involved in preparing the new visa process.Speaking exclusively to BBC News about the announcement, he said that he wanted to see a greater openness to scientific top talent from around the world.""We're going to turn the UK into a kind of supercharged magnet, drawing scientists like iron filings from around the world coming to help push forward projects like this (fusion research in Culham) in which we can not only take a scientific lead but a commercial lead as well,"" he said.EU researchers account for half of the total UK scientific workforce of 211,000. Currently, they don't need visas to work in British labs.Those from outside the UK currently need to go through a rigorous process supervised by the Home Office. The process is time consuming, taking up to 100 days and costly, with a bill of about £8,000.After Brexit, new applicants from EU countries will have to go through the same procedure, prompting fears of a large scientific skills shortage.In response, Mr Johnson has asked the Home Office and Beis to develop a system that has no limit on numbers allowed to work in the UK under the tier one exceptional talent visas. He also wants them to expand the pool of UK research institutes and universities able to endorse candidates.In addition, he wants officials to come up with criteria that confer automatic endorsement, subject to immigration checks, ensuring dependants are also able to work in the UK and remove the need to hold an offer of employment before arriving.Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the UK's Royal Society, has been calling for such reforms since the result of the referendum on membership of the EU in 2016.""We welcome the government's objective of supporting science by facilitating immigration of researchers at all levels, and look forward to discussing the details of a new immigration system,"" he told BBC News.""But the fact remains, half of international academic talent in UK universities comes from the European Union and the EU is our single largest research collaborator.""Alongside immigration reform, therefore, maintaining close working ties with researchers in Europe and access to EU research funding, are essential. A no-deal exit from the EU is the worst option for science.""Chi Onwurah MP, the shadow spokesperson on science and industrial strategy, said that a no-deal Brexit would be ""hugely damaging"" for British science.""Britain is a science superpower and we need to build an innovation nation but that won't be achieved by a few fast track visas and re-announcing commitments already given, and broken, on replacement funding for EU programmes"" she said.""Science is a team activity, we need to promote collaboration at all levels not only the super-elite, and deliver on long-term commitments to be part of EU research programmes.""Mr Johnson reiterated that he did not want a no-deal Brexit but, were there to be one, he pledged to ensure that the UK would continue to collaborate in great scientific projects ""under any circumstances"".""We are not only going to participate in the (EU funded) Horizon schemes, we in the new UK government are determined to finance big science as well,"" he said.""So when these people come forward, as they are now, with plans for UK-generated fusion reactors, we are going to be championing those and supporting those as well.""The UK will be unable to participate fully in the EU-funded Horizon programmes once it leaves the EU and British scientists may not be able to be involved at all if the UK leaves without a deal.Participation in Europe's programme to develop nuclear fusion, of which the Culham science centre is a part, will also be restricted after Brexit.UK researchers are as much concerned about the loss of scientific collaborations with EU research institutes as they are about the loss of European funding.A recent Royal Society study showed more than 33% of UK research papers are co-authored with EU scientists and countries associated to the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. This compares with 17.6% that are co-authored with US researchers.James Wilsdon, professor of research policy at Sheffield University, described the proposed measures as ""small beer compared to the chaos, disruption and damage to the UK's attractiveness to international collaborators & mobile talent that will result from a no-deal Brexit"".Dr Daniel Rathbone, assistant director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) welcomed the prime minister's ""powerful message"", but looked forward to seeing the details of his proposals.""Any new visa system must be streamlined, easy to use and competitively priced compared to other leading science nations. Currently, UK visas are significantly more expensive than those of other countries.""Science is also a collaborative enterprise, so it would be very beneficial if there was a streamlined process for these talented scientists to bring their teams with them to the UK.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Attempts to 'erase the science' at UN climate talks		"Oil producing countries are trying to ""erase the science"" on keeping the world's temperatures below 1.5C, say some delegates at UN talks in Bonn.The chair of the Alliance of Small Island States said Saudi Arabia and others were trying to pretend a key scientific report didn't exist.Small island states believe keeping temperatures below 1.5C this century is critical to their survival.A key report in October said this was possible.But huge emissions cuts would be needed in the short term.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on 1.5C was commissioned by the UN back in 2015.But when it was presented to climate negotiators in December in Poland, four countries including the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait refused to ""welcome"" it.The simmering battle over the report has re-emerged here at this meeting in Bonn.There has been a serious battle over a text that would include reference to the scientists' conclusion that carbon emissions would have to be reduced by 45% by 2030.Saudi Arabia has been at the fore in wanting to include text that underlined the uncertainties in the report.For the group of around 40 small island states, this has proved inflammatory.""The report came out in in October of 2018 and now we see this move at the negotiations to try and have it almost erased from existence, which is impossible to do,"" Lois Young, the ambassador from Belize, who is chairing the group, told the BBC.""There's this move to pretend as though it's not there, to not to refer to it in documents. And it's been ongoing since we got here.""The Saudis have gained some support in their arguments from an unlikely alliance of countries, including the US, Australia and Iran.""The countries that are trying to downplay the importance of the document, erase it from the records, not all of them are showing their faces,"" said Ambassador Young.""It's unreal, it's as though they're resigning our Aosis states to collateral damage, I mean, it's like we have no importance doesn't matter.""Other observers here believe that the IPCC report has been a critical document in helping raise public awareness of the threat posed by climate change.""The report has had a transformational effect, not just with the UK now passing a net zero law, but with public opinion around the world,"" said Alden Meyer, from the Union of Concerned Scientists.""But there is a fault line between a handful of countries, most of them major oil producers on the significance and status of the report. But they can't put the stopper back in the bottle and pretend the report doesn't exist.""Efforts at finding a compromise are ongoing here in Bonn, with some delegates believing that both the goals for 2030 and the Saudi questions about uncertainty can be accommodated.These talks are due to finish later today but if an agreed text can't be found, the increasingly rancorous debate may spill into the open at the final meeting this afternoon.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Tory hopefuls told not to squander UK science progress	More stories like this:Hollow ring	"The Conservative leadership candidates have been urged to make a pledge to put scientific research at the heart of their economic policy.Scientific bodies have called on Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson to set out their long-term plans for research.They want them to commit to ensuring that the UK remains a world leader in research and innovation.There is also alarm that the political uncertainty is stalling efforts to develop a strategy for UK science.The president of the UK's Royal Society, Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, told BBC News that the uncertainty ""could threaten the research and innovation that are vital for the long-term health of our economy"".Science has been relatively well-funded under Theresa May. Under her premiership, science funding has been increased by more than £2.5bn and a target has been set to boost public and private science spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2027 - which would require a further £20bn from government and £40bn from industry.Research is also at the heart of the government's industrial strategy, which aims to develop a high-skills, high-technology economy.Sir Venki said it was vital that both leadership candidates commit to continuing the policy.""If we lose the momentum behind the commitment to investing 2.4% of GDP, we will be left behind by our competitors. If that happens, any talk of a bright future for the UK could have a very hollow ring to it.""We need Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to really get behind the 2.4% target, including committing to investing the government's own share, and show us what a real vision for future prosperity looks like.""The Royal Society, the Russell Group of Universities and the CBI, among others, are concerned that science is not on Jeremy Hunt's or Boris Johnson's radar. James Wilsdon, who is professor of research policy at Sheffield University, worries that the progress UK science has made might be squandered.""Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are now spraying around large and un-costed commitments to tax cuts and defence spending - with no mention so far of the importance of research, innovation and industrial strategy,"" he told BBC News.""The 2.4% target requires billions of pounds of government investment, but it's hard to see where this will come from, when our economy faces so much uncertainty and the cliff-edge of a no-deal Brexit.""In a joint statement, several research and business bodies urge Hunt and Johnson to ""ensure the UK remains globally competitive, delivering a strong and prosperous future for our economy and society post-Brexit"".It continues: ""The evidence is clear: investment in R&D drives productivity and raises living standards, benefitting people and communities across the whole of the UK. From the great challenges of our time, including cancer, climate change, food security and caring for an ageing society, to the creation of high-skilled jobs, new businesses, and the innovations that power our NHS - UK research and innovation has real-life impact.""Dr Sarah Main, executive director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case), said that the aim of the joint statement was to put the importance of scientific research in the minds of the two candidates for prime minister.""This cross-sector letter shows how important it is for the next prime minister to back the UK's strength in science. It will stimulate the ideas, innovation and investment to improve the quality of life and attract global attention,"" she said.Uncertainty about the level of funding for science has made it difficult for the recently created UK Research and Innovation agency (UKRI), which is the body that funds research, to develop a long-term strategy for UK science. Its plan should have been published this month.Prof Wilsdon said that UKRI was waiting for clarity on policy before producing its plan.""With so much political, economic and sectoral uncertainty, it's not surprising that UKRI hasn't yet published the longer-term blueprint for research and innovation that was expected. For good or ill, UKRI has pinned its strategic colours to the 2.4% of GDP mast. But choppy waters lie ahead. and if the 2.4% target goes down, UKRI may also flounder in delivering on the aspirations that surrounded its creation.""The agency's sense of paralysis has been compounded by the departure of senior staff. Its strategy director, Rebecca Endean - who joined in March 2017 - left last week, while the chief finance officer, Ian Kenyon, is due to leave in July after just over a year-and-a-half in the post. In a statement issued in April, he said it was ""in light of changes within the finance and operations portfolio"".The joint statement has been signed by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Association of Medical Research Charities, the British Academy, the Campaign for Science and Engineering, Cancer Research UK, the Confederation for British Industry, the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Russell Group and Universities UK.Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Europe's new space budget to enable CO2 mapping	Other highlights to come out of Space19+	"Europe will press ahead with a network of satellites to track carbon dioxide emissions across the globe.They will be developed out of a new European Space Agency (Esa) budget agreed in Seville, Spain.Research ministers on Thursday approved a package of proposals worth some €14.4bn (£12.3bn/$15.9bn) over the next five years.As well as the new CO2 monitoring system, the funds will also pave the way for missions to the Moon and Mars.""You're looking at a very happy DG,"" said Jan Wörner, the director general of Esa, after getting pretty much everything he wanted from the ""Space19+"" Ministerial Council. ""It always looks so simple. But it took more than two years of preparations to get here. Unbelievable!""While there were multiple projects being considered here, it is the support given to Earth observation (EO) that catches the eye.Delegates from 22 nations had been asked to pledge €1.4bn (£1.2bn) to expand the so-called Copernicus programme, which flies a suite of Sentinel satellites to track the health of the planet. At the end of two days of discussions, the actual figure committed was €1.8bn (£1.5bn).The extra cash will enable Esa to improve the performance of the new Sentinels.The three spacecraft that will make up the carbon dioxide constellation will have their resolution increased, to be able to map grid squares across the globe of just 2km across. And their swath - the width of their vision - will be increased from 200km to nearly 300km. In addition, the satellites will be given more instruments to help tease apart the CO2 coming from natural sources from that which is being produced by humans.The enhanced capability is expected to be a potent tool in helping all nations - not just European ones - better understand their carbon footprint.Esa wants to get the new Sentinel system launched by 2025/26, to align its mapping service with the global stocktake of emissions that will be undertaken in 2028 as part of the Paris climate deal.As well as CO2-sensing satellites, the expanded Copernicus programme will develop five other systems to measure a range of Earth variables, from the extent of Arctic sea-ice to the temperature of the global land surface.The impressive backing for these new Earth observing spacecraft was driven largely by Germany, which pledged €518m (£444m) of the total €1.8bn. Its industry will now get the bulk of the R&D contracts.""Earth observation is the cornerstone of German space policy,"" said Thomas Jarzombek, from the nation's Economic Affairs Ministry.""People are more and more interested in climate change and what we can do to protect ourselves against it. Information is key because we can only really act against climate change if we understand what it going on. Copernicus gives us better data,"" he told BBC News.It should be stated that Copernicus is a joint venture between Esa and the EU, with the latter covering 70% of the overall costs. Brussels' contribution to the expansion programme has yet to be determined.""There is today about €6bn (£5.1bn) foreseen as part of the [EU] budget for space. And we look forward to completing the constellation with the recurring [satellites] which are to be paid for by the EU along with, of course, their operation,"" explained Esa EO director, Josef Aschbacher.Across the entire Space19+ budget request, the top contributing countries were:The UK's subscription after this meeting will rise from €355m (£304m) per year to €440m (£377m) per year.Graham Peters, the chair of the trade association UKSpace sees this as a positive outcome.""It gives us a fantastic platform upon which we can now build the national space programme to develop new sovereign capabilities and to start collaborating more globally to drive exports,"" he said.Human spaceflight and robotic exploration - This near-€2bn programme was 98% subscribed. It will make Esa an important partner in the US space agency's (Nasa) grand plan to return astronauts to the Moon - known as Artemis. Member states committed money in Seville to fund two propulsion units for the Americans' Orion crew capsules. Cash was also made available to start development work on modules that will attach to a lunar space station called Gateway. On Mars exploration, the agency now has the money to advance missions to bring rock samples back to Earth from the Red Planet. Technologies for this include a surface rover that UK engineers would very much like to build.Science - Valued at €2.8bn, all member states must contribute to the projects that fall under this umbrella. The 10% increase in this budget line is the first real-terms increase in 25 years. One of the benefits will be to provide the funding necessary to align the development path of a couple of very exciting observatories. Esa is building a big X-ray space telescope called Athena and a constellation of satellites, known as Lisa, that could detect the gravitational waves from colliding black holes. It would be best if they flew at the same time to study cosmic events in tandem. The money promised at this council should now make this possible in 2031/32.Space transportation - In recent times, it has been arguments over the future development of Europe's rockets that have bedevilled Esa ministerial meetings. Not this time. Differences of opinion on how to finish, financially support and further innovate the new vehicles known as Ariane 6 and Vega C were settled on the eve of the meeting. France, Germany and Italy dominate this programme area which will be receiving €2.2bn from the new budget. Also in the plan is an Italian-led project to launch a reusable mini robotic shuttle called Space Rider. It will carry experimental payloads into orbit and back. A prototype has been launched in the past, but the first certification flight of an updated, operational model will take place in 2022.Space safety and security - This area, worth just over €540m, is all about protection - of space infrastructure and of Earth itself. Put before ministers was a satellite concept known as Lagrange that would stare at the Sun to warn of outbursts that could damage other spacecraft and interfere with radio communications and power grids on Earth. It's a project primarily of interest to the UK. It didn't receive all the money it needed and a decision was taken to work only on the spacecraft's instruments for now. At the last ministerial council, member states rejected an asteroid encounter mission. The decision drew criticism because of our need to study objects that could hit - and devastate - the Earth. In response, Esa designed a new mission for subscription called Hera, and this time it won the financial support needed to proceed. Hera will visit a space rock that has previously been bombarded by a Nasa mission to learn more about how threatening asteroids could be deflected.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Ministers told back up science vision or risk UK stagnation	'Scale and urgency'Diversity	"A £20bn investment is needed if the government is to achieve its vision of a science-led economy, according to a new analysis.The Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) is calling for the boost in UK science funding to avoid the risk of ""stagnation"".The UK currently ranks 23rd in its R&D spending as a proportion of GDP.Case said now was the time for the government to set out details of its plan.""The government has set out a bold vision for UK science,"" said executive director, Dr Sarah Main.""It is a potentially transformative one for the entire country. But now is the time for it to put some substance to the plan.""In 2017 the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a government target to increase public and private research investment from 1.7% of GDP to 2.4% of GDP by 2027.The UK currently ranks 23rd in its R&D spending as a proportion of GDP, behind Iceland and Norway. The Government has already pledged an additional £7bn to UK R&D by 2022. But, according to Case, the government has to treble that investment over the following five years if it is to reach its target. This would mean making a commitment to invest £21bn.The investment would raise Britain's ranking to 13th if other countries maintained their level of spending. But the UK would still be below Belgium.James Wilsdon, who is professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said that the report was a timely reminder of the ""scale and urgency"" of the funding of UK science at a time when the minds of politicians have been dominated by Brexit.""As the beauty parade gets underway for a new PM and leader of the Conservative party, anyone who cares about the long-term economic prospects of the nation should be judging candidates by the seriousness of their commitment to the 2.4% of GDP goal.""Earlier this month, the German government pledged year-on-year increases of 3% in its research spending up to 2027. As Case shows, if we're to even stand still, let alone move into the premier league of global R&D spenders, we need to see a similarly ambitious plan from the UK government.""Case's report is drawn from a survey of its membership which includes over 100 organisations, including businesses, universities, learned and professional organisations and research charities. They say that a £21bn pledge could attract an additional £27.5bn of research investment from private sources over 15 years.Its report warns that a failure to provide such an uplift would lead to ""stagnation"". It also calls for a clear strategy on how the increased money is to be spent effectively.Case recommends that an early priority should be to increase the number of people studying postgraduate degrees to avoid a skills shortage when the fruits of the investment in research begin to come through.Part of this push should include efforts by the UK Research and Innovation agency (UKRI), which directs research funding, to increase the number of under-represented groups studying science. These include women, people from poorer backgrounds, disabled individuals and black students.According to Dr Main, this would entail collecting data on the diversity of those studying science and assessing the approaches that are effective.""The issue of who is employed and engaged in science is not just to feed the workforce,"" she explained.""It is to make sure that in ten years' time, after this huge amount of money has been invested, that more people across the UK can have a stake in it, that they have a say in how research is used and how it affects their lives.""And that this huge change is something that they can be part of and benefit from.""The report also says that it should be easier for firms to access the myriad of funds and incentives available for research.A spokesperson from the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy, which is responsible for research, welcomed the report and its recommendations.""The government is investing record levels into research and development, while working closely with stakeholders to fuel investment in the private sector to ensure we become the global leaders in new and emerging technologies and secure highly-skilled jobs and investment in all parts of the country.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Geologist blasts society's links with oil firms		"Oil and gas firms have got one of the world's leading scientific societies in their pockets, a top geologist says.Prof Bill McGuire is furious at the links between major fossil fuel companies and the Geological Society.After more than 40 years as a member, he's resigned from the society – saying it's madness to take cash from firms causing a climate emergency.The society said geologists were playing a vital role in the transition to the zero carbon economy.But Prof McGuire told BBC News: ""Geologists know more than anyone how suddenly an apparently stable climate can dramatically shift, with massive consequences.""The society shouldn't be accepting sponsorship from these firms and cosying up to them. It's madness.""He pointed to the corporate sponsors page on the society's website, which features firms like Exxon Mobil that have tried to discredit climate science in the past.The society gravitates naturally towards fossil fuel firms because they provide many well-paid jobs for geologists.Prof McGuire said: ""The society makes pronouncements on climate change from time to time, but doesn't mention its support from firms that are causing the problem.""The society conspires with climate change deniers. Hopefully, younger society members will ask what they are doing. There are many geology jobs in engineering or renewables.""Prof McGuire is Emeritus Professor of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at University College London.In an open letter to the society president, he refers to the sponsors list: ""To anyone with even the slightest interest in the sort of world we wish to leave our children and their children, this reads like a tally from hell; a list of some of the biggest despoilers of the surface of our planet, its ecosystems and its atmosphere.""Even worse, a number of the corporations listed have worked actively to discredit climate science and to undermine efforts to tackle climate change.""I appreciate that these affiliates are major employers of geologists, but – at a time of climate and ecological emergency – this is quite simply no excuse, nor a justification, for sustaining links with companies that are working against humanity and that put profit before people's lives and livelihoods.""It truly beggars belief that the society can sign up to a communique on climate change demanding action by government, businesses, public institutions and others – as it did in 2015 – yet continue to cosy up to some of the world's most polluting corporations.""A spokesperson for the society said: ""We are not aware of any other members resigning for [Prof McGuire's] reason.""The Geological Society of London represents geologists from all industries and disciplines, in the UK and abroad.""We believe the society believes that geologists and geoscience knowledge have a vital role in meeting current targets for reducing emissions and supporting the energy transition.""Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
science	AAAS: Machine learning 'causing science crisis'	'Reproducibility crisis'More from Pallab at the AAAS:Flawed patterns	"Machine-learning techniques used by thousands of scientists to analyse data are producing results that are misleading and often completely wrong.Dr Genevera Allen from Rice University in Houston said that the increased use of such systems was contributing to a “crisis in science”.She warned scientists that if they didn’t improve their techniques they would be wasting both time and money. Her research was presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington.A growing amount of scientific research involves using machine learning software to analyse data that has already been collected. This happens across many subject areas ranging from biomedical research to astronomy. The data sets are very large and expensive.But, according to Dr Allen, the answers they come up with are likely to be inaccurate or wrong because the software is identifying patterns that exist only in that data set and not the real world.“Often these studies are not found out to be inaccurate until there's another real big dataset that someone applies these techniques to and says ‘oh my goodness, the results of these two studies don't overlap‘,"" she said.“There is general recognition of a reproducibility crisis in science right now. I would venture to argue that a huge part of that does come from the use of machine learning techniques in science.”The “reproducibility crisis” in science refers to the alarming number of research results that are not repeated when another group of scientists tries the same experiment. It can mean that the initial results were wrong. One analysis suggested that up to 85% of all biomedical research carried out in the world is wasted effort.It is a crisis that has been growing for two decades and has come about because experiments are not designed well enough to ensure that the scientists don’t fool themselves and see what they want to see in the results.Machine learning systems and the use of big data sets has accelerated the crisis, according to Dr Allen. That is because machine learning algorithms have been developed specifically to find interesting things in datasets and so when they search through huge amounts of data they will inevitably find a pattern.“The challenge is can we really trust those findings?” she told BBC News.“Are those really true discoveries that really represent science? Are they reproducible? If we had an additional dataset would we see the same scientific discovery or principle on the same dataset? And unfortunately the answer is often probably not.”Dr Allen is working with a group of biomedical researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston to improve the reliability of their results. She is developing the next generation of machine learning and statistical techniques that can not only sift through large amounts of data to make discoveries, but also report how uncertain their results are and their likely reproducibility.“Collecting these huge data sets is incredibly expensive. And I tell the scientists that I work with that it might take you longer to get published, but in the end your results are going to stand the test of time.“It will save scientists money and it's also important to advance science by not going down all of these wrong possible directions.”Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Europe keen to demonstrate Moon ambitions		"The European Space Agency (Esa) will show its commitment to the new wave of lunar exploration when member-state research ministers meet in Seville, Spain, next week.The politicians are expected to commit hundreds of millions of euros to fund technologies that will support the US-led Artemis project to return humans to the Moon.Included will be the money to complete two propulsion-cum-service modules that are needed to push the Americans' Orion crew capsules through space.These spacecraft, which will take part in the Nasa missions known as Artemis 3 and 4, are scheduled to fly from 2024 onwards.They will witness the first astronaut sorties to the lunar surface in nearly 50 years.Also set to be nodded through by ministers at the Seville Council is development work on the international lunar space station, known as Gateway.Europe wants to contribute a habitation module (iHab) and a second multi-purpose unit that would enable access, refuelling, and high-data-rate communications to the Moon's surface.Dubbed Esprit, this unit would come with big windows through which the Gateway's live-aboard astronauts could monitor robotic operations on the exterior of the station but also look down on the Moon and back to Earth.The menu before research ministers at their Seville Council (PDF) doesn't end there. Esa officials also envisage a large autonomous freighter that could deliver supplies to astronauts working on the lunar surface.It wouldn't fly until later in the next decade, but engineers need to begin the design work now.""We want to do a robotic Moon mission that is part of the human exploration,"" explained Dr David Parker, who directs the agency's human and robotic exploration programmes.""Basically, we'd like to be able to send a cargo vehicle to the Moon - to take the food, the rovers; whatever you need for long-term sustained exploration on the surface. And that vehicle could also do science by bringing rock and soil samples back up to the Gateway,"" he told BBC News.Dr Parker will be laying a near-€2bn request before ministers next week - a step up from the €1.5bn approved at the last major Council in Lucerne in 2016. And while ambitions at the Moon currently catch the eye, Europe has also to maintain its infrastructure just above the Earth.Its Columbus science lab, which has been a part of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost 11 years, is going through a modernisation programme. Esa will be updating the lab's ground support and attempting to bring in new players to use the facility.Dr Parker, a former chief executive at the UK Space Agency, has within his remit robotic exploration at Mars.This includes the Rosalind Franklin rover, which is set to launch to the Red Planet next July, assuming the troublesome parachutes on its descent-and-landing system can be made ready in time. The chutes are in the midst of a make-or-break test programme.The Council must approve the next tranche of money for the project, which will be used in part to fund the six-wheeled vehicle's operation on the Martian surface. But ministers will also be asked to turn their minds to ""what comes next"".This is Mars Sample Return - the quest to bring back rock and dust samples to Earth labs for study. These samples will be chosen and cached in small canisters by the US space agency's (Nasa) big 2020 rover.The one-tonne robot will drop the canisters on the ground and it will be the job of a later European ""fetch rover"" to go around and retrieve them.Dr Parker wants money to push forward development activities - for this small rover and a European spacecraft that would do the transfer of the samples from Mars to Earth.""There is a robotic arm involved that we need to work on too. This would take the sample tubes from the fetch rover and load them into the Mars ascent vehicle from Nasa. The ascent vehicle - essentially a rocket - takes the sample tubes up to the European orbiter.""UK industry and academia have interest in many of these projects. For example, they're keen to get involved in the communications aspects of the Esprit module; British engineers would like also to work on the propulsion system that takes the Moon freighter down to the surface; and having been responsible for the assembly of Rosalind Franklin, there is eagerness to lead the fetch rover.In addition, Britain is looking for support from other member states in Seville to help take the Lunar Pathfinder concept to the next level. This is a commercial service that Esa would purchase.It envisions a mothership-type spacecraft, to be built at SSTL in Guildford, that would ferry smaller satellites to the Moon's vicinity and then relay their communications back to Earth. Other Esa nations or commercial concerns could book a ride on Pathfinder.The head of the US space agency, Administrator Jim Bridenstine, recently wrote to his Esa counter-part, Director General Jan Wörner, inviting Europe to play a major role in the Artemis missions.The Nasa chief said he hoped to see a European astronaut on the lunar surface in the near future. This is ultimately the goal, confirmed Dr Parker.""What we're doing at this ministerial is laying the ground in steps that would get Europeans to the surface of the Moon. That's the big objective,"" he told BBC News.""It's not tomorrow, because it's not going to be tomorrow for anyone. But that's absolutely what we're working towards.""It will probably mean new astronauts will need to be recruited and trained - a process that takes a minimum of five years. ""This is a specific decision member states would have to make; when they want us to do that. But it would make sense to start thinking about the post-2025 era,"" Dr Parker said."
science	Ten big science stories of 2018	"A ""safe"" limit for warmingThe earliest animalsGiant plastic bergGhost particle bustersA watery Mars - and MoonWhat happened to the Stonehenge builders?Icy impactAn earlier exodusRocks from MarsPlastic in our water"	"The year 2018 provided plenty to chew on if you're interested in science and the environment. From the stark warning from climate scientists about the dangers of letting temperatures rise beyond 1.5C to the discovery of a 20km-wide liquid water lake on Mars, it was a memorable year.Here's a rundown of some of 2018's most eye-catching stories.A rise in global temperatures of 2C by the end of this century has long been seen as the gateway to dangerous climate change. Researchers had argued that keeping within this limit was necessary to avoid the most damaging effects of global warming.But some have been pushing for an even lower target of 1.5C. In October, climate scientists released a major report detailing what would be involved in keeping the temperature rise to within that tougher limit.This would result in millions fewer people losing their homes to rising seas, fewer species at risk of extinction and a drastic reduction in the numbers of people experiencing water scarcity.But it would also be hugely expensive and require ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes"" to society. The report didn't tell governments what to do, but set out a range of approaches including heavy cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes.Other climate change stories from 2018Climate change 'greatest threat', UN toldLast four years are 'world's hottest'Climate change: Where we are in seven chartsThe one-million-plus animal species alive today are staggeringly diverse, from the giant oceanic blue whale to the wriggly earthworms beneath our feet. But their early evolution from single-celled ancestors remains shrouded in mystery.In the hunt for the earliest animal life, much attention has been focused on a group of enigmatic life forms - known as the ""Ediacaran biota"" - from more than 500 million years ago. These were some of the first complex organisms to appear on Earth.But their position on the tree of life is difficult decipher. These curious creatures have been variously categorised as lichens, fungi, and even as a halfway house between plants and animals.In September, scientists were able to extract molecules of cholesterol from a fossilised Ediacaran life form called Dickinsonia, which resembled a flat jellyfish. Cholesterol is one of the molecular hallmarks of animal life, clearly demonstrating that the Ediacaran biota were animals.Other palaeontology stories from 2018The world's plastic waste crisis was one of the big themes of 2018. The problem had been highlighted by the BBC's Blue Planet 2 series, presented by David Attenborough, which contained shocking footage of the devastation wrought on the oceans and marine life by our addiction to plastic.In April, our Science Editor, David Shukman, visited Indonesia to report on a morass of plastic waste that had clogged rivers and canals in Bandung, on the Indonesian island of Java. The crisis was so acute, the army was called in to help clean up a vast plastic berg of bottles, bags and other plastic packaging.Worryingly, the problem only looks set to get worse. In March, a report commissioned by the UK government suggested the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decade unless litter is curbed.Other plastic waste stories from 2018Neutrinos are some of the fundamental building blocks of the Universe. These sub-atomic particles hurtle around the cosmos more-or-less unimpeded, interacting with very little. In fact, it's estimated that a single neutrino particle can pass through a light-year (about 10 trillion km) of lead without hitting a single atom.Many neutrinos we encounter on Earth come from the Sun or the Earth's atmosphere. But the origins of one group of ultra-high-energy neutrinos remained mysterious until this year. In July, an international team traced one of them to a distant galaxy firing a particle ""ray"" straight at the Earth.This type of galaxy is called a blazar. It has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central, massive black hole. As matter falls into the hole, enormous jets of charged particles emerge, turning these galaxies into vast particle accelerators.The IceCube experiment in Antarctica has been collecting data on these ultra-high-energy neutrinos for six years, but this was the first time researchers were able to match them with a source in the sky.Other astronomy stories from 2018We know there is water on Mars in the form of ice, and there are possible signs of occasional liquid flows. But in July, a team of scientists reported the discovery of a 20km-wide lake sitting under the planet's south polar ice cap.Nasa's Curiosity rover has been exploring the rock remnants of an ancient lake bed, but this is the first sign of a persistent body of water today. The result was exciting because scientists have long hunted for signs of present-day liquid water on Mars.""We are not closer to actually detecting life,"" said Manish Patel, from the UK's Open University, ""but what this finding does is give us the location of where to look on Mars.""Mars wasn't the only cosmic body making watery headlines. In August, researchers published what they said was the most definitive evidence yet for ice on the surface of the Moon.Data from India's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft suggests the presence of icy deposits at the north and south poles. This ancient water might be accessible as a resource for future human missions to the Moon.Other planetary science stories from 2018The field of ancient DNA - which involves extracting and analysing genetic material from long-dead people - has provided us with unprecedented insights into the past. One striking result from 2018 was the discovery that the ancient people of Britain were almost completely replaced in a mass migration from the continent about 4,500 years ago.The Neolithic Britons had just erected the big stones at Stonehenge when they were overrun by newcomers known as the Beaker people. This resulted in 90% of the British gene pool being replaced in just a few hundred years. Why this happened is unknown. But disease, famine and conflict are all potential candidates.In a different study released in 2018, researchers showed that 50,000-year-old bone fragments from Russia belonged to a girl who was half Denisovan and half Neanderthal. The Denisovans and Neanderthals were distinct species of human who inhabited Eurasia before our species - Homo sapiens - left Africa.Other ancient DNA stories from 2018In November, scientists identified what looked to be a large impact crater under the Greenland ice. The 31km-wide depression came to light when scientists examined radar images of the island's bedrock.The bowl was probably excavated by a 1.5km-wide iron asteroid sometime between about 12,000 and three million years ago. Some researchers have their doubts about the evidence presented so far. But it has raised some intriguing possibilities, including a potential connection to a period of strong cooling that punctuated the climatic warming seen as the Earth emerged from the height of the last Ice Age.There is a longstanding hypothesis that this dip in temperatures could have been the result of the sun's rays being blocked by debris thrown into the atmosphere by an impact and the smoke and ash from wildfires it set off. If further work confirms the age of the crater is close to the lower end of the age range, it could re-ignite interest in this old debate.Other earth science stories from 2018:Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the ancestors of most humans living outside Africa left the continent in one migration 60,000 years ago. But there is some evidence that pioneer modern humans (Homo sapiens) made forays outside Africa before this time.In January, scientists unveiled the jawbone of a modern human who died in Israel 185,000 years ago, tens of thousands of years earlier than previous evidence. Received wisdom suggests that these earlier excursions failed to provide modern humans with a permanent foothold in Eurasia.But the jawbone fits in with the emerging picture of earlier out-of-Africa migrations that spread further into Eurasia than many had believed. These pioneers appear to have lived alongside other human species such as the Neanderthals and Denisovans. But it remains a mystery as to why their genetic signatures are not preserved in people alive today.Other human evolution stories from 2018After years of discussion and one false start, the European and American space agencies made their first significant move towards bringing back rocks from Mars.In April, Nasa and Esa signed a letter of intent that would lead to the first ""round trip"" to another planet.The venture would allow scientists to start answering key questions about Martian history, including whether the planet once hosted life. But it would also allow geologists to start building an accurate chronology for events in Martian history.US missions over the last few decades have contributed enormously to our understanding of the Red Planet in situ, but there are mass constraints on the experiments that can fit on a payload destined for Mars.There's no comparison to the information scientists will be able to glean from studying Martian rocks and soil with the scientific instruments available in terrestrial laboratories.Other space exploration stories from 2018Plastic waste is increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, and this extends to our drinking water. Research by the journalism organisation Orb Media found an average of 10 plastic particles per litre in major brands of bottled water.In the largest investigation of its kind, 250 bottles bought in nine different countries were examined. Nearly all of them contained tiny plastic particles.Our planet's far north is often regarded as a pristine wilderness. But this year, researchers voiced their concern about the large concentrations of plastic building up in Arctic sea-ice.The number of particles in just one litre of melted Arctic sea ice was found to be higher than in the open ocean. Scientists said there was a need for more research into its effects on zooplankton, invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and mammals.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Death of the 'grandfather of climate science'		"Wallace Broecker, the US climate scientist who helped popularise the term ""global warming"" has died in New York at the age of 87.Prof Broecker was among the first to connect emissions of CO2 to rising temperatures back in the 1970s.He also studied the ocean conveyor belt, linking oceanography to climate change.Scientists the world over have paid tribute, calling Prof Broecker a ""genius and pioneer"".Widely known as Wally, Prof Broecker spent a career that spanned nearly 67 years at Columbia University in New York.In 1975, he published a paper in the journal Science that had a profound effect on thinking about the connection between carbon dioxide and temperatures around the world.It was titled Climatic Change: Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming? The paper was said to be the first time the phrase was used in a research paper.The study outlined the idea that humans were having a significant impact on the climate by emitting CO2.He argued that the world in the 1970s was experiencing what he believed was a 40-year cooling cycle that would soon end and the signal of human induced warming would soon be evident.Just a year later in 1976, temperatures started to go up and have gone up since along the lines that Wally Broecker predicted.In the 1980s, he told US political leaders that the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warranted a ""bold, new national effort aimed at understanding the operation of the realms of the atmosphere, oceans, ice and terrestrial biosphere"".Prof Broecker's work on the ocean current conveyor was also hugely important.He outlined the idea that the scale of circulation of these currents must help regulate the climate system by moving large amounts of heat from one place to another. He also developed the idea that the conveyor could suddenly change, leading to dramatic climatic shifts that could occur over decades not millennia, as previously thought.Prof Broecker was hugely concerned about the ability of humans to tackle the root causes of climate change. He became an early advocate for the idea of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere using machines.""I don't like the idea of a technological solution any more than anyone else does but I'm saying that unless we have a technological solution CO2 is going to keep on going up,"" he explained to the BBC in an interview back in 2009.""We can put a tax on CO2, society has learned how to keep water clean, now we have to learn how to keep the atmosphere in a nearly natural state.""We are not going to be able to do that because we are predestined, I think, to double CO2 in the atmosphere.""""And that means a 3.5C warming if the models are right, it means precipitation will change almost everywhere on the planet, polar ice will melt and sea level is going to slowly rise and these things are going to change the world we live in.""Prof Broecker's high standing as a scientist was reflected in the many messages and tweets that have followed his passing.""He has singlehandedly pushed more understanding than probably anybody in our field,"" said Richard Alley, a climatologist at Pennsylvania State University.""He is intellectually so huge in how the Earth system works and what its history is, that all of us are following Wally in one way or other.""Prof Broecker was known for his friendly, humble demeanour. He suffered from dyslexia, and never learned how to type or use a personal computer. He was somewhat embarrassed at the fuss over coining the term ""global warming"", which he put down to ""dumb luck"".In an obituary on the Columbia University website, Prof Broecker is quoted as warning that he would turn over in his grave if someone put the phrase on his tombstone."
science	Hawking's final science study released	Hawking's most important discoveries	"Stephen Hawking's final scientific paper has been released, and it deals with one of the central topics in the physicist's 56-year-long career.The work was completed in the days before Hawking's death in March.It tackles the question of whether black holes preserve information on the stuff that falls into them.Some researchers had believed this information was destroyed, but others said that this violated the laws of quantum mechanics.These laws propose that everything in our world can be broken down into information, for example, a string of 1s and 0s. In addition, this information should never disappear, not even if it gets sucked into a black hole.But Hawking, building on the work of Albert Einstein, showed that black holes have a temperature. And because hot objects lose heat into space, black holes must eventually evaporate - disappearing from existence.Black holes themselves are regions in space where the gravity is so strong that nothing that gets pulled in can escape.Obituary: Stephen HawkingVisionary physicist Stephen Hawking diesStephen Hawking: The science that made him famousWriting in the Guardian, one of the study's co-authors, Malcolm Perry, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""What Hawking discovered was that in black hole physics, there seemed to be even greater uncertainty than in quantum mechanics.""He added: ""That might not have mattered - except that black holes are real physical objects. There are huge black holes at the centres of many galaxies.""If an object has a temperature, it will also have a property known as entropy.""The entropy is a measure of how many different ways an object can be made from its microscopic ingredients and still look the same,"" said Prof Perry.He says that he discussed the paper with Hawking shortly before he died, but wasn't aware the professor was ill.""It was very difficult for Stephen to communicate and I was put on a loudspeaker to explain where we had got to. When I explained it, he simply produced an enormous smile,"" Prof Perry explained.The new paper shows mathematically that the entropy of a black hole may be recorded by the particles of light (photons) that surround the black hole's event horizon. The event horizon is a boundary, or point of no return, where escape from the gravitational pull of the black hole becomes impossible - including for light.The patina of light around the black hole has been dubbed ""soft hair"". ""What this paper does is show that 'soft hair' can account for the entropy,"" said Prof Perry.But he added that : ""We don't know that Hawking entropy accounts for everything you could possibly throw at a black hole, so this is really a step along the way.""Now Prof Perry and the remaining authors have to find out how the information associated with a black hole's entropy is physically stored in the soft hair, and how that information comes out of a black hole when it evaporates.The research builds on previous work published in 2015, which suggested that information might not make it into a black hole, but is held on its boundary.Prof Marika Taylor, a theoretical physicist at the University of Southampton, said: ""The authors have to make several non-trivial assumptions so the next steps will be to show that these assumptions are valid.""Previously, Prof Hawking had proposed that photons could be emitted from black holes due to quantum fluctuations, a concept known as Hawking radiation. Information from the black hole might be able to escape via this route, but it might be in a chaotic, useless form."

science	The festivals mixing music and science		"Music festivals are increasingly becoming a venue for science as well as bands. Are music and science a good mix?""It's changed my life,"" says Andrea Sella, who is professor of chemistry at University College London.""I couldn't believe that I'd found myself at Latitude in front of about 1,000 people talking about carbon dioxide, dry ice and climate change,"" he says of his first involvement in scientific outreach at a music festival seven years ago.""I thought, 'Oh my God, they started laughing. Let me remember what I did to cause it.'""It's changed the way I teach and speak to students. I've been able to take more risks. I've learnt enormous amounts about the craft of speaking in public.""Prof Sella, who won the Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize in 2015 for his science communication, is one of an increasing number of scientists who are involved in public engagement at music festivals.Bluedot, Green Man, Chagstock and Glastonbury are among the growing number of festivals who have brought music and science together.Womad, the world music festival at Charlton Park in Wiltshire, recently hosted its physics pavilion for the third successive year and claims to be the first music festival to do ""real"" science.One of the people behind the pavilion is Prof Roger Jones, of Lancaster University who also works on the Atlas particle detector experiment at Cern.""There are at least two major music festivals in Europe that we're looking to work with,"" he says over a backstage cup of tea.""They realise there's an appetite for science, and music festivals are in a competitive market. They want things that make them more attractive to a broader audience.""We had 4,000 people come to the physics pavilion in 2016 and just under 6,000 last year and this year we're looking at a similar number again. The only thing stopping us from getting any bigger is space,"" Prof Jones says.The pavilion's main tent hosted talks and demonstrations, such as one on lasers called ""From Death to Art"", a science rap performance and a live link up with Nasa's Hubble telescope control room.The ""Physics of Gin"" workshop went down well in ""The Lab"" tent, while Institute of Physics volunteers and Badminton school students manned the ""Give it a Go"" gazebo.""Music and science are a good mix,"" says Meklit, an Ethiopian born, US-based singer, who performed in the main festival at Womad.She has incorporated star sounds - created from data by a Nasa engineer - in her song Supernova.""I'm a TED fellow and go to a lot of TED conferences. Scientists are some of the most creative people I know,"" she adds.""Science at music festivals is definitely growing, as is outreach in general,"" says Alice Roberts, the writer, broadcaster and professor of public engagement in science at Birmingham University.""The first time I talked at Glastonbury five years ago I thought, 'Who is going to come and listen to me in a tepee on a hill when there is all this music nearby?' But a couple of hundred people came,"" she says.""You engage with an audience that is going for the music and it works. We have a false and archaic division between science and the humanities.""Prof Roberts admits that assessing the long-term impact of such outreach is difficult. ""You have to combine quantitative data with case studies.""A student came up to me at Bluedot recently and said: 'The reason I started doing anthropology was because of you.' It was humbling and made it feel worthwhile,"" says Prof Roberts, who was talking about archaeology, history and genetics.Prof Jones says that outreach in general has in part led to an increase in students studying physics.""At Lancaster in 2011/12 we had about 80 students per year. In 2017/18 it was 143. We're doing particularly well, but there has been a rise across universities,"" he says.Prof Roberts says the secret of successful outreach is pitching things at the right level. ""It is about being brave and not dumbing down, getting the right balance of being accessible but tackling some complex issues. Create a story line that brings in the concepts,"" she says.Robin Ince, the co-presenter, with the scientist and musician Brian Cox, of the Radio 4 comedy and science programme The Infinite Monkey Cage, says: ""Dumbing down is a boring accusation from people who want to keep their subject to themselves.""The main formula that works is the speaker has to have passion,"" he adds.Jacky Jarrett, from Bristol, visited the physics pavilion with her seven and 10-year-old daughters, who learnt about electrical circuits, while making card faces with flashing LED lights for the noses and eyes.""I don't know if I would have gone to a science event in the past. I would have thought it was boring, but now I might go to more,"" she says.Emma Welton travelled to Womad from Exeter with her 10-year-old son, Harry. ""I'm interested in music and he's interested in science,"" she says, after Harry investigated a cornflour mixture with a spoon.""It felt solid because the particles were squashed together,"" he says.Robin Ince has been mixing science and comedy for 15 years and is a regular on the festival scene.""At Glastonbury we did an Infinite Monkey Cage on quantum cosmology and had 3,000 people in the tent. They had been drinking cider - and other things - for a few days but they still engaged,"" he says.""Science at festivals is becoming more popular because people aren't getting science from other places. People go to festivals to hear a few bands, but not all of them on the bill, and to experience something new, maybe about black holes.""The main thing with a music festival is you have several stages and people wander about, but at a literary festival you buy an individual ticket for an author's talk,"" Robin Ince adds.Ana Godinho, head of education, communications and outreach at Cern, says it puts about £8,000 into the costs of the Womad physics pavilion and that it represents good value for money.""Womad is the only music festival we do. We are thinking of doing more. We're not here to recruit scientists. It's to raise awareness,"" she says.The rest of the pavilion's cost - which Prof Jones estimates at under £30,000 ¬- comes from Lancaster University, the Institute of Physics, the Science and Technology Facilities Council and Womad itself.So what does the future hold for science outreach and music? Prof Sella says: ""I think it will continue to grow. It may become edgier and have more niches.""""We're thinking about breaking out of the pavilion and doing installations around the Womad site and doing things on the main stages,"" Prof Jones says.He would like to get a well-known musician who is also a scientist to appear in the pavilion.""You don't have to be called Brian to apply,"" he says with a smile."
science	Botanical exploits: How British plant hunters served science	Into the wildernessTwo miraclesPlant pilgrimage	"In a corner of the Yorkshire Dales, far from the beaten track, you might stumble on the peaceful village of Clapham.Now known as a stop-off point for exploring the dales, it was once the home of a rock garden full of plants never seen before in the Western world.Legend has it that the Edwardian plant-hunter Reginald Farrer loaded a shotgun with seeds collected on an expedition to Ceylon and fired them into a rock cliff and gorge.While the rock garden is long gone, you can still see other specimens brought back by Farrer dotted around the woods beside his family home.The flamboyant rhododendrons, lilac-flowered honeysuckles and sweetly fragranced viburnums are floral reminders of his far-flung travels.Farrer was among the early British plant-hunters who risked death to explore the botanically rich interior of China in the name of science.""It's a fascinating period when China was opening up to botanists and explorers so that we could see their fauna and flora,'' says Sarah McDonald, Heritage Collections Manager at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS).''They all had this love of travel, this love of exploration, an absolute love of plants as well.''And to be the person who first found a particular plant and to have that plant named after yourself or to be able to recommend who it was named after was what really drove them, I think.''Reginald Farrer (1880-1920) was one of four 20th Century botanists who made expeditions to then remote parts of China to discover and bring back plants.He and his contemporaries - George Forrest (1873-1932), William Purdom (1880-1921) and Frank Kingdon-Ward (1885-1958) - are remembered in a new exhibition at the RHS Lindley library in London.Photographs, an original plant press and books published by the explorers are on display in the library, which holds unique collections of early printed books on botany.In the archives, Sarah regales me with tales of the intrepid four.''There were all sorts of perils and disasters; from weather, storms, earthquakes through to tropical diseases,'' she explains.""George Forrest on his very first expedition in 1904 escaped with his life only narrowly from Tibetan monks who were rebelling against Chinese missionaries and were rampaging through the countryside.""The two missionaries that he was travelling with died a horrible death but fortunately after a week travelling on his own he managed to get to a safe village, barefoot, almost starving, but he got home.""Forrest lost all of his specimens, but continued his expeditions, carrying out a further six, to Upper Burma, eastern Tibet and Sichuan province.He spent months in the wilderness, navigating sheer cliffs and makeshift bridges across deep gorges.His last expedition proved to be his most successful, but, in 1932, he collapsed and died of a heart attack outside the town of Tengyueh.Forrest collected over 31,000 specimens from China, discovered more than 1,200 plant species new to science and had more than 30 taxa named after him.They range from large magnolia trees with water-lily-like flowers, to spectacular camellias and more than 50 types of primula.Over a similar time period, Farrer introduced many alpine species from China, Tibet and Upper Burma. He travelled with William Purdom, an English plant explorer who had been trained at Kew.""Purdom was a very shy, retiring chap; we don't have very much from him,"" says Sarah McDonald.""He didn't keep diaries or journals, but he was a great support to Farrer. Farrer probably couldn't have operated without him in the field.""Purdom knew Chinese, he knew the local people, he was very much liked by them, so he really supported Farrer's expedition.""In 1914, Purdom and Farrer set out on an ambitious expedition to Tibet and northwestern China.Their two years of adventures are documented in Farrer's books, On the Eaves of the World (1917), and The Rainbow Bridge (1921), published after his death in the Burmese mountains.Frank Kingdon-Ward, son of a botany professor, was perhaps the most prolific of the four plant collectors.""He carried out over 20 expeditions in total - not all in China; he travelled all over, in India as well and Assam Himalayas, and really his first love was exploration,"" says Sarah McDonald.Kingdon-Ward frequently cheated death on his travels. Once, lost in the jungle, he survived by sucking the nectar from flowers. Another time, a tree fell on his tent during a storm, but he crawled out unscathed. And he survived falling over a precipice only by gripping a tree long enough to be pulled to safety.In a letter to his sister, he wrote: ""If I survive another month without going dotty or white-haired it will be a miracle; if my firm get any seeds at all this year it will be another.""Many of the plants brought back by Forrest, Farrer, Kingdon-Ward and Purdom can be seen at RHS gardens, both as living specimens and in the Herbarium at RHS Wisley.More than 80,000 preserved plants, which are used for scientific study, are filed away in numerous cupboards.The specimens collected by early plant-hunters are an important scientific legacy.Yvette Harvey, Keeper of the Herbarium, says plant collecting remains important because we haven't yet collected every single plant in the world.""It's extremely important to have a specimen that everyone can refer back to in the future,"" she says.""Our collection is steadily increasing by about a thousand specimens a year.""Some of the first plant-hunters in the field were commissioned by the RHS, and this work continues today. More than 100 years since the men set off on their travels, the RHS is calling on horticulturists to start their own plant-finding missions through its bursary scheme.Recently funded missions include expeditions to South Africa in search of red-hot pokers and searching for rare azaleas in Japan.After my visit to the Herbarium, Yvette Harvey leads me through the gardens on a plant pilgrimage of our own.It's a sunny winter morning and children bundled up in coats, hat and gloves dart along the paths or point up at the large cranes on the skyline that are carrying out a multi-million-pound development scheme.Tucked away in a bed near the lake is a large berberis shrub descended from the specimen collected on the Farrer-Purdom expedition. It's not showy and you could be forgiven for strolling by without giving it a second glance.But it's thanks to collectors like Farrer and Purdom that plants such as these grace most British gardens today.Collecting in the Clouds: Early 20th Century Plant Discoveries runs until Friday 2 March at the RHS Lindley Library in London.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	No-deal Brexit 'worse than thought' for science	What is the big concern?So what happens next?	"The impact of a no-deal Brexit on British science could be worse than previously thought, according to a new analysis.UK researchers risk losing access to much of the EU funding that's currently available to them, it says.The campaign group Scientists for EU has studied the Brexit technical notes released by the government on Thursday.One of the documents states the UK would no longer be eligible for three of the EU's major funding programmes.The analysis estimates that those streams of research cash provide up to 45% of the total of EU science funding coming Britain's way.The government says it hopes to avoid leaving the EU without a deal and that it is working to ensure that the UK will continue to take part in European research projects.EC hopes for big science funding upliftPM 'will pay' for post-Brexit science dealUK scientists have been highly successful at bidding for European research grants, winning 4.6bn euros since 2014 from the EU's Horizon 2020 science programme.When Britain becomes a non-EU country it should still be eligible to participate - countries like Israel have an associate status that allows them to take part.And the government says it is a priority for relations to continue.But three related research programmes are only open to EU countries, as the government's technical briefing makes clear, and these can be highly valuable.The European Research Council (ERC) issues prestigious grants which have so far been worth a total of €1.29bn to the UK.Another set of grants, known as Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions, have totalled nearly €0.7bn for researchers here.And a third programme, SME instrument grants, which are designed to encourage small innovative businesses, has seen nearly 140m euros heading to the UK.According to Dr Mike Galsworthy of Scientists for EU, a non-deal Brexit ""would mean losing over half a billion a year in high value grants"".He explained: ""No deal would wreck nearly half the funding we're eligible for, it would be absolutely devastating.""Dr Galsworthy also highlights a potential problem with British applications to the elements of the Horizon 2020 programme that will still be open to the UK.One of the conditions is that the coordinator of any grant must be from an EU member state or from a developing country.So far, British researchers have had an enviable track record of leading EU-funded science projects - this role may now be at risk and may affect the scale of cash secured here.For many in the UK science community, the best hope lies in the government negotiating a deal that sees a close science relationship continuing with the EU.And that's the emphasis too from the government itself.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: ""The government's priority is to conclude and finalise the Withdrawal Agreement. This would ensure that the UK's participation in Horizon 2020 would be unaffected when we leave the EU.""Ministers have repeatedly stressed that bids for EU funding will be underwritten up to 2020.The BEIS spokesperson added: ""The UK has announced support for third-country participation in a no-deal scenario via the extension to the underwrite guarantee.""We are considering what other measures may be necessary to support UK research and innovation in the unlikely event of no-deal.""Some figures in the world of science are putting their faith in Europe's next big science programme, Horizon Europe, which is due to start in 2020, and may be more open to countries outside the EU.Dr Sarah Main of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) told me: ""It looks like the hints about greater openness are part of a genuine ambition to be more accessible to the rest of the world""So that's a chink of light, and we do know that there's an appetite in the research community to find ways for UK and European researchers to work together in future.""But Dr Main also says that, in the meantime, the uncertainty of Britain's future relations with the EU is having an impact.University College London has seen a drop in the number of fellowship applications from EU researchers and UK business has slipped from being the second largest recipient of Horizon 2020 funding to the fifth largest.For Leave campaigners, the argument has long been that British science will benefit from being free of EU regulations on developments such as GM and being more open to collaborations beyond Europe.Follow David on Twitter."
science	Where plastic outnumbers fish by seven to one		"Plastic is building up in the areas of the ocean where fish feed and grow, according to research.A study found bits of plastic outnumber baby fish by seven to one in nursery waters off Hawaii.It appears that the same ocean processes that concentrate prey for juvenile fish also accumulate floating plastics.There is growing evidence that plastic is being ingested by marine life, but the health implications are unclear.""We don't have the data to say whether or not this has a negative effect on fish populations,"" Dr Gareth Williams of Bangor University, UK, told BBC News.""But the fact that they're eating these non-nutritious particles at the point when eating is so critical for their survival in those first few days, it can only be a bad thing.""The researchers set out to investigate the roles of ""slicks"" as nursery habitats for tiny larval fish.Slicks are naturally occurring, ribbon-like, smooth water features of the oceans, which are full of plankton, an important food resource.When the researchers started surveys for plankton off the coast of Hawaii, they were surprised to find lots of plastic in the nets.""It was completely unexpected,"" said Dr Williams. ""The fact that the plastics outnumber the larval fish was astonishing.""Plastic densities in surface slicks off Hawaii were, on average, eight times higher than the plastic densities recently found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Inside the slicks there were seven times more plastics than there were larval fish.""We were shocked to find that so many of our samples were dominated by plastics,"" said Dr Jonathan Whitney, a marine ecologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).After dissecting hundreds of larval fish, the researchers discovered that many fish species ingested plastic particles.""We found tiny plastic pieces in the stomachs of commercially targeted pelagic (open sea) species, including swordfish and mahi-mahi, as well as in coral reef species like triggerfish,"" said Dr Whitney.Plastics were also found in flying fish, which are eaten by top predators such as tunas and most Hawaiian seabirds.""Biodiversity and fisheries production are currently threatened by a variety of human-induced stressors such as climate change, habitat loss, and overfishing,"" said Dr Jamison Gove, of the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center in Honolulu.""Unfortunately, our research suggests we can likely now add plastic ingestion by larval fish to that list of threats,""The study is published in the journal PNAS.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	The Meg: the myth, the legend (the science)	Dead or alive?What did it look like?What did it eat?Why did it die out?All publicity is good publicity?	"The Meg, Hollywood's latest shark tale, is opening wide this week in anticipation of summer audiences in the mood for a scare.Proposing that the extinct Megalodon, a large prehistoric relative of the great white shark, has survived to the present day, the film follows its subsequent encounter with humanity.But how much do we really know about the giant predator?And what impact do shark attack films have on their real subjects?Shark researcher and Megalodon expert Catalina Pimiento from Swansea University wants to break down a few myths.""It's very much extinct,"" says Dr Pimiento. ""There's no way it can be still around.""Researchers have pinned the date of Megalodon's extinction at about 2.6 million years ago - roughly when its cousin the great white shark was just becoming established.In The Meg, Megalodon has survived the ages in a previously unknown (to humans) area of deep ocean off the coast of China.However, Dr Pimiento points out that Megalodon likely lived in water no more than 200 metres deep, in and around coastal areas.We would, she says, have noticed something of Megalodon's size if it was swimming off our shores.Much of what we know about the species comes from its teeth, which are some of the only remains that have been preserved.Estimates of its full body length range from at least 13 metres up to a maximum of 18 metres, or almost the length of two double decker buses.While this dwarfs great white sharks, it's not quite the submarine-crunching 25 metres featured in The Meg.Melagodon's remarkable size is fascinating to researchers, as an animal that large would have had to work very hard to find enough food.""If you think about that on land for example, all the largest animals are herbivores... if you're that big then you need to eat a lot of prey and you need to hunt a lot to find that much food,"" explains Dr Pimiento.""So that's why Megalodon is so amazing; because it was a predator and it was huge!""Although it's very difficult to know much about how Megalodon would have moved and behaved, Dr Pimiento has her suspicions about what kind of hunter it would have been. She hopes to build a 3D model of the shark in order to study this in more detail.""If I had to guess, I wouldn't think it was an agile predator. It could even have been more of a scavenger. Sharks are opportunistic, and they will eat anything they can. If they can hunt, they will hunt. If they see a carcass, they will eat the carcass.""So even if we had lived at the same time, a small human snack might not have been worth the energy.There's no evidence that Megalodon's remarkable size was the cause of its extinction, but food was almost certainly a factor.Rapidly changing sea levels about 2.6 million years ago impacted the coastal ecosystem that the giant shark inhabited.Over the course of a few million years, around 36% of sharks, sea turtles, sea birds and marine mammals became extinct.Megalodon was the last of its lineage of giant sharks, and it was succeeded by smaller, more agile hunters like the great white.Although The Meg's creators put a good deal of research into reviving Megalodon, before adding some artistic licence, previous shark attack films have been thought to affect their real life counterparts.""Movies have such an impact,"" says Dr Pimiento.""We shouldn't take them lightly. Jaws had a huge impact on the protection of sharks, and a role in giving them a bad reputation. People don't realise how vulnerable they are.""It was speculated that shark populations off the US coast were affected after Steven Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster, with fishers setting out to catch ""trophy sharks.""Nowadays, sharks are threatened by human encroachment on their hunting grounds, competing for the same prey.If Megalodon had survived to encounter humans, it's likely we would be the far greater danger.Follow Mary on Twitter."
science	European Commission hopes for big science funding uplift	The Brexit calculationUK associationScience and migration'Open door' policy	"The European Commission has set out how it wants to spend €100bn (£87bn) on science in the next EU budget.The funding programme, dubbed HorizonEU, covers the period 2021-2027.Expenditure would be split across three main areas, with the largest sum (€52.7bn) going on ""global challenges"", such as health, energy, and food.Open science, or researcher-driven projects, would get €25.8bn; and innovation directed at taking ideas to market would receive €13.5bn.The spending proposal was set out by Science Commissioner Carlos Moedas in a press conference in Brussels.His numbers come with caveats, the major one being that everything is aspirational at this stage.The whole HorizonEU programme has to run through Europe's normal democratic channels - through debate in the European parliament and among member states. The numbers that fall out at the end of this process could look very different.But another major point of interest of course is that Commissioner Moedas has had to lay out a plan that assumes no involvement or contribution from the UK. HorizonEU kicks in after Brexit.This in his view makes the headline figure of €100bn look all the more ambitious.""It is the biggest increase in absolute terms, ever,"" he told reporters.""Horizon2020 was €77bn. But if you take off the UK and do 27 countries - that was €67bn. So, the increase we are proposing today is from €67bn to €100bn.""[Science and innovation] is a priority for Europe and the Commission.""The British government recently released a position paper in which it called for a far-reaching Science and Innovation Pact with the EU beyond next March.London would like to fully associate to the new programme and is prepared to pay its way, subject to how the involvement is structured and the level of influence Britain gets inside HorizonEU.It is a critical negotiation - and not just for Mr Moedas, who would then receive an increase in what he could spend; it is vital also for the UK research community.Science is one of the activities at EU level where Britain has got a big return on its investment.Take, for example, the European Research Council, which is the funding line that supports some of the most successful open, ""blue skies"" research.British grantees have so far taken about a fifth of all monies released by the ERC in Horizon2020 (its total for the period is €13.1bn).The ERC will be the largest individual funding stream in HorizonEU and will rise to €16.6bn under Mr Moedas' plans.""Over the 11 years of its existence the ERC has proved itself as a highly successful and prestigious source of research funding across Europe. The increase in funding promised for it in HorizonEU reflects recognition of this success,"" commented Cambridge University's Prof Dame Athene Donald, who sits on the ERC's scientific council.""The strength of UK science means that the country has always been extremely successful in winning ERC grants in their highly competitive process.""For the health of UK science going forward (including the free flow of researchers), both the community and the government recognise the importance of continued access,"" she told BBC News.The UK's Royal Society set out its principles this week for future association with the EU's research framework programmes, which it said promote ""collaborative science that is unrivalled in scale and impact"".The society called for an early agreement with the EU-27 and stressed the need for the easy flow of skilled workers to and from the continent.Whether an association can be agreed is totally dependent on the top-level negotiations that London and Brussels are currently engaged in to define their future relationship.What happens with a science pact is secondary to this, and will likely hang on the level of access and influence the UK is given as a ""third country"".Mr Moedas said there was scope for third countries to have a bigger role than had been the case in the past. ""The doors are open for that discussion,"" he told the press conference.One new highlight for HorizonEU will be a European Innovation Council (EIC), which will mirror the philosophy of the ERC. Its aim will be to support individual entrepreneurs with disruptive ideas that have the potential to create entirely new markets.The EIC would have funding of €10bn available over the 2021-2027 period.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Children drawing more women in science		"Children in the US are drawing more women scientists than in previous decades, according to a new study.The ""Draw A Scientist"" test has been administered by sociologists in various studies since the 1960s.Researchers at Northwestern University, US, analysed five decades of the test.When asked to draw a scientist, less than one per cent of children in the 1960s and 1970s drew a woman. This rose to 28% between the 1980s and present day.However, children are still far more likely to draw a traditionally male figure when asked to depict a scientist.""The effect ... increased over age as children became more connected to their world and became more aware of the male dominance of science,"" Prof Alice Eagly, a co-author on the study, told BBC News.""The fact that children are still drawing more male than female scientists reflects their environment,"" said David Miller, the study's lead author. ""Given the underrepresentation of women we observe in several science fields, we shouldn't except equal numbers. Encouragingly though, we can see that children's stereotypes change over time.""Despite women's representation in science improving significantly since the 1960s, girls draw on average 58% of scientists as men, with boys drawing 96%.Yet, the study highlights, by 2013 women were 49% of biological scientists, 35% of chemists, and 11% of physicists and astronomers in the United States.Bianca Reinisch of the Free University of Berlin, who was not involved in the study, cautions that the way in which children are prompted to draw for the study may also be changing.""Although it is true that studies make use of the prompt ""Draw a scientist,"", there are differences in the setting of the assessments and even variations of the prompt,"" she explained. Children's responses could be influenced by posters visible in the room or the way in which the task is phrased to them.Prof Eagly points out that the exercise is not perfect, yet it is a useful indirect measure as it can encourage children to share their thoughts and ideas on a topic without realising they are being tested.The authors suggest that media stereotypes play a significant role in children's images of scientists as they get older. Where it was possible to determine detailed characteristics, many of the scientists in the drawings wore lab coats and glasses. On average, 79% were Caucasian.It is also notable that the the test requires figures to be indentified as one of two genders. Although the Northwestern analysis factors in figures of ""indeterminate"" gender, Bianca Reinisch considers that some earlier studies may have been ""forced"" to choose between the categories of men and women when assessing the pictures.When children in one study were also asked to draw a teacher, only a quarter drew men, suggesting that gender stereotypes persist across other professions."
science	Climate change: Impacts 'accelerating' as leaders gather for UN talks	'No fancy speeches'You may also be interested in:	"The signs and impacts of global warming are speeding up, the latest science on climate change, published ahead of key UN talks in New York, says.The data, compiled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), says the five-year period from 2014 to 2019 is the warmest on record.Sea-level rise has accelerated significantly over the same period, as CO2 emissions have hit new highs.The WMO says carbon-cutting efforts have to be intensified immediately.The climate statement is a pull-together of the latest science on the causes and growing impacts of unprecedented levels of warming seen in recent years.Recognising that global temperatures have risen by 1.1 degrees C since 1850, the paper notes they have gone up by 0.2C between 2011 and 2015.This is as a result of burgeoning emissions of carbon, with the amount of the gas going into the atmosphere between 2015 and 2019 growing by 20% compared with the previous five years.Perhaps most worrying of all is the data on sea-level rise.The average rate of rise since 1993 until now is 3.2mm per year. However, from May 2014 to 2019 the rise has increased to 5mm per year. The 10-year period from 2007-2016 saw an average of about 4mm per year.""Sea-level rise has accelerated and we are concerned that an abrupt decline in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which will exacerbate future rise,"" said WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas.""As we have seen this year with tragic effect in the Bahamas and Mozambique, sea-level rise and intense tropical storms led to humanitarian and economic catastrophes.""The report also highlights the threats to the oceans, with more than 90% of the excess heat caused by climate change ending up in the waters. The WMO analysis says 2018 had the highest ocean heat content values on record.The study underlines the fact that wherever you look on the planet right now, the story is the same: human-induced warming is impacting the scale and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and wildfires.""Climate change due to us is accelerating and on a very dangerous course,"" said Prof Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, and professor of meteorology, University of Reading.""We should listen to the loud cry coming from the schoolchildren. There is an emergency - one for action in both rapidly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions towards zero and adapting to the inevitable changes in climate.""The WMO report is meant to inform the special UN summit on climate change taking place in New York on Monday.A range of political leaders will attend the one-day event, which is designed to be about action and not words, according to UN secretary general António Guterres.""I told leaders not to come with fancy speeches, but with concrete commitments,"" he said ahead of the meeting.""People want solutions, commitments and action. I expect there will be an announcement and unveiling of a number of meaningful plans on dramatically reducing emissions during the next decade, and on reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.""Greta Thunberg and other youth activists, fresh from marching on the streets of New York on Friday, will speak at the opening of the meeting.About 60 heads of state are expected to follow, with countries expected to announce new actions to limit the causes of warming or to speak on initiatives developed by a coalition of nations.While China, India, France, Germany and the UK will speak at the meeting, there is no place on the podium for Japan or Australia.Mr Guterres has asked that as well as committing to net-zero emissions by 2050, countries should reduce subsidies for fossil fuels and stop building new coal-fired power stations. The question of coal has led to the barring of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Australia's Scott Morrison.The US, Brazil and Saudi Arabia will also not be taking part.The success of the special summit remains in the balance - what isn't in question is the urgency of action and the fact that delay means more difficult decisions down the line.""It is highly important that we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, notably from energy production, industry and transport. This is critical if we are to mitigate climate change and meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement,"" said Petteri Taalas from the WMO.""To stop a global temperature increase of more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, the level of ambition needs to be tripled. And to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees, it needs to be multiplied by five,"" he said.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Science and tech community mourns Stephen Hawking		"Tributes from around the scientific community are pouring in for prominent physicist Stephen Hawking, who died early on Wednesday aged 76.The messages highlight his breakthrough research as well as his personality and inspiration to millions.One of the world's best-loved scientists, he was renowned for his work on black holes and relativity.He wrote hugely popular science books, and even broke into a pop culture.Suffering from a rare form of motor neurone disease he spent most of his life in a wheelchair and was largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser.US TV scientist Neil DeGrasse Tyson said Hawking's death left a huge vacuum.Caltech physicist John Preskill said Hawking's work inspired millions of young scientists to try and follow in his footsteps.""I'll remember the sharp wit and twinkling eyes; he never took himself too seriously. His friends will miss him terribly,"" he wrote on Twitter.US space agency Nasa described the Briton as an ambassador of science, remembering his work with the astronauts on the international space station.Accolades for Mr Hawking also came in from the tech community with Google CEO Sundar Pichai writing that the world had ""lost a beautiful mind and a brilliant scientist.""Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told BBC News: ""Stephen Hawking's integrity and scientific dedication place him above pure brilliance.""""We lost a great one today,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. ""Stephen Hawking will be remembered for his incredible contributions to science - making complex theories and concepts more accessible to the masses.""""He'll also be remembered for his spirit and unbounded pursuit to gain a complete understanding of the universe, despite the obstacles he faced. May he rest peacefully as his legacy and brilliance live on.""Tim Berners-Lee, widely regarded as the inventor of the World Wide Web, tweeted the world had ""lost a colossal mind and a wonderful spirit"".US-Canadian theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss described Mr Hawking as bravely fighting and taming the cosmos for 76 years.Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, whose Breakthrough Foundation had won Hawking as a supporter for plans on interstellar travel, told the BBC that the physicist's contributions to science ""will not be forgotten"".""When future historians consider who were the outstanding people of our age, they will think of Professor Hawking,"" he said in a statement to the BBC. ""As both scientist and human being, he was of the very highest stature.""Yangyang Cheng, a particle physicist at Cornell University, also highlighted the fact that the British physicist had inspired her when she grew up in China.A similar notion was tweeted by James Davenport, an astrophysics post-doctoral student at Western Washington University.Robert McNees, a physics professor at Loyola University Chicago, expressed the same feeling.""I idolised Hawking when I was a kid. Once, when I was a post-doc, I got to hang out with him for an evening. Our group went for dinner and drinks, then karaoke. He was funny, lively, and kind. I called my parents at 3am to tell them. It was my 'I made it' moment.""Mr Hawking's unique fame far beyond the science community was highlighted by Caltech physicist Sean Carroll."
science	Citizen science bags five-planet haul	Links in a chain	"A discovery by citizen scientists has led to the confirmation of a system of five planets orbiting a far-off star.Furthermore, the planets' orbits are linked in a mathematical relationship called a resonance chain, with a pattern that is unique among the known planetary systems in our galaxy.Studying the system could help unlock some mysteries surrounding the formation of planetary systems.The results were announced at the 231st American Astronomical Society meeting.The system was found by astronomy enthusiasts using Zooniverse, an online platform for crowdsourcing research.""People anywhere can log on and learn what real signals from exoplanets look like, and then look through actual data collected from the Kepler telescope to vote on whether or not to classify a given signal as a transit, or just noise,"" said co-author Dr Jessie Christiansen, from Caltech in Pasadena.Since the discovery of four planets in this system was announced last year, Dr Christiansen has been working to shed further light on this distant planetary neighbourhood, dubbed K2-138. This led to the discovery of the fifth planet and hints of a sixth.All the worlds are a bit bigger than our own planet, ranging between 1.6 and 3.3 times the radius of Earth.The collected findings have now been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.The raw data used in the discovery was provided by Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which identifies potential planets around other stars by looking for dips in the brightness of those stars when planets pass across their face - or transit them.Being in a resonance chain means each planet takes almost 50% longer to orbit the star than the next planet further in.Intriguingly, the sixth planet skips two slots in that resonance chain - taking much longer to orbit the star than it should if it was simply the next planet up from number five.""If you keep going with the resonance chain, you skip 19 days, you skip 27 days and you end up at about 43 days,"" said Dr Christiansen.""That's a really tantalising clue that we may be missing more planets in this system. If this chain continues, there's a gap.""It's not the only system to exhibit resonances. The orbital motions of seven planets in the Trappist-1 system are linked in a complex chain. In the time that it takes for the innermost planet to make eight orbits, the second, third and fourth planets revolve five, three and two times around the star, respectively.But the way the chain is configured in K2-138 is different to Trappist-1 and unique among exoplanetary neighbourhoods. The near-resonant chain in Trappist-1 is thought to have formed as the planets migrated inwards toward their parent star after formation, early in the system's history.So K2-138 could yield further clues to the process by which planets form and then migrate from their original positions. This is a particularly contested area, with several competing ideas.""Some current theories suggest that planets form by a chaotic scattering of rock and gas and other material in the early stages of the planetary system's life. However, these theories are unlikely to result in such a closely packed, orderly system as K2-138,"" said Dr Christiansen.""What's exciting is that we found this unusual system with the help of the general public.""Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	A science news preview of 2018	World in motionCommercial space raceNeed for speed	"From next steps in the commercial space revolution to a rocket-powered supercar, there's much to look forward to in 2018.BBC News looks ahead to some of the biggest science and environment stories coming this year.2018 will see a raft of space missions that highlight the international nature of present-day space exploration. First up is Chandrayaan 2, India's follow-up to its groundbreaking lunar mission launched in 2008.While its predecessor was an orbiter, Chandrayaan 2 will comprise an orbiter, lander and rover developed by the country's space agency, ISRO. The mission is currently slated to launch on a GSLV rocket from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh around March.In May, Nasa will launch its Insight spacecraft to Mars. Insight will use a sophisticated suite of instruments to probe deep beneath the surface of the Red Planet, looking for clues to how it formed. It will also listen for ""marsquakes"" which could shed light on the planet's internal structure.In July, the Japanese space agency's (Jaxa) Hayabusa 2 spacecraft will arrive at its target, the asteroid 162173 Ryugu, in an effort to return samples of this space rock to Earth. Its predecessor, Hayabusa, captured the world's imagination when, in 2005, it reached asteroid Itokawa.Although that mission suffered some mishaps, it managed to return to Earth with some tiny specks of asteroid material - enough for scientists to get information from.Engineers have made several improvements for Hayabusa 2, which aims to build on its pioneering predecessor by returning even more asteroid material and successfully deploying several small landers to Ryugu's surface.Japan won't be the only country to visit an asteroid next year. Nasa's Osiris-Rex spacecraft, launched in 2016, is due to rendezvous with the object known as 101955 Bennu in August. Osiris-Rex will also aims to collect a sample of soil and rock and get it back to our planet for analysis.Finally, Europe and Japan could despatch a mission to explore the first planet from the Sun: Mercury. The mission, Bepi Colombo, will seek to deepen and extend the knowledge gained at Mercury by the US space agency's recent Messenger spacecraft.BepiColombo consists of two spacecraft launched on one rocket; the mission will carry out detailed mapping and investigate the planet's magnetic field. Scientists hope to shed light on key questions, such as why Mercury seems to consist of a large iron core with just a thin shell of silicate rocks on the outside.2018 should be the year Elon Musk's private launch company SpaceX lofts one of the most powerful rockets ever built: the Falcon Heavy.In December, Mr Musk tweeted tantalising photos of the huge vehicle under assembly at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The heavy-lift rocket consists of two of the company's existing Falcon 9 boosters strapped to a central core stage. The 70m-long leviathan has been designed to launch payloads up to 57 metric tonnes into space, allowing SpaceX to move into new satellite launch markets and - eventually - loft astronauts beyond Earth orbit.Private firms could also take significant steps towards their goal of transporting crews to the International Space Station (ISS) - but it's always possible the schedule could slip to 2019.Under current plans, SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing would perform the first crewed launches from US soil since Nasa's space shuttle was retired in July 2011. Since then, the US has been reliant on Russia's Soyuz launcher for transporting crew to the ISS - something that has rankled many who work in the American spaceflight sector.Both companies plan to test their launch systems, performing uncrewed demonstrations in the first instance to gather engineering data. Then, they are expected to launch astronauts in the vehicles. But with the lives of Nasa astronauts at stake on a brand new launch system, nobody will be taking any chances - so delays are not out of the question.But successful tests (whenever they happen) should lead to both systems being human-certified by the US space agency, allowing SpaceX and Boeing to begin fulfilling contracts to transport astronauts to the space station.These craft should later be joined by Nasa's own launch system - the long-awaited (and expensive) Orion capsule and SLS rocket, which will be used to send people beyond low-Earth orbit. If everything proceeds to plan, Orion could be launched on an uncrewed test flight in 2019 and a launch with astronauts in 2021.After several schedule slips, the UK's Bloodhound car should step up its assault on the land speed record in the autumn.Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the car was put through its paces on the runway at Newquay airport in 2017. That was ""slow speed"" testing - at just 200mph (320km/h).Next, the team aims to exceed 500mph (800km/h) on South Africa's Hakskeen Pan this coming October.That's still short of the existing world land speed record (763mph/1,228km/h), but it ought to provide the necessary engineering data to push the car to ever higher speeds in 2019 and 2020.The eventual goal is to pass 1,000mph (1,610km/h)."
science	Eight amazing science stories of 2017	"Star crashCassini's final bowParis pull-outMultiple ""Earths""Recent relativeDark skiesVisitor from beyondGiant iceberg"	"It was a year of endings and beginnings: the plucky Cassini spacecraft's 13-year-long mission reached its finale, while the fledgling field of gravitational wave astronomy bagged the catastrophic collision of two dead stars.BBC News looks back on eight of the biggest science and environment stories of 2017.In 2017, scientists detected Einstein's gravitational waves from a new source - the collision of two dead stars, or neutron stars. The first direct detection of these waves was announced in 2016, when the Advanced LIGO laboratories described the warping of space from the merger of two distant black holes. The result was hailed as the starting point for a new branch of astronomy, using gravitational waves to collect data about distant phenomena.Telescopes from all over the world captured details of the neutron star merger as it unfolded. The outburst took place in a galaxy located roughly a thousand billion, billion km away in the Constellation Hydra. Some of the facts about these cataclysmic events are staggering. For example, neutron stars are so dense that a teaspoonful would weigh a billion tonnes. The team was also able to confirm that these collisions lead to the production of the gold and platinum that exists in the Universe.The Cassini spacecraft arrived in the Saturn system in 2004. In the 13 years it was operational it transformed our understanding of the ringed planet and its moons. It discovered geysers spewing water-ice out into space from a sub-surface ocean on the icy satellite of Enceladus, spied seas and lakes of methane on Saturn's biggest moon Titan and watched as a giant storm encircled Saturn.But with its fuel tanks running low, Nasa decided to destroy the satellite in Saturn's clouds rather than see it collide with a potential target in the search for life, such as Enceladus, and contaminate it with terrestrial microbes. On 15 September, Cassini hurtled into the giant planet's atmosphere and was torn apart. But it still managed to return data to Earth from its dive towards destruction.While he was on the campaign trail, Donald Trump said he would ""cancel"" the Paris climate agreement, taking the US out of the deal. But after winning the US election in November of that year, he made few public pronouncements on the topic of climate change. Reports emerged that Mr Trump's advisers were split on the issue, prompting some commentators to wonder whether the President might be convinced to stay in the process.However, on 1 June, President Trump held a press conference in the White House's Rose Garden to announce America's withdrawal. Mr Trump said: ""In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States.""As expected, the reaction from Democrats and other world leaders was damning. Former US President Barack Obama accused the Trump administration of ""rejecting the future"", while former Secretary of State John Kerry called the decision a ""gross abdication of leadership"".Of the 3,500 planets now documented to exist beyond our Solar System, some are pretty weird. For starters, there's J1407b, a distant world with rings that are 200 times larger than the ones around Saturn.But this year, astronomers discovered a planetary system with seven Earth-sized planets. What's more, these worlds seem to be locked in a strange ""resonance"" as they orbit their host star. Intriguingly, three of the planets are in the habitable zone, where water can remain liquid on the surface. And where there's water, there is at least a chance for life.In July, researchers unveiled fossils of five early humans found in North Africa that showed our species - Homo sapiens - emerged at least 100,000 years earlier than previously recognised. The finds suggested that our species did not evolve in a single ""cradle"" in East Africa. Instead, modern humans may have been evolving in the same direction all over the continent.And there was more big news in human evolution this year. When, in 2015, scientists unveiled the remains of 15 partial skeletons belonging to a new species of human, it made headlines around the world. At the time, researchers had been unable to say for sure how old the specimens of Homo naledi were, but some primitive traits suggested they could be as much as three million years in age.This year, team leader Lee Berger announced the remains were just 200,000-300,000 years old. The findings suggested that far from being an ancestor of present-day people, Homo naledi may even have encountered very early members of our own species - Homo sapiens.On 21 August, a giant shadow cast by the Moon swept across America, marking the first total solar eclipse since the country's founding in 1776 where totality made exclusive landfall in the US. It was also 99 years since a solar eclipse had crossed from the west to the east coast.Millions of people gathered along the eclipse's path to witness the rare astronomical event.And what an awesome event it was. Reporting from Madras, Oregon, the BBC's Pallab Ghosh said: ""You can see that it's quarter past 10 in the morning, but it seems like night-time. We're just a few seconds away from the total eclipse... it looks like a smiley face in the sky.""After totality had passed, he added: ""I got goosebumps; it just feels like a completely dream-like state.""Though scientists had been predicting for years that we would be visited by an asteroid from interstellar space, 2017 was the first time we spotted one. Discovered by a team using Hawaii's Pan-Starrs telescope in October, they were soon sure that the object's speed and trajectory indicated an origin outside our Solar System. Named 'Oumuamua, after the Hawaiian for ""a messenger from afar arriving first"", the object quickly became the subject of an observing campaign with some of the most powerful telescopes in the world.In many respects, it turned out to be not dissimilar to objects known from the furthest reaches of our Solar System - so-called Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) - complete with a reddish hue likely resulting from irradiation by cosmic rays over millions of years. One aspect of this cosmic wanderer wasn't so familiar, however: it's shape. Although the investigations are ongoing, 'Oumuamua seemed to be 10 times longer than it was wide, making it much more elongated than anything else in our Solar System.One of the biggest icebergs ever recorded broke away from Antarctica's Larsen C ice shelf in July. But scientists had been following the development of a large crack for upwards of a decade. The giant block was estimated to cover an area of roughly 6,000 sq km - about a quarter the size of Wales.The calving of bergs at the forward edge of the shelf is a very natural behaviour. However, scientists think that Larsen C is now at its smallest extent since the end of the last Ice Age, around 11,700 years ago. Future studies will be needed to understand how the shelf is responding to a warming climate."
science	Stephen Hawking: The science that made him famous	Hawking's most important discoveriesHis obsession with black holesMaking black holes disappearAn explanation for the UniverseHe wasn't always rightA man for wider horizons	Prof Stephen Hawking has died aged 76. The Cambridge theoretical physicist was one of the best-known scientists in the world, but what about his discoveries?His fame among researchers was founded on a series of studies that wed Albert Einstein's great theory of gravity, general relativity, with the strange world of quantum mechanics, normally applied to tiny things like atoms and molecules.What Hawking ended up with were descriptions of black holes that could boil themselves out of existence, and equations that described the entire history of the Universe in a single sweep.Hawking’s first forays into science publication were as a student in the 1960s when he’d had only the first intimations of the motor neurone disease that would become such a big part of his life.With Oxford mathematician Roger Penrose, he showed that if there was a Big Bang, it must have started from an infinitely small point - in physicist-speak, a “singularity”.At the time, when the still cooling afterglow of the Big Bang (the cosmic microwave background radiation) had only just been detected on the sky, other cosmologists had hoped for something less radical than the notion of an entire Universe emerging out of nothing.Together, Hawking and Penrose showed the quest for gentler answers was hopeless.Hawking’s next venture, in the 1970s, was to show that black holes are not black at all, but are in fact, as the title of one paper put it, “white hot”.Black holes are the ultimate monster of general relativity. First conceived and named by John Wheeler, they are regions of space so dense that everything within their realm collapses to a single point – another example of a singularity.At the time, it seemed ridiculous that these gorgons of gravity should have anything to do with the delicate theory of quantum mechanics, designed to explain light and the orbits of electrons in atoms.But Hawking showed otherwise. In fact, quantum theory completely changes the fate of black holes.At their very fringes, Hawking demonstrated, black holes would create and radiate new particles due to these laws, losing energy, and hence losing mass (remember Einstein's equation E=mc²).It would take a black hole a very long time to evaporate in this way, but in its last moments Hawking said it would expire in a burst of energy equivalent to a million megaton hydrogen bombs.When the Large Hadron Collider was opened in the Swiss/French countryside outside Geneva, there was hope that the particle accelerator might be able to create microscopic black holes and so prove Hawking's ideas.A Nobel Prize would then have been a certainty. But the LHC has seen nothing yet.Having tackled single black holes, Hawking turned his attention to the Universe as a whole - the ultimate, inescapable gravitational container.The laws of quantum science are as applicable here as to a vanishing black hole, especially at the first moment, the Big Bang.While other researchers struggled to depict a brief moment in the life of a molecule using quantum laws, Hawking showed it was possible to encapsulate the entire history of the whole Universe in a single mathematical expression – “The Wavefunction of the Universe”, as he called it.Because the expression is self-contained - it starts at a singularity at the beginning of time and is closed by another at the end of time, and if necessary, history can bounce back and forth between these two book ends.There is no need, indeed no point, to ask what happened before the Big Bang. An existing Universe would explain itself on its own terms.Hawking continued working on the ramifications of this theory to the end of his life.To know that such a mathematical description might exist is one thing; to know which expression is the right one is a far harder job.Stephen Hawking’s mind was not the all-conquering juggernaut of public myth.Like any scientist, he got it wrong from time to time, and often had to concede defeat in intellectual combat.We sometimes know of this because of his predilection for laying down fanciful bets over debated points – a year’s subscription to Playboy versus one for Private Eye, in one instance.This happened in 2004, when he conceded to computer scientist John Preskill that black holes were not the ultimate information shredders in the Universe (a consequence he perceived of his black hole theories that would have undermined some of the most fundamental laws of physics).Hawking accepted black holes could store information about their past, encoded somehow at their edges - the so-called event horizon.Many researchers were frustrated by the ease with which Stephen Hawking generated publicity, often overshadowing other talents with equally extraordinary or challenging ideas.His papers were typically at the extremes of mathematical science, a further step along the path he’d chosen to follow in his student days; but they were not always close to the central scientific issues of the day.Nevertheless, his ability to project his intellectual enthusiasm beyond his frail body, and to draw the wider public into abstruse realms of science is undeniable.
science	Gender equality: 'No room at the top for women scientists'	What did the study show?What are the lessons learned?	"The number of women climbing the career ladder in science is ""disappointingly low"", say researchers.Women make up half of students in the life sciences, but only one in four professors, according to data from 500 scientific institutions worldwide.The main problem lies with retaining and promoting women into influential positions, the study concluded.It found women had fewer chances to serve on committees or speak at scientific meetings.Other factors included unconscious bias, tensions with work-life balance, poor funding and pay, and a lack of networking opportunities.The data, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, came from 541 universities and research institutions in 38 countries in the US, Europe and Australia.Women made up more than half of undergraduate and postgraduate students, 42% of assistant professors and 23% of full professors, although rates varied by institution.The findings back the view of many women in science that more must be done to address the problem of the ""leaky pipeline"" - where women leave the profession due to problems such as harassment and issues around promotion and pay.""There is no point in encouraging more girls into science if the system is set up to exclude them,"" Dr Jessica Wade of Imperial College London, who champions women in physics but was not connected with this particular study, told the BBC.""Improving gender balance in science will take institutional commitments to support women in their applications for promotion, act when there are reports of sexual harassment or bullying and make work allocation more transparent.""The Royal Society of Chemistry said its own report, Breaking the barriers, which looked at the picture in the UK, showed a similar picture - 44% of chemists at undergraduate level are women - but only 9% of professors are.""More worryingly, a staggering 99% of women told us they had experienced or witnessed barriers to women's progression and retention,"" said Dr Jo Reynolds, director of science & communities.To address the issue, they plan to launch a helpline and are researching whether gender bias exists within scientific publishing - the mainstay of a research career.Women have made important contributions to science throughout history, but have consistently been underrepresented at all levels.One recent study found that closing the gender gap in physics will take hundreds of years, given the current rate of progress.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	How a spider jumps on its prey - science has the answer	Precision jumping	"Scientists have trained a spider to jump on demand.The diminutive arachnid, which they nicknamed Kim, can leap six times her body length from a standing start.Humans only manage about 1.5 body lengths.Unlocking the secrets of her extraordinary leaps could help build a new generation of robots inspired by nature, say University of Manchester researchers.The regal jumping spider (Phidippus regius) is known for its ability to make precision leaps to pounce on prey, including insects and small invertebrates.It is one of thousands of jumping spiders that are found worldwide and hunt actively rather than catching prey in a web. They have excellent vision, with four large eyes in front and four smaller eyes on the top of their head.The research team filmed the jumping arachnid with high-tech cameras to discover the secrets of her extraordinary locomotion.They also carried out 3D CT scanning to build a model of the spider's legs and body structure.They found the spider used different jumping strategies, including a faster, lower trajectory for speed and accuracy, but, at other times, more energy-efficient jumps over a longer distance.""She will jump at the optimal angle, which means that she can understand the challenge that she is presented with,"" said study researcher, Dr Mostafa Nabawy.""And then she can time her jumping performance at take-off to execute a jump that is optimal in terms of energy demand.""The scientists recruited a number of female spiders for their work, buying them at a pet shop in Manchester.But only Kim obliged with making the required leaps when presented with a take-off and landing platform they built in the lab.The data from the videos was analysed to understand the forces behind the jump and how they were generated.""The force on the legs at take-off can be up to five times the weight of the spider - this is amazing and if we can understand these biomechanics we can apply them to other areas of research,"" said Dr Nabawy, an aeronautical engineer who is interested in designing new types of flying and jumping robots.""Spiders have to plan everything, they have to execute accurate jumps and precise jumps to get their target [prey] as soon as possible and as accurately as possible.""Her jumps relied on muscle power alone, not hydraulic pressure (pumping fluid inside the legs to enhance muscle power), which has been mooted as a mechanism used by some spiders.Thus, the role of hydraulic movement in spiders remains an open question.""Our results suggest that whilst Kim can move her legs hydraulically, she does not need the additional power from hydraulics to achieve her extraordinary jumping performance,"" said co-researcher, Dr Bill Crowther.The research is published in the journal, Scientific Reports.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Space science work recognised in New Year Honours		A leading member of the Cassini mission to Saturn, which ended spectacularly in September 2017, has been recognised in the New Year Honours list.Prof Michele Dougherty from Imperial College, London, has become a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space, joins the Order of St Michael and St George, for services to education in science and technology.Overall, science recipients make up about 3% of the list.A professor of Space Physics at Imperial, Michele Dougherty was a key member of the Cassini mission over the 20 years since it launched in 1997.Cassini was a hugely successful venture, discovering active, icy plumes on Saturn's moon Enceladus, as well putting a lander on another moon, Titan.The mission ended when the probe was deliberately crashed into Saturn's atmosphere.Helen Sharman was made an OBE in 1993 after her trip to space onboard a Soyuz spacecraft in 1991.She has now been elevated to be a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for her long-standing commitment to educational outreach in science and technology.Another well known researcher in science and health, Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, is made a CBE for his work in genetics, stem cell research and the public understanding of science. He is a senior group leader at the Francis Crick Institute.Also on the New Year list is volcanologist Prof Steve Sparks, from the University of Bristol, who receives a knighthood. Prof Sparks is a leading expert in this field whose work has helped improve the ability to forecast deadly eruptions.In 2015, he was a winner of the Vetlesen Prize, sometimes described as the Nobel prize for earth sciences.Prof Christl Donnelly, from Imperial College, becomes a CBE for her services to epidemiology and the control of infectious diseases. Prof Donnelly is well known for her work in relation to bovine TB, and on the effectiveness of badger culling and cattle vaccination as ways of controlling the disease.Another to receive a CBE is Dr Demis Hassabis, the co-founder and chief executive officer of DeepMind, a world leading company in artificial intelligence research. The firm's computer programme defeated a human Go player in 2016, in what was seen as a landmark moment for the development of AI.Earlier this month, the software beat other programmes in chess within hours of teaching itself the game from scratch.Others recognised include Prof Karen Holford, the deputy vice chancellor of Cardiff University for services to engineering and for the advancement of women in science and engineering.
science	100 Women: Seven trailblazing women in science	Marie Curie: First double Nobel laureatePeggy Whitson: First science officer aboard the International Space StationMarie Tharp: Mapping the ocean floorWanda Diaz-Merced: Making astronomy accessibleQuarraisha Abdool Karim: Breakthroughs in preventing HIV/AidsSoyeon Yi: First South Korean astronautRajaa Cherkaoui El Moursli: Key role in Higgs boson discovery	"More than half of people in the UK can't name a famous woman in science, a survey suggests. This week, BBC 100 Women aims to change that number.A 2014 YouGov survey of almost 3,000 people, conducted on behalf of UK grassroots group ScienceGrrl, found that only 47% of those asked could name a famous woman scientist.Many identified Marie Curie. Others simply named a male scientist.Tuesday 7 November marks the 150th anniversary of Curie's birth.More than a century seems long enough for her to have carried the burden of being the most famous woman in science - so read on to learn more about other trailblazing women who have changed the world.Marie Curie, whose groundbreaking work on radioactivity brought her international fame, was the first person to win the Nobel Prize in two different fields.In July 1898, Marie along with her husband Pierre Curie, announced the discovery of a new chemical polonium, naming it after her native country Poland. The same year, the Curies discovered radium.In 1903, she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics alongside Pierre and Henri Becquerel. Eight years later, she won her second Nobel Prize in Chemistry.The youngest of five children, Curie was born in Poland in 1867. She did part-time jobs from a young age to be able to afford formal education. Her hard work paid off - she earned a masters degree in physics and another in mathematics in consecutive years.After her husband Pierre died in an accident in 1906, Curie took over his teaching post, becoming the first female professor at Sorbonne university.She died of leukaemia, caused by prolonged exposure to high-energy radiation during her research, on 4 July 1934.When Peggy Whitson was in her senior year of high school, Nasa selected its first female astronauts. The dream that had begun watching the Moon landings suddenly seemed like a reality - Peggy was going to be an astronaut too.Growing up in a rural farm community in Iowa, she wasn't exactly sure what that would involve, but she pursued her love of biology and chemistry to gain a PhD.Scientists remain a minority in the astronaut corps, with many coming from a military background, but in 1996 Peggy was selected as an astronaut candidate.During her first flight to the International Space Station in 2002, Peggy was named the first science officer aboard the ISS. There was, she says a ""cool factor"" in sharing this job title with Star Trek's Mr Spock.As a scientist, the ISS gives Peggy a unique research environment that doesn't exist anywhere else. Aboard the space station she has worked on experiments to grow crops, investigate potential cancer treatments and experiment with fluid dynamics.""I really love all the diversity of research we're doing in space [and it] will help us I think in the future, when we really get out and explore distant places,"" she told 100 Women.""Within our solar system and even beyond that.""In 1953, Marie Tharp became the first scientist to map the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.A geologist and oceanographic cartographer, Tharp's discovery of a rift valley running down the centre of the ocean floor was revolutionary in proving the controversial theory of plate tectonics. Initially, her discovery was dismissed as ""girl talk"" by her research partner Bruce Heezen.As women were not allowed on research vessels, Tharp would painstakingly draw maps from data that Heezen brought back from expeditions.Despite her groundbreaking contributions, Tharp remains almost unknown, with Heezen credited for much of their joint work. Tharp knew she worked in the background throughout her career, but she ruled out any resentment and recognised the importance of documenting mid-Atlantic Ridge.""You could only do that once. You can't find anything bigger than that, at least on this planet.""Astrophysicist Wanda Diaz-Merced began to see spots when she was an undergraduate student at the University of Puerto Rico.Diabetic retinopathy would soon deprive her of vision altogether, but she was determined not to change her chosen career.A Nasa internship gave Diaz-Merced the opportunity to work with a method called data sonification. This translated the satellite information from stars that she was studying into sound waves, instead of visual graphs - on which astronomers usually rely heavily.She would go on to develop this software further, making it possible for astrophysicists to more accurately interpret their data, and making the field accessible to a range of researchers who had previously been excluded.Diaz-Merced currently works with the South African Office of Astronomy for Development, opening up the world of astronomy to a generation of blind students.""For my field of astronomy which I really love I want no segregation,"" she told 100 Women. "" I want people to have equal opportunities to display their talents.""Quarraisha Abdool Karim, an infectious disease epidemiologist, has spent over 25 years researching how HIV/Aids is spread in South Africa, and its impact on women.In 2013, Karim was awarded South Africa's highest honour, the Order of Mapungubwe, for her breakthrough contributions.She has deeply engaged with women across communities for HIV prevention trials.Currently the associate scientific director at Caprisa, Karim has served as an HIV adviser at the United Nations agencies.In 2008, Soyeon Yi made history by being the first astronaut from South Korea, having competed against 36,000 other candidates to win her spot.""It's not typical to be the first in history for females,"" said Yi, confident her success would inspire more women to enter the world of science.When Yi looked down at Earth from space, she said she felt grateful the opportunities she got in life and for the ""beautiful gift"" of our planet.Growing up, nuclear physicist Rajaa Cherkaoui El Moursli read Marie Curie's biography several times and Curie's achievements drove El Moursli in her education.She had to overcome a number of obstacles to pursue her career in science.""The first challenge was to convince my father to allow me to go to France, to Grenoble, for graduate studies,"" she said.""At that time, Moroccan society was still quite conservative, and most girls didn't leave home until they got married.""She's won awards for her role in proving the existence of the Higgs boson, the particle responsible for the creation of mass in the universe.She's also responsible for setting up the first masters degree in medical physics in Morocco.Join us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, where we'll be celebrating women in science all week, and let us know about your favourite scientists on #100Women"
science	Sentinel for sea-level rise enters testing		"The next satellite tasked with maintaining the ""gold standard"" measurement of sea-level rise is about to enter final testing.Sentinel-6a will pick up from the long-running Jason series of spacecraft when it launches in November 2020.These missions track the height and shape of Earth's oceans with microwave altimeters.Since 1992, the orbiting instruments have observed sea level go up by an average of 3.2mm per year.This trend is accelerating, however. The most recent five-year period, from 2014 to 2019, has witnessed a 4.8mm/yr increase.Sentinel-6a marks the first time this hugely important mission series will fly under the badge of the EU's Copernicus Earth observation programme.It is still a joint venture between Europe (principally France) and the US, but the Copernicus patronage gives long-term security of financing.In the past, there was always some uncertainty over where the funding would come from to initiate the next iteration of spacecraft.Now, not only is Sentinel-6a entering testing but its follow-on, Sentinel-6b, has all its money in place with construction due to begin in 2021.Senior space agency and industry officials gathered at the IAGB facility in Ottobrunn, near Munich, Germany, on Friday to celebrate one year to launch.The IABG company will check over the Sentinel's systems to ensure they are fit to ride to orbit on a Falcon-9 rocket.When it eventually gets up there, Sentinel-6a will spend a number of weeks running alongside the current operational satellite, Jason-3.This will enable scientists to cross-calibrate their ""Poseidon altimeters"".These instruments are used to map the various ""hills"" and ""valleys"" in the ocean surface below.Understanding the variations in elevation over time has myriad applications, both short term and long term.Just as air pressure tells meteorologists what is going on in the atmosphere, so ocean height will betray details about the behaviour of water below just the top layers.The data gives clues to temperature and salinity. When combined with gravity information, it will also indicate current direction and speed.The oceans store vast amounts of heat from the Sun, and how they move that energy around the globe and interact with the atmosphere are what drive key elements of our weather and climate systems.A classic example is the El Niño phenomenon. This sees usually cold waters in the eastern central Pacific overtaken every few years by a surge of warm waters from the west. This disrupts weather patterns worldwide, bringing drought to some areas and intense rainfall to others.Sentinel-6a will act as an early warning system for El Niño by detecting the encroaching bulge in warm surface waters.The spacecraft will be managed on a day-to-day basis by Eumetsat, the intergovernmental organisation that operates Europe's weather satellites.It sends the altimeter data to national met agencies to be ingested in the numerical models that produce weather forecasts.Storm intensity and the onset of heatwaves, to give just two examples, will have tell-tale signatures in the changes detected in sea-surface height.Eumetsat also manages another altimeter-equipped Copernicus mission called Sentinel-3.The instrument characteristics are very similar but the orbit flown around the Earth is different.Whereas Sentinel-6 moves between 66 degrees North and South, Sentinel-3 goes to 82 degrees.""They are a system,"" says Eumetsat director-general, Alain Ratier.""Altimeters are narrow-swath and they [look straight down] - and yet the oceans provide great variety across space and time which we have to sample fully. So for this you need several orbits,"" he explained.""Sentinel-6 has a 10-day repeat cycle but the distance between its tracks is relatively large. This means it's optimised to monitor big features like the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current. Sentinel-3 is on a 27-day repeat cycle where the tracks are closer together, which makes it good for seeing the small ocean eddies that are perhaps 15-20km across and move very slowly.""The latest version of Poseidon altimeter on Sentinel-6 comes with greater precision - so much so that scientists hope it can help tease out even some of the more subtle shifts in climate.For instance, there's an expectation that increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will lead to an intensification of tropical trade winds. This should push warm equatorial surface waters westwards.It's the sort of detail required to make better predictions about the likely impacts of regional sea-level rise, says Benoit Meyssignac from the French Laboratory of Geophysical Studies and Spatial Oceanography.""This response from greenhouse gases - we see it in climate models and we're starting to see in the observations. However, because the uncertainty in observations is about 1.2-1.5mm/yr regionally, we cannot attribute it with confidence. But with Sentinel-6, we expect we will have the necessary precision and accuracy,"" he told BBC News.The European-US partnership at space agency level has become very important in recent years.Sentinel-2 is a land imager whose data products overlap with America's Landsat Earth observation programme - deliberately so; their respective imaging instruments were built to complement each other.It's teamwork Sandra Cauffmann, the acting director of the Earth Science Division at Nasa, would like to strengthen.""We are in conversation with the European Space Agency (Esa) and we will be having a workshop in February to consider the potential for partnership in the future architecture of Landsat. It makes sense that Sentinel-2 and Landsat go forward together,"" she said.As well as the European Commission, Esa, Nasa, and Eumetsat - major partners on Sentinel-6 project include the French space agency (Cnes), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Airbus, who built the satellite.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Europe eyes improved 'space weather' resilience	The different Lagrangian Points	"This artist's concept is of a new weather satellite - but not the type of spacecraft that warns us of coming winds and rain.It's a mission that would monitor the Sun for the type of energetic outbursts that can interfere with everyday activities on Earth.These powerful eruptions of particles and magnetic fields can degrade communications and even knock over power grids.The Lagrange satellite would see this ""space weather"" as it develops, alerting us to the impending disruption.The pictured concept has been produced by the UK arm of European aerospace company Airbus, which has just finished its initial assessment of how to construct the mission.Airbus is one of four groups that were asked to work through ideas by the European Space Agency (Esa).Member state delegations to Esa's big ministerial meeting in late November will now be asked to fund the next phase of the project.The name Lagrange reflects the position the satellite would take up in space. The plan is to go to a gravitational ""sweetspot"" just behind the Earth in its orbit around the Sun known as ""Lagrangian Point 5"".Spacecraft that are sited there do not have to use so much fuel to maintain station - but there is an even bigger operational rationale to use this location: it is the perfect spot to see that part of the Sun which is about to rotate into view of the Earth.In other words, the Lagrange satellite would get a preview of emerging storm systems. And being off to one side would also allow it to estimate how quickly any big outburst might arrive at Earth.Space weather is an issue of growing concern. There's a recognition that society's heavy reliance on technology has probably made it more vulnerable to the type of interference solar storms can initiate.If a major outburst knocked satellite navigation systems offline, for example - a not-inconceivable scenario - the economic losses would run in to the billions.On Thursday, the European Science Foundation’s European Space Science Committee issued a series of recommendations intended to lead to greater resilience.The panel wants to see: more research on the topic; improvements in the models used for forecasting; a greater awareness of the risks; better coordination among everyone's efforts across Europe; and, obviously, a much enhanced system of observations.This is where missions like Lagrange come in. And it's hoped the European satellite would have an American partner in space. This would take up a position directly between the Earth and the Sun, at Lagrangian Point 1.Last month, the UK government, which has supported the Lagrange feasibility studies through its Esa membership, put a further £20m towards space weather science.This money will go to research that can, ultimately, ""improve systems at the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre"". The Met Office works closely with US colleagues in issuing forecasts and warnings to users. These users include satellite operators. The alerts will tell them if they need to turn their spacecraft to shield sensitive electronics from the full force of a storm.Follow Jonathan on Twitter."
science	Science funding: Will 'picking winners' work?		"An ambitious Conservative minister has set out a strategy to turn the UK's scientific expertise into new products and services that will generate jobs and wealth for the economy.That was in 1983. The minister was Kenneth Clarke, who launched the £350m Alvey programme. It was designed to propel Britain to the forefront of advanced computing.But the policy of government subsidies for the research and development of favoured companies - known as ""picking winners"" - did not fit in with Margaret Thatcher's policy of introducing free market principles to the economy. Five years after its inception, the government pulled the plug on the Alvey programme.Thirty five years on, another Mr Clark, the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, announced £140m to support collaboration between industry and academia in the so-called life sciences sector, which develops innovative new medical treatments.The money was announced earlier this year - but details were revealed on Wednesday, to great fanfare.""The life sciences industry is the most successful and most important we know,"" Mr Clark told reporters.""Demand for this is going to increase in the years ahead, so what we are doing is to support a collaboration to get breakthroughs for patients and also create jobs.""So why is another Conservative government reviving a policy of subsidising industrial research when an earlier one junked it in the 1980s?It is because some high-tech companies and leading scientists have persuaded the Treasury and Downing Street that the policy was not wrong back then and should be given another go now.As a result, the prime minister and the chancellor announced an industrial strategy late last year.It is to be driven by UK research strengths, and they gave an extra £4.7bn pounds to spend on science over the next four years.The life sciences strategy is the first announcement of many that will aim to harness Britain's scientific strengths to benefit the economy.And while the word ""intervention"" does not sit easily with some Conservative politicians, the policy is being sold as part of the solution in the government's Brexit narrative.The formerly Remain-supporting Jeremy Hunt said: ""When we leave the EU, we will have a lot of money that we currently didn't have control over.""What we are saying today is the life science industries [have a] very big opportunity.""The government is backing those businesses that want Britain to be right at the very top of the pile to make those innovations.""Until recently, the Treasury has been suspicious of the way the nine separate scientific funding bodies spend public money.The process involves experts in the field deciding allocations based purely on scientific excellence.But the lack of coordination or strategic oversight made civil servants and ministers nervous of giving the funding bodies any serious money.That began to change in 2015, when Nobel Prize winner and director of the Crick Institute, Prof Sir Paul Nurse, persuaded the then Chancellor, George Osborne, that an umbrella body should be set up to both coordinate science funders and to consider how the research they were supporting fitted in with economic opportunities.The Treasury loved the idea. It was a marked departure from the autonomy the funding bodies had enjoyed in the past.But Sir Paul said proper oversight and coordination was the only way the UK could maintain its research excellence.Government accepted Sir Paul's idea and set up the umbrella body, called United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI).With it came the extra £4.7bn for science, with the possibility of more, maybe even much more, to come if the system delivers benefits to the economy.""It is a massive sum that we haven't seen for decades that has been added to the science budget. So, I think we have everything to play for,"" says Sir Paul.There is concern though that ministers will interfere, directing funding away from the best research and toward those areas that are socially, economically and politically important to them.Sir Paul believes such concerns to be ""scaremongering"".""For science to play its proper role in promoting benefit for society it's very important to invest in [pure] research,"" he says, ""but also to think about how those fundamental discoveries may be translated into useful objectives that will bring advances for society.""Thirty five years on from the launch of the Alvey programme, do we have another Conservative government that is not afraid of picking winners?The author of the new life sciences strategy document, Prof Sir John Bell, of Oxford University says he hopes so.""If you look around the world, it's important to think why you're doing an industrial strategy, and I think it's to try to identify sectors where you are likely to see very substantial economic expansion,"" he says.""Everyone thinks that the US is a completely capitalist free-market enterprise, but the truth is they pour billions of pounds into subsidising their life sciences industry in a whole variety of different ways.""Follow Pallab on Twitter."

science	How to escape from a lion or cheetah - the science	Defining the chase'Evolutionary arms race'	"The antelope can never out-run the cheetah, but it can survive the chase if it twists and turns sharply at the last minute.That's the finding of a study that tracks the dance of death between the fastest land animal and its prey.Researchers have been analysing how zebra and antelope escape from lions and cheetahs on the African savannah.They say hunting at lower speed favours prey, as it offers them the best chance of out-manoeuvring the predator.""In the final stages of a hunt, it isn't about high speed,"" said Alan Wilson of the Royal Veterinary College, University of London, UK.""If the prey tries to run away at speed, it is a very bad move because the predator is faster and can accelerate more quickly, so that plays into the predator's hands.""The optimum tactics of the prey is to run relatively slowly and turn very sharply at the last moment.""To determine how wild animals are able to compete for survival on the savannah, scientists compared the athletic abilities of lions and cheetahs with that of their favourite prey - zebra and impala (a type of antelope).In a study featured in Thursday's episode of the BBC One documentary Big Cats, researchers used specially designed radio collars to track the animals' top speeds, their acceleration and deceleration, and how quickly each animal could turn.They also took a small muscle sample to analyse the animals' maximum muscle power.The predators turned out to be significantly faster and more powerful than their prey.However, at lower speeds they were unable to match the zebra and impala for manoeuvrability, allowing these animals a chance of escape.The study, carried out in collaboration with the University of Botswana, sheds light on the extremes of performance in wild animals and the factors that influence their survival.""Prey can define the chase,"" said Prof Wilson. ""It decides when to turn, how fast to run. So, it's always one stride ahead of the predator.""Because the prey defines the tactics of the hunt, the predator needs to be more athletic to compete, he added.The work by the Royal Veterinary College on cheetah locomotion will be shown in Thursday's episode of BBC One's Big Cats documentary.The cheetah is known for its impressive running speed of more than 100km/h (60mph). Lions are more powerful than cheetahs, but not as fast on their feet.Both cheetahs and lions have about 20% more powerful muscles, 37% greater acceleration and 72% greater deceleration capacity than their prey. The cats are successful in about a third of hunts, using a combination of stealth and speed.Modelling work shows that zebra and impala have the best chance of evading capture if they turn quickly, particularly after slowing very rapidly.Meanwhile, cheetahs and lions have the highest chance of success if they are travelling only slightly faster than their prey.Scientists say this reflects the ""evolutionary arms race"" between predator and prey.Put simply, if predators were too successful at catching their prey, they would run out of food to eat.The research is published in the journal Nature.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	How science transformed the world in 100 years	Global change calculator	In an essay for the BBC, Nobel Prize-winner and Royal Society President Sir Venki Ramakrishnan contemplates the nature of scientific discovery - how it has transformed our worldview in a short space of time, and why we need to be just as watchful today about the uses of research as we've ever been.If we could miraculously transport even the smartest people from around 1900 to today's world, they would be simply astonished at how we now understand things that had puzzled humans for centuries.Just over a hundred years ago, people had no idea how we inherit and pass on traits or how a single cell could grow into an organism.They didn't know that atoms themselves had structure - the word itself means indivisible. They didn't know that matter has very strange properties that defy common sense. Or why there is gravity. And they had no idea how things began, whether it was life on earth or the universe itself.BBC Tomorrow's WorldThese days because of fundamental discoveries we can answer or at least begin to answer those mysteries. That has transformed the way we see the world and often our everyday lives. Much of what we take for granted today is a result of an interplay of fundamental science and technology, with each driving the other forward.Almost every modern invention has one or often many fundamental discoveries that make it possible. Sometimes, these fundamental discoveries were hundreds of years old. Neither jet engines nor rockets would be possible without a knowledge of Newton's laws of motion.There are big moments in science, like the discovery of the structure of DNA that shift our perspectives. But even that discovery was a milestone that built on work by Darwin and Mendel and presaged today's biotechnology where the entire DNA of a human being - the human genome - has been sequenced.Which groundbreaking discovery was uncovered in your life time? Find out with the Tomorrow's World Global Change Calculator.That in turn has given us the ability to figure out how things go wrong in genetic diseases and potentially how to fix them. Scientists were recently able to modify the genes of a young girl to cure her cancer.We are no longer a complete black box, although our complexity is such that we are only just beginning to understand how our genes regulate the body and how they interact with our environment.Genetic technologies are likely to present society with some big questions about how we see ourselves and what we want to use our greater understanding and capability for.That is also true of the Big Bang theory of how the Universe came into existence. A hundred years ago mysteries such as how the Universe came to exist were, for many, firmly in the realms of faith.Spurred on by the observation that the Universe is not constant, but galaxies are always expanding away from each other, we were able to work out that the Universe began with a Big Bang from a single point.This knowledge gives us insight into perhaps what is the biggest question of all - where did everything come from? That insight makes our small blue dot seem increasingly small, yet our quest for knowledge of what is out there shows no signs of an inferiority complex.From the Apollo missions to the Cassini probe, the Hubble telescope to the search for gravitational waves and exoplanets - all of those breakthroughs seem to be making us more inquisitive about space.Today, much of how we see the world is through an electronic screen. Computers in all their many guises are sources of knowledge, but they are also increasingly how we present ourselves to the rest of the world, and how we interact with others.Even a ubiquitous object like a smartphone depends on many fundamental discoveries. Its powerful computer depends on integrated chips made up of transistors, whose discovery depended on an understanding of quantum mechanics.The GPS in a smart phone depends on correcting the time from satellites using both the special and general theories of relativity - theories that people once thought would have no practical value. I wonder how many understand all the discoveries that make the little box work.Computers are also driving developments that will continue to challenge our view of the world. Machines that learn are already among us and are changing the world in which we live.They offer great potential in areas including healthcare and improving other public services, and may soon result in driverless cars and very sophisticated robots, but we need to make conscious decisions about how we want smart machines to allow humanity to flourish.Discoveries themselves are morally neutral, but the use we make of them are not. One discovery that shifted our view of the world in two distinctly divergent directions was nuclear fission. Its discovery led to the development of the most destructive weapons known.Some argue that the fear of destruction has been a powerful motivator for peace, but this is hardly a stable solution as can be seen with today's situation with North Korea. On the other hand, nuclear fission also promised a reliable source of energy that was once optimistically predicted to be 'too cheap to meter'.Science is the pursuit of knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. That pursuit of knowledge has also shaped the way we view the world, as has the application of the knowledge. It has transformed our lives, generally for the better.We live nearly twice as long today as our ancestors did in 1900 and the quality of our lives is far better than it was then.But the uses of science and technology are not shaped by science and scientists alone. They depend on an interplay of cultural, economic and political factors.Science is a triumph of human knowledge and we can all share in its excitement. At the same time, understanding its many uses can help us be engaged in decisions that affect us all.
science	Future forests facing climate balancing act	Delicate balancing act	"Forests can cope with a warming world if - and only if - temperature rises increase in line with increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.Increased CO2 allows trees to develop physiological characteristics, such as greater foliage, that can cope with higher temperatures.But researchers warn that a break in the temperature-CO2 increase ratio could trigger mortality in forests.The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.""Nobody had really considered incorporating the ability of trees, the forests, to adjust to novel conditions and to acclimate,"" explained co-author John Sperry from the University of Utah.""So it felt like we were bringing in two new approaches to this longstanding question of whether CO2 or warming were going to play out in the future.""Higher levels of atmospheric CO2 allow trees to consume relatively less water and photosynthesise more, whereas increased temperatures result in trees consuming more water and photosynthesising less.Using a unique model that took into account the trees' physiology, Prof Sperry and his colleagues reached a rather surprising conclusion.""What's interesting is that it is not the magnitude of the CO2 increase or the magnitude of the warming, it was the ratio of the two,"" he told BBC News.""For example, it was interesting to see that the low emissions scenario is actually predicted to be closer to the tipping point; closer to the critical ratio than the higher emissions scenario.""That's simply because in the lower emissions scenario, the ratio of CO2 increase for warming is lower.""Co-author Martin Venturas said the team did not find many differences between species in the study, which covered 20 locations across the mainland of the US, and included both deciduous and conifer species.But Dr Venturas added: ""There is still a huge amount of uncertainty, despite the fact that we have reduced uncertainty related to the physiology of the forest.""One such uncertainty, he explained, was precipitation levels in a changing climate and how this change affected soil moisture levels.However, the researchers said the study findings helped move the debate forward.""If you were coming at this naively, you would think the more emissions, the worse the forest was going to be affected because it was going to get warmer,"" observed Prof Sperry.""But it is really the ratio of the two that is important. You can have a massive shift in CO2 and warming but as long as they travel along that neutral ratio, the force is physiologically neutral and you'll have no response."""
science	Science debate: Should we embrace an enhanced future?	Moral drug mazeAre we all enhanced?Frosty reception	"To write this article, I drank a beverage containing an effective cognitive enhancer - something that helps me - almost daily - to focus.In my pocket, I carry an extension of my memory, on which I made notes for this very story.Caffeine and smart phones might not strike most people as human enhancements, but in changing how we use our bodies and brains, they are exactly that. They improve our subjective wellbeing and facilitate our meeting day-to-day life goals.The rather more futuristic-sounding concept of transhumanism - the idea that every human should have the right to enhance themselves beyond the so-called ""norm"" through science and technology - was the subject under scrutiny at a debate this week at the British Science Association Festival in Brighton.The big question being posed: do we all have the right to enhance our bodies as technology and pharmaceuticals will allow, or is that immoral? As the probably over-used term has it, would that be ""playing God""? And who gets to decide?First we should be frank about what is a correction - a medical fix - and what is an enhancement.Eyeglasses and contact lenses would be seen by most people as falling in the correction category, restoring sight to normal levels. However, although everyone may strive for 20-20 vision and invest in the technology to get it, such acute sight is far from normal and in many cases more enhancement than correction.There is no easy line to draw between medicine and enhancement, because the very notion of ""normal"" is not easy to define. And as science and technology moves on, we have a new and ever-changing normal.Ritalin a central nervous system stimulating drug is used by people unable to maintain normal levels of concentration. It is often prescribed for those who suffer from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).However, it is also in now widespread use as a ""smart drug"" - to enhance the concentration of people without ADHD. This form of enhancement, often by students battling to hit tight deadlines, has proven very controversial.Critics of such smart drugs argue that they give users an unfair advantage. But others points out that exams have never been a level playing field - some people can afford the luxury of personal tutors, while others have to work in full-time jobs to support themselves in higher education.Many people find the idea of any such cognitive enhancement deeply troubling, but what if, as Rebecca Roache, a philosopher at Royal Holloway, University of London argued at the festival debate, ""this might be the fastest way to find a cure for cancer?""That, she pointed out would benefit everyone.So is it then immoral not to attempt to upgrade people for the sake of improving society? And who and what should we be upgrading?Sarah Chan from the University of Edinburgh argued that research into enhancement should be directed towards helping those who are worst off in society first.If not, as Florence Okoye of the Natural History Museum noted, enhancement could magnify already existing societal inequalities.This then opens up the question of whether society's goal should be to make upgrades available for everyone.Most humans are now enhanced to be resistant to many infectious diseases. Vaccination is human enhancement. Apart from ""anti-vaxxers"" - as those who lobby against childhood inoculations are often dubbed - most of us are content to participate. And society as a whole benefits from being free of those diseases.So what if we took that a pharmaceutical step further. What if, as well as vaccines against polio, mumps, measles, rubella and TB, everyone also ""upgraded"" by taking drugs to modify their behaviour? Calming beta-blocker drugs could reduce aggression - perhaps even helping to diffuse racial tension. Or what if we were all prescribed the hormone oxytocin, a substance known to enhance social and family bonds - to just help us all just get along a little better.Would society function better with these chemical tweaks? And might those who opt out become pariahs for not helping to build a better world - for not wanting to be ""vaccinated"" against anti-social behaviours?And what if such chemical upgrades could not be made available to everyone, because of cost or scarcity? Should they be available to no one? An enhanced sense of smell might be useful for a career in wine tasting but not perhaps in rubbish disposal.A case in point is military research - an arm of which is already an ongoing transhumanism experiment.Many soldiers on the battlefield routinely take pharmaceuticals as cognitive enhancers to reduce the need to sleep and increase the ability to operate under stress. High tech exoskeletons, increasing strength and endurance, are no longer the realms of science fiction and could soon be in routine military use.The US military, always a research leader, has recently tested electrical brain stimulation, which was shown to improve increase multitasking skills and performance in people using flight simulators.But like GPS and the Internet, many initially military breakthroughs will become available to wider society, leaving us to charter new self-enhancing waters.Some ethicists have argued that there is an urgent need to enhance human moral decision-making - biomedically, if necessary. And Dr Roache, during the debate, was quick to suggest that most people might approve of morally enhanced politicians.Public perception of new technology though is often cold to begin with.But just a few decades ago treatments like IVF were seen by many as morally wrong. IVF is now largely considered routine and socially acceptable. So might we one day accept gene therapy on cells in early-stage embryos, which would produce heritable genetic changes for future generations?As technology moves inexorably forward, we are being faced with new questions about how enhanced we want ourselves and everyone else to be.In answering those questions, perhaps we need to recognise how enhanced we already are.Dr Alexander Lees is a British Science Association media fellow and lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University @Alexander_Lees"
science	Sir David Attenborough polar science vessel takes shape		"The 900-tonne block of steel that will form the stern of Britain's new polar ship is being moved into position at Cammell Laird on Merseyside.The Birkenhead yard received the rear section of the Sir David Attenborough on a sea-barge at the weekend from Northeast subcontractor A&P Tyne.Multi-wheeled trailers are now shifting the block from the quayside up to Cammell Laird's big construction hall.Attachment to the rest of the hull will take place in the next couple of weeks.The aim is to have the finished ship ready to start trials by autumn next year.Linton Roberts is the managing director at Cammell Laird. He told BBC News that assembly of the £200m vessel was moving at pace and on schedule.""We've got about 85% of the ship's structure in fabrication at the moment, and each of the blocks being assembled on the slipway area are very much being outfitted now. And by outfit, we mean pipework, machinery, and cableways. So it's a very busy time.""The 128m-long RRS Sir David Attenborough has been commissioned to replace the UK's existing polar fleet - the RRS James Clark Ross and the RRS Ernest Shackleton.The new vessel will support British scientists working in the Antarctic and the Arctic. It will feature a big cargo hold, a helipad, cranes and onboard labs, and have the ability to deploy subs and other ocean survey and sampling gear.Some of this equipment will go into the sea through an enclosed ""moon pool"". This feature - essentially a huge hole right through the middle of the hull - is clear to see for anyone walking across the growing mass of steel decks at Birkenhead.Another very visible sign of progress are the giant Rolls-Royce diesel engines. There are four of them and they have all been mounted on their seats. Two are resting on a double ""raft"" system inside the hull. This will allow them to run with minimal noise disruption to the wider environment - an essential capability for the Attenborough to conduct sensitive science experiments in polar waters.Once all items of auxiliary equipment are positioned in their respective blocks, the deck sections above can go on. The next in line are ready and waiting.""Sequencing is very important,"" said project director John Drummond. ""You can't just build the shell of a ship and then outfit it. Everything that doesn't go through a door has to be inside before you put the lid on. We don't want to be cutting holes in the side of a brand new ship.""Behind the diesels are the switchboard rooms that send the engines' electricity to the propulsion motors that drive the propeller shafts. Segments of those shafts are present and ready to be threaded through A&P Tyne's stern section.Referred to in the build as Block 10, this steel mass is the equivalent weight of 71 London double-decker buses. As well as those propeller shafts, it will also hold the steering gear and rudders.Block 10 is being rolled up to the construction hall to be welded to the rear of the Birkenhead-produced blocks. When that is done, the hull structure will be more than 100m in length.The next move is to edge this whole edifice down the slipway a short way to create room at the front to attach the ice-breaking bow - so-called Block 40.Currently, this section is minus its exterior shell plates and flipped 180 degrees to give Cammell Laird's engineers easy access to the internal framework.""You can see from the framing of the steelwork at the bow that it's a lot closer together,"" explained Mr Drummond. ""As the whole of the hull is pushed together at this point, it has a lot of very thick welds, much thicker than in the rest of the ship - because obviously it takes a lot more pounding from the ice. The vessel actually rolls on the ice to break through; it doesn't cut through it like a knife."" The required specification is to break sea-ice that is 1.5m thick.It was only in October last year that the BBC broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough kicked off the formal construction of the vessel that will bear his name. This involved the ceremonial laying of an initial hull block on the big hall's slipway.If timelines are maintained Cammell Laird should have the ship in a launch position on that slipway in the spring of next year.The first full science expeditions using the Attenborough are expected to be conducted by the Natural Environment Research Council-funded British Antarctic Survey in 2019.Mr Roberts said the ship would come back to Birkenhead for periodic inspections and re-fits. He expects the yard and the Attenborough to have a long relationship.""This is a very capable ship,"" he told BBC News. ""For example, it will have aviation capability in the form of helicopters and drones. But it's a very flexible platform and I think when the scientists start using it in ways that no-one imagined, they'll be back to have modifications made, and the design certainly allows us to do that.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Tinkering for science on the Irrawaddy		"""Poohsticks"" is what you might call entry-level hydrology.Drop twigs over a bridge on the upstream side and then race over to the downstream side to see which bits of wood appear first.Good fun, for sure, but the scientist in you may also learn something about stream behaviour.This is essentially what Delft University of Technology's Thom Bogaard and Rolf Hut have been doing in Myanmar. Together with local students, they've been playing a kind of poohsticks on the Irrawaddy River... with coconuts.Their aim has been to understand how this mighty watercourse moves, how it mixes, how it might disperse and dilute pollution if faced with such a problem.In the West, scientists would resort to all sorts of fancy, high-end equipment that costs hundreds, even thousands, of dollars. ""But this is Myanmar; they can't afford that,"" said Dr Bogaard. ""They have no information on water quality at the moment. They know a bit about sediment, but that's it. So, we decided to use citizen science to see how far we could go to get basic data.""Start with 300 coconuts. Attach them to coloured balloons that also contain a small bicycle light for visibility at night; and then just throw them in the river.The density of a coconut is almost one, which means it sits submerged at the surface of the water and is driven by the current alone, not the wind. It's the perfect, low-cost (""off the tree"", even edible) scientific drifter.Those dropped in the middle of the Irrawaddy will in all likelihood move the fastest; those near the bank will very probably move the slowest. ""And what you do is position your student teams on bridges and watch them pass by,” explained Dr Hut.""They just mark the times: 'It's now 09:45 in the morning and there's a blue one, and there's a white one'. What you see is a curve develop at one bridge, and then this bell shape gets broader at the next bridge. And that allows you to say something about the average changes in velocity between the bridges.""It's not enough of course, so Bogaard, Hut and their band of students and technicians - from Yangon Technological University and Myanmar Maritime University - upped the level of sophistication.This took the form of a block of wood topped with styrofoam. To this platform they attached a waterproof plastic box containing a GPS tracker, data card, and cell transmitter - the sorts of components that the Western ""maker movement"" (DIY technogeeks) like to play with all the time.The whole contraption - still costing less than $150 - is weighted to sit in the river properly with chunks of metal cut from an old car.This drifter can report its own position and velocity as it heads downstream. The group used 15 of these devices at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and its major tributary, the Chindwin.The latter carries more sediment and contaminants, but it takes many kilometres before these become fully mixed in the Irrawaddy.The data gathered earlier this year will now be used to model the river's behaviour, to better forecast how a pollution incident might propagate in time.""The ultimate aim is to make sure the local people can do this kind of thing themselves,"" said Thom Bogaard.""To be honest, it takes quite a bit of experience to know how to build these makeshift devices, but I think we've got them started. We had about 10 students and local technicians and it was a fabulous success. We were able to discuss how we do the science and you could see them flourish and get the mindset that is needed to monitor a river like the Irrawaddy.""But Rolf Hut doesn't want this approach to be seen as some kind of patronising hand-me-down. He's adamant that ""tinkering for data"" should be in the arsenal of every scientist, wherever they work.""For a lot of applications in the Western world it's just beneficial to have lower cost, tinkered sensors because it opens the opportunity to get far more geo-scientific data than would otherwise be possible.""Too often people think they need to buy a standard device and if it breaks they have to send it away and wait for it to come back. No! Fix it; make something of your own. Use a coconut!""Thom Bogaard and Rolf Hut presented their work in Myanmar to the recent European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly.

science	UK research chief 'will not direct science'	Centrally runSceptical views	"Britain's new research chief has said that he won't centrally direct scientific research.Prof Sir Mark Walport will be responsible for all public research spending in Britain next year.In an exclusive interview with BBC News, Prof Walport said that he wants to be a ""powerful voice for science"" in dealing with government.In the first interview in his new role, he sets out his vision for the new research agency he heads.Currently, UK research is funded by nine separate organisations. Each body specialises in specific fields, such as environmental research, the physical science and the biosciences.The system has contributed to Britain leading the world in many areas of research.The government is replacing it with the United Kingdom Research and Innovation agency (UKRI), which will oversee and co-ordinate the work of the research organisations when it formally takes control on 1 April 2018.But as its new chief executive, Prof Walport - currently the government's chief scientist - is already working to ensure that the new agency hits the ground running.Critics of the reform fear that the ""super research council"" will direct research centrally and be driven by economic priorities and the whims of ministers - rather than support the best curiosity-driven research as the current system allows and encourages.Prof Walport told me that these fears were ""completely wrong"".""We are going to continue to support the brightest minds to tackle the problems as they see them,"" he told BBC News.""Our job quite simply is to help the scientific community tackle the whole range of fundamental questions. It simply wouldn't be to anyone at the top of UKRI to pose the questions.""Prof Walport said the individual councils will stay and have a high degree of autonomy. And he pledged to appoint ""the strongest people"" to lead them.So if the research councils are going to be left to get on with what they already do so well, why add an extra layer of bureaucracy?Quite simply, it was because the Treasury was sceptical of what it saw as an uncoordinated research funding system with no strategic oversight or coordinated planning.The creation of UKRI has already been a success in this respect. Reassured by the restructuring, the Prime Minister announced an extra £4.7bn for research spread over four years. In 2020, Prof Walport will have a total of £8bn to spend.But he will be under pressure to deliver, so the investment from the Treasury continues.He tells me his aim is to make the UK funding system ""the best in the world"", one fit for purpose in the 21st Century.""By bringing it all together under the umbrella of UKRI we can have a powerful voice for research and innovation at a time when we really need that voice with the global challenges the world faces,"" he said.""It's about having a strong voice representing those (research) communities that have so much to offer to society in terms of solving societal problems.""A key role for UKRI will be to get researchers out of their silos and encourage scientists from different fields to work together. Another is to help deliver the government's industrial strategy which aims to focus efforts on areas of scientific and technological strength for the benefit of the economy.And one of the main challenges Prof Walport will face is the impact of Brexit. British universities employ about 30,000 scientists from EU countries and in collaboration with small businesses, receive £850m in research grants each year from the European Union.Prof Walport says that he takes heart from the fact that the Prime Minster has on several occasions said that she appreciates the importance of UK science.""There is no doubt about the vitality of our future research and innovation infrastructure depends on having the most skilled people from wherever they come,"" he told BBC News.""I think that that is a message that is well recognised by government. Our job is to provide the support and the leadership and the mechanisms to enable us to remain at the forefront which we will do by remaining very global in our outlook.""We have to have the confidence that there will be a solution that recognises that research and innovation are international activities.""Prof Walport was also keen to stress that the new agency includes the Arts and Humanities Research Council whose ideas he hopes the other research councils will draw on.The acronym ""Stem"" is used to describe activities in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. Prof Walport said: ""The Industrial Revolution was driven by the steam engine. And I think that this industrial revolution is driven by ""Steam"" as well by which I mean science, technology, engineering arts and mathematics.""And if you think what it is that makes modern technology usable is the sort of design element. So if you put all that together, then the opportunity [exists] to strengthen what's already a very strong research and innovation mechanism in the UK. That means getting the synergies and making the whole greater than the sum of the parts.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	'Brightest minds' key to future science success		"Diversity in research should be an early focus of the new umbrella organisation for UK science funding, according to the Universities and Science Minister, Jo Johnson.He said it should look at ""all the different facets at what makes for a diverse and resilient research system that optimises all the talents available in the country"".The body's new chief executive said it would support ""the brightest minds, while recognising that the brightest minds come in many diverse forms"".Sir Mark Walport and Mr Johnson were speaking at a launch event for UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) in London.Commenting on the issue of diversity in science, Prof Ottoline Leyser of the University of Cambridge said diversity was essential for a creative and innovative research system.""This requires an inclusive research culture, which in turn depends on diverse assessment criteria for researchers, diverse funding types and diverse routes for researchers into and out of the research base,"" she said.""The creation of UKRI is an opportunity to embed diversity in all aspects of the research system.""UKRI will incorporate the seven existing research councils, as well as Innovate UK and Research England (the research arm of the Higher Education Funding Council for England).""Research is a global activity,"" said Sir Mark.""We practise in an international landscape, we are internationally diverse, and much of the science that's done today is international in nature, both through the instruments that are needed, which can't be funded by any one nation alone, and also by the desire of researchers to work with the best counterparts, wherever they are.""He said the world of science and research is changing, driven by big data, interdisciplinary research and global collaborations.

science	Earthworms' place on Earth mapped	Facts about earthworms	"The first global atlas of earthworms has been compiled, based on surveys at 7,000 sites in 56 countries.The findings will help protect the hundreds of different earthworm species found on all continents except Antarctica.Climate change might have ""substantial effects"" on earthworms, said an international team of scientists.The burrowing creatures play a vital role in improving the soil but little is known about them on a global scale.We rely on earthworms for increasing crop yields and aerating the soil, but they have been overlooked in the past, said Dr Helen Phillips of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig.""As children probably the vast majority of us held earthworms in our hands and probably weren't quite aware how significant they are in the environment and for the things that we rely upon,"" she said.""We should never stop looking at the above ground biodiversity but we really shouldn't be overlooking what's beneath our feet, as well.""The international team of 141 researchers from 35 countries mapped global patterns in the number and type of different earthworms and how this is related to factors like soil pH and the climate.They discovered that temperature and rainfall can shape patterns of earthworms in the soil, suggesting climate change might have ""serious implications"" for both earthworms and the services they provide to nature.Dr Noah Fierer of the University of Colorado, Boulder, who is not connected with the study, said the results underscore that earthworm distributions are highly sensitive to climate, though ""it remains unclear how earthworm communities will respond to ongoing climate change"".The study, published in Science, found that at a local level, the number of species and the abundance of earthworms is lower in the tropics than in the temperate regions.For example, the soils of southern England are an earthworm paradise, harbouring some of the highest diversity and abundances of earthworms in the world.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Open Sesame: Science centre unveiled in Jordan		"In a rare show of unity in the Middle East, an advanced research centre to be shared by the troubled region has opened in Jordan.Despite political tensions and rows, countries usually hostile to each other are jointly supporting the venture.Its name is Sesame - Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East.The facility hosts a synchrotron, a particle accelerator that acts as a powerful microscope.Researchers including Iranians, Israelis and Palestinians - who would never normally meet - will now use the machine together.Sesame is a play on the famous phrase ""Open Sesame"" and is meant to signal a new era of collaborative science.By generating intense beams of light, synchrotrons provide exceptionally detailed views of everything from cancerous tissue to ancient parchments to plant diseases.Sesame's vast white building, located amid dusty hills some 35km north of the capital Amman, makes a stark contrast to the olive groves around it.The idea of a Middle Eastern synchrotron was first mooted 20 years ago but the sheer novelty of the plan and the extreme sensitivities of the region led to endless delays in finance, design and construction.For most of the past decade, a British physicist, Prof Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, has chaired the project through a series of obstacles.Now, standing in the centre of the completed - and tested - main ring of the Sesame synchrotron, Prof Llewellyn Smith admitted that he was ""a bit surprised"" that the venture had got so far.""The real problem has been finding the money - the countries in this region have science budgets that you can hardly see with a microscope,"" he said.""And there've been many times in the history of this project when a rational person would say 'let's give up' but it's so important it's kept going and here we are today.""The turning point came in 2012 when Iran, Israel, Jordan and Turkey each agreed to contribute US$5m provided that all the others did too, though the Iranians have yet to pay.That unlocked further finance from Italy and also from the EU which funded Cern, the international particle collider in Geneva, to manufacture the magnets that guide Sesame's beams. Unesco has also provided support.There are some 60 synchrotrons in use around the world but Sesame will be the first in the Middle East.The aim is to provide young scientists in the region with a reason not to emigrate to Europe or America - to try to help stem the brain drain of research talent.Dr Gihan Kamel is an Egyptian who returned to the Middle East from a synchrotron in Italy in order to work at Sesame.She sees the facility as vital for establishing advanced science in the region enabling it to develop techniques for the early detection of cancer or for analysing key crops to improve agriculture or explore treasured documents like the Dead Sea Scrolls which are 2,000 years old.She says that it takes time to adjust to working with people from different religions and cultures but that the result of collaboration makes it worth it.""We are not building a paradise, it's not an ideal place,"" she told me.""But we are creating something, we are giving hope for other people for other generations.""One of the earliest movers behind the project, Prof Eliezer Rabinovici, a leading Israeli physicist, described the opening as ""a very moving moment"".""People and scientists from all over the region as well as many parts of the world have demonstrated that one can work together over decades for a common goal benefitting humanity,"" said Prof Rabinovici.""Today a tiny lighthouse is opened which can suggest another direction to the young generation.""This comes amid escalating tensions in the region with the war in Syria right next door to the nation hosting Sesame, Jordan.Last month the King Abdullah of Jordan, who performed today's opening ceremony at Sesame, recently criticised Iran over its role in the Syrian conflict.So I asked a senior Iranian scientist, Prof Mahmoud Tabrizchi, whether these tumultuous events make a collaborative project like Sesame too difficult.""Science is different from politics,"" he said, describing Sesame as ""the greatest event in science in the Middle East"".""Scientists are doing their job. Science is like water - it flows between the countries but it never runs out. So it is better to share with each other.""The opening ceremony was attended by royalty, ministers or senior officials from the Jordanian, Cypriot, Egyptian, Iranian, Israeli, Pakistani, Palestinian and Turkish delegations, and by the European Commissioner for research and science and the heads of Cern, Unesco and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The first research using the synchrotron is due to start shortly with a ""beam-line"" using infra-red light with others to follow.And because of the high cost of electricity in Jordan there are plans for a solar farm which would make Sesame the first synchrotron to be powered by renewable energy.Looking ahead, already discussions have started about copying the Sesame model by building similar synchrotrons in other parts of the world including Africa and Central America.Follow David on Twitter."
science	Galaxy Zoo: Citizen science trailblazer marks tenth birthday	Space 'frog'New balls, please	"Galaxy Zoo began with a call for volunteers to help classify distant galaxies in space telescope images. The collaborative project made spectacular discoveries, spawning a family of similar projects - collectively known as the Zooniverse. We look back on 10 years of a citizen science phenomenon.It started with a strange blue smudge on a computer screen.Now that mysterious blob, spotted by a Dutch primary school teacher during a few idle hours one evening, has become one of the most remarkable recent discoveries in astronomy.Hanny's Voorwerp, named after its discoverer Hanny van Arkel, is providing scientists with a striking new window on the universe.They have found these distant clouds of glowing gas provide a kind of time capsule that can reveal what their neighbouring galaxies have been doing in the previous few thousand years.For Miss van Arkel, it is fitting for the object that now bears her name to be providing such insights - it marks 10 years since she first encountered it during her summer break from teaching.She had been taking part in a citizen science project called Galaxy Zoo, which asked members of the public to classify different types of galaxies from images taken by robotic telescopes.Launched in July 2007, Galaxy Zoo has resulted in 125 million galaxies of a wide variety of shapes and size being identified and produced 60 peer reviewed academic papers.It is an output far beyond any computer or expert, but by harnessing the power of the general public, researchers have gained an unprecedented insight into the Universe around us.""What started as a small project has been completely transformed by the enthusiasm and efforts of the volunteers,"" said Prof Chris Lintott, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford and co-founder of the Galaxy Zoo project. ""It has had a real impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution.""Miss van Arkel's own contribution started on a whim. A huge Queen fan, she had been browsing the website of guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May one evening while tinkering on her own guitar.There she saw some images of some distant galaxies May had posted along with a comment urging people to sign up to the project.""He said nobody has seen these galaxies before and that everyone could discover their own,"" explained Miss van Arkel. ""That got me interested and as I was on my summer break I signed up.""She had only been taking part for a week when she spotted the bizarre blue blob.""I had no idea what it was,"" she said. ""I thought it could have been a smudge on the camera maybe. There was this tutorial that showed us what we might expect to see but it didn't look anything like those on there so I sent an email to the team to ask about it.""She also posted the image on the project's forum, which is where the object earned its name from other members who christened it Hanny's Voorwerp, or Hanny's thing.It turned out to be an entirely new object in space - one that was completely unknown to science at the time.It took almost a year of analysis and research before scientists began to unravel what it was she had found - the blue smudge was an extremely hot gas cloud with no stars in it.They believe the huge cloud of gas, which is 16,000 light-years across, had been excited by material dropping towards the supermassive black hole at the centre of a nearby galaxy, creating a kind of ""light echo"" that reverberates around inside.When the news broke, it turned Miss van Arkel into a minor celebrity in the astronomy world.""The first time someone asked me for my autograph I thought they were joking,"" the 34-year-old explained.A decade later, another 20 of these rare intergalactic objects are thought to have been found - although many remain ""candidate"" voorwerpen until they can be examined more closely.Astronomers have turned some of the most powerful telescopes at their disposal - including the Hubble Space Telescope - towards them in an attempt to find out more.In a new paper published in the Astrophysical Journal, scientists who led the Galaxy Zoo project at the University of Alabama and University of Oxford, have examined eight of these voorwerpen, including the one originally found by van Arkel.They found they could detect variations in luminosity of the gas clouds that appear to correlate with changes in the activity of the neighbouring galaxy.In the voorwerp the researchers could detect distinct bands of brightening and fading in the light echo, which appears correlate to changes that occurred in the galaxy in the past.In the voorwerp next to the distinctive Teacup galaxy, which is 1.1 billion light years from Earth, the researchers saw a brightening and then two periods of fading, which indicate a rise and then drop in activity, all within a period of 55,000 years.They saw similar patterns in the other voorwerp they looked at, including Hanny's Voorwerp, which lies next to a galaxy called IC 2497.""It suggests parts of the Universe where we have active galaxies can change very rapidly,"" explained Professor Lintott.""When we talk about activity at the centre of galaxies, we're talking about material dropping toward the black hole. This can lead to material being ejected from the centre in the form of jets of material moving close to the speed of light. These jets are what we think excite the gas in the voorwerpen.""If things can change so rapidly in active galaxies, it may cause us to change how we think about our own galaxy, which is thought to be not active. These findings suggest it might have been in the recent past. Those systems close to the galactic centre would not have been pleasant places to be.""Peering at galaxies millions of light years away means we are also seeing them millions of years in the past. The voorwerp light echos, however, provide a record of what has happened in a galaxy's recent past - something that would be otherwise impossible to see.""It is fantastic, as we don't have anything else that lets us see what is going on in the Universe on this sort of timescale,"" said Professor Lintott. ""We can see what is going on during a human lifetime and we can look back millions of years at a population of galaxies far away, so this could be really useful as we find more of them.""For Miss van Arkel, however, it the beauty of the object she discovered that is still most striking.""The Hubble images have been amazing,"" said Miss van Arkel. ""Some images it is green and kind of looks like a tree frog. You can see these orange spots where the eyes would be and apparently this is where new stars are forming.""But the voorwerpen are not the only discovery to have emerged from the Galaxy Zoo project. Strange green balls - which became known as Green Peas by the affable ""zooites"" involved in the project - were a completely new type of galaxy that was spotted by participants. The eagle-eyed Ms van Arkel was also among the first to notice these too.Galaxy Zoo was so successful it has also spawned a whole family of other citizen science projects that are now conducted under the umbrella of the Zooniverse project.Members of the public can log on to classify everything from snapshots of animals in the Serengeti and count seals in the Weddell Sea to helping computers recognise animal faces and transcribing handwritten documents from the time of Shakespeare.It became so vast it quickly outgrew its old servers at Johns Hopkins University in the US, and now runs off the virtual servers hosted by Amazon Web Services.One offspring project to identify objects in our own galaxy has resulted in another recent discovery - small, round yellow objects scattered throughout the Milky Way.These ""Yellow Balls"" were found to be extremely massive stars cocooned inside dust. The project has found thousands in our galaxy.But the legacy of Galaxy Zoo could be something even more significant than a handful of new objects - it has changed the way science is done.Dr Karen Masters, an astrophysicist at Portsmouth University and project scientist for Galaxy Zoo said: ""We're genuinely asking for help with something we cannot do ourselves and the results have made a big contribution to the field."""
science	The battle to break plastic's bonds	Transforming trash into treasureIndustrial plastic tactics	"When Kenneth Poeppelmeier opened the reactor vessel in his lab and saw liquid, he said it was a real ""eureka moment"".""All of us were so excited,"" he told BBC News.Prof Poeppelmeier and his colleagues at Northwestern University in Illinois, US, have developed a chemical technique which breaks down the bonds that make polyethylene - the plastic most commonly used to make the ubiquitous carrier bag - so indestructible.The process ""chops up"" the plastic polymer, turning it into liquid oil. His team published their breakthrough in the journal ACS Central Science. It is a clever catalytic technique using metal nanoparticles to essentially snip the polymer apart - chemically transforming it into a liquid.""Importantly, that liquid has use and value,"" says Prof Poeppelmeier, who says his team - including collaborators from Argonne National Laboratory and Ames Laboratory - are now testing how it performs as a lubricant.""It's important to understand that these materials - all this plastic packaging - has a value. We certainly shouldn't be throwing it into the environment, but we shouldn't be throwing it away or burning it either.""While the approach has promise, it is in its early stages - it does not mean we will all be pouring a liquid form of recycled carrier bags into our cars any time soon. Similar approaches, though, are attracting investment to tackle a huge technological and environmental quandary - how can plastic waste be made into something useful and more valuable?Chemists - the chemical industry, in particular - are racing to make use of the mountain of single-use plastic building up in our environment. Meanwhile, more than a million tonnes of new plastic are created worldwide, every day.The strong bonds that link together the long chains of many commonly used plastic polymers are the fundamental reason for their incredibly useful properties. They are the physical backbone of plastic's strength and durability. But this means they are also the reason for its now infamous longevity - they are why plastic takes so very long to degrade.So transforming that tide of plastic waste into something of higher value - fuels or new materials - is a promising business venture. It is called chemical recycling - and is distinct from purely mechanical recycling. That's what we are largely reliant upon when we throw our plastic packaging into the recycling bin. Currently, plastics are sorted into their different types, melted down and made into pellets, which can be used to make new objects out of that same type of plastic.This process also degrades the material, so there's a finite number of times that a plastic bottle can be recycled in this way.Chemical recycling creates something chemically different - something new and useful. ""We need chemical recycling as part of how we deal with waste in the UK,"" says Prof Michael Shaver from The University of Manchester and Henry Royce Institute.But, he explains, it has lagged behind mechanical recycling because it is so much more energy intensive.""Even this more efficient study (by the scientists at Northwestern University) requires a process at 300C for more than 30 hours.""But chemical recycling has promising potential when waste streams are mixed - when we have lots of different types of plastics in the bin.""If we can convert these materials together, there is real value in the product as we avoid the need to separate things.""Most of the endeavours in this area are in industry, where new ventures and existing chemical giants are trying to develop techniques that can, on an industrial and profitable scale, break down plastics into either fuels or feedstocks - chemicals which can be fed back into a plant to produce brand new plastics.There are some relatively new, ecologically branded UK-based ventures like Recycling Technologies and Plastic Energy, which has plans to build 10 new plants in Europe and Asia by 2023. These companies use technology based on using high heat in the absence of oxygen to break down a mixture of plastics into fuel. Other ventures are using various methods of ""depolymerisation"" - breaking one hardy polymer down into its constituent fragments, so it can be fed back into a plant to make brand new plastic products.Because much of the investment in this area is from industry, many new technologies being developed are not yet public knowledge.In reality, Prof Shaver says, chemical recycling - though promising and important - will be just one piece in the monstrous puzzle of how we effectively make good use of all that plastic waste.""Many plastics are efficiently mechanically recycled,"" he says. ""This needs to be maintained - but when we cannot do that, we can turn to this new strategy for turning these strong bonds into a useful feedstock.""Follow Victoria on Twitter"
science	Europe steps in to cover US shortfall in funding climate science	Meeting the challenge	"French president Emmanuel Macron says that Europe will cover any shortfall in funding for the global climate body, the IPCC.The scientific organisation has faced uncertainty since President Donald Trump outlined plans earlier this year to cut US funding.The UK government also pledged to double their IPCC contribution.Speaking at UN talks in Bonn, Mr Macron said that climate change was the most significant struggle of our times.Today saw the start of the high level segment at this meeting of global climate negotiators known as COP23.In his statement to negotiators, the French president outlined the need for increased commitments to cut carbon.What is climate change?Trump team looks for climate alternativesMr Macron said these decisions must be based on clear scientific information.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has long been seen as a key element of that system of advice to governments.Their assessment reports, which come out every six or seven years, are critical in informing the public and governments about the causes and impacts of climate change.Earlier this year, President Trump proposed ending US funding for this body. Mr Macron said that Europe would now fill the gap.""I propose that Europe replace America, and France will meet that challenge,"" he told delegates here in Bonn.""I would like to see the largest number of EU countries at our side, all together we can compensate for the loss of US funding but I can guarantee from the start of 2018, the IPCC will have all the money that it needs and it will continue to support our decision-making. They will not miss a single euro.""The UK also announced that it would help the IPCC financially, with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) announcing a doubling of funding for the organisation.Mr Macron was keen to reinforce the leadership of France and the European Union on climate change. He announced that France would close all its coal plants by 2021, putting him at odds with German chancellor Angela Merkel who struggled with this issue as she tried to form a coalition government.On renewable energy, Mr Macron outlined plans for projects that would build inter-connections between green energy producers and consumer across the continent.""We will encourage and actively participate in funding all the projects we need bilaterally, with Germany and France but also with Ireland, Spain, Italy, the Benelux countries and Portugal,""""These international interconnections will be aimed at utilising renewables most efficiently across our continent, throughout the EU,""""This will be a guarantee that we will accelerate a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.""Earlier UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres had addressed the conference of the parties for the first time in his new role. He used the opportunity to call for greater investment in green energy - and an end to subsidies for coal, oil and gas.""In 2016, an estimated $825bn were invested in fossil fuels and high emissions sector,"" he told the meeting.""We must stop making bets on an unsustainable future that will place savings and societies at risk.""Other leaders and senior ministers were scheduled to address the talks on Thursday amid progress across a raft of technical issues, including the wish of poorer nations to see more action from the richer states in the years before 2020, when the Paris pact kicks in.There was also some good news from researchers who track the commitments of countries to cut their carbon emissions.Scientists involved with the Climate Action Tracker said that while the decision of President Trump to withdraw from Paris would impact US commitments, their analysis showed that on the ground actions in India and China were making a difference in curbing emissions.The report shows that the projected temperature rise facing the world by 2100 had dropped to 3.4C compared to 3.6C a year ago.""It is clear who the leaders are here,"" said Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, part of the team the group that put the tracker together.""In the face of US inaction, China and India are stepping up.""""However, both need to review, and strengthen, their Paris commitments. Our projections show they will meet them much earlier than 2030.""Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook"
science	Brexit uncertainty 'corrosive' for science		"Uncertainty over the nature of the UK's future relationship with the EU is having a ""corrosive"" effect on science, a House of Lords report says.The report highlights what it says is a ""delay in solid reassurances"" on Brexit and ""mixed messages"" from ministers.The report welcomes the increase to science funding announced in the 2016 Autumn Statement.But it says bold steps are needed to ensure the UK continues to attract the best scientific talent.Pro-Brexit campaigners reject the suggestions of negative consequences shared by other scientists and believe the UK will retain its ability to influence EU science policy on leaving.""At this early stage, there is little documented evidence of scientists from other EU member states deciding not to come to the UK because of the EU referendum,"" the report from the Lords Science and Technology Committee says.But it adds that ministers and the wider community should be on the look-out for ""any early indications of change in the attractiveness of the UK to talented scientists"".The report also highlights the importance of freedom of movement.It recommends the government distinguishes in statistics between students and other immigrants and treats student numbers separately for immigration policy making purposes.The committee also recommends that the government assesses the need for a scientific adviser role in the Department for International Trade.Lord Selborne, the committee's chairman, said: ""We welcome the major increase in science funding announced in the 2016 Autumn Statement and the government's separate assurance that it will underwrite funding for approved Horizon 2020 projects applied for before Brexit.""The UK's outstanding reputation and performance in the scientific world depends critically on redoubling efforts to persuade many of the world's most talented scientists to pursue careers in this country.""He added: ""It is vital the UK is still seen as open to scientific talent; the government has the ability to send this message to the scientific community enabling us to become world leaders after Brexit and beyond.""Universities and Science Minister Jo Johnson said he would carefully consider the recommendations. He commented: ""The excellence of our research and the attractiveness of the UK as a lead destination for science and innovation are fundamental to the future success of this country. That is why our upcoming Industrial Strategy will place science and innovation at its core.""As we prepare to leave the EU, we are determined to secure the best possible outcome for our research base. We've made a substantial investment in the sector - pledging an extra £2 billion a year by 2020/21, the biggest increase in decades. In addition, HMT will guarantee competitively awarded EU research funding, bid for while we remain a member of the EU.""The report is a follow-up on the findings of an inquiry published earlier this year."
science	Amazing science stories from 2016	Crest of a waveShake your tail featherPeake performanceThe world next door'Game-changing' lensSpace bonanzaAI comes of age?	"From the first direct evidence for black holes, to a rocky planet circling a neighbouring star, 2016 was packed with amazing science stories. Here's a selection.About a century ago, Albert Einstein proposed the existence of ripples in the fabric of space-time - as an outcome of his Theory of General Relativity. It took until February this year, however, for scientists to finally announce their detection, using an approach known as laser interferometry.Quite apart from this spectacular confirmation of Einstein's ideas, the discovery also provided the first direct confirmation for the existence of black holes. It opens up a completely new branch of astronomy, offering a way to probe cosmic phenomena that are off limits to other forms of astronomical inquiry.The hope is that this will all lead to a more complete understanding of the Universe and even shine a light on what got it all started - the Big Bang.Humans have been turning amber into jewellery and trinkets since prehistoric times. And it's not uncommon to find ancient beetles, ants and other insects trapped in the fossilised tree sap. But it's unusual to find the remains of larger animals.In June, researchers Lida Xing, Ryan McKellar and others published details of wings from baby birds trapped in 99-million-year-old amber from north-eastern Myanmar.The finds preserved spectacular detail of the feathers and traces of colour, but the best was yet to come. In December, the same team unveiled a dinosaur tail captured in amber from the same region - a world-first discovery.Scientists think the juvenile animal - small enough to have fitted in the palm of a hand - got trapped in sticky sap from the tropical forest that once existed there and could not wrestle free.At the end of 2015, Tim Peake became the first ""official"" UK astronaut to launch into space since Helen Sharman visited the Soviet Mir Space Station in 1991.His mission certainly got off to an eventful start. A few hours after launch, the flight's Russian commander Yuri Malenchenko had to manually dock the Soyuz spacecraft with the space station following the failure of its ""Kurs"" radar system.Then, in January, Nasa announced that Peake would step outside the space station to help repair a failed voltage regulator. He became the first ever person to wear the Union Flag on a spacewalk.But while the walk achieved its primary objective, it had to be called off early when water began leaking into the helmet of colleague Tim Kopra's spacesuit.Major Tim also became the first person to ""run"" the London Marathon from space, attached to the ISS's special microgravity treadmill, before returning to Earth in June.This year, astronomers confirmed the existence of a rocky exoplanet orbiting the nearest star to our Solar System - Proxima Centauri. This rocky world in a next-door system - named Proxima b - also sits within the so-called habitable zone around its star.However, Proxima Centauri belongs to a class of small, cool stars known as M dwarfs. They are quite different to the mid-sized yellow category that our Sun belongs to. Because they are cooler, the habitable zones around M dwarfs are located further in. But this also exposes planets to the harsh radiation by these stars.Just how suitable for life the habitable zones of these M dwarf stars are remains a matter for debate. In September, a team of researchers estimated that Proxima b could be blasted by deadly ""superflares"" from the host star about eight times a year.The search for a compact, thin lens that performs as well, or better, than the bulky, curved types used in cameras and telescopes got a major boost during 2016.A flat lens made of paint whitener on a sliver of glass could be ""game-changing"", according to one of its US inventors.""The quality of our images is actually better than with a state-of-the-art objective lens. I think it is no exaggeration to say that this is potentially revolutionary,"" said Prof Federico Capasso of Harvard University.These ""metalenses"" work in the visible spectrum but avoid the shortfalls - known as aberrations - inherent in traditional glass optics. In fact, the focal spot of the flat lens was typically 30% sharper than its competition.But just as importantly, because the lenses are flat, they could be manufactured in the same foundries that produce computer chips. This means they could be made on a large scale at a fraction of the cost of conventional lenses.One of the most important robotic spacecraft missions of recent times came to an end in 2016, as the European Space Agency crashed its Rosetta spacecraft into the comet it had been orbiting for two years.Just before that happened, mission scientists announced that they had found Philae, the little lander that had detached from Rosetta and descended to the surface of Comet 67P in 2014.Philae had relayed pictures and science data to Earth, but bounced off the surface and fell silent 60 hours later when its battery went flat. Its resting place had been a mystery, but Rosetta's Osiris cameras spotted the probe wedged in an overhang, explaining why it couldn't get enough sunlight to power its batteries.Europe's other big mission of the year also crashed on its target, albeit unintentionally. Schiaparelli, which was intended to test the technology for landing on Mars, suffered a glitch that caused its parachute to jettison too early.Officials at the agency were concerned that the next stage in the Mars programme - the ExoMars rover - might not receive sufficient funding at a meeting of ministers in December. But delegates eventually decided to stump up the money.Google's Deep Mind wowed observers yet again this year, with more powerful demonstrations of artificial intelligence.In March, the lab's AlphaGo programme beat one of the world's top players of Go - the strategy board game. In fact, Le Se-dol won only one of the five matches against his silicon-based opponent, missing out on a $1m prize.And in a study published in the journal Neuron, researchers from DeepMind collaborated with scientists from Oxford and UCL to probe how the human brain navigates underground train maps. First author Jan Balaguer said the work could help scientists ""design more clever algorithms"".AI expert Prof Noel Sharkey said we shouldn't be too worried about rogue AI taking over the world. But he suggested we might do well to keep an eye on our jobs.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Secrets of tea plant revealed by science		"Botanists have unlocked the genetic secrets of the plant prized for producing tea.A team in China has decoded the genetic building blocks of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis, whose leaves are used for all types of tea, including black, green and oolong.The research gives an insight into the chemicals that give tea its flavour.Until now, little has been known about the genetics of the plant, despite its huge economic and cultural importance.""There are many diverse flavours, but the mystery is what determines or what is the genetic basis of tea flavours?"" said plant geneticist Lizhi Gao of Kunming Institute of Botany, China, who led the research.""Together with the construction of genetic maps and new sequencing technologies, we are working on an updated tea tree genome that will investigate some of the flavour.""The Camellia grouping, or genus, contains over 100 species, including ornamental garden plants. But only Camellia Sinensis is grown commercially for making tea.The researchers found that the leaves of the tea plant contain high levels of chemicals that give tea its distinctive flavour. They include flavonoids and caffeine.Other members of the Camellia genus contain these chemicals at much lower levels.Dr Monique Simmonds, deputy director of science at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, UK, who is not connected with the research, said it provided an important insight into the genetic building blocks of tea.She told BBC News: ''Overall, the findings from this study could have a significant impact on those involved in the breeding of tea but also those involved in breeding many plants used medicinally and in cosmetics, as the compounds that occur in tea are often associated with the biological properties of plants used medicinally or in cosmetics.''Decoding the genome of the tea plant took more than five years. At three billion DNA base pairs in length, the tea plant genome is more than four times the size of the coffee plant genome and much larger than most sequenced plant species.""Our lab has successfully sequenced and assembled more than 20 plant genomes,"" said Prof Gao, who carried out the work with scientists in South Korea and the US.""But this genome, the tea tree genome, was tough.""The genetic knowledge could lead to ways to improve the quality and price of tea, by selective breeding of tea plants.Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), UK, said the work gave plant breeders a ""powerful new tool"".""Once you understand the basis for the flavours and the processing quality of the tea, you can then have genetic markers that breeders can look for when trying to produce new varieties,"" he told BBC News.Six main types of tea are produced from Camellia sinensis - white, yellow, green, oolong, black and post-fermented. Each has its own aroma, taste and appearance.The distinctive flavours of these teas are created by their different chemical compositions.Dr Simmonds said knowledge of the genome of tea helped us understand how the plant evolved.''Another important finding is that the biochemical pathways involved in the synthesis of the compounds important in the taste of tea are also present in some of the ancestors of tea and have been conserved for about 6.3 million years,'' she said.The first plant genome was sequenced more than 15 years ago.Since then more than 50 types of plant have been sequenced, including food crops such as the banana, potato and tomato.The research is published in the journal Molecular Plant.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	'Fake science used to justify badger culls'		"A senior researcher has accused the UK government of using ""fake science"" to justify its policy of culling badgers to control cattle TB.Prof Rosie Woodroffe has told BBC News that ministers were creating an ""illusion"" of success to justify the policy.She was speaking ahead of a scientific symposium on controlling cattle TB.Ministers say their approach is supported by government scientists and leading vets.Prof Woodroffe, a wildlife expert at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) who carried out the scientific assessment of culling badgers to control Cattle TB on which the current policy is based, said the government risked losing trust on how it used evidence - not just on its policy on controlling cattle TB but also on other important scientific issues.""When evidence is being cherry-picked and presented in the best possible light, it ceases to be evidence. It is fake science.""When it comes to (other policy areas) such as climate change and bee pollination, issues that have a big impact on lives and livelihoods of people, it is important that we can rely on the government to provide good evidence that stands up to scrutiny.""A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which oversees the badger cull, responded: ""England has the highest incidence of TB in Europe and that is why we are taking strong action to deliver our 25-year strategy to eradicate the disease and to protect the future of our dairy and beef industries.""Badger control in areas where TB is rife is one part of our long-term plan, which also includes strengthening cattle testing and movement controls, improving biosecurity on farm and when trading, and badger vaccination when possible.""Read also: Badger culls extended to Wales to stem spread of cattle TBDefra has overseen the issuing of licences to cull badgers in 10 areas in South West England to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle. The first culls began in 2013 in two areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire amid criticism from many scientists that the policy would at best have only a marginal effect on the spread of the disease and possibly increase the spread of TB.The critics' comments stem from an eight-year trial carried out by Prof Woodroffe in the 1990s which showed that only sustained and coordinated culling of badgers can slow down the rate of increase in cattle becoming infected with TB in the immediate area.Crucially, the trial also showed that if less than 70% of badgers are killed, the incidence of TB will not be reduced and may even increase because of the greater movement of badgers caused by the disturbance of culling.Since then Defra's own monitoring has concluded that it has killed enough badgers in its pilot culls and has rolled out culls in eight more areas. The department will also announce up 10 more areas later this year.But some scientists are concerned that Defra has changed the way it assesses badger numbers in a cull area and how it sets the target for the minimum number of badgers to be killed to ensure that its culls are seen to be successful.The previous system involved field work by experts to inspect the number of badger setts and a system of genetically testing badger hairs. Many researchers regard this approach as a more accurate way of assessing badger numbers but it is also expensive.The new system requires no field work. Instead, officials calculate the average number of badgers thought to be in different categories of land from government records.The new method predicts a higher and lower number for the total number of badgers in any given cull area. This reflects the scientific uncertainty. In its advice to Natural England, who issue licences for the trials, Defra has suggested the agency require culling companies to kill the lower number. The document also states that if it becomes apparent during the cull itself that there are more or less numbers than predicted the targets should be revised accordingly.But according to Prof Woodroffe, if the government can revise its targets then by definition the culls will always be successful""Where few badgers were being killed, they lowered the targets; where a lot were killed, they raised them. This means that there is really no way to tell what reduction in badger numbers was achieved by these culls. Culling that was consistently ineffective would look like a low badger density and prompt a reduced target,"" she said.Prof Tim Coulson, of Oxford University, who was a member of the Independent Expert Panel (IEP) that assessed the pilot culls, agrees.""The IEP developed robust methods for assessing effectiveness. Defra has chosen to ignore these. My hope is at the end of this there is a proper independent review and those who have deliberately chosen to ignore the science and pursue an expensive and ineffective agenda on political grounds are held accountable.""It is not helping the poor farmers. It is costing the tax payer millions. The science has already been clear, but science no longer plays a part in the decision process.""But a spokesman for the National Farmers Union (NFU), which is in favour of the culls, said that the new method for assessing and adjusting targets was justified.""Daily data collected through the course of the cull will allow Natural England to assess whether the estimated population was a reasonable reflection of the true population. If there is evidence on the ground during culling operations that suggests the minimum and maximum numbers have been set either too low or too high, Natural England can adjust the figures accordingly.""The rock musician Brain May, who campaigns against the cull, is among the organisers of Tuesday's scientific symposium. He said he hoped that it might be possible for all parties to reach a scientific consensus.""Everyone is sincere in their views but they are diametrically opposed based on the same body of data. My view is that it's because there are all sorts of other factors in there: there is a political element, there is an emotional element, as well as an intellectual element; and unfortunately it has become very hard to disentangle all these.""The aim of this conference is to try to clear that out of the way and look honestly, and, if possible, without prejudice at the information that is in front of us.""Follow Pallab on Twitter."
science	A science news preview of 2017	Eclipse of the centuryLord of the ringsFast and furiousHeavy metal	"From a majestic natural spectacle to a high-octane technological thrill ride, here's our guide to the big science events of 2017.If reports are to be believed, 2017 will offer up what's been described as the eclipse of the century.In August next year, skywatchers from all over the world are expected to converge on the United States for this spectacular cosmic event.The excitement is understandable, since it's the first such eclipse with a path of totality crossing from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts since 1918.Over the course of one-and-a-half-hours, the Moon's shadow will trace an arching path from Oregon in the west diagonally downwards towards South Carolina.In addition, several large urban centres, such as St Louis, Missouri, and Nashville, Tennessee, lie in the path of the eclipse.There isn't much cutting-edge science to be done on eclipses, but next year's event is sure to provide one of the greatest natural spectacles in recent memory.In 2017, one of Nasa's most successful ever missions will build up to a dramatic end. The Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997, arriving in orbit around Saturn in 2004.The array of discoveries made during the mission is staggering: giant hurricanes at Saturn's poles, geysers erupting from the icy moon Enceladus, rain, rivers and seas on the planet's biggest satellite Titan.But starting at the end of 2016 and continuing through early 2017, Cassini will carry out more than 20 dives at the outer edge of the majestic ring system that surrounds Saturn.This will give scientists the opportunity to study the rings in unprecedented detail.""We have two instruments that can sample particles and gases as we cross the ring plane, so in a sense Cassini is also 'grazing' on the rings,"" said Linda Spilker, Cassini's project scientist.They will also be able to observe the menagerie of small moons that orbit in or near the edges of the rings.In April, Cassini will begin repeated dives through the narrow gap between Saturn and its rings. Finally, on 15 September, the probe will end its mission by plunging through Saturn's atmosphere - a finale designed to prevent it crashing into potentially habitable moons and contaminating them with any Earth bugs that have hitched a ride.It should be a thrilling and spectacular ride.The British Bloodhound project aims to smash the land speed record with a rocket-powered car.The project has already been delayed several times, but the team behind the record attempt will be hoping that 2017 is their lucky year.Most of the car is already built; most recently, the team has been testing the car's fuel system.Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter-Typhoon jet engine, the vehicle should be subjected to trials at Newquay Airport in the UK in July and then Hakskeen Pan in South Africa later in the year.The British team wants to accelerate the car to 800mph, exceeding the current land speed record, by the end of the year.Then, after a hiatus, the car should return to South Africa in 2018 to achieve its ultimate goal of breaking the 1,000mph mark.A British car being entered for next year's World Solar Challenge won't need to get anywhere near those speeds. But it will require impressive feats of engineering to drive the sleek vehicle 3,000km through Australia's interior.Will this be the year that Elon Musk's SpaceX launches its Falcon Heavy rocket? The super heavy-lift launcher was first mentioned in 2005, but the date for its maiden flight has slipped several times, most recently because of the explosion of SpaceX's smaller Falcon 9 rocket in September.While Musk's company works to successfully return that rocket to flight in 2017, it's just possible that we might see its more powerful cousin launch next year. The rocket, which effectively consists of three combined Falcon 9 boosters, is designed to lift heavy payloads into orbit, including the heaviest commercial and military satellites - and, perhaps one day, crewed spacecraft.But the repeated delays have prompted some interested commercial customers to look at other options for planned satellite launches over the next few years.The demonstration launch could either occur from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California or Kennedy Space Center in Florida. With so much else in play at the moment, SpaceX may further delay the launcher's debut.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Curbing immigration spells 'disaster' for science	'Poor strategy'	"The president of the UK's Royal Society has warned that onerous restrictions on immigration for scientists would be a ""disaster"" for the UK economy.Prof Venki Ramakrishnan has said that growth could be stifled if researchers are not able to move easily.In a speech, he also said that retreating into protectionism would repeat the mistakes of the past.Prof Ramakrishnan made his remarks ahead of the government unveiling details of its industrial strategy.Addressing fellows of the Royal Society, he said that science had always been a global enterprise and depended on the free flow of people to bring in new ideas and expertise. That, he said, would need to continue after Brexit.""A major reason for the success of UK science and technology is that it has been open and welcoming to the best talent from around the world,"" he said.""Currently an EU citizen working here has to fill out a 90-page form with lots of onerous and unnecessary reporting to gain the right to remain.""In the future, rather than making things worse by having EU citizens go through the same mass of red tape that others currently do to gain the right to work here, we need to improve the situation for everyone by streamlining procedures so they are fair, transparent and efficient.""Prof Ramakrishnan said that 30% of the UK's academic research staff were from abroad and a third of UK start-ups were founded by non-UK nationals.""We are second only to the US as a destination for global talent. Their presence ensures that we remain first rate, and, importantly, produces a first-rate environment for training home-grown talent. Losing them would be a disaster for our economy.""The Nobel Prize winner added that he believed that people voted for Brexit were not against movement of highly skilled labour into the country. He also said that including students as part of the migration figures is both ""unreasonable and a poor strategy"".He said: ""Only a small fraction of them stay on mostly to our benefit and they can be counted at that time. The rest return to their home countries and are valuable links with the UK. They become future leaders and are more likely to look at the UK as natural partners for trade and investment.""By putting up unnecessary barriers to students and restricting opportunities for them, we are in danger of turning away entire generations of future partners who would be well disposed towards us"".But Prof Ramakrishnan welcomed the extra money for science and infrastructure the Prime Minister announced last week as well as the prospect of an industrial strategy.""Science and innovation must be an essential component of such a strategy. The recent announcement by the government of significant increased spending for research... sends a strong message that post-Brexit, the UK is determined to continue to be a leader in science and innovation,"" he explained.Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Academies warn Brexit 'damaging science'	Funding gap	"The UK's national academies representing science, medicine and engineering have told the government that Brexit is already harming science.A joint letter from seven academies says that the UK's world-leading position in these areas is in jeopardy.The national academies represent the best researchers in their fields.They call for the government to make a ""bold public commitment"" to prioritize research in Brexit negotiations.Individual researchers have also spoken about the effects of Brexit on their funding and collaborations.The joint letter was written by the presidents of the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the British Academy, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Irish Academy and the Learned Society of Wales.It states: ""The UK's outstanding research and innovation base is central to our economic, social and cultural well-being.""The result of the EU Referendum presents a challenge to maintaining this excellence. The current uncertainty is having immediate implications and raises many questions.""We stand ready to help ensure that Great Britain and Northern Ireland maintains its world leading position in research and innovation.""The academies say that ease of movement of researchers and students between the UK and EU countries is key to our future excellence and should be ""reinforced"".""We believe it is vital that UK-based researchers and staff from other EU countries are given assurances that they and their dependents will be able to continue to live and work here. Similarly, opportunities need to be safeguarded for UK researchers to gain experience in other EU countries.""UK universities receive £850 million a year from European Union funds. A condition of full access to those funds is free movement of people.Following the referendum result it is unclear whether the UK would continue to be eligible for EU research funding.The uncertainty has already resulted in some UK research groups and small businesses losing funding.The academies call for ""urgent discussions"" on how the government will address any funding gap in both the short and medium term.Of equal concern, they add, is the loss of access to networks that have been built over decades and help UK research groups and businesses stay at the cutting edge of research.""It is... the intrinsically collaborative nature of these programmes that allows UK researchers to achieve more than they would alone. Similarly, EU programmes provide opportunities for industrial competitors to collaborate with each other and work together towards common goals, often for societal benefit.""The academies also ask that UK experts remain ""fully engaged"" in shaping the development of standards and regulations and to safeguard UK research by ""seeking the closest achievable association with the EU research programmes""."
science	Black Friday: Brands opt out for environment reasons	'Make Friday Green Again'What is Black Friday?Is Black Friday bad for the environment?Start of 'golden quarter of retail'	"More than 300 clothing brands are asking shoppers not to buy anything in the Black Friday sales because of environmental reasons.The Make Friday Green Again collective says discount deals encourage people to purchase things they don't need.They say this ""overproduction"" contributes to climate change.Instead, it wants shoppers to spend 29 November this year looking in their wardrobes at what items they can repair, sell or recycle.But the British Retail Consortium argued the day allowed consumers to buy products they might not otherwise be able to afford.The collective, made up of predominantly French brands, was started by Nicolas Rohr, one of the co-founders of eco-friendly, clothing company, Faguo.""When people buy something, we pollute because of the carbon emissions that come from making that product, from using it and then getting rid of that product,"" he said.""Today we don't buy what we need; we buy because we are tempted.""We are not in a good relationship with consumption any more.""We want people to focus on what they already have in their wardrobes then, if you really need something more you can buy it.""Nous avons réuni le collectif #makefridaygreenagain, réunissant plus de 450 marques françaises, avec un point commun : elles ne participeront pas au Black Friday, le 29 novembre prochain.

This depends on how it was made, what it was made from, how far it's been transported and what happens to it at the end of its life.The argument from the collective is that the less you buy, the smaller your environmental footprint. It could also save you money.Dr Patsy Perry, a senior lecturer in fashion marketing from the University of Manchester, said: ""[Black Friday] is a great time to take advantage of discounts but it goes against what we're trying to do with sustainability.""On the one hand, retailers are increasingly talking about sustainability now and all the good stuff they're doing but, on the other hand, it feels like they're encouraging people to keep buying more stuff.""She added: ""Deep discounts communicate something to the consumer in terms of what that product is worth.""I think, increasingly, we'll see more businesses saying they don't want to be part of this [Black Friday].""The British Retail Consortium has defended shops taking part in Black Friday.Its chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said: ""Involvement... is a commercial decision by retailers. Such sales allow consumers to access many goods they might not otherwise be able to afford, particularly with Christmas around the corner.""After a year of stagnant sales, many retailers will be looking for Black Friday to give a welcome boost as they enter the 'Golden Quarter' of retail.""But Mr Rohr said Make Friday Green Again isn't about blaming brands or shoppers, but making us more aware of how we can live more sustainably.""The last two years we made great sales - 5% of our annual turnover - but we didn't feel comfortable with it,"" he explained.""I know I will lose turnover compared to my competitors but I will accept it because my interest is in the future [of the planet]. We need to have the courage to change things even if we have to sacrifice some turnover.""I would prefer that the brands offer a good price all year round. We do it for our generation and our planet""."
science	Doubts grow over UK environment protection post-Brexit	Environmental 'crisis'Not legally bindingWeakened	"Doubts are growing about the future protection of the UK's environment following Brexit.The Financial Times reported that an official paper shared by ministers proposed to deviate from green standards set by the European Union.It said the UK was open to significant divergence - even though the Prime Minister has previously promised standards won't fall.The government says it ""doesn't recognise"" the document - but the paper chimes with a BBC analysis which suggests the green watchdog planned after Brexit may be toothless.At the moment Britain's standards on water, air, waste and wildlife are enforced by the EU.So far, government ministers have had four chances to guarantee equal environmental standards after Brexit, but have declined the opportunity to follow through.Their critics accuse them of creating the illusion of strong action without actually ensuring it will happen.The Environment Bill - described by the Prime Minister as the ""huge star of our legislative programme"" - will be debated for the first time on Monday.It aims to establish a new Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) to take on the job of ensuring ministers hit their own targets following Brexit.But, critics warn this watchdog will not be truly independent because it will answer to the government, rather than to Parliament.The suggestion is the government will not be able to issue the sort of fines previously instigated by the EU which have concentrated ministers' minds in recent years.Mary Creagh, the Environmental Audit Committee chair, said: ""The only reason the government have done anything on waste, landfill and air quality is because of the threat of EU fines.""Ministers argue that the watchdog would be able to take ministers to court.They say it would be absurd for a regulator to actually fine the government, because it would simply transfer funds from one part of government to another.Environmentalists want the government to face the threat of fines, with the proceeds going to green projects.In addition, the critics say the 2037 date for enforcement of targets in the Environment Bill is far too late.""This is completely unacceptable,"" said Ms Creagh. ""We are in an environmental crisis - we need to act like it.""The Environmental Audit Committee wants the watchdog to be fully independent - similar to the National Audit Office, which reports to Parliament (not the government) and whose head is appointed by MPs.Boris Johnson is under pressure from Brexiteer MPs to impose complete independence from EU environmental legislation after the UK leaves the EU.A statement by the government said: ""By setting long-term, legally-binding environmental targets the UK is showing global leadership at a crucial time for our planet.""Given the scale of the challenges we face, our targets have to be ambitious and deliver sustainable results.""We will need to give businesses and the public sufficient time to make the necessary changes to help us get there.""""The OEP will hold the government to account to make sure it is on track.""Environmentalists say there is much good in the bill - but they simply don't trust the government to deliver.Ministers have recently taken four different steps that might have included a legal commitment to non-regression.These included the Withdrawal Agreement, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the Environment Bill and a set of 'assurances' provided to MP Caroline Flint.But, none would actually bind the UK in law to maintaining high environmental standards which are comparable to those enforced by the EU.This is a weaker position than adopted under Theresa May's rejected deal.Critics say the government has a track record of missing environmental targets, with the number of serious pollution incidents recorded in 2018/19 rising to its highest level since 2014-15.A leaked document from last year showed the government had actually abandoned agreed targets to conserve 50 per cent of England's sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), by area, by 2020.It is understood that The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' ambitions have been weakened by the Treasury and by Liz Truss at the trade department.Ruth Chambers, from GreenerUK, said: ""The bill includes several measures which could seriously undermine the water environment - and the biodiversity and nature clauses should be strengthened.""It is silent on tackling the UK's global footprint.""This must be addressed, else the UK risks undermining its global leadership credentials ahead of key international summits.""Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
science	'Alarm' over winter flood prospects in England		"The Environment Agency's director of flood risk management says he is ""alarmed"" by the prospect of further flooding across England this winter.John Curtin said there had been so much rain this Autumn, the land is saturated in many places.He is concerned that floods are going to ""get worse, more frequently, more often.""The three months from September have seen near-record levels of rain with 900 properties flooded across England.Mr Curtin said 21,000 homes in the current flooding period had been protected due to existing defences and operational activities.""I do sound alarmed because we are in the middle of November and everywhere is saturated,"" he told reporters.""All the flood storage areas are full. We have to be really vigilant because what I don't want is that horrendous 900 number to become a 10, 15, 20,000 number.""Mr Curtin encouraged people living on or near floodplains to sign up for Environment Agency flood warnings - only half of people living in these areas had done so to date, he said.Last week saw 50-100mm of rainfall in an area from the Humber to Sheffield, the same amount as would normally be expected in the whole of the month of November.""After another 30-40mm yesterday across large parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands, some locations are close to having their wettest Autumns on record and we still have two weeks of November to go,"" said Will Lang from the Met Office.In the worst-affected village of Fishlake in Yorkshire, there are now 38 pumps helping to drain the flood waters away.Some 200 troops were deployed to South Yorkshire to help in the relief efforts.They were on the ground until the early hours of Friday morning helping to erect temporary flood barriers and distributing sandbags to residents.Mr Curtin said that around 50% of the homes were still inundated but he expects all of them to be clear of water by Sunday.Over the past 24 hours the focus of concern has shifted southwards from Yorkshire to Warwickshire and Worcestershire where the River Avon was expected to peak at 4m.Twenty-five to 30 properties have been flooded and the Environment Agency said any further rise in the river above 4m could see around a hundred more properties under water.The Environment Agency is deploying temporary flood defences around Evesham and Stratford to prevent more damage.On criticisms that houses continue to be built on floodplains, Mr Curtin said that England had been building on wet areas for hundreds of years - and there was no problem with building new houses on floodplains as long as they were made flood resilient.""We have a huge amount of locked-in flood risk. If you were to never develop again on the floodplains, you'd freeze development in many major cities,"" he explained.He gave as an example new-build houses by the river in Derby.""The access is above the river level and the car park is down below; that is development in the floodplain but it is safe and it keeps the economic hub of Derby going.""If you develop it, you make it flood-resilient and you don't take away storage from the flood plain.""Around 140 flood warnings remain in place across England with some 170 alerts also in place. To put this in context, the Environment Agency said the highest number of warnings on record is 200."
science	Climate change: Plan to cut carbon emissions from concerts	Carbon footprint of a tour	"Scientists from the University of Manchester are creating a blueprint to help bands and pop stars to perform live and tour the world without contributing to climate change.It's after the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research were approached by the group Massive Attack who say they want to help find solutions to the climate crisis.The findings will be shared with musicians from across the industry and, it's hoped, will inspire millions of fans to live more sustainably.Massive Attack have spent a lot of 2019 with the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, even playing a set at one of their protests in London in April.Robert del Naja, aka 3D, told the BBC he felt conflicted because of how his career has contributed to climate change.""[As musicians] we have enjoyed a high carbon lifestyle. But as a society we've all existed in a fossil fuel economy for a long time and had very little choice in that.""The challenge now is to not only make personal sacrifices, but to insist on the systemic change that's needed. Business as usual is over.""The news comes a week after Coldplay announced they would not tour with their latest album for environmental reasons.Meanwhile, Billie Eilish is offering fans a chance to earn tickets to her next tour by fighting climate change and there'll be eco-villages at each concert where fans can learn more about the issues facing the planet.What will the scientists be looking at?This new research will look at all aspects of touring and how its carbon footprint can be reduced to zero, or as close to zero as possible.It's not looking simply at balancing out emissions from concerts by planting trees for removing carbon dioxide from the air - a process known as carbon offsetting.Instead, researchers will look at how to reduce the amount of energy used during concerts and in moving musicians, crews and sets between different venues and cities, as well as the impact audiences have.Tyndall Manchester's Director, Prof Carly McLachlan, says they'll be looking at where switches can be made to renewable energy sources, how to reduce the amount of energy being consumed but also thinking about how touring could be different.""It is a high carbon sector and we need to try and tackle that, because every sector has to be part of the transition to a low-carbon economy.""It's not yet known what impact, if any, changing the way tours are put on will have on ticket prices, routes or number of concerts.Just how bad is live music for the environment?Musicians are often criticised when they speak out about climate change and carbon because they have high carbon lifestyles.Promoting albums and performing in cities around the world means artists and their teams fly a lot.Then there are the carbon emissions from tour buses, from moving sets, from making merchandise, on top of the energy needed for things like lighting and sound.Recent figures suggest that live music generates 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK every year.Prof Carly McLachlan says music and art and culture are a ""really beautiful part of what it is to be human"".

science	Thousands of homes to be built in flood zones	Risk level'Planning for disaster'	"Almost 10,000 new homes could be built on some of the most flood-prone areas of England, a Greenpeace investigation has found.They include hundreds of new-builds in Sheffield and Doncaster, the towns hit hardest by the latest floods.The Environment Agency told the BBC that virtually all planning applications last year followed its advice on flood risk.But it predicts the flooding risk will increase because of climate change.The Greenpeace study comes as hundreds of flood-hit homes in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire are still evacuated.It identifies plans to build a total of 9,688 new homes in high-risk areas.More than 5,000 homes have been proposed in high-risk zones of Lincolnshire, where roads and thousands of acres of farmland have been flooded in the last few days.The developments include Boston United Football Club's new 5,000-seater stadium.The research also highlighted a 3,100-home ""new town"" near Stainforth, less than two miles from Fishlake, the village where hundreds of people have been forced from their homes because of flooding.The project includes what has been described by developers as a ""marina"".These properties have not yet received full planning permission but have been ear-marked by the local authority for development.The Greenpeace study selected the 10 English councils with the highest percentage of land covered by high-risk areas using the Environment Agency's map.It then plotted these against sites that the councils listed in their five-year plans for housing supply.Sheffield and Doncaster were added after the recent flooding in those areas.The work found that, as well as hundreds of new homes in high-risk areas of these towns, thousands of homes are planned for medium-risk zones.The Environment Agency defines a high-risk flood zone as one where there is a one in 100 chance of flooding in any given year.Medium-risk zones are areas where there is a one in 1,000 risk of flooding in any year.Fishlake is judged by the Environment Agency to be a mix of medium-risk and low-risk areas.Greenpeace's chief scientist, Doug Parr, described the plans to build homes in areas at high risk of flooding as ""literally planning for disaster"".""Flooding has been flashing on the radar as one of the major impacts of the climate emergency in the UK for years,"" he said, ""yet our planning system keeps failing to properly recognise it"".The Environment Agency told the BBC that local planning authorities are responsible for approving proposals for new development in their areas.However, it said the National Planning Policy Framework makes clear that inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided.""In some places it will be challenging to avoid these areas,"" the Environment Agency statement said, ""due to limited land outside the flood plain or because of other sustainable development objectives.""Nevertheless, the agency claimed that, between 2017 and 2018, 99.4% of planning applications involving new homes were decided in line with its advice on flood risk.The Local Government Association told the BBC that the figure for 2018-19 was a bit lower, at around 97.3% ."
science	Climate change: Bafta calls for more environment plot lines on TV	What has Bafta found?How much of an influence is television?Climate change translator	"Television shows should have more plot lines and references to climate change to help tackle the issue, according to Bafta.The British Academy of Film and Television Arts says TV can help change people's attitudes towards the planet.It cites successes from previous initiatives based around health and social issues.The call to action comes after Bafta analysed a year's worth of subtitles from 40 TV channels.It found that references to climate change lagged far behind such terms as ""beer"" or ""sex"".In its ""Subtitles to Save the World"" report, the academy analysed 128,719 non-news programmes from across the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky between September 2017 and September 2018.In total, 25 words related to the environment were tracked including ""food waste"", ""electric car"" and ""green energy"".The document found that ""climate change"" had 3,125 mentions - far behind such terms as ""beer"" (21,648), ""dog"" (105,245), ""tea"" (60,060) and ""sex"" (56,307).""Climate change"" references came up more or less as often as ""zombie"", ""urine"" or ""rhubarb"".The report also found that the possible solutions to reducing individuals' carbon footprints which were mentioned the most in programmes were not the ones that have the biggest impact.Words like ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"" were used more often than words like ""green energy"" and ""hybrid cars"". However, food is responsible for 12% of a person's carbon footprint, and experts say we will need to eat less meat if we want to meet climate targets.The report was prepared by Bafta and was also supported by analysis from Deloitte.Reacting to the document's findings, Bafta's chairwoman Dame Pippa Harris said: ""The TV industry's call to address climate change is clear.""It's time to write a different script,"" she said, urging the industry to ""use powerful human stories to connect audiences with the world around them"".Meanwhile, the academy's head of industry sustainability, Aaron Matthews, told the BBC that TV programmes did talk about the environment ""in some way, but at quite a low level at the moment"".""So, obviously, no zombie apocalypse on the horizon, but a climate change one,"" he said.Television is still seen as a very powerful medium which can change the public's opinion of health and social issues.Blue Planet II opened people's eyes to the problem of plastic pollution.And when soap operas such as EastEnders tackle health and social issues, charities often receive surges in calls for help.Research by the charity Mind found that one in four people who saw a mental health storyline in a soap, contacted a friend, colleague or loved one. In addition, 16% sought professional help themselves.But when it comes to issues such as sustainability and climate change, some will question whether this can be done without putting off viewers.Satirist and writer Charlie Brooker has explored climate change in his show Black Mirror, but admits including the subject in plotlines ""is a very, very tough nut to crack"".He says: ""It is a difficult thing to see a simple story.""You tend to get things like Game of Thrones where the dead at the wall and 'winter is coming' was kinda playing out like a metaphor for climate change with everybody warring and getting caught up with their own political squabbles while facing annihilation.""I never know quite how much drama can change people's opinions and behaviour.""But screenwriter Lisa Holdsworth says little references - like showing people recycling and talking about environmental issues - can make a difference.""We're beginning to see the real-life effects of climate change on people who've no choice but to bear the brunt of it and, I think, if television and drama are not reflecting that, we're not doing our job properly.""In a statement, the BBC said it was ""helping to arm audiences with the facts on climate change and sustainability"".It added: ""We will be commissioning more programmes which challenge and inform audiences, while building up our collection of online resources and archive about our planet and the environment in which we live.""Sky said it supports the new research and says its ""channels regularly show content that illustrates the breadth of the challenge we face in order to help protect our planet.""""Broadcasters have an incredible opportunity to highlight environmental issues and inspire public change.""Chief of Staff at Channel Four, Lynette Huntley, said ""this fascinating piece of research will help us identify what more we can do to challenge perception and inspire change around sustainability.""BBC News has contacted ITV for a comment and is still waiting to hear back.Follow Laura on twitter.1.5 degreesKeeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. That’s compared with ‘pre-industrial’ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then.2 degreesThe original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit.3 degreesThe current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change.4 degreesA prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture.AdaptationAn action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought.AGWStands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes.Arctic iceThe Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.AttributionAttribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely.Average temperatureThe average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C.BECCSStands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy.BiofuelA fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste.BiomassBiomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations.CarbonCarbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide.Carbon captureThe trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy.Carbon dioxideCarbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity.Carbon footprintThe amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product.Carbon neutralA process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning.Carbon offsettingCarbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour.Carbon sinkAnything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil.CCUStands for ‘Carbon Capture and Utilisation’. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics.Climate changeA pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans.Climate modelClimate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes.Climate negotiationsClimate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies.CO2Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up.COPStands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate.CopenhagenA UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began.Coral bleachingCoral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot.DeforestationThe clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned.DeniersClimate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century.EmissionsEmissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries.Extreme weatherExtreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer.Feedback loopIn a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sun’s rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting.Fossil fuelsFuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide.Geo-engineeringGeo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences.Global temperatureUsually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet.Global warmingThe steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record.Green energyGreen energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets.Greenhouse gasesNatural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride.Gulf StreamThe Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater.HydrocarbonA hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change.IPCCThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts.JetstreamA jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europe’s hot summer of 2018 more common.Kyoto ProtocolA set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990.LukewarmersA term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists.MethaneMethane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture – cows emit large amounts – as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming.MitigationAction that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests.Net zeroA term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'.Ocean acidificationThe ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the world’s oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds.Ozone layerThe ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming.PPM / ppmAn abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year.Pre-industrialScientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker.Renewable energyNormally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar.Runaway climate changeDescribes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century.Sea iceSea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average.Sea level risesRising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm.SustainabilitySustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example.Tipping pointDescribes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a ‘tipping point’, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible.UNFCCCStands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change."
science	Environment in multiple crises - report	So what is needed?What issues are being under-played?Will society take the solutions on offer?	"Politicians and policymakers have failed to grasp the gravity of the environmental crisis facing the Earth, a report claims.The think-tank IPPR says human impacts have reached a critical stage and threaten to destabilise society and the global economy.Scientists warn of a potentially deadly combination of factors.These include climate change, mass loss of species, topsoil erosion, forest felling and acidifying oceans.The report from the centre-left Institute for Public Policy Research says these factors are ""driving a complex, dynamic process of environmental destabilisation that has reached critical levels.""This destabilisation is occurring at speeds unprecedented in human history and, in some cases, over billions of years.""The IPPR warns that the window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic outcomes is rapidly closing.The authors urge three shifts in political understanding: on the scale and pace of environmental breakdown; the implications for societies; and the subsequent need for transformative change.At least climate change features in policy discussions, they say – but other vitally important impacts barely figure.These matters are close to home for British politicians, the authors argue, with the average population sizes of the most threatened species in the UK having decreased by two-thirds since 1970.The UK is described as one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world.Some 2.2 million tonnes of UK topsoil is eroded annually, and over 17% of arable land shows signs of erosion.Nearly 85% of fertile peat topsoil in East Anglia has been lost since 1850, with the remainder at risk of being lost over next 30–60 years.The IPPR says many scientists believe we have entered a new era of rapid environmental change.The report warns: ""We define this as the 'age of environmental breakdown' to better highlight the severity of the scale, pace and implications of environmental destabilisation resulting from aggregate human activity.""Simon Lewis, Professor of Global Change Science at University College London, told BBC News: ""IPPR are right to say that environmental change is happening ever-faster and threatens to destabilise society.""Future problems with food supplies could cause price spikes that drive civil unrest, while increases in levels of migration can strain societies.""Both together could overload political institutions and global networks of trade.""This century will be marked by rapid social and environmental change - that is certain. What is less clear is if societies can make wise political choices to avoid disaster in the future.""Harriet Bulkeley, a geography professor at Durham University, told BBC News that the IPPR paper was a good interpretation of the current evidence, but she said it raised the question of how firm evidence of environmental threats had to be to prompt government action.""We know lots of good things to do,"" she said, ""but often the argument is made that we need to have 'evidence-based policy'.""This can, of course, be used as an excuse for delay. So, I guess the question is how much more evidence is needed for action?""A UK government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to leaving our environment in a better state than we found it through our 25 Year Environment Plan and the forthcoming Environment Bill.""Over 25 years we will replenish depleted soils, rid our seas and rivers of the rubbish trashing our planet, cut greenhouse gas emissions, cleanse our air of toxic pollutants, and develop cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.""The Environment Bill will also create a new environmental body, the Office for Environmental Protection, to hold us to account on this commitment.""Update 28 February 2019: This story has been amended following criticism of IPPR's Online report which led to it altering its comments on extreme weather.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"

science	New hope for trees affected by ash dieback		"Scientists say there is new hope in the fight against a disease that is devastating ash trees.A study has identified the genes that give trees resistance to ash dieback, which arrived in the UK in 2012 and has now spread to almost every part of the country.The discovery suggests that trees could now be bred that are unaffected by the epidemic.The research is published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.Prof Richard Buggs, from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, said: ""I hope this work will lead to us safeguarding ash populations for future generations.""Ash dieback is caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, which originated in Asia.In its native range, it causes little damage to trees, but when the fungus was introduced to Europe about 30 years ago, it caused widespread destruction.Recent estimates suggest that the disease can kill up to 70% of ash trees.In the UK, this means 70 million trees could be lost, which would cost the economy £15bn, according to an analysis published this year.In a bid to halt this seemingly unstoppable disease, scientists have been studying the DNA of hundreds of ash trees.A small number of trees are showing some natural resistance to ash dieback - and the researchers have identified the parts of their genome that are helping this fightback.""We've discovered about 3,000 locations in the DNA of these ash trees that are contributing to the resistance,"" explained Prof Buggs.Knowing this will help the team to monitor how quickly ash trees are evolving a tolerance to the fungus in the natural environment, but is also crucial for any future breeding programmes.Prof Buggs said: ""We hope to bring together all of the genetic differences that are contributing to resistance into a single population of ash trees that will have higher resistance than any of the ash trees that we currently have.""He added that this will not save the trees that are currently dying, but if this project is successful, it could mean they could eventually be replaced and ash could live on in the countryside.But ash is not the only tree that is in trouble.So alongside this study, a team from Kew has also been collecting seeds of 70 woodland species.Since 2013, some 15 million seeds have been amassed as part of the UK National Tree Seed Project. They are now stored at -20C at the Millennium Seed Bank in Wakehurst.Dr Alice Hudson said: ""We don't know what's around the corner for our woodlands. There are threats from climate change, from plant health, from pests and diseases, and from land-use change… but banking the seeds here, we have them out of the environment, they are away from the threats - and they are a back-up.""Follow Rebecca on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Greenhouse gas concentrations again break records		"Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases once again reached new highs in 2018.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says the increase in CO2 was just above the average rise recorded over the last decade.Levels of other warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also surged by above average amounts.Since 1990 there's been an increase of 43% in the warming effect on the climate of long lived greenhouse gases.The WMO report looks at concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere rather than just emissions.The difference between the two is that emissions refer to the amount of gases that go up into the atmosphere from the use of fossil fuels, such as burning coal for electricity and from deforestation.Concentrations are what's left in the air after a complex series of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, the forests and the land. About a quarter of all carbon emissions are absorbed by the seas, and a similar amount by land and trees.Using data from monitoring stations in the Arctic and all over the world, researchers say that in 2018 concentrations of CO2 reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm), up from 405.5ppm a year previously.This increase was above the average for the last 10 years and is 147% of the ""pre-industrial"" level in 1750.The WMO also records concentrations of other warming gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. About 40% of the methane emitted into the air comes from natural sources, such as wetlands, with 60% from human activities, including cattle farming, rice cultivation and landfill dumps.Methane is now at 259% of the pre-industrial level and the increase seen over the past year was higher than both the previous annual rate and the average over the past 10 years.Nitrous oxide is emitted from natural and human sources, including from the oceans and from fertiliser-use in farming. According to the WMO, it is now at 123% of the levels that existed in 1750.Last year's increase in concentrations of the gas, which can also harm the ozone layer, was bigger than the previous 12 months and higher than the average of the past decade.What concerns scientists is the overall warming impact of all these increasing concentrations. Known as total radiative forcing, this effect has increased by 43% since 1990, and is not showing any indication of stopping.""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.""We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,"" he added.""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3C warmer, sea level was 10-20m higher than now,"" said Mr Taalas.The UN Environment Programme will report shortly on the gap between what actions countries are taking to cut carbon and what needs to be done to keep under the temperature targets agreed in the Paris climate pact.Preliminary findings from this study, published during the UN Secretary General's special climate summit last September, indicated that emissions continued to rise during 2018.Both reports will help inform delegates from almost 200 countries who will meet in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual round of international climate talks.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	General election 2019: How big an issue is climate change for voters?	What do the opinion polls show?What's behind this shift?So are the parties listening?So what actually needs to be done?What's at stake?	"Could this be the UK's first general election where climate change plays a defining role?Usually it's issues such as the economy or crime or health that dominate the campaigns. And this time Brexit is bound to be the most acute question facing politicians and voters.But some recent polling has revealed a potentially significant shift elevating the environment to one of the top priorities.The polling company YouGov has tracked views on the environment for nearly a decade and for most of that time the subject ranked pretty low.There was a spike in interest following the violent storms of the winter of 2013-14 in which many areas were hit by devastating floods, but that was an exception and things slipped back to ""normal"" soon afterwards.But this year something has shifted dramatically, according to YouGov.Chris Curtis, one of its researchers, says that in the most recent poll 27% of voters cited the environment as one of three top issues - behind Brexit and health. That puts it on a par with crime and the economy.And he says this is particularly striking among younger voters - 45% of 18- to 24-year-olds put it as their second-biggest concern after Brexit.His conclusion? ""I think over this election campaign politicians are going to have to start discussing the issue of the environment if they want to win over the support of those younger voters.""The YouGov polling points very clearly to the protests by Extinction Rebellion last April as one key factor.Resented by some, inspiring to many, the movement has at the very least got people talking.Around the same time, the school strikes led by the Swedish 16-year-old Greta Thunberg were catching the imagination of thousands of British children - and maybe some of their parents too.The past summer saw record-breaking heatwaves and scientists making it clear that rising temperatures are not a problem for the distant future, but something that's threatening now.And on top of it all, the revered tones of Sir David Attenborough have been heard by millions, including right now with his new series Seven Worlds, One Planet, warning that the threat of climate change is real and dangerous.The two biggest parties are trading blows over which of them offers the most credible green policies.Last Saturday the Conservatives announced a halt to fracking, the controversial process of extracting gas from shale rock. Labour derided the timing as opportunistic and more of a pause than a total ban.The very next day, Labour came out with a Warm Homes plan to insulate the country's households - nearly 27m of them - and help with solar panels and heat pumps. The Tories dismissed the scheme's £250bn bill as unaffordable and unrealistic.And now, along with the Liberal Democrats, SNP and Green Party, Labour are calling for a live TV debate on climate change, clearly hoping to highlight what they see as government failings.For their part, ministers point to the fact that the UK, on their watch, is the first major industrialised economy to commit to decarbonisation.As things stand, there's a national goal of making sure the UK no longer adds to the problem of global climate change after 2050.In practice that means reducing carbon emissions to what is called ""net zero"" by that time - which basically means any greenhouse gases still being released are absorbed or compensated for in some way.That was the target proposed by the Committee on Climate Change, the government's climate advisers, but opposition parties want to move much faster.There are plenty of different scenarios for achieving net zero but they all involve radical changes and huge investments in the next decade or so.Among the options is a trebling of the UK's current solar power and of the output of its offshore wind, switching away from using gas to heat our homes, together with massive improvements in the energy efficiency of all our buildings and greening all our transport.For Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, ""this election really is the climate election"".He told BBC News: ""There probably isn't a bigger challenge - when we think about the things that need to be done to get to that goal of net zero emissions, it's absolutely enormous.""It involves things in every sector of the economy and of course we need government policies in every sector of the economy to deliver that.""And we need to see the manifestos that come forth in the next election that those policy commitments are there - it's essential that they are.""And for whoever ends up in charge next month, there's another incentive to think about: the UK is due to host a crucial climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow in a year's time.The country's green credentials will be under global scrutiny like never before.Follow David on Twitter."
science	Coal: Is this the beginning of the end?	Record declineRise of renewablesUS bankruptcies	"The fuel that powered the industrial revolution may be in decline at last.This year looks set to see the largest fall in electricity production from coal on record, according to a new report.The reduction is estimated to be more than the power generated from coal in Germany, Spain and the UK combined.It is projected to drop by 3% - which is a fall of 300 terawatt hours.The report by three energy experts - published in the online journal Carbon Brief - draws on energy sector data from around the world for the first seven to 10 months of the year.The record drop raises the prospect of a slowing of global CO2 emissions growth in 2019.But the authors warn that, even with this decline, coal use and emissions remain far higher than the level required to keep the global temperature rise below 2C.Coal has been the mainstay of electricity generation for over a century and has seen decades of near-uninterrupted growth.Yet this report finds that record reductions in coal use in developed countries, including the US, European Union, and South Korea, could signal the beginning of the end of the industry.These reductions in use are not being matched by increases elsewhere.The decline suggests that coal plants will take a significant blow to revenues as average running hours look set to reach an all-time low.""It is clear that the economics of coal production no longer make sense in many parts of the world where it is simply cheaper to generate electricity from natural gas and renewables,"" said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment at the London School of Economics.However, he also warned that is too early to tell whether the global downturn in coal consumption in 2019 is the start of a declining trend.The report suggests that the reasons for the drop in coal-fired generation vary from country to country, but include increased electricity generation from renewables, nuclear and gas, as well as slowing or negative demand for electricity.In previous years the reductions in coal generation in the US and EU have been offset by increases elsewhere, particularly China.This year, however, the fall in developed economies is accelerating, while coal generation in India and China is slowing sharplyThe Chinese situation is complex.A recent report showed a surge in new coal-fired plants in China.However, this new analysis shows that electricity demand growth in China this year slowed to 3%, down from 6.7% over the last two years.It finds that non-fossil energy sources - nuclear, wind and hydro generation - have met almost all of this demand.As a result, coal-fired power plants are being used less intensively.The report estimates that this year utilisation rates will be below 49% - a record low.It says 2019 has also seen the first Chinese contracts for wind and solar plants that will generate power at the same price as coal power plants.The authors say this could threaten the long-term viability of coal in China and put it on a path to renewable energy ""grid parity"" as those projects come online in 2020.Meanwhile, the US has seen the largest reductions in coal-fired power generation.This comes despite US President Donald Trump's vigorous efforts to revive the US coal industry.Eight US coal companies have filed for bankruptcy this year, including Murray Energy, the largest privately held coal company in the country.At the same time, the report finds there has been a sharp turnaround in India, where coal power output is on track to fall for the first time in at least three decades.Only south-east Asia has seen significant increases in coal generation, but demand here is relatively small relative to the global total."
science	Climate change: 'Bleak' outlook as carbon emissions gap grows	How years compare with the 20th Century average	"Countries will have to increase their carbon-cutting ambitions five fold if the world is to avoid warming by more than 1.5C, the UN says.The annual emissions gap report shows that even if all current promises are met, the world will warm by more than double that amount by 2100.Richer countries have failed to cut emissions quickly enough, the authors say.Fifteen of the 20 wealthiest nations have no timeline for a net zero target.Hot on the heels of the World Meteorological Organization's report on greenhouse gas concentrations, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) has published its regular snapshot of how the world is doing in cutting levels of these pollutants.The emissions gap report looks at the difference between how much carbon needs to be cut to avoid dangerous warming - and where we are likely to end up with the promises that countries have currently committed to, in the Paris climate agreement.The UN assessment is fairly blunt. ""The summary findings are bleak,"" it says. ""Countries collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required.""The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5% per year in the last decade. In 2018, the total reached 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century.2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAAJust last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that allowing temperatures to rise more than 1.5 degrees this century would have hugely damaging effects for human, plant and animal life across the planet.This report says that to keep this target alive, the world needs to cut emissions by 7.6% every year for the next 10 years.""Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions - over 7% each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,"" said Inger Andersen, Unep's executive director.The report pays particular attention to the actions of the richest countries. The group of the 20 wealthiest (G20) are responsible for 78% of all emissions. But so far, only the EU, the UK, Italy and France have committed to long-term net zero targets.Seven G20 members need to take more action to achieve their current promises. These include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and the US.For example, Brazil's plans were recently revised, ""reflecting the recent trend towards increased deforestation"".Three countries - India, Russia and Turkey - are all on track to over-achieve their plans by 15% but the authors of the report say this is because the targets they set themselves were too low in the first place.For three others - Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia - the researchers are uncertain as to whether they are meeting their targets or not.That leaves China, the EU and Mexico as three countries or regions that are set to meet their promises or nationally determined contributions (NDCs), as they are called, with their current policies.Without serious upgrades to most countries' plans, the UN says the 1.5C target will be missed by a significant amount.""We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020, then stronger NDCs to kick-start the major transformations of economies and societies,"" says Inger Anderson.""We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated,"" she added. ""If we don't do this, the 1.5C goal will be out of reach before 2030.""The report outlines some specific actions for different countries in the G20.So for Argentina it's recommended that they work harder to shift the public towards widespread use of public transport in big cities. China is urged to ban all new coal-fired power plants, something that recent research casts doubt on.The biggest focus of action is the energy system. To get a sense of the massive scale of change that is needed, the study says the world will have to spend up to $3.8 trillion per year, every year between 2020 and 2050 to achieve the 1.5C target.The impression that time is running short is reinforced by the report - and UN negotiators gearing up to meet in Madrid next week at COP25 are feeling the pressure to increase their ambitions on carbon.""This is a new and stark reminder by the Unep that we cannot delay climate action any longer,"" said Teresa Ribera, Spain's minister for the ecological transition.""We need it at every level, by every national and subnational government, and by the rest of the economic and civil society actors. We urgently need to align with the Paris Agreement objectives and elevate climate ambition.""It would be incomprehensible if countries who are committed to the United Nations system and multilateralism did not acknowledge that part of this commitment requires further climate action. Otherwise, there will only be more suffering, pain, and injustice.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	How do you stop flooding?	Flood barriersNatural flood managementSustainable drainageDredging riversHow much is spent on flood defences?Why are we seeing so many floods?	"Severe flooding has once again hit parts of the UK, damaging homes and leaving many people stranded.But how can flooding be prevented or alleviated? Here are some of the main methods used in the UK.The Environment Agency uses a range of temporary or ""demountable"" flood barriers to provide additional protection to flood-prone areas.Lightweight sectional metal barriers are relatively inexpensive, can be placed in various configurations, and can be removed completely when waters recede.Frame barriers consist of rigid frames holding an impermeable membrane and use the weight of the floodwater itself to hold the barrier in place.Temporary barriers can also be added to existing permanent flood defences, such as raised embankments, increasing the level of protection.Natural flood management offers a sustainable approach to managing floods and is intended to complement traditional ""hard engineering"" techniques, such as flood barriers and concrete walls.These schemes rely on a combination of small-scale interventions with the aim of reducing the speed of the flow of converging water before it reaches larger rivers.Natural flood defence features include small barriers in ditches and fields, or notches cut into embankments, all of which divert the water into open land.Letting pools form outside the main channel of the river means the water is temporarily removed from the main flow reducing the power of the floodwaters.Trees can also help defend against floods. Planting more trees catches rainfall and helps take water from the soil - although the Environment Agency says large areas must be reforested to make a real difference.Felled trees can also be laid across streams in wooded areas and help push unusually high waters into surrounding woodlands, although such schemes need very careful planning and management.Sustainable drainage is a concept often applied to towns and cities which are especially prone to flash flooding after sudden heavy rain.In urban areas, large areas of concrete and tarmac, as well as the roofs of buildings, are impermeable to water. Rain is channelled straight into drainage systems which can quickly become overwhelmed.In the UK, the Flood Act of 2010 obliges builders to landscape developments so that water from roofs and driveways seeps into open ground rather than rushing into the water system.Sustainable drainage guidelines suggest that impermeable surfaces should be replaced with permeable material, allowing rainwater to drain into the ground - a process known as infiltration.Large ""detention basins"" can also be built to collect rainwater and hold it, managing the volume of water entering urban rivers, while ponds offer further water-holding capacity.The basic aim of dredging is to remove silt - a sedimentary material made of fine sand, clay and small-sized particles of rock - from the river's bed, therefore increasing its capacity to carry water downstream.The process usually involves an excavator, or vacuum pump, mounted on a barge or on the riverbank, to remove silt from the river.But the issue of whether rivers should be dredged is not clear cut.The Environment Agency says that while dredging can improve general land drainage, it cannot prevent rivers from flooding, due to the huge volumes of water involved.Farmers in Somerset claim a lack of river dredging worsened the impact of the flooding that hit the region in January 2014. But planned flood defences in Oxford, for example, have avoided dredging, as it would not provide enough additional capacity to deal with a major flood.The process is costly, sometimes harmful to the environment, and can weaken riverbanks as well as the foundations of bridges and weirs.After a major flood, large volumes of silt may accumulate in slow-flowing areas and the river may need to be dredged again.Flooding and coastal erosion can have a huge impact on local communities and economies.Damage estimated at £1.1bn a year is prevented by the UK's river barriers and defences, according to research by the Association of British Insurers.The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs is responsible for flood policy in the UK. It gives funding to the Environment Agency to deal with main rivers, estuaries, the sea or reservoirs flooding.Over the last 10 years, total spend on managing flood and coastal erosion risks in England increased by 18.4% to £808.2m in 2018-19.Spending peaked in 2014-15 at £786.8m. Defra says a lot of that was down to repairing damage after heavy winter storms.Flooding can come from all sorts of water sources, including groundwater, reservoirs and surface water. But cities and towns that lie on rivers or near the sea are most at risk.Generally speaking, increased rainfall causes flooding inland, while high tides and storms are behind much coastal flooding - and both can happen together.Flooding has always been an occasional part of life in such areas, but experts warn that climate change is worsening the situation.In early 2019, Environment Agency chairwoman Emma Howard Boyd said that some communities might even have to move entirely. She suggested that spending on flood management would need to be raised to £1bn a year.""We can't win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences,"" she said.Researchers have also warned that coastal areas in Northern Europe are also at higher risk of flooding in the coming years because of rising temperatures.So-called ""compound flooding"" happens when heavy rainfall combines with a storm surge from the sea."
science	England floods: What is making them worse?	Do we know why Fishlake has had such large floods?Where did all the water come from?Have the flood defences installed in recent years simply moved the problem along?Are we protecting cities at the expense of the countryside?Is government funding for flooding having an impact?Would dredging the Don have helped?Are there too many agencies involved?Were the warnings given in South Yorkshire adequate?Is climate change likely to overwhelm even the best defences?Is what we've seen in Yorkshire a vision of the future?	"About 500 homes have been flooded in Doncaster with more than 1,000 properties evacuated in areas hit by the rising waters, including the village of Fishlake where residents have complained about the lack of warnings.So what are the factors that have made these floods so damaging, and are they a taste of what the future might bring? Environment correspondent Matt McGrath has been looking at the likely causes of the floods along the Don.There are numerous factors at play, but in essence Fishlake has been caught in a pincer movement with two rivers, the Don and Ea Beck both bursting their banks into an area that was heavily sodden from rain over a period of weeks.Making matters worse is the fact that Fishlake is built on what was once a boggy fenland, that was drained many years ago.""Fishlake is on the edge of the Great Humberhead levels which was a massive fenland and huge peat bog until the 1700s,"" said Prof Ian Rotherham from Sheffield Hallam University.""By 1900, almost the entirety had gone. We drained the landscape and we've built on it.""There was a dramatic and sustained downpour last week with South Yorkshire receiving the equivalent of a month of rain in just one day.But the situation was made worse because, according to experts, there was nothing to slow down the flow of the water in the River Don.""This water is coming from the uplands, it is coming from the Peak District, from the Pennines,"" said Prof Rotherham.""And what we have had there is the massive removal of peat by cutting, the burning of heather moorland and of course drainage, and instead of holding the water back in the uplands, it shoots downstream.""All the way along we have straightened the rivers and drained the flood lands. The water rushes down. It is not being held back and it spews out across the lowlands and that's what happened here.""There were severe floods in the Sheffield area back in 2007. Two people died and hundreds were evacuated.In the aftermath, there were significant investments in new defences, with six protection schemes put in place around the city at a cost of £83m.It involved the construction of more than 60 new flood protection measures along a five-mile stretch of the River Don.The Environment Agency said that these flood defences managed to significantly reduce the impact of last Thursday's inundation.But defences can only go so far. Too often, severe floods will find the weakest point.""In Sheffield, the main factories and other areas that were smashed back in 2007 are now protected,"" said Prof Rotherham.""However, if you are keeping the water out of there, you are moving it faster downstream, and they get smashed even worse.""The Environment Agency examine each flood protection scheme in the light of how it will benefit people and property. Rural areas aren't avoided, but urban areas generally need more protection.""You might argue that's appropriate as there are more people and properties in urban areas, so it is not necessarily a bad thing,"" said Dr Liz Sharp from the University of Sheffield.""If you accept it is going to rain more, and we don't have an infinite pot of money, then decisions need to be reached about what the priorities need to be.""Some flood experts say that rural areas are getting a raw deal at the moment.""We don't have enough resources to protect all those people in rural areas and that really isn't good enough because those people are just as important as those who live in urban areas,"" said Prof Hannah Cloke, from the University of Reading.""I think we need to prioritise everyone, we all have the same rights to be protected from floods wherever we live.""The government say they are already investing £2.6bn over six years, in more than 1,000 projects to protect 300,000 homes from flooding and coastal erosion.But the view among experts is that there simply isn't enough in the right places at the right time.""There is a lack of resource in the Environment Agency and in the lead local flood authorities to undertake flood risk analysis and all the warning activities,"" said Prof Cloke.""So they really are working on a shoestring in certain places. We've really got to sort out the funding so they are working together better. They are thinly staffed in places and that can be a problem in sorting out these issues.""Another challenge is that the funding seems to follow the areas that suffer disasters rather than going to the areas most in need.""Somerset got a huge amount of publicity for flooding in 2013, but compare that to Hull in 2007 where 8,000 homes were inundated, and really the latter should have been the higher priority,"" said Dr Sharp.""Attention should be given to where the needs are.""Local residents in Fishlake say that their situation would have been improved if the Don had been dredged.""It is a tidal river here, bringing in sand and silt from the Humber, and we have all the water coming off the hills around Sheffield,"" Fred Turner, 71, told the BBC.""At high tides it is coming the other way too and Fishlake is in the middle.""But many experts say that by itself dredging is not enough.""It can be a good way of moving water from A to B,"" said Dr Liz Sharp from the University of Sheffield.""But this may cause flooding at B, and this is the challenge with flood walls and dredging. They are just faster at conveying water, the more contemporary approach is to make space for the water.""Dr Sharp gives the example of the Rother Valley Park, where they have converted land that was once used for mining into a series of lakes that hold back more water when it rains and that has contributed to reducing flood threats in Doncaster.The Environment Agency tends to look after the bigger rivers while there are dozens of internal drainage boards that have responsibility for managing water levels in areas across England. For smaller streams, local authorities usually have responsibility. All this means there is some potential for confusion.""We have different authorities in charge of different parts of flooding and that can be a problem,"" said Prof Cloke.""We have seen some steps forward since the flooding in 2007 with the Met Office and Environment Agency working much more closely together and that collaboration has been really valuable.""Local people in Fishlake have complained that they were told that their properties were safe hours before the water rushed in last week.But forecasting the flow of water is very difficult indeed, especially when it gets down to local street level. Often you don't have just have one form of flooding such as a threat from rivers, you also have what's termed surface water flooding where rainwater is unable to drain away.That type of flood often depends on how much rain is falling on a particular place and how much the land is able to absorb. In Fishlake and surrounding areas, there has been heavy rain for weeks, leading to sodden ground.The physical facts of a warming world mean that the air can now hold more moisture. This means that downpours are heavier and likely to cause more flooding.According to the UK Met Office, the amount of rain from extremely wet days in the UK has increased by 17% in the most recent decade (2008-2017) compared to 1961-1990.There are things we can do to ensure that we adapt to cope with changes we are now seeing.""We can have earlier warnings to get people out of the way, so they know what to do to protect their homes and businesses,"" said Hannah Cloke.""We can retro-fit houses so they are more resilient to floods, and if we have to build on the flood plain, if there is nowhere else to build, then we can do it cleverly - by building on stilts and making those properties safe to live in.""""Yes it is a foretaste of the future,"" said Dr Liz Sharp.""It will happen in different places, we need to be expecting this to happen more often.""Other experts agree that the future environment will be a challenge.""We're running behind with climate change - we need to really speed up if we are going to keep on top of the problems that are being exacerbated by the change in the climate,"" said Prof Cloke.""We don't really have the right infrastructure in place for the next 25 years to 50 years and that is very frightening.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: How your duvet can help the environment	Waste Facts	"While the world tackles plastic waste, some experts feel other forms of waste need attention too… like duvets.Yes, duvets. A student city like Brighton throws away tens of thousands of duvets a year.They are buried in landfill or burned - but researchers are trying to insulate walls with them instead.It's the sort of idea being promoted at a waste summit in London on Thursday to be addressed by the Prince of Wales and Environment Secretary Michael Gove.The summit brings together 200 leaders from business, government, universities and voluntary groups in a bid to squeeze more useful life out of the materials we use.Making goods (like polyester duvets) uses energy and releases greenhouses gases – and the Prince and the politician both say we can’t tackle climate change unless we use materials more intelligently.The target for firms at the summit is to reduce avoidable waste by 2030 and double the nation’s resource productivity – that means getting more service from existing materials, and finding new uses for old materials.Where denim legs keep a house warmThe Waste House in Brighton – where the duvet experiment is happening - offers a lesson in re-use of resources that would otherwise have been scrapped.The house looks normal but its structure is built from construction waste, which forms the majority of the waste stream in the UK.In its hollow walls they are testing the insulation qualities of an unlikely host of scrap - including old floppy discs; audio cassette cases; unfashionable rolls of wallpaper and – bizarrely - 1.8 tonnes denim legs cut off from trousers to make shorts.The black tiles on the exterior walls look traditional, but are in fact carpet tiles with the waterproof rubber back facing outwards.'I just hate waste'Cat Fletcher, who calls herself the ""Resource Goddess"" and runs re-use programmes in Brighton, told BBC News: “I just hate waste. I hate it passionately. We simply can’t afford to keep throwing things away like we do on our planet with finite resources.”More than 40 leading businesses have signed a commitment to the so-called Waste to Wealth summit. It’s organised by the Prince’s Business in the Community (BITC), which encourages responsible business.They are committing to devising creative solutions for re-using waste materials, and to designing products that use less material in the first place.The initiative will support the government’s forthcoming Waste and Resources Strategy, which is due before Christmas.Ministers are under pressure from waste campaigners to produce policies that minimise waste. They want the Treasury, for instance, to scrap VAT on refurbishment on homes.'Insane' tax break to demolish buildingsDuncan Baker-Brown, the architect of the Waste House, told BBC News: ""You pay 20% VAT to refurbish a building, but zero VAT to demolish and rebuild. There is a tax incentive to knock buildings down, which is frankly insane.""A survey of over 2,000 UK adults published today by BITC and Ipsos MORI shows consumers want to do their bit to reduce waste.The most popular actions from business to help consumers were:In 2014 the UK generated 202.8 million tonnes of total waste. 59.4% came from construction, demolition and excavation, with households responsible for a further 13.7%. – DEFRA.Amanda Mackenzie, chief executive of Business in the Community, said: “The old adage ‘waste not want not’ has never been more relevant.“The research shows that customers welcome action from business which encourages them to do the right thing. Let’s tackle this critical problem together and lead the world in doing so.”Some other nations are, in fact, well ahead of the UK in re-using items. Finland is one of many countries with sophisticated superstores for up-cycled and second-hand goods.In the UK, Devon County Council has taken a lead on the issue, and the website Freegle offers people the opportunity to give unwanted items away.Signatories to the BITC initiative so far include Co-Operative Bank, Deloitte, Greggs, Heineken, Iceland, Lloyds Banking Group, Marks & Spencer, PwC, Sky, Thames Water, Toyota, Costain, Arup, Marshalls, Unilever and Veolia.Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	UN environment chief Erik Solheim quits amid expenses row	Climate change jet-setterWhat did the audit say?	"UN environment chief Erik Solheim has resigned amid a row over his travel expenses.A recent draft internal audit, obtained by Britain's Guardian newspaper and seen by the BBC, said he had incurred costs of $488,518 (£382,111) while travelling for 529 out of 668 days.It said this harmed the reputation of UN Environment - a body that highlights green issues and sustainability.There was ""no oversight or accountability"" to monitor this travel.Mr Solheim, a Norwegian former environment minister, says he has paid back the money where ""instances of oversight"" occurred.On Tuesday, Mr Solheim himself confirmed his resignation, Norway's NRK broadcaster reported.A formal UN announcement is expected shortly.By Matt McGrath, BBC environment correspondentOnce news leaked about Erik Solheim's flights and expenses, he was on borrowed time at the UN. It wasn't solely because of the large sums involved - there was also an image problem.At a time when awareness of climate change has never been greater, the sight of the man dedicated to fighting global warming endlessly jet-setting around the world risked reputational damage to the UN.The auditor's report had also upset some European countries to such an extent that they had threatened to withhold millions of dollars in funding if he continued in post.While many in UN circles will be glad to see him go, some will miss the energy and greater visibility he brought to a once-lacklustre branch of the organisation.The amount spent on travel by UN Environment, a Kenya-based agency, doubled between 2014 and 2017.The report was particularly critical of the travel undertaken under Mr Solheim, UN Environment executive director since 2016. A total about $58m was spent in the two years since then.While all UN staff are expected to complete ""mission reports"" within two weeks of travel, the audit found that these were often missing.When they requested reports for 596 trips undertaken by 32 managers and staff, 210 mission reports were not provided, while around 200 others were only completed after the request was made.The audio was carried out by the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).It says Mr Solheim's leave and travel were approved by a member of his office who reported directly to him - in contravention of UN rules.On one occasion, it says, ""he made an eight-hour trip from Washington DC for a weekend in Paris, before taking another flight to New York city."""

science	Five products you didn't know were harming the environment	The contraceptive pillAvocadosPineapplesShampooAir fresheners	"Palau has become the first country to impose a widespread ban on sunscreen in order to protect its vulnerable coral reefs - but for many consumers this may be the first they have heard of the product's harmful effects.Researchers believe 10 chemical ingredients found in sunscreen are highly toxic to marine life, and can make coral more susceptible to bleaching.But sunscreen is far from the only household product having an adverse effect on the natural world.Here are five others you may not have been aware of.While the contraceptive pill may result in fewer humans inhabiting the planet - reducing the strain on natural resources - a 2016 Swedish study unearthed evidence of an unusual drawback.In her doctoral thesis at Lund University, Lina Nikoleris found the hormone ethinyl-estradiol (EE2) - a synthetic version of oestrogen found in birth control pills - was changing both the behaviour and genetics of some fish.When released into water as waste, EE2 was changing ""the genetic balance"" in fish such as salmon, trout and roach - which have more oestrogen receptors than humans.The study also found EE2 made it harder for the fish to catch food.""Previous studies have shown that the fish also develop problems with procreation,"" said Ms Nikoleris.""This can lead to the complete disappearance of an entire fish population, and consequences for entire ecosystems.""Bad news, avocado fans.Not only is your favourite breakfast component preventing you from getting on the housing ladder, it is also bad for the environment.The Water Footprint Network, which campaigns for more efficient water use, calculated that it took around 272 litres of water to grow a single avocado - with a potentially devastating effect on regions where it is grown.In 2011, an investigation by the Chilean water authority found at least 65 examples of avocado farms illegally diverting rivers and other water sources to their plantations.That, in turn, was blamed for causing droughts, forcing local villagers to choose between drinking and washing.Another UK supermarket favourite also leaves a sour taste in the mouth.The pineapple, which according to Tesco overtook the avocado as the fruit with the fastest-growing UK sales last year, is being grown at such a rate that it is having a detrimental impact on the environment in some parts of the world.In Costa Rica, one of the world's largest producers, thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared to make way for pineapples.The Costa Rican Conservationist Federation says complete forests have disappeared overnight, causing irreversible damage to the country.Pineapples are grown in vast monocultures - the intense production of only one crop - and require a large amount of pesticides, which can also be harmful for the environment.Palm oil is one of the most efficient and versatile vegetable oils on the planet - but its widespread use has led to significant deforestation.In a 2018 report, conservation group the WWF warned the conversion of tropical forests and peat land to palm oil plantations was releasing ""massive quantities of carbon dioxide, fuelling climate change, and destroying the habitat of species like orangutans"".While you may be aware of palm oil's presence in edible products such as chocolate, margarine, ice cream, bread and biscuits, fewer people know of its role in numerous household products.In shampoo, for example, palm oil is used as a form of conditioner to help maintain your hair's natural oils, which would otherwise be stripped away by chemicals.Palm oil is also found in products such as lipstick, washing detergents, hand soap and toothpaste.The dangerous levels of air pollution in the UK have been well publicised - but did you know that air fresheners could be part of the problem?A 2016 report, from the Royal College of Physicians, warned that it was not just outdoor air pollution which people needed to be wary of but also poor air quality in our homes, caused by everyday household products such as air fresheners.These often contain a chemical called limonene, which is commonly used to give a citrus smell - and is also used in food.It is not a chemical that poses a big hazard to health on its own but once released into the air it can become a problem.An experiment carried out by the BBC's Trust Me, I'm a Doctor show found that when limonene reacted with the ozone present in air, it produced formaldehyde.Everyday exposure to formaldehyde may contribute to increasing incidences of asthma and other illnesses.Links between formaldehyde and cancer were established in the 1980s, and since 2011 it's been listed as a known human carcinogen."
science	Brexit 'could damage UK environment'	Government promise	"The environment is still at risk of damage after Brexit, according to a cross-party group of 74 MPs and peers.They say personal reassurances by Environment Secretary Michael Gove are of no value without new legislation.Mr Gove has promised that the environment will be maintained or enhanced after the UK leaves the EU.The group of 74 want a new Clean Air Act. They say they fear that, following Brexit, the government will pass the buck on pollution to councils.They have outlined their concerns in a letter, which has been organised by Geraint Davies, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Air Pollution.He told BBC News: “Mr Gove talks the talk very impressively. But assurances are worth nothing until they are enacted.“If there’s no deal, then the UK will be on a cliff edge in March. The government failed to meet existing standards, but it will no longer be able to be taken to court.“It could easily pass the buck to local councils to transfer responsibility to them for tackling illegal air pollution.""Mr Davies also re-iterated a demand from a joint committee of MPs reporting on air pollution. They said motor manufacturers who have cheated emissions tests should be forced to pay into a clean air fund.“VW were fined heavily in the USA,” he said. “But here, Michael Gove is saying it's better for them to invest the money designing better engines. That doesn’t wash with us.”Mr Gove will reply to the letter shortly. But a spokesperson for his department said: “We will set out new primary legislation to secure a more coherent legislative framework for action to tackle air pollution.“This will be underpinned by new England-wide powers to control major sources of air pollution plus new local powers to take action in areas with a problem.""The government has launched a consultation on our proposals to establish a new, independent, statutory body to hold government to account on environmental standards once we have left the European Union, and on a new policy statement on environmental principles to apply following EU Exit.“We are consulting as widely as possible in order to gather views on different models and options before making any final decisions.”Mr Davies is unlikely to be assuaged by this response. He told us: “We have no idea how long Mr Gove will be in the department and we don’t know if he’ll get backing for legislation. We won’t believe it until we see it.”Follow Roger on Twitter."

science	Intensive farming 'least bad option' for food and environment	Fallow fields	"Intensive, high-yielding agriculture may be the best way to meet growing demand for food while conserving biodiversity, say researchers.But their study says the approach makes sense only if it is linked to more wilderness being spared the plough.Intensive farming is said to create high levels of pollution and damage the environment more than organic farming.However, this report suggests that contrary to perceptions, this is not necessarily the case.Organic groups though have rejected the report's findings.Around the world sales of organic produce have boomed over the past 20 years as consumers have bought into the idea that the approach is good not just for their health but for the good of the planet, as well.However, this study takes issue with that view.The researchers measured the environmental costs - including what they term ""externalities"", such as greenhouse gas emissions, fertiliser and water use - of producing a given amount of food on both high-yield and low-yield farms.Working with scientists in 17 organisations from around the globe, they analysed information from hundreds of investigations into four large food areas - Asian paddy rice, European wheat, Latin American beef and European dairy.While the data available is limited, the researchers concluded that many high-yield systems are less damaging to the environment and use less land.""If we are serious about keeping most of the species with which we share the planet, we are going to have to make the best use of the farmland we've already got rather than continue to expand,"" said lead author Prof Andrew Balmford, from the University of Cambridge.""And that means we are going to have to get smart about high-yield agriculture.""The authors say the world needs to reduce consumption of beef and other high-impact foodstuffs if we are to have a sustainable future - but they believe their study shows that producing these materials with less land may be the best way of making space for nature and may also have fewer environmental costs than lower-yielding systems.""We are certainly not pro conventional agriculture business as usual,"" said Prof Balmford. ""'We're just pro looking at the numbers, and the numbers tell us that most biodiversity can't survive on any sort of farm.""When it comes to organic dairy farming in Europe, the researchers found that for the production of the same volume of milk, organic systems took up twice as much land and caused at least one-third more soil loss than conventional dairy farming.""Across all dairy systems we find that higher milk yield per unit of land generally leads to greater biological and economic efficiency of production,"" said co-author Prof Phil Garnsworthy, from the University of Nottingham,""Dairy farmers should welcome the news that more efficient systems have lower environmental impact.""One key element of this report is the link between intensive farming and leaving more land for wilderness.The authors say there are various mechanisms that can be put in place to encourage farmers to take land out of production and reward them for the ""public good"" element that their lands provide, such as stemming the flow of floodwater, or absorbing carbon dioxide.Environment Secretary Michael Gove has made this idea a key element of his proposed reforms for agriculture funding in the UK in the wake of Brexit.Prof Balmford supports the approach.""Land owners do produce very significant public goods that the market doesn't reward them for. Using some of the subsidy to do that offers considerable promise.""Organic group though are not impressed with the study's conclusions. They argue that the world produces enough food already and that the issues with feeding populations are economic and political, not agricultural.""When the environmental and other damages caused by high energy and chemical inputs in non-organic are factored in - some of which the report's authors did not take into account - the research we've seen to date shows organic farming is more beneficial to society,"" said a spokesman for the UK's Soil Association.""Organic methods show that it is possible to have long-term sustainable food production and environmental conservation; supporting 50% higher abundance of wildlife than non-organic and higher standards of animal welfare, while improving soil health and supporting soils to capture up to 450kg more carbon per hectare.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Sustainability."
science	Secrets of the largest ape that ever lived	Human evolution hopesExtinction clues	"A fossilised tooth left behind by the largest ape that ever lived is shedding new light on the evolution of apes.Gigantopithecus blacki was thought to stand nearly three metres tall and tip the scales at 600kg.In an astonishing advance, scientists have obtained molecular evidence from a two-million-year-old fossil molar tooth found in a Chinese cave.The mystery ape is a distant relative of orangutans, sharing a common ancestor around 12 million years ago.""It would have been a distant cousin (of orangutans), in the sense that its closest living relatives are orangutans, compared to other living great apes such as gorillas or chimpanzees or us,"" said Dr Frido Welker, from the University of Copenhagen.The research, reported in Nature, is based on comparing the ancient protein sequence of the tooth of the extinct ape, believed to be a female, with apes alive today.Obtaining skeletal protein from a two-million-year-old fossil is rare if not unprecedented, raising hopes of being able to look even further back in time at other ancient ancestors, including humans, who lived in warmer regions.There is a much poorer chance of being able to find ancient DNA or proteins in tropical climates, where samples tend to degrade quicker.""This study suggests that ancient proteins might be a suitable molecule surviving across most of recent human evolution even for areas like Africa or Asia and we could thereby in the future study our own evolution as a species over a very long time span,"" Dr Welker told BBC News.Gigantopithecus blacki was first identified in 1935 based on a single tooth sample. The ape is thought to have lived in Southeast Asia from two million years ago to 300,000 years ago.Many teeth and four partial jawbones have been identified but the animal's relationship to other great ape species has been hard to decipher.The ape reached massive proportions, exceeding that of living gorillas, based on analysis of the few bones that have been found.It is thought to have gone extinct when the environment changed from forest to savannah.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Supernova 1987A: 'Blob' hides long-sought remnant from star blast		"Scientists believe they've finally tracked down the dead remnant from Supernova 1987A - one of their favourite star explosions.Astronomers knew the object must exist but had always struggled to identify its location because of a shroud of obscuring dust.Now, a UK-led team thinks the remnant's hiding place can be pinpointed from the way it's been heating up that dust.The researchers refer to the area of interest as ""the blob"".""It's so much hotter than its surroundings, the blob needs some explanation. It really stands out from its neighbouring dust clumps,"" Prof Haley Gomez from Cardiff University told BBC News.""We think it's being heated by the hot neutron star created in the supernova.""When telescopes first spotted the explosion in 1987, it caused huge excitement.Sited in the Large Magellanic Cloud, some 168,000 light-years from Earth - the blast was the nearest, brightest supernova seen in the night sky in 400 years.As such, it's become the test case for what we think we know about stars when their fuel runs out and they suffer a cataclysmic collapse.Three decades on, astronomers routinely observe Supernova 1987A and its constantly developing form.It is a thing of beauty: it has a series of bright rings that represent bands of gas and dust thrown out by the star in its dying phases and which have since been excited by the expanding shockwaves emitted in the end-moment explosion.One of these rings looks like a string of pearls, and it's at the centre of this celestial jewellery that the scientists reckon they've now located the star remnant.It should be a dense object composed entirely of neutron particles and measuring just a few tens of kilometres across. The thick cloud of dust in which it sits, however, is perhaps 30 times the size of our Solar System and this makes the neutron star impossible to see directly.""We see the recycled light, if you like. The hot neutron star heats the dust grains and as they absorb that energy - they shine at sub-millimetre wavelengths. That's what we detect,"" explained Prof Gomez.The team has been probing the area of interest using data from Europe's now defunct Herschel space telescope and the international Atacama Large Millimeter Array (Alma) facility in Chile.What Alma in particular reveals is that the blob also resides in a region deficient in carbon monoxide (CO) molecules. The CO is being destroyed, presumably in the same heating process that's making the dust shine.Unfortunately, it's difficult to be more descriptive about the neutron star because of its dust shroud, but the group expects this to change with time.In maybe 50 to 100 years, the dust should clear to reveal the object's true guise.A paper detailing the new findings is published in The Astrophysical Journal. Its lead author is Cardiff's Dr Phil Cigan.He told BBC News: ""The amazing thing about [Supernova 1987A] is that we are watching the changes in real time, seeing how it evolves over months and years. It's like watching the plot develop in the acts of a play.""By monitoring its progress, we can compare the reality to what different models predict, and we are eagerly anticipating seeing the direct radiation from the neutron star when the dust thins out.""Astronomers are interested in supernovas because they are integral to the evolution of the Universe.The explosions stir up the environment, nudging nearby gas clouds to gravitationally fall in on themselves and birth new stars. The dust ejected in supernovas also seeds the cosmos with the heavier elements that go into building rocky planets."
science	Changing environment influenced human evolution	The world turned upside downThe obsidian roadHuman origins	"Humans may have developed advanced social behaviours and trade 100,000 years earlier than previously thought.This is according to a series of papers published today in Science.The results come from an archaeological site in Kenya's rift valley. ""Over one million years of time"" is represented at the site, according to Rick Potts from the Smithsonian Institution, who was involved in the studies.There are also signs of developments in toolmaking technologies.Environmental change may have been a key influence in this evolution of early Homo sapiens in the region of the Olorgesailie dig site.Early humans were in the area for about 700,000 years, making large hand axes from nearby stone, explained Dr Potts.""[Technologically], things changed very slowly, if at all, over hundreds of thousands of years,"" he said.Then, roughly 500,000 years ago, something did change.A period of tectonic upheaval and erratic climate conditions swept across the region, and there is a 180,000 year interruption in the geological record due to erosion.It was not only the landscape that altered, but also the plant and animal life in the region - transforming the resources available to our early ancestors.When the record resumes, the way of life of these early humans has completely changed.""The speed of the transition is really remarkable,"" Dr Potts said. ""Sometime in that [gap] there was a switch, a very rapid period of evolution.""New tools appeared at this time - small, sharp blades and points made from obsidian, a dark volcanic glass.This technology marks the transition to what is known as the Middle Stone Age, explained Dr Eleanor Scerri from the University of Oxford.Rather than shaping a block of rock, into a hand axe, humans became interested in the sharp flakes that could be chipped off. These were mounted on spears and used as projectile weapons.Where 98% of the rock previously used by people in the Olorgesailie area had come from within a 5km radius, there were no sources of obsidian nearby.People were travelling from 25km to 95km across rugged terrain to obtain the material, and ""interacting with other groups of early humans over that time period"", according to Dr Potts.This makes the site the earliest known example of such long distance transport, and possibly of trade.There is additional evidence that the inhabitants, who would likely have lived in small groups of 20-25 people, also used pigments like ochre. It is unclear whether these were merely practical or had a ritual social application.Dr Marta Mirazon Lahr from the University of Cambridge said that being able to ""securely date"" the continuous occupation of the site using argon techniques on volcanic deposits ""makes Olorgesailie a key reference site for understanding human evolution in Africa during [this period]"".Dr Scerri, who was not involved in the studies, emphasised that they are valuable in implying that ""Middle Stone Age technology emerged at the same time in both eastern and northwestern Africa.""Prof Chris Stringer from the Natural History Museum agrees.""This makes me think that the Middle Stone Age probably already existed in various parts of Africa by 315,000 years ago, rather than originating in one place at that time and then spreading,"" he said.While the behaviours exhibited at the Kenya site are characteristic of Homo sapiens, there are as yet no fossils associated with this time period and location.The oldest known Homo sapiens fossils were discovered in Morocco, and are dated to between 300,000 and 350,000 years old.For more on this story, listen to Science in Action on the World Service on Thursday 20:30 GMT, or catch up on iPlayer."
science	Environment prize goes to Flint water activist	Corrosive supply	"The founder of a citizens' movement that helped expose the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, is one of the recipients of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize.Nearly 100,000 residents of Flint were left without safe tap water after lead began leaching into the supply.Mother of four LeeAnne Walters led a citizens' movement that tested the tap water to expose the health threat.Tests showed lead levels in her water were seven times the acceptable limit.In 2014, the water in Ms Walters' home turned brownish and she noticed rashes on her three-year-old twins. Her daughters' hair then fell out in clumps.Women who stopped SA nuclear deal win prizeWalters spent months reading technical documents about the Flint water system. She then teamed up with environmental engineer Dr Marc Edwards, from Virginia Tech, who helped her conduct extensive water testing in the city.She methodically sampled each zip code in Flint and set up a system to ensure the integrity of the tests, working over 100 hours per week for three weeks.They showed lead levels as high as 13,200 parts per billion in some parts of the city - more than twice the level classified as hazardous waste by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The contamination was traced to the city switching its water supply away from Detroit's system, which draws from Lake Huron, and beginning instead to draw water from the Flint River.Flint was in a financial state of emergency and this switch was meant to save the city millions of dollars.But the water from the Flint River was more corrosive than Lake Huron's water and the pipes began leaching lead, which is a powerful neurotoxin.The city has since switched back to using Detroit's water system. But Flint continues to wrestle with the aftermath of the crisis, and pipe replacement is ongoing.In their citation, the jurors praised Ms Walters' ""inquisitive, persistent, and logical mind"", adding: ""Her communal spirit and powerful moral compass proved equally critical to her ability to reach and organize Flint residents and experts alike.""Ms Walters is this year's recipient from North America, but the prize is also awarded to activists from several other global regions.They include France's Claire Nouvian who led a data-driven campaign against what she and many other activists regarded as the destructive practice of deep sea bottom trawling. Her actions helped secure French support for a ban on the practice.Another of this year's winners, Khanh Nguy Thi, worked with state agencies in Vietnam to reduce the country's reliance on coal for electricity generation."
science	Risk of water shortages for England warns Environment Agency		"England is facing water supply shortages by 2050 unless rapid action is taken to curb water use and wastage, the Environment Agency has warned.Its new report says enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people is lost through leakage every day.Population growth and the impact of climate change are expected to add to supply pressures.The agency wants people to have a personal water target and has urged them to use water more wisely at home.The study, the first major report on water resources in England, says that population growth and climate change are the biggest pressures on a system that is already struggling.In 2016, some 9,500 billion litres of freshwater were taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and underground sources, with 55% of this used by public water companies, and 27% going to the electricity supply industry.But in addition to the 3 billion litres a day that are wasted through leakage, there is a considerable price being paid in terms of the sustainability of these supplies.According to the Environment Agency, extraction of groundwater - the water beneath the earth's surface - is not at a sustainable level for 28% of groundwater bodies and up to 18% of surface waters.A year earlier in 2016, unsustainable extraction meant that at least 6% and possibly up to 15% of river water bodies did not achieve ""a good ecological status or potential"".The majority of chalk streams also failed to meet that standard, with over extraction of water being responsible in a quarter of the streams that were tested.""We need to change our attitudes to water use,"" said Emma Howard Boyd, the Environment Agency chair woman.""It is the most fundamental thing needed to ensure a healthy environment, but we are taking too much of it and have to work together to manage this precious resource.""Addressing the questions of how to reduce the amount of water that is being used, Michael Roberts, from Water UK, said water companies were tackling the question head-on.""It's actually everyone's issue,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""In the home we have to do our bit and as companies we have to do our bit - but the good news is that domestic consumption has been coming down for the last decade, and in terms of leakage, we are leaking a third less than we did 30 years ago, but there is a heck of a lot more to do.""On average, people use 140 litres every day in England. The Environment Agency says it will work with government and industry to establish a personal consumption target and come up with cost-effective measures to meet it.The government has already suggested that an individual's water use be reduced, in its 25-year plan, published earlier this year.The water industry says that three quarters of water used in the home goes towards washing ourselves, our clothes and how we flush the toilet. Greater awareness could help cut that amount significantly.""We'd love to see a really ambitious target of per capita consumption per day,"" Nicci Russell from Waterwise, who campaign for water efficiency, told the BBC.""It's around about 140 litres per day and we'd like to see it at 100 or less, we think that's perfectly do-able over the next 20-25 years.""But Environment Minister George Eustice has told BBC Radio 5 live that the proposed Environment Agency household water guidelines are ""not a cap"" and that ""nobody need worry that we're shutting off the taps"".""It's more a target really to encourage individual households to think about their water, to encourage the use of, for instance, flushing systems on toilets that are more economical in the way they use water, and basically get the types of innovation that we need within households over a period of time, so that we are using water more carefully.""The big questions for the future, according to the Environment Agency, are the impacts of climate change and population growth.Rising temperatures will affect the timing and amount of rainfall that flows into rivers and replenishes groundwater supplies.Although average summer rainfall is not predicted to change, more rainfall is likely to occur in large downpours in the future, increasing the chances of droughts and floods happening at the same time.The report warns that reduced summer rain and increased evaporation might damage wetland areas.Increased areas of stagnant water during droughts coupled with increased temperatures could see the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus.The population of England is predicted to increase to 58.5 million by 2026 - the report says that much of this increase is likely to take place in areas where water supplies are already stressed.If no action is taken to reduce use and increase supply of water, ""most areas will not meet demand by the 2050s"" if both emissions and population growth are high.Even low population growth and modest climate change ""suggest significant water supply deficits by the 2050s, particularly in the South East"".The National Infrastructure Commission has already suggested that moving water from north to south should be considered as part of future development.""Today's report reflects our own findings, that the country faces the real risk of drought and that we need to take urgent action now to address it - by reducing demand, as well as by increasing supply, said Sir John Armitt, who chairs the commission.""Our recommendations include the need for a new National Water Network, to help move supplies from areas with water surpluses to those in greatest need.""But there must be a concerted effort by industry to encourage consumers to use water more efficiently - and with a fifth of our mains water lost to leakages, they must also take steps to halve the amount lost this way by 2050.""Investment in nuclear power and renewable energy will likely lead to much lower rates of abstraction and consumption by 2050, the study says.However, if future energy scenarios involve carbon capture and storage (CCS), this would require much higher freshwater abstraction and consumption levels, as the technology needs extra water to function, and would also increase the amount of cooling water needed at conventional power plants to which CCS equipment is attached."
science	Electric car future may depend on deep sea mining	What is 'deep sea mining'?Why would anyone bother?So what are the risks?Could deep sea mining be made less damaging?Who decides if it goes ahead?	"The future of electric cars may depend on mining critically important metals on the ocean floor.That's the view of the engineer leading a major European investigation into new sources of key elements.Demand is soaring for the metal cobalt - an essential ingredient in batteries and abundant in rocks on the seabed.Laurens de Jonge, who's running the EU project, says the transition to electric cars means ""we need those resources"".He was speaking during a unique set of underwater experiments designed to assess the impact of extracting rocks from the ocean floor.In calm waters 15km off the coast of Malaga in southern Spain, a prototype mining machine was lowered to the seabed and 'driven' by remote control.Cameras attached to the Apollo II machine recorded its progress and, crucially, monitored how the aluminium tracks stirred up clouds of sand and silt as they advanced.Did deep sea mining start with CIA plot?An array of instruments was positioned nearby to measure how far these clouds were carried on the currents - the risk of seabed mining smothering marine life over a wide area is one of the biggest concerns.It's hard to visualise, but imagine opencast mining taking place at the bottom of the ocean, where huge remote-controlled machines would excavate rocks from the seabed and pump them up to the surface.The concept has been talked about for decades, but until now it's been thought too difficult to operate in the high-pressure, pitch-black conditions as much as 5km deep.Now the technology is advancing to the point where dozens of government and private ventures are weighing up the potential for mines on the ocean floor.The short answer: demand. The rocks of the seabed are far richer in valuable metals than those on land and there's a growing clamour to get at them.Billions of potato-sized rocks known as ""nodules"" litter the abyssal plains of the Pacific and other oceans and many are brimming with cobalt, suddenly highly sought after as the boom in the production of batteries gathers pace.At the moment, most of the world's cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo where for years there've been allegations of child labour, environmental damage and widespread corruption.Expanding production there is not straightforward which is leading mining companies to weigh the potential advantages of cobalt on the seabed.Laurens de Jonge, who's in charge of the EU project, known as Blue Nodules, said: ""It's not difficult to access - you don't have to go deep into tropical forests or deep into mines.""It's readily available on the seafloor, it's almost like potato harvesting only 5km deep in the ocean.""And he says society faces a choice: there may in future be alternative ways of making batteries for electric cars - and some manufacturers are exploring them - but current technology requires cobalt.""If you want to make a fast change, you need cobalt quick and you need a lot of it - if you want to make a lot of batteries you need the resources to do that.""His view is backed by a group of leading scientists at London's Natural History Museum and other institutions.They recently calculated that meeting the UK's targets for electric cars by 2050 would require nearly twice the world's current output of cobalt.No one can be entirely sure, which makes the research off Spain highly relevant.It's widely accepted that whatever is in the path of the mining machines will be destroyed - there's no argument about that.But what's uncertain is how far the damage will reach, in particular the size of the plumes of silt and sand churned up and the distance they will travel, potentially endangering marine life far beyond the mining site.The chief scientist on board, Henko de Stigter of the Dutch marine research institute NIOZ, points out that life in the deep Pacific - where mining is likely to start first - has adapted to the usually ""crystal clear conditions"".So for any organisms feeding by filter, waters that are suddenly filled with stirred-up sediment would be threatening.""Many species are unknown or not described, and let alone do we know how they will respond to this activity - we can only estimate.""And Dr de Stigter warned of the danger of doing to the oceans what humanity has done to the land.""With every new human activity it's often difficult to foresee all the consequences of that in the long term.""What is new here is that we are entering an environment that is almost completely untouched.""Ralf Langeler thinks so. He's the engineer in charge of the Apollo II mining machine and he believes the design will minimise any impacts.Like Laurens de Jonge, he works for the Dutch marine engineering giant Royal IHC and he says his technology can help reduce the environmental effects.The machine is meant to cut a very shallow slice into the top 6-10cm of the seabed, lifting the nodules. Its tracks are made with lightweight aluminium to avoid sinking too far into the surface.Silt and sand stirred up by the extraction process should then be channelled into special vents at the rear of the machine and released in a narrow stream, to try to avoid the plume spreading too far.""We'll always change the environment, that's for sure,"" Ralf says, ""but that's the same with onshore mining and our purpose is to minimise the impact.""I ask him if deep sea mining is now a realistic prospect.""One day it's going to happen, especially with the rising demand for special metals - and they're there on the sea floor.""Mining in territorial waters can be approved by an individual government.That happened a decade ago when Papua New Guinea gave the go-ahead to a Canadian company, Nautilus Minerals, to mine gold and copper from hydrothermal vents in the Bismarck Sea.Since then the project has been repeatedly delayed as the company ran short of funds and the prime minister of PNG called for a 10-year moratorium on deep sea mining.A Nautilus Minerals representative has told me that the company is being restructured and that they remain hopeful of starting to mine.Meanwhile, nearly 30 other ventures are eyeing areas of ocean floor beyond national waters, and these are regulated by a UN body, the International Seabed Authority (ISA).It has issued licences for exploration and is due next year to publish the rules that would govern future mining.The EU's Blue Nodules project involves a host of different institutions and countries.The vessel used for the underwater research off Spain, the Sarmiento de Gamboa, is operated by CSIC, the Spanish National Research Council.Follow David on Twitter."
science	Renewable energy: Rise in global wind speed to boost green power		"A new study suggests that global wind speeds have increased substantially since 2010 after decades of decline.Scientists say they believe that changes in the patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation are behind the rise.The researchers say the discovery is very good news for the wind energy industry.They believe that speedier winds will see the energy produced by a single turbine grow by about 37%.From the 1980s, scientists detected a marked decrease in the speed of winds around the world.Termed ""terrestrial stilling"", the decline was large enough that had it continued until the end of this century, global wind speed would have declined by 21%.The authors of the study say this would have halved the amount of power available from the wind industry.Scientists were uncertain as to what was causing the decline. One theory argued that the greening of the Earth or more urbanisation was increasing surface roughness and curbing wind speeds.But this new study suggests that by itself, the roughness idea is not enough to explain the changes.By looking at data from 9,000 ground weather stations combined with statistical models, the researchers show that over the years since 2010, winds have picked up ""significantly"" around the globe.The rate of speed increase is in fact three times greater than the rate at which the winds were declining before 2010.The authors believe that the reason for the increase is more to do with changes in the ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns and not down to surface roughness alone.""By ocean atmospheric circulation, we mean heating of the Earth's surface which creates pressure gradients and thereby wind,"" said co-author Dr Adrian Chappell from the University of Cardiff, UK.""Changes in these circulations have changed wind speeds. The alternative and/or contributing cause of change in wind speed is due to change in land surface roughness. It is very unlikely that change in roughness alone has caused the change in wind speeds. It remains plausible that the combination of large-scale circulation and change in roughness has caused the change in wind speed.""The finding helps explain an increase in the capacity factor of the US wind fleet which has risen at a rate of 7% per decade.It had been assumed that technological innovation was behind the improvement but according to the new study, 50% of the rise is due to increasing wind speeds.Overall, the finding is ""good news"" for the wind energy industry, the authors say.""The reversal in global terrestrial stilling bodes well for the expansion of large-scale and efficient wind power generation systems in these mid-latitude countries in the near future,"" Dr Chappell said.If the trends persist for the next decade, wind power from a single turbine would rise to 3.3 million kilowatt hours in 2024, an overall increase of 37%.The authors believe the increase in wind speeds will decline again in future but will persist for at least the next 10 years.The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Telescope tracks 35 million galaxies in Dark Energy hunt	What is Dark Energy?What will the new project examine?How does Dark Energy push the Universe apart?But could the answer lie elsewhere?	"A super telescope has begun the most detailed survey of the Universe ever undertaken.The aim of the five-year programme is to shed light on Dark Energy - the mysterious force thought to drive an accelerated expansion of the Universe.The instrument effectively contains 5,000 mini-telescopes. Each one can image a galaxy every 20 minutes.In just one year scientists will have surveyed more galaxies than all the other telescopes in the world combined.The Big Bang theory of the creation of the Universe originally predicted that its expansion would slow down, and that it would possibly begin to contract as a result of the pull of gravity.However, in 1998, astronomers were shocked to discover that not only was the Universe continuing to expand, but that this expansion was also accelerating.The most widely held view is that something is counteracting the pull of gravity - and that something has been termed Dark Energy.It has been calculated that Dark Energy makes up most of the Universe. Indeed, the atoms that build planets, stars and galaxies probably account for just 5%.Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, is taking part in the project. He said scientists still knew next to nothing about Dark Energy 20 years after its discovery.""It is just embarrassing to live in a Universe where you only know 5% of it,"" he told BBC News.""The nature of Dark Energy, and what it is, may well lead to a revolution in physics - the whole of physics!""An international team of researchers will use a device called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). It has been retrofitted on to the 4m Mayall telescope at the Kitt Peak observatory in Arizona, US.Inside DESI are 5,000 optical fibres, each acting as a mini-telescope. This enables the instrument to capture light from 5,000 different galaxies simultaneously, precisely to map their distance from Earth, and gauge how much the Universe expanded as this light travelled to Earth.In ideal conditions, DESI can cycle through a new set of 5,000 galaxies every 20 minutes.The further DESI looks into space, the further back in time it sees. This is because of the time it takes for light to reach Earth. The instrument can see objects 10 billion light-years away, which are therefore 10 billion years in the past.There have been other similar projects, but DESI will cover a much larger volume of space and will measure the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe three times more accurately than ever before.The team has drawn on previous surveys to create a guide map of the Universe from which 35 million galaxies will be selected as targets for DESI.The key seems to be a force called vacuum pressure which is caused by fluctuations in the fabric of space-time at a sub-atomic level.Calculations suggest that this vacuum pressure should be an unimaginably larger number (1 with 120 zeroes after it) than the force astronomers actually see pushing galaxies apart.One possibility is that the vacuum pressure was much, much larger in the early Universe and now has dwindled to its current level.If, however, astronomers discover that the vacuum pressure has stayed the same, then some more speculative theories come into play.One suggests that our Universe is one of many in a massive ""multiverse"". Ours has a tiny vacuum pressure while others may have the much larger pressure.But matter - and ultimately life - can only exist in a Universe like ours, with a low vacuum pressure.Another possibility is that the current theory of gravity is incomplete. Unlike other fundamental forces, it does not have an opposite force - akin to the positive and negative charges of electricity.DESI is able to test the current theory of gravity, developed by Albert Einstein more than 100 years ago, in unprecedented detail because it can see so far back into the past.Astronomers will be able to see, blow by blow and in exquisite detail, how gravity operated over that time to bring together particles to form the planets, stars and galaxies we see.This ""movie"" will enable cosmologists to check if Einstein's theory of gravity and space-time (General Relativity) is correct. If not then the concept of Dark Energy might not be required. Instead, what would be needed is a more complete theory of gravity that explains the accelerating Universe.The DESI Collaboration involves researchers at 25 institutions from the US, UK, France, Switzerland, and Spain.Follow Pallabon Twitter"
science	Amazon fires intensify Andes glacier melt	How can fires in the rainforest affect glaciers hundreds of miles away?What could the impact of this be?	"Smoke from burning forests in the Amazon can intensify glacier melt, researchers say, fuelling concern about a water crisis in South America.The team found evidence that snow and ice was being ""darkened"", accelerating the melt rate, threatening supplies.Melting tropical glaciers provide water for millions of people in the region.Scientists modelled the movement and effect of smoke particles from fires on Andean glaciers, and checked their conclusions against satellite images.And they say the impact will be felt across the continent.Dr Newton de Magalhães Neto from Rio de Janeiro State University in Brazil, said: ""Amazon deforestation and fires - events that occur mainly in Bolivia, Peru and Brazil - cannot be considered a regional issue.""They have social implications at the continental scale, [because] accelerating the loss of glaciers increases the risk of a water crisis and the vulnerability of several Andean communities in response to climate change.""The first thing the study, published in Scientific Reports, set out to do was show that smoke plumes from forest fires in the Amazon could actually reach glaciers in the Andes mountains.The study, led by Dr de Magalhães Neto, focused the research on two years - 2007 and 2010 - when many more fires than usual burned in the Amazon rainforest.Atmospheric data showed that smoke from those fires - particularly particles of black carbon - were carried on wind and deposited on mountain glaciers.The study focused on one specific glacier - Zongo Glacier in Bolivia.Dr de Magalhães Neto said: ""Once deposited on the glacier, the [black carbon darkens] the snow/ice surface, which reduces its ability to reflect solar radiation - or sunlight.""That darkened surface then absorbs more of the sun's energy, which amplifies melting.While the findings were significant, the researchers said they did not come as a huge surprise: the same process has been seen elsewhere in the world.""Greenland receives large amounts of black carbon from fossil-fuel origin due to North America and European industrialisation,"" said Dr de Magalhães Neto. ""And black carbon from the burning of fossil fuels and biomass throughout the northern hemisphere has accelerated glacier melting in the Arctic.""In the tropical Andes, communities across the continent rely on melting glaciers for their water supply, which means the impact will be felt over an enormous area.Dr Ryan Wilson, from the University of Huddersfield, has studied the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Andes for five years. He said the study demonstrated the long-distance impacts of Amazon fires.""This raises awareness of an additional factor that may [have an] impact [on] glacier melting in the tropical Andes,"" he said.But he added: ""[Since] this study only looks at one glacier, further investigations are needed to understand the impact at a regional scale.""Follow Victoria on Twitter"
science	Nuclear: Energy bills 'used to subsidise submarines'		"Energy bills in the UK are inflated partly because households are subsidising nuclear submarines, MPs have been told.Experts think one government motive for backing civilian nuclear power is to cross-subsidise the defence industry.They say nuclear power is so expensive that it should be scrapped in favour of much cheaper renewable energy.Others argue that nuclear still plays a key role in keeping on the lights, so the military aspect is not significant.But in evidence to MPs on the Business Select Committee, researchers from the University of Sussex said the government should be frank about the inter-dependence of the civilian nuclear programme and the nuclear defence industry.Supply chainProf Andy Stirling from Sussex argues that one reason the government is willing to burden householders with the expense of nuclear energy is because it underpins the supply chain and skills base for firms such as Rolls Royce and Babcock that work on nuclear submarines.He said: “It is clear that the costs of maintaining nuclear submarine capabilities are insupportable without parallel consumer-funded civil nuclear infrastructures.“The accelerating competitiveness of renewable energy and declining viability of nuclear power are making this continuing dependency increasingly difficult to conceal.”Rolls Royce, which makes reactors for nuclear submarines, has been pressing the government to agree a fleet of small modular reactors for power generation in the UK. This civilian technology would be transferable to submarines.'Persuasive' evidenceA spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: ""We believe having a diverse energy mix is the best way of ensuing energy security while allowing us to meet our climate commitments.""Nuclear has an important role to play as we transition to a low-carbon economy, but as with any technology, it must represent good value for money for the taxpayer and consumer.""A committee source told BBC News the researchers' evidence appeared persuasive and well-researched.The committee is expected to release the evidence in coming days as it prepares to discuss whether the UK really needs nuclear power for energy security.The debate has taken on greater significance as the true costs of nuclear power have been revealed.It was once forecast that nuclear energy would be too cheap to meter. But it's clear now that bill-payers will give price support to the Hinkley Point C nuclear station at a cost of £92.50 per megawatt hour, compared with the cheapest agreed future subsidy of £57.50 for offshore wind.Ministers expect that, before long, wind energy will operate without support.Prof Stirling says the issue of nuclear inter-dependence is addressed openly in the US.In 2017, the former US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz (a nuclear scientist) said: “A strong domestic (nuclear) supply chain is needed to provide for Navy requirements. This has a very strong overlap with commercial nuclear energy.”Prof Stirling told BBC News: ""We need this sort of transparency in the UK.""Catch-22But the government faces a Catch-22 situation on this issue.If it continues to decline to admit the inter-dependence of civil and military nuclear, it will stand accused of hiding a self-evident truth.But if it accepts that decisions on nuclear power are influenced with half an eye on manufacturing jobs and nuclear deterrent, it will face resistance from consumer groups unwilling to cross-subsidise submarines.The MPs’ hearing is timely, as the government will shortly publish an energy white paper outlining how the UK will supply electricity in a zero carbon economy.Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Water and green energy produced by a single device		"Researchers have found a way to purify water and produce electricity from a single device powered by sunlight.The scientists adapted a solar panel that not only generated power, but used some of the heat energy to distil and purify sea water.They believe the idea could make a major difference in sunny climates with limited water supplies.The lead author expects that a commercial device could be available in five years.Clean energy and clean water are among the major challenges for sustainable development especially in emerging countries. But traditional approaches to electricity generation consume huge amounts of water. In the US and Europe about 50% of water withdrawals are for energy production.Similarly, producing water for humans via desalination in countries with water scarcity is a huge consumer of energy. It's estimated that in Arab countries around 15% of electricity production is used to produce drinking water.Now, researchers believe they have found a way to combine these actions in a single device.Existing state-of-the-art solar panels face physical limits on the amount of sunlight they can actually turn into electricity. Normally about 10-20% of the sun that hits the panel becomes power. The rest of this heat is considered as waste.In this experiment, the scientists designed a three stage membrane distillation unit and attached it to the back of the photovoltaic (PV) panel.The membrane essentially evaporates seawater at relatively low temperatures. The researchers were able to produce three times more water than conventional solar stills while also generating electricity with an efficiency greater than 11%. This meant the device was generating nine times more power than had been achieved in previously published research.""The waste heat from PV panels has really been ignored, no one has thought about it as a resource,"" said lead author Prof Peng Wang from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.""We use the heat to generate water vapour that gets transported across the membrane and then it condenses on the other side.""""Because it is a multiple stage distillation device, it also allows the latent heat in the condensation to be utilised to drive the second cycle of water evaporation. So that is why we can get a very high fresh water production rate by this device.""According to the authors if the technology was scaled up and used globally, it could, in theory, produce 10% of the total amount of drinking water consumed in 2017.However there are many tricky steps to go through to develop and commercialise this type of device. There are some inherent drawbacks in that it needs a large area of land to collect enough solar light to be effective at producing water.""It can be used for coastal areas as long as you are not talking about delivering drinking water for a city of over one million people,"" said Prof Wang.""It is a suitable technology to deliver drinking water at the small to medium scale,"" he explained.The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

Ramping up renewablesCoal dominance continuesCement and steel - 'real challenges'Un-used electricityRenewables pricingLow per capita emissions	"India's major political parties competing in the ongoing general elections have pledged free electricity to farmers, ambitious infrastructure projects and rapid expansion of the manufacturing sector. What impact could this have on carbon emissions in India, already the world's third largest CO2 producer?Hundreds of lorries each day haul tens of thousands of tonnes of coal out of massive open cast mines in the Korba district, Chhatisgarh state in central India.At night, the place illuminates with so much light that one can see plumes of smoke coming out of coal-fired power plants - just like in daylight.This is India's major power hub, with Chhatisgarh providing almost 25% of the country's electricity.More than 70% of it comes from coal burning, according to independent think tanks and global energy agencies. The Indian government puts the figure at below 55%.""Coal-fired power plants have always received the government's backing,"" says Sunil Dahiya, clean energy and climate campaigner with Greenpeace.""And coal demand is not going to decrease right now.""Andhra Pradesh, the state just south of Chhatisgarh, has a solar park that until recently was the world's largest.With 4.5 million solar panels installed in an area of 6,000 acres (2,430ha), the park has a capacity of 1,000 MegaWatts (MW).There are other similar parks, and new ones are being built.India says its renewable energy capacity reached 70 GigaWatts (GW) last year.The country now ranks fourth in the world in wind power-based capacity and sixth in solar. The government's target is to reach 175 GW by 2022.Under the Paris climate agreement, India has committed to reduce the CO2 emission intensity of its GDP by 33-35% below 2005 levels by 2030.The world's second largest populous country emitted 2.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2018 - a nearly 5% rise on the previous year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says.About 90% of India's energy still comes from fossil fuels and nearly two thirds of that from coal - the dirtiest of fossil fuels.Nearly 70% of India's CO2 emissions come from the energy sector and more than two thirds of that is electricity generation.The British Petroleum is forecasting that coal's share in India's power mix will increase by roughly 10% by 2040.""Renewable energy consumption surges from 20 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) today to 300 Mtoe by 2040 - concentrated mainly in the power sector and driven largely by growth in solar capacity,"" the BP says.""Yet despite this growth in renewables, coal continues to dominate India's power generation mix, accounting for 80% of output by 2040.""Some energy experts believe election promises could lead to more coal-burning and increased emissions.""On one hand, the country is so aggressive on renewables, on the other hand, political parties are promising free electricity to farmers,"" says Srinivas Krishnaswamy, chief executive officer of Vasudha, an NGO that works in the area of energy and climate policies.""That makes me doubt that the country's dependence on coal is going to go away.""Since the middle of this decade, India has said it will double coal production to one billion tonnes by 2020. This is on top of what India imports from countries like Australia and Indonesia.The import increased to nearly 210m tonnes in 2018 from 190m tonnes the year before.The IEA said recently coal demand had increased in India by 5% last year - just when it was decreasing in many countries.In its earlier report, the agency projected electricity demand to triple in 2018-40.+ 823%Solar energy+ 66%Wind energyAnd it is not just about electricity generating plants.Steel and cement are massively energy intensive industries that are major source of emissions.India aims to triple its cement production in the next 10 years.In 2018, the country became the second largest producer of steel surpassing Japan.""For emissions, cement and steel are the real challenge, and nobody seems to be talking about it,"" says Ajay Mathur, head of the Energy Resources Institute, an independent Delhi-based think tank.""In the absence of technology, these are massive sources of emissions, and they are a huge issue for all the countries around the world.""But if you look at the demand-supply situation, India already has surplus electricity.It has an installed capacity of nearly 350,000MW while, officials say. Meanwhile, the demand has never crossed 180,000MW.The bottlenecks in the country's transmission and distribution networks have been blamed.""Lack of investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure has resulted in congestion of the network in India, impeding the evacuation of power and the development of a competitive market,"" the World Bank says in its report.That is one of the reasons why most of the power plants in the country are operating a little above 50% of their capacity, known as Plant Load Factor.Share of world's totalFrom 7%at presentTo 14%by 2040Some experts fear if electricity cannot be fully evacuated from existing power plants in distant places, then states could start having their own plants.Two major coal-fired power plants have recently been approved in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.""Political competition between parties can create that situation, particularly if this election results into a grand coalition government,"" says Mr Krishnaswamy.""But that competition could also result in installation of solar plants. But again will the renewables be able to supply the amount of energy they are now promising?""Some say that now looks increasingly possible because renewable energy in India is becoming much cheaper than electricity produced from coal burning.""The move towards renewable electricity will keep on happening because we see that as being the most cost effective way to meet people's needs,"" says Mr Mathur.""Our action is not based on environmental aspirations, it is based on hard economic realities.""Renewables can generate only when there is the Sun and wind - but India's peak demand time is before midnight.Battery technologies to store renewable energy cannot yet be source of stable electricity supply.""For stable power generation, coal is our necessity and our plants will need more coal,"" says Shailendra Shukla, head of the power generation company in Chattisgarh.""The day an alternative is available, we will stop using coal.""But even with so much of coal burning, the Indian government says it is already on its way to meet its commitments under the Paris deal.""India has been one of the top performers in terms of living up to climate commitments,"" says Mr Krishnaswamy.""But is that adequate? Particularly because now we need to limit global warming to 1.5C degrees compared with pre-industrial period.""The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year brought out a special report indicating that the Paris agreement's goal of limiting warming to ""well below 2C degrees"" could still be inadequate to fight climate change.The BP is predicting that India will account ""for more than a quarter of net global primary energy demand growth between 2017-2040"".The company adds that ""42% of this new energy demand is met through coal, meaning CO2 emissions roughly double by 2040"".Chandra Bhusan, from the Centre of Science and Environment, a Delhi-based think tank, agrees that India's emissions will increase.But he adds: ""It will happen simply because we have a very low per capita emissions.""Just for comparison, the per capita emissions from just food consumption in the UK is higher that total per capital emissions in India."""
science	Nuclear fusion is 'a question of when, not if'	So what exactly is fusion?Giant step forward or a white elephant?How will the UK make fusion work?So where is the excitement about fusion coming from?'A ball of liquid metal...'Why hasn't fusion worked so far?Will renewable energy make fusion redundant?	"The prospects for developing nuclear fusion as a feasible source of energy have significantly improved, say experts.The UK government has recently announced an investment of £200m to deliver electricity from a fusion reactor by 2040.Private companies and governments have told the BBC they aim to have demonstration models working within five years.But huge hurdles remain, say critics.With the price of wind and solar continuing to drop, experts say these existing renewables might offer a more economical and timely method of tackling climate change and generating energy than an unproven technology like fusion.Nuclear fusion is an attempt to replicate the processes of the Sun on Earth. It differs significantly from nuclear fission, which has been our only way of getting electricity from atoms since the 1950s.Fission has proven to be hugely expensive. It generates large amounts of radioactive waste and raises serious concerns about safety and the proliferation of weapons.Fusion is the process that drives our Sun.Every single second, millions of tonnes of hydrogen atoms crash together in the tremendous temperatures and pressures of our parent star. This forces them to break their atomic bonds and fuse to make the heavier element, helium.Natural, solar fusion generates enormous quantities of heat and light.For decades, researchers have been trying to replicate this process on Earth, or ""build the Sun in a box"" as one physicist dubbed it. The basic idea is to take a type of hydrogen gas, heat it to more than 100 million degrees until it forms a thin, fragile cloud called a plasma, and then control it with powerful magnets until the atoms fuse and release energy.Potentially, it can generate power that is low carbon, with much smaller amounts of waste. It also comes without the danger of explosions.To deliver the fusion concept, countries have focused their energies on a major international co-operative effort called Iter.The Iter project involves 35 countries and, right now, it is constructing a huge test reactor in southern France.The plan is to have the first plasma generated in 2025. However, getting from this step to producing energy is extremely difficult.Iter has also been beset by long delays and budget overspend which means it is unlikely to have a demonstration fusion power plant working even by 2050.""One of the reasons that Iter is late is that it is really, really hard,"" said Prof Ian Chapman, chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority.""What we are doing is fundamentally pushing the barriers of what's known in the technology world. And of course you reach hurdles and you have to overcome them, which we do all the time and Iter will happen, I am completely convinced of it.""Until Iter is up and running in 2025, the UK based Joint European Torus (Jet) remains the world's largest fusion experiment.It has secured EU funding until the end of 2020, but what happens after that, and the participation of the UK in Iter after Brexit remain unclear.To give some sense of certainty, the UK government recently announced £220m for the conceptual design of a fusion power station by 2040.Over the next four years, researchers based at Culham in Oxfordshire will develop designs for a fusion power plant called Step or Spherical Tokomak for Energy Production.The most widely known approach to making fusion happen involves a doughnut shaped vacuum chamber called a Tokomak. Hydrogen gas is heated to 100 million degrees C at which point it become a plasma. Powerful magnets are used to confine and steer the plasma until fusion occurs.In the UK, researchers have developed a different form of Tokamak, that more resembles an apple core than a doughnut. Called a Spherical Tokamak, it has the advantage of being more compact, potentially allowing future power plants to be located in towns and cities.""If you look at some of the very big units, the big machines that we are looking at, just finding geographically somewhere to put them is difficult,"" said Nanna Heiberg from the UK Atomic Energy Authority.""What you really want to do is put them close to where the energy is required. And so if you can do them in a much smaller footprint, you can put them closer to the users and you can put more of them around the country for example.""While governments are wrestling with Iter, many are also driving ahead with their own national plans. China, India, Russia and the US among others are working on developing commercial reactors.As well as the UK government putting cash in, the European Investment Bank is pumping hundreds of millions of euros into an Italian programme to produce fusion energy by 2050.But perhaps the major excitement comes from private companies. They are usually smaller, nimbler, and they develop by making mistakes and learning from them quickly.There are now dozens of them around the world, raising funds and pushing forward often with different approaches to fusion than that seen in Iter and in the UK.Here's a brief sample of some different approaches to fusion.First Light: This company originated in the University of Oxford and was founded specifically to address the urgent need to decarbonise the global energy system. Their idea involves firing a projectile at a target that contains hydrogen atoms. The shockwave from the impact of the projectile creates a shockwave that crushes the fuel and briefly this reaction will produce plasma that is hotter than the sun and denser than lead.Commonwealth Fusion Systems: A private company created by former Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) staff, CFS has raised significant funding of over $100m. It is focusing on developing a Tokamak system but its key innovation is in superconducting magnets. They hope to build powerful enough magnets so they can build smaller and cheaper Tokomaks to contain the plasmas required to generate fusion.TAE Technologies: With backing from Google and other high tech investors, this California-based company is using a different mix of fuel to develop smaller, cheaper reactors. They want to use hydrogen and boron as both elements are readily available and non-radioactive. Their prototype is a cylindrical colliding beam fusion reactor (CBFR) that heats hydrogen gas to form two rings of plasma. These are merged and held together with beams of neutral particles to make it hotter and last longer.US Navy: Worried about how to power their ships in the future, the US Navy has filed a patent for a ""plasma compression fusion device"". The patent says that it would use magnetic fields to create ""accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin"". The idea would be to make fusion power reactors small enough to be portable. There's a lot of scepticism that this approach will work.One of the main challengers with ambitions to make fusion work is a company based in British Columbia, Canada called General Fusion. Their approach, which has gathered a lot of attention and backing from the likes of Amazon's Jeff Bezos, combines cutting edge physics with off the shelf technology.They call their system ""magnetised target fusion"".This approach sees a hot gas plasma injected into a ball of liquid metal inside a steel sphere. It is then compressed by pistons, much like in a diesel engine.""The pistons all fire simultaneously and collapse the cavity with the fuel inside,"" said Michael Delage, the company's chief technology officer.""So at the peak of that compression when the fuel bursts into fusion reaction, it is surrounded on all sides by liquid metal so the energy goes into the metal and you take this hot liquid metal and boil water, make steam and make electricity.""General Fusion say they hope to have a working model within five years.Despite the hopes, no one to date has managed to get more energy out of a fusion experiment than they have put in.Most experts are confident the idea will work, but many believe that it is a matter of scale. To make it work, you have to go large.""I think fusion needs resources to really make it work,"" said Prof Ian Chapman from UKAEA. ""You could do that within a company or a country but you really need to have the requisite scale and resources.""""When ITER works, and I say when, not if, it will be a step change for fusion and you will see massive investment come into the field.""In 2018, the IPCC reported that emissions of carbon dioxide need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C.Getting to that point requires a rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector. The UK has committed to Net Zero emissions by 2050 which will require the deployment of wind and solar on a massive scale. Some argue this is should be a greater priority for Britain, rather than spending large sums on experimental fusion reactors.""The cost of renewables has shot down while the cost of the world fusion project, Iter has gone up and it now looks very unlikely they will be able to compete without new ideas,"" said Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, a one time chair of the ITER council and a respected British physicist.""I don't think this means we should give up on fusion, there are ways it could become cheaper but it is not going to be there immediately when we need in the UK at least.""Others involved in the fusion industry take a different view.""If you're a country like Malaysia, that has a high carbon intensity of its energy system, and you're trying to move away from coal, there's not a lot of options today,"" said Chris Mowry, General Fusion's chief executive.""This is the type of application we're focused on. And even in countries like Canada, which have a fair amount of renewables, it can never be 100% renewables.""""And so we need a carbon free source of energy that can complement renewables in the future.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	'World-class' surf lake opens near Bristol		"A ""world-class"" surf lake that's opened in Bristol is 100% powered by renewable energy, say its creators.The complex, called The Wave, cost £26m to build and can generate up to 1,000 waves an hour.It provides a gentle swell for aspiring surfers and fast, hollow waves for veteran surfers.Its owners call it ""the perfect classroom"" to raise awareness of environmental issues such as plastic pollution and carbon emissions.The surf lake is in the village of Easter Compton, 12 miles north of Bristol city centre. The site covers 75 acres, with the lake itself measuring 180m long and 200m wide.Alongside raising awareness of environmental issues, those behind The Wave hope to inspire social change. The first people to ride the waves were selected from hundreds of nominees.They include a group of schoolchildren from central Bristol, some of whom had never seen the sea; Marshall Janson, a youngster from Cornwall who lost his hands and legs to meningitis, and Claire Moodie, who set up the campaign group Plastic Free North Devon.The complex has also been designed to make the waves accessible to those with even the most severe disabilities.It was Nick Hounsfield's idea, and it's taken 10 years to see the first wave break.""We've got a real opportunity of getting people, particularly kids, off computers, getting them outdoors, get them interacting with nature, and improving people's health and wellbeing on a physical and a mental basis,"" he said. ""That's the bit that really makes me tick.""Mr Hounsfield admits to being worried what the reaction would be.""Some of my friends are seasoned environmental campaigners, I was quite worried about building something quite artificial like this, as though it would somehow devalue it,"" he said.""But all of them categorically say we cannot wait for the wave to be open because it will be the perfect classroom for us to be able to get that message out there in a really engaging way.""Mr Hounsfield continued: ""Particularly because this is inland, there is a real disconnect between people who are living in cities, and maybe don't understand the impact of what they are doing day-to-day and the choices that they are making are having on the coastal environment - from what we flush down the toilet to our choices in single-use plastics.""The site has been built using as few toxic chemicals as possible. The buildings are timber-clade and insulated with sustainable wood fibre. They're also fitted with solar thermal panels that pre-heat water to reduce energy use. There are also plans to build infrastructure to allow the site to generate its own power.Chief executive Craig Stoddart says it's costing an extra £100,000 a year to use renewable energy. ""The idea of helping to acidify the ocean where natural waves come from, that's crazy - why would you do that? Let's get a conversation going about this; let's be responsible as an industry.""Some 16,000 trees are being planted around the site; wildflower meadows and wetlands are also being created; hedgerows are being restored, and a space for outdoor learning is being developed.The landscape architect is Ian Richardson. ""My brief was to bring kids out of the inner city and play in a natural way - to be kids. Also for older people, to give them space to be in a natural environment.""It was constructed within the green belt on former farmland which, according to Mr Richardson, was ""low in diversity and ecology.""""We needed to look at where the lake was and how it fitted in to the landscape. What we could do with all the soil that came out; how we could use it to improve biodiversity and habitat,"" he said.The Wave is in part of the Avon Forest conservation area. ""I am very much of the mindset of looking at the wider context. Rather than creating a pocket of ecology, I wanted to connect it with the wider network of habitat corridors like hedgerows and nearby woodland, to allow flora and fauna to spread,"" Mr Richardson added.The commitment to provide a connection with nature extends in to the lake itself. In the ocean, waves can form thousands of miles from where they break on land. They are born when wind moves over the surface of the water, stirring up ripples which grow in to a swell. A swell is essentially a moving band of energy, forged into a complex, shifting shape that peaks and breaks when it reaches shallower water.The kind of wave you get depends on that sea bed, and the bottom of the Wave pool has been designed to mimic those that crash over coral reefs, known as ""reef breaks."" This means it's as close to a natural ocean wave as physics is currently able to generate.Mr Hounsfield started the project with practically no money. ""Everything from finding the land, to getting planning permission, to the massive hurdle of getting the financing. That took two-and-a-half years of 'Dragons Den' style meetings,"" he said.Critics say that the regular, identical waves produced by surf lakes give people a false sense of security in the ocean. Some surfers also believe that it will lead to popular breaks becoming overcrowded.Mr Hounsfield says that while it's possible there could be more surfers, they will understand the sport much better, be more environmentally aware - and be safer in the water. For example, they will teach people how to get out of dangerous rip currents.Either way, surf lakes are here to stay. London is next: an exclusive deal with Lee Valley Regional Park Authority has been signed to build a Wave facility on land in Enfield.Follow Claire on Twitter."
science	Climate change: LED lights making dent in UK energy demand	Who says this?How much carbon has been reduced?What role has industry played?Should 'Cinderella' efficiency be allowed to shine?	"Installing a single low-energy LED bulb may make a trivial contribution to cutting the carbon emissions that are overheating the planet.But if millions choose LEDs, then with a twist of the collective wrist, their efforts will make a small but significant dent in the UK's energy demand.Studies show making products more efficient has - along with other factors - already been slightly more effective than renewable energy in cutting CO2 emissions.The difference is that glamorous renewables grab the headlines.The ""Cinderella"" field of energy efficiency, however, is often ignored or derided.The new analysis of government figures comes from the environmental analysis website Carbon Brief.Its author says EU product standards on light bulbs, fridges, vacuum cleaners and other appliances have played a substantial part in reducing energy demand.Provisional calculations show that electricity generation in the UK peaked around 2005. But generation per person is now back down to the level of 1984 (around 5 megawatt hours per capita).It’s widely known that the great switch from coal power to renewables has helped the UK meet ambitions to cut carbon emissions.The report says the use of renewables reduced fossil fuel energy by the equivalent of 95 terawatt hours (TWh) between 2005 and now. And last year renewables supplied a record 33% share of UK electricity generation.But in the meantime, humble energy efficiency has contributed to cutting energy demand by 103 TWh. In other words, in the carbon-cutting contest, efficiency has won – so far. And what’s more, efficiency is uncontroversial, unlike wind and solar.The energy efficiency story doesn’t just apply to households. There have been major strides amongst firms, too. Big supermarkets have worked hard to improve the performance of their lighting and refrigeration.And because firms and individuals are using less energy, that has offset the rise in energy prices. So whilst the prices have gone up, often bills have gone down.The issue is complicated, though. Other factors have to be taken into account, such as energy imported via cables from mainland Europe, population growth and shifts from old energy-intensive industries.Simon Evans from Carbon Brief told BBC News: “Although the picture is complex it’s clear that energy efficiency has played a huge role in help the UK to decarbonise – and I don’t think it’s got the recognition it should have.""Say you change from a B or C-rated fridge to an A++ rated fridge. That can halve your energy use from the appliance, so it’s pretty significant.”The UK government has consistently said it champions energy efficiency, but campaigners say it could do more. The UN’s climate body also supports energy efficiency as a major policy objective, although the issue features little in media coverage.But supporters of efficiency argue that ratcheting up efficiency standards for everything from planes and cars to computer displays and freezers offers the best-value carbon reductions without the pain of confronting the public with restrictions on their lifestyle choices.Joanne Wade from the Association for Conservation of Energy told BBC News: “I haven’t seen these figures before but I’m not surprised.“The huge improvement in energy efficiency tends to be completely ignored. People haven’t noticed it because if efficiency improves, they are still able to have the energy services that they want. I suppose I should reluctantly agree that the fact that no-one notices it is part of its appeal.”Scientists will be keen to point out that government-imposed energy efficiency is just one of a host of cures needed to tackle the multi-faceted problem of an overheating planet.Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Bug covered 'bionic mushroom' generates clean energy		"US researchers have successfully tested the rather whacky idea of producing electricity from a mushroom covered in bacteria.The scientists used 3D printing to attach clusters of energy-producing bugs to the cap of a button mushroom.The fungus provided the ideal environment to allow the cyanobacteria to generate a small amount of power.The authors say their fossil-free ""bionic mushroom"" could have great potential.As researchers the world over search for alternative energy sources, there has been a sharp rise in interest in cyanobacteria.These organisms, widely found in the oceans and on land, are being investigated for their abilities to turn sunlight into electrical current.One big problem is that they do not survive long enough on artificial surfaces to be able to deliver on their power potential.That's where the humble button mushroom comes in.This fertile fungus is already home to many other forms of bacterial life, providing an attractive array of nutrients, moisture and temperature.So the scientists from the Stevens Institute of Technology in the US developed a clever method of marrying the mushroom to the sparky bugs.Appropriately enough, they came up with the idea while having lunch!""One day my friends and I went to lunch together and we ordered some mushrooms,"" said Sudeep Joshi, a postdoctoral researcher and author of the study.""As we discussed them we realised they have a rich microbiota of their own, so we thought why not use the mushrooms as a support for the cynaobacteria. We thought let's merge them and see what happens.""Using a special bio-ink, the team printed the bacteria on the cap of the mushroom in a spiral pattern. They had previously used an electronic ink to embed graphene nano-ribbons on to the surface of the fungus to collect the current.When they shone a light on this magical mushroom, it caused the cyanobacteria to generate a small amount of electricity.Not quite a lightbulb moment but proof that the idea works. The researchers say that several mushrooms wired up together could light a small lamp.""We are looking to connect all the mushrooms in series, in an array, and we are also looking to pack more bacteria together,"" said Sudeep Joshi.""These are the next steps, to optimise the bio-currents, to generate more electricity, to power a small LED.""A big plus for the experiment was the fact that the bugs on the fungus lasted several days longer compared with cyanobacteria placed on other surfaces.The researchers believe that the idea could have potential as a renewable energy source.""Right now we are using cyanobacteria from the pond, but you can genetically engineer them and you can change their molecules to produce higher photo currents, via photosynthesis,"" said Sudeep Joshi.""It's a new start; we call it engineered symbiosis. If we do more research in this we can really push this field forward to have some type of effective green technology.""The leap from fossil fuel to fungus fuel may not be that far away.The study has been published in the journal Nano Letters.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Climate change: Low cost, low energy cooling system shows promise	How effective is this material?What makes it work?What is it likely to be used for?How much cooling does the world need?	"Researchers in the US have scaled up a new low-cost system that could provide efficient cooling for homes while using very little electricity.The team has developed a roof-top sized array, built from a highly reflective material made from glass and polymers.In tests, the system kept water around 10C cooler than the ambient air when exposed to midday sunlight in summer.The approach could also be scaled up to cool power stations and data centres.The system is based around what's termed a cooling meta-material, which is essentially an engineered film not found in nature.Last year, researchers at CU Boulder in the US published research on the extraordinary properties of the new film, which reflects back almost all incoming light from the Sun.But it also has another cooling trick that makes it quite special. If you use the film to cover water, it allows any heat in the liquid to escape into the air.So when the heat escapes and is not replaced because the material deflects away sunlight, temperatures drop rapidly.Now the scientists have improved the system and and built and tested a 13-sq-metre array of panels, that's small enough to fit on most rooftops.""You could place these panels on the roof of a single-family home and satisfy its cooling requirements,"" said Dongliang Zhao, lead author of the study from CU Boulder's Department of Mechanical Engineering.The system has been tested outdoors in a variety of weather conditions. In experiments carried out in the summer of 2017, the reflective system kept a container of water some 12C cooler than the surrounding air in the warmest hours of the day.""We can now apply these materials on building rooftops, and even build large-scale water cooling systems with significant advantages over the conventional air-conditioning systems, which require high amounts of electricity to function,"" said Associate Professor Gang Tan, another author of the study from the University of Wyoming.The key material is made with glass microspheres embedded into a polymer film, with a thin silver coating.At just 50 micrometres, it is slightly thicker than aluminium foil.Another big advantage of the material is that it can be manufactured on rolls, making it easier to apply on residential and commercial applications.The authors say that one of the most effective uses of the new material would be to cool thermoelectric power generating plants. These installations use large amounts of water and electricity to maintain the operating temperatures of their machinery. Using the new material could make them more efficient.In 2016 around 10% of the world's energy use went to power air conditioning. The International Energy Agency says that this rate is set to triple by 2050, with air conditioning (AC) consuming as much electricity as is used in China today.As well as all the CO2 that is produced as electricity is created to power these devices, AC units also contain potent greenhouse gases in the form of hydrofluorocarbons.HFCs were introduced to protect the ozone layer, because the previous generation of the cooling chemicals exacerbated the hole over Antarctica that had developed in the 1980s.While HFCs are less damaging, they have a large global warming potential. In 2016, countries agreed that they would be phased out over the course of the next 15-20 years. If this happens successfully it could have a significant impact on limiting future temperature rises.The new study has been published in the journal Joule."
science	Organic solar cells set 'remarkable' energy record	What are organic solar cells?What's stopped them becoming widely used?So what have these researchers done differently?How far are these from commercial production?What type of application might we expect?What's been the reaction of others in the field?	"Chinese researchers have taken what they say is a major step forward for the development of a new generation of solar cells.Manufacturers have long used silicon to make solar panels because the material was the most efficient at converting sunlight into electricity.But organic photovoltaics, made from carbon and plastic, promise a cheaper way of generating electricity.This new study shows that organics can now be just as efficient as silicon.The term organic relates to the fact that carbon-based materials are at the heart of these devices, rather than silicon. The square or rectangular solid solar panels that most of us are familiar with, require fixed installation points usually on roofs or in flat fields.Organic photovoltaics (OPV) can be made of compounds that are dissolved in ink so they can be printed on thin rolls of plastic, they can bend or curve around structures or even be incorporated into clothing.In a word - efficiency.This is a measure of how much of the sunlight that shines on a panel can be turned into usable electricity.Commercial solar photovoltaics usually covert 15-22% of sunlight, with a world record for a silicon cell of 27.3% reached in this summer in the UK.Organics have long lingered at around half this rate, but this year has seen some major leaps forward.In April researchers were able to reach 15% in tests. Now this new study pushes that beyond 17% with the authors saying that up to 25% is possible.This is important because according to estimates, with a 15% efficiency and a 20 year lifetime, organic solar cells could produce electricity at a cost of less than 7 cents per kilowatt-hour.In 2017, the average cost of electricity in the US was 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the US Energy Information Administration.One of the things that has made OPV less efficient in the past is the fact that the organic materials have loosely bound molecules which can trap electrons and slow down the generation of electricity. So researchers have tried to get around this by putting different layers of material together in a what's termed a tandem cell approach.""Tandem cell means you have two devices built together in the same structure,"" said one of the authors, Dr Yongsheng Chen, from Nankai University in Tianjin, China.""We have two layers of active materials, each layer can absorb different wavelengths of light. That means you can use sunlight in the wider wavelengths or more efficiently and this can generate more current.""Not that far away according to the researchers. Dr Yongsheng Chen compares the OPV to organic light-emitting diodes, or OLED. This technology has been introduced in the past few years and is widely used for high-end TVs.""These are already commercial, and they use a similar material to OPV,"" Dr Yongsheng Chen told BBC News.""The physical principle is the same, just a different direction, one is from solar to electricity, the other from electricity to light, the device and structure are similar.""""I am very positive for OPV, and it may not need five years,"" he added.Flexible, printed solar cells offer a wide range of possibilities. They can work indoors and they can be made semi-transparent, so they could be incorporated into windows and generate power during daylight.They offer huge potential for buildings as they are lightweight so might be ideal for deploying on the roofs of houses in developing countries where structures might not suit heavy silicon. They could be used on the roofs of cars, and in clothes, even in glasses to charge your phone while you are out and about.""Their optional semi-transparency enables their use in windows or glass facade shading,"" said Dr Alexander Colsmann and expert on organic photovoltaics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.""The very same properties render organic solar cells ideally suited to also power mobile applications - camping gear, smart wearables or phone chargers, just to name a few - which have been only insufficiently addressed by classical solar cell technologies such as silicon.""Other experts in this field were generally positive.""This looks a remarkable result to me,"" said Dr Artem Bakulin, from Imperial College London.""The development of such new materials with previously unthinkable properties allowed them to achieve the reported record efficiency and, in general, makes OPV technology much more promising.""Dr Feng Gao from Linköping University in Sweden also believes the new paper is significant.""This work is a very important contribution to organic solar cells and will certainly inspire new developments in the field,"" he said by email.""The tandem organic solar cells with record efficiencies in this work indicate great potential of organic solar cells for practical applications."""
science	Milky Way's centre exploded 3.5 million years ago	More stories like this:	"A cataclysmic energy flare ripped through our galaxy, the Milky Way, about 3.5 million years ago, a team of astronomers say.The so-called Seyfert flare started near the supermassive black hole in the centre of the galaxy, they add.The impact was felt 200,000 light-years away.The discovery that the Milky Way's centre was more dynamic than previously thought can lead to a complete reinterpretation of its evolution.""These results dramatically change our understanding of the Milky Way,"" says co-author Magda Guglielmo from the University of Sydney, Australia.""We always thought about our galaxy as an inactive galaxy, with a not so bright centre,"" she added.The flare created two enormous ""ionisation cones"" that sliced through the Milky Way and left its imprint on the Magellanic Stream. This is a long trail of gas that extends from nearby dwarf galaxies called the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.The stream lies at an average of 200,000 light-years from the Milky Way.The Australian-US research team says the explosion was too big to have been triggered by anything other than nuclear activity associated with the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy.Known as Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* - this colossus is more than four million times the mass of our Sun. This assessment needs further work but the conclusion seems inescapable, the researchers say.""The flare must have been a bit like a lighthouse beam,"" explained team leader Prof Bland-Hawthorn, who is also at the University of Sydney. ""Imagine darkness, and then someone switches on a lighthouse beacon for a brief period of time.""The research, which used the Hubble Space Telescope, will be published in the Astrophysical Journal."
science	Origin of modern humans 'traced to Botswana'	Lakeland havenReconstructing the human storyEvolutionary milestones in human history	"Scientists have pinpointed the homeland of all humans alive today to a region south of the Zambezi River.The area is now dominated by salt pans, but was once home to an enormous lake, which may have been our ancestral heartland 200,000 years ago.Our ancestors settled for 70,000 years, until the local climate changed, researchers have proposed.They began to move on as fertile green corridors opened up, paving the way for future migrations out of Africa.""It has been clear for some time that anatomically modern humans appeared in Africa roughly 200,000 years ago,"" said Prof Vanessa Hayes, a geneticist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia.""What has been long debated is the exact location of this emergence and subsequent dispersal of our earliest ancestors.""Prof Hayes' conclusions have drawn scepticism from other researchers in the field, however.The area in question is south of the Zambezi basin, in northern Botswana.The researchers think our ancestors settled near Africa's huge lake system, known as Lake Makgadikgadi, which is now an area of sprawling salt flats.""It's an extremely large area, it would have been very wet, it would have been very lush,"" said Prof Hayes. ""And it would have actually provided a suitable habitat for modern humans and wildlife to have lived.""After staying there for 70,000 years, people began to move on. Shifts in rainfall across the region led to three waves of migration 130,000 and 110,000 years ago, driven by corridors of green fertile land opening up.The first migrants ventured north-east, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled south-west and a third population remained in the homeland until today.This scenario is based on tracing back the human family tree using hundreds of samples of mitochondrial DNA (the scrap of DNA that passes down the maternal line from mother to child) from living Africans.By combining genetics with geology and climate computer model simulations, researchers were able to paint a picture of what the African continent might have been like 200,000 years ago.However, the study, published in the journal Nature, was greeted with caution by one expert, who says you can't reconstruct the story of human origins from mitochondrial DNA alone.Other analyses have produced different answers with fossil discoveries hinting at an eastern African origin.Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London, who is not connected with the study, said the evolution of Homo sapiens was a complex process.""You can't use modern mitochondrial distributions on their own to reconstruct a single location for modern human origins,"" he told BBC News.""I think it's over-reaching the data because you're only looking at one tiny part of the genome so it cannot give you the whole story of our origins.""Thus, there could have been many homelands, rather than one, which have yet to be pinned down.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	William Smith: Seminal geology map rediscovered		"A first edition copy of one of the most significant maps in the history of science has been rediscovered in time for an important anniversary.William Smith's 1815 depiction of the geology of England, Wales and part of Scotland is a seminal piece of work.The first map of its kind produced anywhere in the world, only about 70 copies are thought to exist today.Now, The Geological Society has turned up another in its own archives, ready to celebrate the map's bicentenary.Tucked away in a leather sleeve case, the mislaid artefact was last seen roughly 40 or 50 years ago.""It just wasn't where people expected it to be,"" said John Henry, the chairman of The Geological Society's History of Geology Group.""I guess the person who put it away knew where it was, but then they left and that was it - it became lost,"" he told BBC News.In one sense, the map is better for its abeyance because it means it has not been exposed to light, and that has protected its exquisite colours.Smith spent the better part of 15 years collecting the information needed to compile the map.It is said he covered about 10,000 miles a year on foot, on horse and in carriage, cataloguing the locations of all the formations that make up the geology of the three home nations.An estimated 370 copies were produced. The outline of the geography and the strata were printed from copper plate engravings, but the detail was finished by hand with watercolours.The lower edge of a formation is saturated and then the paint is made to fade back to the high edge.It is this colouring technique, combined with the tendency of many of England's rocks to dip to the south or southeast, that gives Smith's map its iconic look.The re-discovered copy comes in 15 separate sheets. These have no serial numbers on them, but that in itself is a clue to the map's position in the production sequence.The first batch in the run is known not to have carried any numbering. Another clue is the geology of the Isle of Wight. Smith changed its depiction several times, and the re-discovered map displays his earliest efforts.The artefact is certainly among the first 50 to come off the production line, and very probably among the first 10.Quite what its value is - that is difficult to say. Possibly in the six figures.The Geological Society has had the map fully restored and digitised. And from Monday, anyone will be able to view it online. The paper version will also go on display at the society's Burlington House HQ in London's Piccadilly.William Smith (1769-1839) is often referred to as the ""Father of English Geology"" - a title bestowed on him by The Geological Society, which at first had been reluctant to embrace his vision.The organisation's first members were drawn from the metropolitan elite, and they took a rather disdainful view of the blacksmith's son turned surveyor.But the big landowners knew his worth. They brought Smith in to help them maximise the worth of their estates - to drain land, to improve the soil, to find building stone, and, above all, to find coal.It is this work that would have brought him into contact with the rocks and with the fossils that would lead him to his greatest scientific contribution.John Henry explained: ""The concept which enabled him to do the mapping and that drove him along almost obsessively was this realisation that specific fossils were unique to a specific stratum, and that you knew where you were in a sequence if you could see what the fossils were. That was the breakthrough. People had been collecting them for a long time and naming them in the Linnaean way, but without any real idea that they were in a sequence. But Smith knew it.""Today, it is called the ""principle of faunal succession"", and this idea holds that because fossils succeed one another in order, rocks containing similar fossils are similar in age.This principle has enabled scientists to construct the geological timescale by which the relative ages of rocks can be measured, and thereby understand the history of the Earth.No wonder Simon Winchester called his 2001 book about William Smith, The Map that Changed the World.Monday, 23 March, is Smith's birth date.Sir David Attenborough is going to unveil a plaque at Smith's former residence at 15 Buckingham Street on London's Embankment.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Anak Krakatau: Volcano's tsunami trigger was 'relatively small'	How Anak Krakatau was remodelled	"The scale of the tsunami hazard from volcanoes that collapse into the sea has been underestimated.That's the conclusion of a new analysis of satellite pictures of Indonesia's Anak Krakatau showing the aftermath of its flank failure last December.The study concludes that the volume of material that slipped into the water was actually relatively small.And yet it generated destructive waves around the Sunda Strait as big as those expected from a much larger event.More than 400 people died in the disaster on 22 December 2018; a further 7,000 were injured and nearly 47,000 were displaced from their homes.Rebecca Williams from Hull University, UK, and colleagues have gone back and examined the satellite radar images that were taken of Anak Krakatau (""Child of Krakatau"") before, during and after the volcanic activity that precipitated the flank failure.Radar data was central to the analysis because this remote sensing technique can detect the ground surface even when it's dark, covered by cloud or, as in this case, obscured by erupted ash.A key image in Dr Williams' study is one acquired by the EU's Sentinel-1a satellite which passed over the volcano just eight hours after its western flank had fallen into the water but before the 340m-high mountain's summit had been removed.It helped her team to not only get a good calculation of the likely volume of lost material in the landslide but to also pick apart the different phases the event went through to produce an edifice that eventually stood little more than 100m above the surrounding ocean.The estimated slip volume is 0.1 cubic km. This is a third of the volume that had been anticipated would produce the kind of tsunami witnessed on 22 December.Scientists had modelled in 2012 what might happen if the western flank of Anak Krakatau gave way, and even worked out the likely height and arrival times of waves at nearby coastlines.These projections turned out to be tragically accurate. However, they had presumed a tsunami-generating mass of 0.3 cu km.""There's bound to be some error in the detail but we're confident that it was only a very small portion of the flank that collapsed to produce the tsunami,"" explained Dr Williams.""The truly dramatic geomorphological (shape) changes we saw coming out a few days later in satellite images were due to the explosive eruption rather than the initial landslide event,"" she told BBC News.(1) The volcano had been in a periodic but persistent eruptive phase(2) On 22 December its western flank failed, generating destructive waves(3) This opened a vent to the sea. Huge explosions then removed the summit(4) The volcano began to rebuild itself and closed off the underwater ventThese changes refer to the removal of the summit. The cone and crater are still visible and intact in the Sentinel image. They only disappear in subsequent days.Dr Williams' team now think the flank collapse may have reorganised the plumbing of the volcano, opening a new vent that brought magma directly into contact with seawater. This would have initiated violent phreatomagmatic activity which is evident in the spectacular photos taken from an aeroplane that flew around Anak Krakatau in late December.""The behaviour seen in those pictures was very typical of these marine explosions and it's this violence that removed the summit,"" she explained.""Over the following weeks, as the volcano started to build again, the water was eventually stopped from getting into the magmatic system and Anak Krakatau went 'back to normal'.""We went through the old literature and you see evidence of the vents migrating backwards and forwards, so this is something the volcanic island has done throughout its history.""Dr Williams concedes that many of the tsunami models out there currently cannot reproduce 22 December using a slip volume of only 0.1 cu km, although there is a new simulation from a French group that can, using 0.15 cu km.""I would challenge that the models are currently underestimating the ability of these landslides to make these larger tsunamis,"" she said.It's thought there are about 40 volcanoes worldwide sited close to water that could pose a hazard similar to that of Anak Krakatau.Dr Williams' group has published its study in the journal Geology.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Chang'e-4: Chinese rover 'confirms' Moon crater theory		"The Chinese Chang'e-4 rover may have confirmed a longstanding idea about the origin of a vast crater on the Moon's far side.The rover's landing site lies within a vast impact depression created by an asteroid strike billions of years ago.Now, mission scientists have found evidence that impact was so powerful it punched through the Moon's crust and into the layer below called the mantle.Chang'e-4 has identified what appear to be mantle rocks on the surface.It's something the rover was sent to the far side to find out.Chunlai Li, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and colleagues have presented their findings in the journal Nature.The lunar far side, which is turned away from Earth, is more rugged than the familiar near side and has fewer ""maria"" - dark plains formed by ancient volcanic eruptions.The Chinese spacecraft touched down on 3 January, becoming the first spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the lunar far side. The rover then rolled off the lander to explore its surroundings.The rover landed inside a 180km-wide impact bowl called Von Kármán crater. But that smaller crater lies within the 2,300km-wide South Pole Aitken (SPA) Basin, which covers nearly a quarter of the Moon's circumference.It's not known exactly how old the SPA Basin is, but it's thought to be at least 3.9 billion years old. The asteroid that carved it out is thought to have been about 170km wide.The Yutu-2 rover has now identified rocks with a very different chemical make-up to those found elsewhere on the Moon.Early results from the rover's Visible and Near Infrared Spectrometer (VNIS) suggest the rocks contain minerals known as low-calcium (ortho)pyroxene and olivine.They fit the profile of rocks from the lunar mantle and suggest that the ancient impact that created the SPA drove right through the 50km-deep crust into the mantle.Observational data taken by Moon-orbiting spacecraft have been inconclusive as to the presence of mantle rocks on the surface.The authors of the paper want to continue their examination of these rocks and find others. They have also raised the possibility of sending another mission to deliver some of them to Earth for study in laboratories.The results could now help scientists understand the chemical and mineralogical composition of the mantle, which could shed light on the origins and evolution of the Moon itself.The team members also want to find out more about what happened after the asteroid collided with the Moon and formed the SPA Basin. Scientists predict that the hole in the surface may have been filled by molten rock - forming a ""melt sheet"" within the impact bowl, which complicates the picture of this region's geology.Patrick Pinet, from the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP) in Toulouse, France, called the results ""thrilling"" and said they ""could have considerable implications for characterising the composition of the Moon's upper mantle"".He added: ""It is of the utmost importance to make progress towards unpacking the geology of the lunar far side, expanding our fundamental knowledge of the Moon's formation and the origin of the crustal asymmetry that exists between its near and far sides, and preparing future sample-return missions.""Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover senses methane spike		"The American space agency's Mars rover Curiosity has recorded its largest measurement yet of methane.The robot frequently ""sniffs"" the Red Planet for the gas but has never before seen so high a concentration - of 21 parts per billion (ppb).The observations are fascinating because on Earth, methane is produced in large part by living things.That's not necessarily the case on Mars; geological processes are very capable of making it as well.Nonetheless, the latest data will heighten interest in the topic.Through the course of its mission, Curiosity has noticed a number of spikes in methane, and it senses a background level that appears to have a seasonal pattern to it.But although the robot's big onboard chemistry lab - the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument - can detect the gas's presence, it can say nothing about the source.""With our current measurements, we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology, or even ancient or modern,"" said SAM Principal Investigator Paul Mahaffy from Nasa's Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.The issue of methane at Mars is a little confusing at the moment, to say the least.While Curiosity continues to measure some spikes, and one of these has been confirmed by the European Mars Express satellite in orbit at the planet - another spacecraft, supposedly with much better sensitivity, has seen nothing.This probe, known as the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), started observing the planet's atmosphere in April 2017. It should be able to detect methane at concentrations in the parts per trillion.Quite why it cannot see what Curiosity sees is therefore a major puzzle.One suggestion is that there is some kind of destruction mechanism that removes a methane spike in the lower atmosphere very rapidly - before the joint European-Russian TGO can get over Curiosity's operation site at Gale Crater.But if this process exists, scientists are at a loss currently to explain it.Nasa controllers commanded Curiosity to run a further air-sampling experiment over the weekend. The results were expected back on Earth on Monday.For context, the concentration of methane in Earth's atmosphere is 1,865ppb. So the quantities at Mars, whatever their source, are still very small.The primary emitters of methane on Earth are from wetlands, livestock, biomass and fossil-fuel burning, landfill and rice paddies.The term ""parts per billion by volume"" (ppbv, or ppb for short) means that in a given volume of air, some billionths of that volume will constitute the gas of interest.One of the geological processes that can produce methane is ""serpentinisation"", which yields the gas at the end of a chain of reactions when water comes into contact with certain rock minerals.Dr Mahaffy's statement about historic methane is an important one, too. Even though Curiosity sees the gas today, it is quite possible the original source is ancient and is only now being released into the atmosphere, perhaps because some store below ground has become disturbed.On Earth, methane can be held in ice under the seafloor or in permafrost regions on land for a very long time before it breaks out into the air."
science	Fracking: UK shale reserves may be smaller than previously estimated	New approach	"Previous projections of the potential amount of shale gas under the UK may have been significantly overestimated, according to a new study.Instead of 50 years of gas at the current rate of consumption, this new research suggests there are just 5-7 years' supply.But the UK's fracking industry, which represents companies like Cuadrilla, dismissed the report.The said the sample size was too small to draw serious conclusions.The recovery of shale gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been a slow moving and controversial affair in the UK over the past decade.Attempts by oil and gas companies to drill wells and extract gas have been held up by planning issues, concerns about earth tremors and public displays of disaffection over the issue.Through it all, the government and industry have maintained faith in the process.They argued that there was huge potential for fracked gas particularly in the Bowland shale, a geological formation that runs under Lancashire, Yorkshire, parts of the Midlands and into North Wales.The optimistic view was based in part on a study published in 2013 by the British Geological Survey (BGS) which issued a very positive report on the likely amount of gas in place under the Bowland.That study suggested that it was one of the world's biggest reserves, containing some 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas.""To put that in context,"" wrote former Prime Minister David Cameron at the time, ""even if we extract just a tenth of that figure, that is still the equivalent of 51 years' gas supply.""But there were concerns expressed at the time that the estimate was on the high side.Now, scientists at the University of Nottingham and the BGS have developed a new method for analysing the gas content of shale, which they believe gives them a more accurate estimate of the overall potential.""In terms of the total gas in place, the mean value from the 2013 study was 1,300 trillion feet of gas, we are struggling to get anywhere above 200 trillion feet,"" said Prof Colin Snape from the University of Nottingham, the lead author on the paper.""The data we've got from the two shales we've looked at are very consistent - and gas companies Cuadrilla and Third Energy have just published two papers in the last year where they have taken core samples and measured the gas that's evolved and that data is very, very consistent with our own data.""According to the new study, the amount of gas in place, assuming an economic recovery rate of 10% would be a maximum of 20 trillion cubic feet, which would equate to around seven years' worth of gas at current UK rates of consumption.Other researchers were impressed with the new method developed by the researchers at Nottingham.""The results bring bad news to those hoping that northern England is floating on a bed of cheap and abundant gas,"" said Prof Stuart Haszeldine, Professor of Geology and Carbon Storage, University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study.""Abundant hydrocarbons may have been generated in the past, but have leaked away to the Earth's surface many millions of years ago. Not only have all those hydrocarbon horses bolted, but there is no longer a secure stable door to retain very large quantities of present-day gas in these shales.""However, some of the leading experts at the BGS were cautious in their interpretation of the study, even though several of their own scientists were involved in the paper.""Early indications published today suggest that it is possible there is less shale gas resource present than previously thought,"" said Prof Mike Stephenson, chief scientist for decarbonisation and resource management, at the BGS.""However the study considered only a very small number of rock samples from only two locations.""""BGS has continued to study resource estimation in shales over the past 16 years and further studies are still required to further refine estimates of shale gas resources.""Cuadrilla, the company which has recently resumed fracking a shale gas well in Lancashire, was blunt in its rejection of the new paper.""Those involved in publishing this should be embarrassed,"" said Francis Egan, Cuadrilla chief executive.""We hold more data and technical experience of the Bowland shale than anyone else in the UK yet not once did anyone from this research group or Nottingham University contact us for our view or input.""UKOOG, the body which represents the UK's onshore oil and gas industry, also rejected the implications of the study.""To date we have made significant advancements in the understanding of the resource potential contained within UK shale, with very encouraging results seen at both Springs Road and Preston New Road which have demonstrated properties in line with world class, US shale plays,"" said Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas.""What we know now is that we have a world class resource which has broadly supported the estimates originally published by the British Geological Survey. Indeed, in terms of potential gas flow indications, the results are at the upper end of our original forecasts.""""The only way to provide accurate estimates of how much gas is likely to be produced is to drill, hydraulically fracture and test many wells,"" said Prof Quentin Fisher, from the University of Leeds, who was not involved with the study.""Which is exactly the intention of companies holding shale gas licences in the UK.""The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications."
science	Mars methane surge spotted from space	Biology or geology?	"A European spacecraft has confirmed a report of methane being released from the surface of Mars.The methane spike was first measured by Nasa's Curiosity rover on the surface; now it has been confirmed by the Mars Express orbiter.The nature and extent of methane in the Martian atmosphere is intensely debated.The gas is of interest because terrestrial methane can be made by life forms, as well as geological processes.Methane is only supposed to have a very short lifetime in the Martian atmosphere, so detecting it there means it must have been released very recently.A strong signal of methane was measured by the Curiosity rover on 15 June 2013.The measurement was confirmed in data collected the next day by the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) on board Mars Express.The results from two studies are outlined in the journal, Nature Geoscience.Building blocks of life found on MarsMethane 'belches' detected on MarsMars probe despatched on methane quest""In general we did not detect any methane, aside from one definite detection of about 15 parts per billion by volume of methane in the atmosphere, which turned out to be a day after Curiosity reported a spike of about six parts per billion,"" says Marco Giuranna, principal investigator for the PFS.""Although parts per billion in general means a relatively small amount, it is quite remarkable for Mars - our measurement corresponds to an average of about 46 tonnes of methane that was present in the area of 49,000 square kilometres observed from our orbit.""At the time of Curiosity's detection, it was thought that the methane might have originated north of the rover (because the prevailing winds were southward), and that the release came from inside Gale Crater, Curiosity's landing location.The team made two independent analyses to home in on potential source regions of the methane, dividing up a wide region around Gale Crater into grids of about 250 by 250 square kilometres.There are a variety of ways methane might be produced on Mars.If microbes still exist, they are one possible source. Methane produced by micro-organisms in the distant past could also get trapped within ice. When the ice melts, it could then release the ancient methane into the atmosphere.But there are geological processes that can produce methane, and don't require biology. These include serpentinisation - a process of mineral alteration in the crust involving heat and water. Methane can be made as a downstream product of serpentinisation.Marco Giuranna suspects the plume didn't originate from Gale Crater.Scientists scrutinised the region around Gale for features where gas seepage is expected.This process is well known on Earth to occur along tectonic faults and from natural gas fields.""We identified tectonic faults that might extend below a region proposed to contain shallow ice. Since permafrost is an excellent seal for methane, it is possible that the ice here could trap subsurface methane and release it episodically along the faults that break through this ice,"" said Giuseppe Etiope from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome, a co-author on one of the studies.""Remarkably, we saw that the atmospheric simulation and geological assessment, performed independently of each other, suggested the same region of provenance of the methane.""The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which is designed to make a detailed inventory of the Martian atmosphere, was launched in 2016. However, it has yet to report its science results."
science	Mars: The box seeking to answer the biggest question	The rover's name: Who was Rosalind Franklin?	"Is it possible? Is there life on Mars?Ever since the Mariner 4 probe made the first successful visit to the Red Planet - a flyby in July 1965 - we've sent a succession of missions that have given us all sorts of fascinating information about Earth's near neighbour - but not the answer to the only question that really matters.So, take a look at the technology that may finally change the game.This is the Analytical Laboratory Drawer, or ALD - a sophisticated three-in-one box of instruments that will examine rock samples for the chemical fingerprints of biology.On Thursday, it was gently lifted by crane and lowered into the ExoMars ""Rosalind Franklin"" rover, the six-wheeled buggy that will carry it across the Oxia plain of Mars in 2021.The 300kg robot, which is being developed jointly by the European and Russian space agencies, will have a drill that can dig up to 2m below the planet's dusty surface.The tailings pulled up by this tool will be handed through a door to the ALD, where the various mechanisms inside will then crush and prepare powders that can be dropped into small cups for analysis.It will be a forensic examination, looking at all aspects of the samples' composition.All previous rovers have skirted the big question. They've essentially only asked whether the conditions on Mars today or in the past would have been favourable to life - if ever it had existed. They haven't actually had the necessary equipment to truly detect biomarkers.Rosalind Franklin will be different. Its 54kg ALD has been built specifically to look for those complex organic molecules that have their origin in life processes.Thursday's integration was slow and deliberate, understandably: the ALD is in many ways the key element of the Rosalind Franklin mission.""It is wonderful to see the heart of the rover has now been installed,"" said Sue Horne, the head of space exploration at the UK Space Agency.""The Analytical Laboratory Drawer is the key location for Martian sample testing on the rover, allowing us to understand the geology and potentially to identify signatures of life of Mars. I can't wait to see what discoveries lie in store for this British-built rover.""Engineers at Airbus UK are now working three shifts a day to get the rover finished.Although it doesn't look much like a vehicle at the moment, virtually all the components have now arrived at the Stevenage factory.They're sitting on shelves around the edge of the cleanroom in bags, waiting their turn in the assembly sequence.There are one or two outstanding items, however, including the rover's British ""eyes"".This is the camera system, or PanCam, which will sit atop a mast and guide the robot on its trail of investigation.""We've just held the delivery review board this week and PanCam should be coming to us in the next few days,"" said Chris Draper, the flight model operations manager at Airbus.""We know everything will go together; that's the beauty of systems engineering. Every single part of the rover has been modelled in 3D, and everyone works to interface control drawings. Assuming we all do that then we know the ALD, for example, will fit perfectly into the rover.""The Stevenage team has a hard deadline of the beginning of August to get the finished Rosalind Franklin rover out the door.It has to go to the company's Toulouse facility for a series of tests that will ensure the design is robust enough to cope with the severe shaking experienced on a rocket ride to Mars.Further fit-checks then follow in France before shipment to the launch site at the famous Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.Lift-off has to occur in July/August next year. This date is immoveable: you only go to Mars when it's aligned with Earth and the windows of opportunity have an interval of 26 months.In 1952, Rosalind Franklin was at King's College London (KCL) investigating the atomic arrangement of DNA, using her skills as an X-ray crystallographer to create images for analysis.One of her team's pictures, known as Photo 51, provided the essential insights for Crick and Watson to build the first three-dimensional model of the two-stranded macromolecule.It was one of the supreme achievements of 20th Century science, enabling researchers to finally understand how DNA stored, copied and transmitted the genetic ""code of life"".Crick, Watson, and KCL colleague Maurice Wilkins received the 1962 Nobel Prize for the breakthrough.Franklin's untimely death meant she could not be considered for the award (Nobels are not awarded posthumously). However, many argue that her contribution has never really been given the attention it deserves, and has even been underplayed.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	European satellite captures Nasa Mars lander from orbit		"Europe's newest satellite at Mars has spied the landing site of the American-led InSight probe.The Nasa spacecraft touched down in November on flat terrain close to the equator in a region referred to as Elysium Planitia.The joint European-Russian Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) then passed overhead in March to capture the scene.Visible in the TGO CaSSIS camera image are the lander and the elements that got it safely to the ground.These components include the parachute and the two halves of the capsule that protected InSight during its fiery descent through the atmosphere - its heatshield and backshell.Something else that can be seen are the scorch marks around the probe that were made by the craft's rocket engines as it gently put down on Mars' surface.Burroughs crater near Mars' south polar ice cap. The ice and dust layers have formed a mound in the crater over hundreds of millions of years. They record how the climate of Mars has evolved over timeThe picture is one of a newly released batch of images from the CaSSIS (Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System) team on the TGO mission.The Swiss-based group's instrument acquires stereo imagery of the planet's surface at a best resolution of 4.5m per pixel.It's onboard principally to provide visual context for the orbiter's other instruments that are trying to track down the locations on Mars where methane and other trace gases could be being released into the atmosphere.But when CaSSIS is not doing this tandem work, it is employed as a general purpose imager to study the geology of the planet.This colour-composite image of the floor of Kibuye Crater in Terra Sirenum highlights the rich variety of mineralogical composition found in the region's rocksA good example is the picture of the floor of Kibuye Crater in the region of Terra Sirenum, says Prof Nic Thomas from the University of Bern.""These places where you have a lot of colour diversity is indicating a lot of mineral diversity, and in different layers. This means we could be looking at sedimentary layers where deposition from water was a key process. And because CaSSIS has got this colour and stereo capability, people are really looking to use the camera on these sites,"" he told BBC News.The stereo allows scientists to build elevation models and work out how thick layers area.The crater just to the left of this image is called Jezero. It's where Nasa will send a rover in 2020. This is a red-blue stereo image that is best viewed with ""3D"" glassesThe Trace Gas Orbiter has been in its science orbit around Mars for almost a year now.One of its roles is to provide a communications relay for surface operations.The US space agency's Insight probe and its Curiosity rover will talk to Earth through the TGO.And when the joint European-Russian Rosalind Franklin rover arrives in 2021, it too will use the orbiter to transfer its data home.This image covers a portion of the wall-terrace region of the 100km-wide Columbus Crater. The white markings are salts that were deposited when lake water in the crater started to dry out, like a ""bath ring""This mysterious pattern was pictured on the crest of a ridge in the Terra Sabaea region of Mars.

science	New Horizons: Nasa probe survives flyby of Ultima Thule	Other stories on the BBC you might like:What's so special about the Kuiper belt?What does New Horizons do next?	"The US space agency's New Horizons probe has made contact with Earth to confirm its successful flyby of the icy world known as Ultima Thule.The encounter occurred some 6.5bn km (4bn miles) away, making it the most distant ever exploration of an object in our Solar System.New Horizons acquired gigabytes of photos and other observations during the pass.It will now send these home over the coming months.The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up by one of Nasa's big antennas, in Madrid, Spain.It had taken fully six hours and eight minutes to traverse the great expanse of space between Ultima and Earth.Controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland greeted the reception of the signal with cheers and applause.""We have a healthy spacecraft,"" announced Mission Operations Manager Alice Bowman. ""We've just accomplished the most distant flyby.""This first radio message contained only engineering information on the status of the spacecraft, but it included confirmation that New Horizons executed its autonomous flyby observations as instructed and that the probe's onboard memory was full.A later downlink on Tuesday will see some choice images returned to give scientists and the public a taster of what New Horizons saw through its cameras.If there is one note of caution it is that the timing and orientation of the spacecraft had to be spot on if the probe was not to shoot pictures of empty space! As a result, there will continue to be some anxiety until the data can be examined.""The highest resolution images taken at closest approach required perfect pointing, almost,"" said Project Scientist Hal Weaver. ""We think, based on everything we've seen so far, that was achieved.""Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto which New Horizons visited in 2015.It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.The vast separation between New Horizons and Earth, coupled with the probe's small, 15-watt transmitter, mean data rates are glacial, however.They top out at 1 kilobit per second. To retrieve all of the imagery stored on the probe is therefore expected to take until September 2020.The first of the very highest resolution pictures should come down to Earth in February. But this wouldn't delay the science, said Principal Investigator Alan Stern.""The [lower resolution] images that come down this week will already reveal the basic geology and structure of Ultima for us, and we're going to start writing our first scientific paper next week,"" he told reporters.Even just the final picture released from the approach phase to the flyby contained tantalising information. Ultima appears in it as just a blob, but immediately it has allowed researchers to refine their estimate of the object's size - about 35km by 15km.Several factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.One is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.Another factor is that Ultima is small (about 30km across), and this means it doesn't have the type of ""geological engine"" that in larger objects will rework their composition.And a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.Unlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.Alan Stern said: ""Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.""First, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.The hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.New Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.The longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.The two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.And in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.The BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Chang'e-4: China Moon probes take snaps of each other		"A Chinese rover and lander have taken images of each other on the Moon's surface.The Chinese space agency says the spacecraft are in good working order after touching down on the lunar far side on 3 January.Also released are new panoramic images of the landing site, along with video of the vehicles touching down.The rover and lander are carrying instruments to analyse the region's geology.The Chang'e-4 mission is the first to explore the Moon's far side from the surface.The rover has just awoken from a period on ""standby"".Controllers placed it in this mode shortly after the touchdown as a precaution against high temperatures, as the Sun rose to its highest point over the landing site.Those temperatures were expected to reach around 200C. But the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP) said that as of the morning of 11 January, the Yutu 2 rover, its lander and the relay satellite were all in a ""stable condition"".The panoramic images show parts of the static lander and the Yutu 2 (""jade rabbit"") rover, which is now exploring the landing site in Von Kármán crater.CLEP, which released the images, said in a statement: ""Researchers completed the preliminary analysis of the lunar surface topography around the landing site based on the image taken by the landing camera.""In contrast with previous images from the landing site, the panoramic image has been colour-corrected by Chinese researchers to better reflect the colours we would see if we were standing there.Online commentators had pointed out that these earlier, unprocessed images made the lunar landscape look reddish - a far cry from the gunpowder grey landscapes familiar from other missions to the surface.In an article for The Conversation, Prof Dave Rothery, from the Open University in Milton Keynes, observed: ""In the raw version, the lunar surface looks red because the detectors used were more sensitive to red than they were to blue or green.""Chang'e-4 was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China on 7 December. It touched down at 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT) on 3 January.Because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.The far side is more rugged, with a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the ""maria"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the more familiar near side.Because there's no way to establish a direct radio link to Earth from the far side, the spacecraft must bounce data off a relay satellite, called Queqiao (or magpie bridge), which orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a so-called Lagrange point.CLEP said: ""The ground receiving image was clear and intact, the Chinese and foreign scientific loads were working normally, and the detection data was valid.""Space News reported that the rover would be put into a dormant state on 12 January, to coincide with the lunar night-time, when temperatures could drop to around -180C.During this time, the rover would have limited functions.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Nasa's New Horizons: Best image yet of 'space snowman' Ultima Thule	What's so special about the Kuiper belt?	"The New Horizons probe has sent back its best picture yet of the small, icy object Ultima Thule, which it flew past on New Year's Day.The image was acquired when the Nasa spacecraft was just 6,700km from its target, which scientists think is two bodies lightly fused together - giving the look of a snowman.Surface details are now much clearer.New Horizons' data is coming back very slowly, over the next 20 months.This is partly to do with the great distance involved (the separation is 6.5 billion km) but is also limited by the small power output of the probe's transmitter and the size (and availability) of the receive antennas here on Earth. It all makes for glacial bit rates.The new image was obtained with New Horizons' wide-angle Multicolor Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) and gives a resolution of 135m per pixel. There is another version of this scene taken at even higher resolution by the probe's Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), but this has not yet been downlinked from the probe.When the best pictures from the moment of closest approach (a miss distance of 3,500km) are available, they should have resolutions of roughly 35m per pixel.But even in the latest MVIC observation, the new detail is fascinating.Ultima Thule's topography has now sharpened sufficiently for us to see the defined outline of a number of pits, especially along the day/night boundary, or terminator.For scale, the overall length of the snowman is about 33km.Researchers will have to determine whether the holes are impact craters or voids created by some other type of process - such as the escape of volatile materials.Ultima Thule, a conglomeration of ice and dust, orbits the Sun in a sparsely populated and low-energy environment known as the Kuiper belt.The chance of a collision with other objects ought therefore to be exceedingly low, but then this snowman was very probably created right at the start of Solar System formation and has had time to pick up at least a few scars.Several factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.One is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.Another factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of ""geological engine"" that in larger objects will rework their composition.And a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.Unlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.New Horizons' principal investigator Prof Alan Stern said: ""Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.""Did you catch the BBC's Sky At Night special on New Horizons' flyby of Ultima Thule?

science	Saturn's spectacular rings are 'very young'	Cassini: A mission of 'astonishing discovery'	"We're looking at Saturn at a very special time in the history of the Solar System, according to scientists.They've confirmed the planet's iconic rings are very young - no more than 100 million years old, when dinosaurs still walked the Earth.The insight comes from the final measurements acquired by the American Cassini probe.The satellite sent back its last data just before diving to destruction in the giant world's atmosphere in 2017.""Previous estimates of the age of Saturn's rings required a lot of modelling and were far more uncertain. But we now have direct measurements that allows us to constrain the age very well,"" Luciano Iess from Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, told BBC News.The professor's team has published an account of its work with Cassini in Science magazine.Cassini has been circling around Saturn for 13 yearsOn the icy moon Enceladus it discovered...an ocean of water hidden beneath the surfaceeight times as deep as the oceans on Earth.Cassini's chemical analysis of the water...suggests conditions could be right for micro-organisms to live there.While visiting Saturn's largest moonwhich is the size of the planet MercuryCassini flew over seas and lakes of methaneand discovered they are up to 170 metres deep.On Saturn itself, above the north poleCassini took photos of a hexagonal hurricane 32,000km across.Scientists have puzzled over how this giant storm spins.Cassini measured its winds at a staggering 330mphFour times as strong as a hurricane on Earth!Back out on the edge of one of Saturn's ringsamong the clouds of ice particlesCassini even captured the birth of a possible new moon.It's been named Peggy and is just 1km wide.Finally, running out of fuel,Cassini was flown directly towards the planetuntil it burnt up in Saturn's atmosphere.Cassini: A mission of 'astonishing discovery'Click next button to proceedLoading ...Swipe to progressImages: Nasa, KongleThere has long been a debate about the age of Saturn's rings. Some had argued these gorgeous loops of icy particles most likely formed along with the planet itself, some 4.5 billion years ago.Others had suggested they were a recent phenomenon - perhaps the crushed up remains of a moon or a passing comet that was involved in a collision.The US-European Cassini mission promised to resolve the argument in its last months at the gas giant.The satellite's end days saw it fly repeatedly through the gap between the rings and the planet's cloudtops.These manoeuvres made possible unprecedented gravity measurements.Cassini essentially weighed the rings, and found their mass to be 20 times smaller than previous estimates: something on the order of 15,400,000,000,000,000 tonnes, or about two-fifths the mass of Mimas - the Saturn moon that looks like the ""Death Star"" weapon in the Star Wars movies.Knowing the mass was a key piece in the puzzle for researchers.From Cassini's other instruments, they already knew the proportion of dust in the rings and the rate at which this dust was being added. Having a definitive mass for the rings then made it possible to work out an age.Prof Iess's team says this could be as young as 10 million years but is no older than 100 million years. In terms of the full age of the Solar System, this is ""yesterday"".The calculation agrees with one made by a different group which last month examined how fast the ring particles were falling on to Saturn - a rate that was described as being equivalent to an Olympic-sized swimming pool every half-hour.This flow, when all factors were considered, would probably see the rings disappear altogether in ""at most 100 million years"", said Dr Tom Stallard from Leicester University, UK.""The rings we see today are actually not that impressive compared with how they would have looked 50-100 million years ago,"" he told BBC News.""Back then they would have been even bigger and even brighter. So, whatever produced them must have made for an incredible display if you'd been an astronomer 100 million years ago.""Cassini's investigations cannot shed much light on the nature of the event that gave rise to the rings, but it would have been cataclysmic in scale.It was conceivable, said Dr Stallard, that the geology of the moons around Saturn could hold important clues. Just as rock and ice cores drilled on Earth reveal debris from ancient meteorite and comet impacts, so it's possible the moons of Saturn could record evidence of the ring-forming event in their deeper layers.Maybe we'll get to drill into the likes of Mimas and Enceladus... one day.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: Is nuclear power the answer?	Why is it bad for the environment?Can we get by without new nuclear?What are the alternatives?	"Nuclear is good for the environment. Nuclear is bad for the environment. Both statements are true.Why is it good? Nuclear power is planned to be a key part of the UK's energy mix.The key benefit is that it helps keep the lights on while producing hardly any of the CO2 emissions that are heating the climate.CO2 emissions come from traditional ways of creating electricity such as burning gas and coal.And the government is expected to have halted emissions almost completely by 2050, to help curb damage to the climate.Because major nuclear accidents are few and far between, but when they happen they create panic.Take the Fukushima explosions in 2011, which released radioactive material into the surrounding air in Japan. Or the Chernobyl accident in 1986, which spewed radioactive material across northern Europe.But arguably, the bigger environmental problem is what to do with nuclear waste.This is a very live issue in the UK, where contaminated material has been held in a temporary store at the Sellafield site in Cumbria.The government has been trying for years to secure a site with the right geology, offering cash sweeteners to local communities to host a permanent £12bn underground store for the most dangerous waste. So far no permanent dump has been agreed - that is after 70 years of nuclear power in the UK.""The UK policy identifying the need for nuclear to play a role alongside renewables has been supported by numerous independent studies,"" said a spokesperson for EDF, which is building the Hinkley C nuclear power plant.""Nuclear provides low-carbon electricity when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine.""Previously civil servants estimated that future UK electricity supplies would be divided up roughly 30/30/30 between nuclear, wind and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS).But no-one has been willing to invest at scale in the expensive CCS technology, which pumps CO2 emissions into rocks.Wind is ready to take its place in the sun. But with old nuclear stations closing, nuclear won't be able to fulfil its third of the deal unless new nuclear plants are built.The issue has caused a bitter divide between environmentalists, with some arguing that the risk from climate change is so severe that it's worth supping nuclear fuel, albeit with a long spoon.Others argue that the technology is dead and that renewables and other options can supply the UK's needs without the danger of nuclear accidents and waste.Prof Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, told BBC News: ""Most analysts now have accepted that we don't need 30% of energy from nuclear - renewables can take a substantially bigger share.""But taking any option off the table makes the job of meeting essential carbon targets even harder. It would certainly be hard to do without nuclear altogether.""The people who keep our lights on are looking to find ways of extending the life of existing nuclear plants, and trying to get nuclear power more cheaply.Factory-built small modular reactors that can be delivered on the back of a lorry are touted as one solution - but they are not expected to be operating at any scale until well into the 2030s. And what's more, with nuclear, bigger is generally better.Meanwhile, other options are being urgently explored. We need the power market to be more flexible. We need to develop better batteries and other techniques for storing power.And we need systems that will reduce the demand for electricity at peak times and transfer the demand to off-peak times when wind energy is plentiful and cheap.One particularly hard task is to find ways of storing power between months and even seasons.Last but by no means least, the government needs to prompt people to insulate their homes to reduce the demand for energy in the first place.The news that Hitachi is suspending work on a nuclear plant in north Wales has made all these tasks more urgent.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabinWhat do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

science	ExoMars: Life-detecting robot to be sent to Oxia Planum		"The robot rover that Europe and Russia will send to Mars in 2020 will be targeted at a near-equatorial site on the Red Planet known as Oxia Planum.The area was recommended by an expert panel meeting at Leicester University.Oxia is rich in clays and other minerals that have resulted from prolonged rock interactions with water.The ExoMars vehicle will carry a drill and sophisticated instruments to this ancient terrain to look for signs of past or even present life.Technically, Oxia remains just a recommendation at this stage; it still needs to be signed off by the heads of the European and Russian space agencies.But it is hard to see the considered view of the Landing Site Selection Working Group (LSSWG) being overturned.The two-day gathering in Leicester was informed by specialists in Mars geology, and engineers whose chief concern was identifying a location that minimised the risks of landing.Getting down safely to the surface of the Red Planet is notoriously difficult. More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.The most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.The LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.But this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.Both ""finalists"" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.Oxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.But it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.Observations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.Investigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.Researchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.Prof John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: ""With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.""The rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.The entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.One key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m. This extra altitude affords more time for a parachute to bite the atmosphere and slow the approach to the ground.The European-led rover is being assembled by Airbus at its UK manufacturing centre in Stevenage.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Antarctic Weddell expedition targets Shackleton's lost ship		"A scientific expedition in the Antarctic has set out on a quest to find Sir Ernest Shackleton's lost ship.The team has spent the past two weeks investigating the Larsen C Ice Shelf and the continent's biggest iceberg, known as A68.And this puts it just a few hundred km from the last recorded position of the famous British explorer's vessel, the Endurance.The polar steam-yacht was crushed in sea-ice and sank in November 1915.Shackleton's extraordinary escape from this loss, saving his crew, means there is considerable interest in finding the wreck.Endurance should be resting on the ocean floor, some 3,000m down.The Weddell Sea Expedition 2019 team wants to grab the chance of making the discovery, using robotic submersibles.On Sunday, the researchers announced that their work at Larsen and A68 was complete, and that they would now concentrate on finding the wreck.But the group will have a tough job reaching its presumed location, concedes chief scientist Prof Julian Dowdeswell.""We've got a journey of several hundred km from where we are now through really heavy and quite difficult sea-ice,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science programme last Thursday.""We shall do our best to get there with the excellent ice-breaker that we have, but in any given year it will be very difficult to judge whether you will be able to penetrate the sea-ice.""The team has a very good idea of where the Endurance should be.Shackleton's skipper on the vessel, Frank Worsley, was a highly skilled navigator, and used a sextant and chronometer to calculate the sinking's co-ordinates - 68°39'30.0"" South and 52°26'30.0"" West.The ship is almost certainly within a few nautical miles of this point.If Prof Dowdeswell's ice-breaker, the SA Agulhas II, can get reasonably close - it will be game-on.The American geophysical survey company Ocean Infinity is part of the Weddell Sea Expedition group. It has a Kongsberg Hugin autonomous underwater vehicle that it will deploy to map a 20km by 20km grid square on the ocean floor.If it succeeds in locating the Endurance, a remotely operated vehicle will then be sent down to photograph the wreck site.The organisms that normally consume sunken wooden ships do not thrive in the cold waters of the Antarctic, so there is optimism that Endurance's timbers are well preserved. That said, crushing forces had done quite a bit of damage to the vessel before she slipped below the floes.""I think that if we locate the Endurance, the greater likelihood will be that her hull is semi-upright and still in a semi-coherent state,"" commented marine archaeologist Mensun Bound.""However, on the evidence of the only deep-water wooden wreck I have been privileged to study, I must concede that there is every possibility that she could have been wrenched wide open by impact (with the seafloor), thus exposing her contents like a box of chocolates,"" he wrote on his expedition blog.Luck has been with the Weddell cruise so far.Attempts to get to Larsen C in recent years by other expeditions were thwarted by the sea-ice conditions, but the SA Agulhas II made the most of favourable circumstances to reach Larsen and complete an extensive range of studies.The ice shelf is the fourth largest such structure in the Antarctic.It is an amalgam of glacier fronts that have flowed off land and lifted up to form a floating platform.Similar shelves to the north have collapsed in past decades and researchers want to understand the current status and likely future prospects of Larsen C. Was the calving from the shelf of the monster berg A68 in July 2017 just part of a natural cycle, or an indication that changes are coming?""We have acquired detailed observations on the glaciology, oceanography, biology, and geology of the little known area around the Larsen C Ice shelf and the huge A68 iceberg,"" said Prof Dowdeswell, who is also the director of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, UK.""Analysis of this data will allow us to better understand the contemporary stability and past behaviour of Larsen C, with its wider implications for ice sheet stability more generally.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Israel's Beresheet spacecraft crashes on Moon	Why did it take weeks to get to the Moon?How hard was it to land?What was the spacecraft supposed to do on the Moon?How significant was this mission?	"The first privately funded mission to the Moon has crashed on the lunar surface after the apparent failure of its main engine.The Israeli spacecraft - called Beresheet - attempted a soft touchdown, but suffered technical problems on its descent to the lunar surface.The aim of the mission was to take pictures and conduct experiments.Only government space agencies from the former Soviet Union, the US and China have achieved soft lunar landings.Israel hoped to become the fourth country to do this.""We didn't make it, but we definitely tried,"" said project originator and major backer Morris Kahn.""I think that the achievement of getting to where we got is really tremendous; I think we can be proud,"" he said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, watching from the control room near Tel Aviv, said: ""If at first you don't succeed, you try again.""After a seven-week journey to the Moon, the robotic spacecraft approached a final orbit at 15km (9 miles) from the surface.Tensions were high in the command centre as communications were lost before Opher Doron, the general manager of Israel Aerospace Industries' space division, announced there had been a failure in the spacecraft.""We unfortunately have not managed to land successfully,"" he said.The audience outside had been through a turbulent journey themselves as they watched the first part of the landing go to plan.As Mr Doron announced that the engine had cut out, groans filled the room.""We are resetting the spacecraft to try to enable the engine,"" he said.The engine came on seconds later and the audience applauded, only for communication with the spacecraft to be lost shortly after. The mission was over.The project has cost about $100m (£76m) and has paved the way for future low-cost lunar exploration.Dr Kimberly Cartier, an astronomer and science news reporter, tweeted that she was ""sad about how #Beresheet ended"" but ""proud of the entire @TeamSpaceIL"".Beresheet, which is Hebrew for ""in the beginning"", was a joint project between SpaceIL, a privately funded Israeli non-profit organisation, and Israel Aerospace Industries.In space terms, the Moon is a mere hop from the Earth, and most missions take a few days to get there.But the Beresheet mission, which launched on 22 February from Cape Canaveral in Florida, spent weeks reaching its destination.Its journey took it on a series of ever-widening orbits around the Earth, before being captured by the Moon's gravity and moving into lunar orbit on 4 April.The average distance to the Moon is 380,000km (240,000 miles) - Beresheet travelled more than 15 times that distance. And the main thing driving this was cost.Instead of sitting alone on a rocket that would put it on the perfect trajectory to the Moon, it blasted off on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket along with a communications satellite and an experimental aircraft.Sharing the ride into space significantly reduced its launch costs - but it meant the spacecraft had to take a more convoluted route.A controlled landing on the lunar surface was the major challenge for the Israeli spacecraft.The engine was British-built, developed by Nammo in Westcott, Buckinghamshire. It provided the power to get the spacecraft all the way to the Moon, but it also took Beresheet on its final descent.The 1.5m-tall spacecraft had to rapidly reduce its speed, so a final firing of the engine in effect slammed on the brakes, hoping to take the spacecraft to a gentle stop.Before the landing, Rob Westcott, senior propulsion engineer at Nammo, said ""We've never used an engine in this kind of application before"".He said the big challenge would be ""the fact that the engine is going to have to be switched on and get very hot, then switched off for a short period of time when all that heat is remaining in its thermal mass, and then fired up again, very accurately and very precisely such that it slows the craft down and lands very softly on the surface on the Moon"".That landing process took around 20 minutes. All of the controls for this were uploaded and performed autonomously with mission control watching on.Its first job was to use its high-resolution cameras to take some photos - including a selfie - which it did manage before the crash.It was then going to measure the magnetic field of the spot it landed in, an area known as Mare Serenitatis.Monica Grady, professor of planetary and space science at Open University, said it would be ""looking at the landing site really closely"". This would help ""work out how the magnetic measurements of the Moon fit in with the geology and geography of the Moon, which is really important to understand how the Moon formed"".The lander also carried a reflector from Nasa to help scientists make accurate measurements of the distance between the Earth and the Moon.Temperatures on the Moon are extreme, and as the Sun rose the spacecraft would have been unlikely to survive the heat.Over 60 years of space exploration, only a few nations have made it down on to the Moon.The former Soviet Union achieved the first soft landing with its spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966. Nasa followed this by getting the first humans to the Moon in 1969. In 2008, India's space agency fired an impact probe, which intentionally crashed into the Moon's south pole. Then, China's Change-4 spacecraft touched down on the farside of the Moon earlier this year.If their landing had worked, Israel would have been the latest nation to join this elite club.But it was the low-price tag - and the fact that the mission was not funded by a major space agency - that was significant.Beresheet was not alone in pursuing low-cost lunar exploration.Its origins lie in the Google Lunar XPrize, an international challenge offering $20m for the first privately developed spacecraft to land on the Moon.And while the competition ended last year after no-one was able to meet its deadline (the foundation has subsequently announced they will award the Beresheet collaboration $1m for their achievement), other teams involved are also continuing with their efforts to get to the Moon.Both Nasa and Esa have also announced their intention to use commercial landers to deliver scientific payloads to the lunar surface.Follow Rebecca on Twitter."
science	Search for Shackleton's lost Endurance ship called off	What happened during the search this week?Why is the team not too downhearted?	"The attempt this week to find Sir Ernest Shackleton's missing ship, the Endurance, has ended - without success.A UK-led expedition to the Weddell Sea sent a sub to the ocean floor to look for the sunken polar yacht, but this robot was itself lost in the process.The team has now withdrawn from the area because of deteriorating weather and sea-ice conditions.Shackleton and his crew were forced to give up the Endurance in 1915 when frozen floes crushed its hull.Their escape across the Antarctic sea-ice on foot and in lifeboats is an astonishing story of fortitude and survival.The idea of finding the remains of the Endurance has captivated maritime historians and archaeologists for decades.""As a team we are clearly disappointed not to have been successful in our mission to find Endurance,"" said Mensun Bound, the director of exploration for the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019 group.""Like Shackleton before us, who described the graveyard of Endurance as 'the worst portion of the worst sea in the world', our well laid plans were overcome by the rapidly moving ice, and what Shackleton called 'the evil conditions of The Weddell Sea'.""The team, on its South African ice-breaker, the SA Agulhas II, arrived at the last-reported position of Endurance on Sunday.The researchers immediately set about putting down an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to go map a wide grid in waters that are 3,000m deep. But just as this submersible was coming to the end of its more than 30-hour dive, the communication link to the Agulhas failed.It is not clear if this was the result of just the difficult sea-ice conditions, or component failure on the sub, or even the robot colliding with an obstruction. Although the last possibility seems very unlikely given how flat the seafloor is known to be in this region of the Antarctic.It is conceivable of course that by the time of the break in communications, the sub had already captured images of Endurance in the Weddell sediments - but that will never be known. An AUV has to be recovered first for its scan data to be pulled off and examined.The US company Ocean Infinity ran the AUV dive. Its representative Oliver Plunkett said: ""Everyone at Ocean Infinity is deeply disappointed that at the eleventh hour, we were not able to produce the images of what is without doubt the most challenging shipwreck in the world to locate.""We understood the risks of pushing the boundaries of what's been done before with technology operating in the harshest environment on the planet. Our team worked tirelessly throughout and are rightly entitled to celebrate what they achieved in advancing knowledge and understanding.""The search for Shackleton's ship was an ""extra"" for the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019. Its main purpose for being in the region was to study the nearby Larsen C Ice Shelf, which in 2017 calved the monster iceberg known as A68.Understanding the climate interactions in this part of the world is imperative, and the Larsen investigation, completed at the end of January, is said to have been hugely productive, with an AUV acquiring remarkable imagery of the seafloor under the shelf.Expedition chief scientist Prof Julian Dowdeswell commented: ""Through the scientific data gathered during the expedition, we have deepened our knowledge and understanding of Antarctic oceanography and ecosystems, and our observations on the glaciology and geology will play a critical role in our understanding of Antarctic ice shelves and sea-ice and, importantly, the changes that are occurring here today.""The story of Shackleton's ill-fated 1914 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition has become the stuff of legend, and is even used at business schools in examples of different approaches to staff management.The Irish-born explorer had wanted to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. He knew it would be tough, which prompted the now famous crew recruitment advert:""Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success."" (Although often cited, there are doubts that this advert ever appeared.)The expedition never got to begin its traverse because the Endurance was captured by the Weddell's thick floes in early 1915.The 44m-long steam yacht drifted for nine months before the pressure of the ice holed the hull and floodwater took it under.Shackleton and his 27-man crew made their escape northwards, dragging their lifeboats across the pack ice in those places where they couldn't sail on the sea surface.They managed first to get to Elephant Island, at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, from where Shackleton then set off with five others to try to reach South Georgia to get help.He succeeded, despite having to navigate across 1,000km of the Southern Ocean in a tiny boat.Even when Shackleton arrived at the British Overseas Territory, he had to climb a set of mountains because the whaling stations that would come to his aid were on the far side of the island.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Chang'e-4: China mission launches to far side of Moon	Seed experimentChina's lunar ambitions	"China has launched the first mission to land a robotic craft on the far side of the Moon, Chinese media say.The Chang'e-4 mission will see a static lander and rover touch down in Von Kármán crater, located on the side of the Moon which never faces Earth.The payload blasted off atop a Long March 3B rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center.The mission will pave the way for the country to deliver samples of Moon rock and soil to Earth.The landing will not occur until early January, when the probe will descend on thrusters and touch down on the rugged terrain of the lunar far side.Von Kármán crater is of interest to scientists because it is located within the oldest and largest impact feature on the Moon - the South Pole-Aitken Basin. This was probably formed by a giant asteroid impact billions of years ago.The landers will characterise the region's geology and the composition of rock and soil.Because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one ""face"" of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.Though often referred to as the ""dark side"", this face of the Moon is also illuminated by the Sun and has the same phases as the near side; ""dark"" in this context simply means ""unseen"".The far side looks rather different to the more familiar near side. It has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also few of the ""mare"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.The powerful impact that created the South Pole Aitken Basin may have punched through the crust down to the Moon's mantle layer. Chang'e-4's instruments could examine whether this was the case, shedding light on the early history of our only natural satellite.The mission will also characterise the ""radio environment"" on the far side, a test designed to lay the groundwork for the creation of future radio astronomy telescopes on the far side, which is shielded from the radio noise of Earth.The static lander will carry a 3kg (6.6lb) container with potato and arabidopsis plant seeds to perform a biological experiment. The ""lunar mini biosphere"" experiment was designed by 28 Chinese universities.""We want to study the respiration of the seeds and the photosynthesis on the Moon,"" Liu Hanlong, chief director of the experiment and vice president of Chongqing University, told the state-run Xinhua news agency earlier this year.Xie Gengxin, chief designer of the experiment, told Xinhua: ""We have to keep the temperature in the 'mini biosphere' within a range from 1 degree to 30 degrees, and properly control the humidity and nutrition. We will use a tube to direct the natural light on the surface of Moon into the tin to make the plants grow.""Because the landers on the far side have no line of sight with our planet, they must send data back via a relay satellite named Queqiao, launched by China in May this year.The probe's design is based on that of its predecessor, Chang'e-3, which deployed landing craft to the Moon's Mare Imbrium region in 2013. However, it has some important modifications.The lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform the low-frequency radio astronomy observations.The rover will carry a panoramic camera; a radar to probe beneath the lunar surface; an imaging spectrometer to identify minerals; and an experiment to examine the interaction of the solar wind (a stream of energised particles from the Sun) with the lunar surface.The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Planet Venus: Hopes rise of new mission to the hothouse world	Historic missionsLost waterTectonic activityToffee planet	"The longstanding idea that Venus is geologically dead is a ""myth"", scientists say.And new research may be on the verge of ending that perception forever.Hints of ongoing volcanic and tectonic activity (activity in the planet's outer shell) suggest that, while different to the Earth, the planet is very much alive.Now scientists are building new narratives to explain the planet's landscape.This includes an idea that proposes the existence of ""toffee planets"". This theory incorporates knowledge accumulated through studying exoplanets.The new ideas have been discussed here at the 50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) in The Woodlands, Texas.The focus on Mars over the last few decades has transformed our view of that planet's geology.In the meantime, the researchers who study Venus's surface have relied heavily on data from Magellan - a Nasa mission that ended in 1994. A European mission, Venus Express, and a Japanese spacecraft, Akatsuki, have been there since, but both are focused on atmospheric science.After years of feeling like a new mission would never happen, there is a sense that the tide might finally be turning.The European Space Agency (Esa) is evaluating a Venus mission, called EnVision, alongside two astronomy proposals - Theseus and Spica. Other concepts are also being proposed to Nasa.Early career researchers are now choosing to join the field again in numbers. And scientists with backgrounds in other disciplines are lending their expertise, bringing new ideas.Venus is a hothouse world, with a surface temperature of 500C - hot enough to melt lead. But it's not just the heat that makes it inhospitable: the planet's thick atmosphere has cranked the surface pressure up to 90 bars. That's the equivalent to what you'd experience 900m below the sea.But Venus and Earth started out being much more similar. ""They probably started out as twins, but they've diverged,"" said Dr Richard Ghail, from Royal Holloway, University of London, who is the principal investigator on EnVision.""The Earth in that time has gained oxygen and life and has - essentially - quite a cold climate, whereas Venus has got incessantly hotter and drier over a long period.""Like Mars, then, Venus might even have had the right conditions in the past for life. But Dr Ghail says that while the Red Planet could have hosted large bodies of water on its surface for about 100 million years, Venus could have harboured oceans for more than a billion years of its early history.How and when it lost that water is just one of the puzzles scientists want new missions to shed light on. It's fate might even present an extreme future pathway for the Earth.The history of Venus exploration with robotic probes goes back more than 50 years. If the US has become synonymous with Mars exploration, it was the Soviets who stamped their mark on our nearest neighbour in the 1960s, 70s and 80s.They launched nearly 30 probes towards the planet, with several notable failures. But the successful missions sent back crucial data, including images of the surface. One probe made a detection of what could have been lightning, while others analysed rock samples, which were found to be basalts - similar to general types found on Earth.Part of the resurgence of interest in Venus centres around the type of geological activity going on, and what it may tell us about rocky planets in general.Venus is thought to lack plate tectonics, the process responsible for recycling the Earth's crust. But the notion that Venus has essentially been ""dead"" since an outpouring of volcanism hundreds of millions of years ago is incorrect in the view of a growing number of researchers.Many signs of tectonic activity on Earth, such as networks of ridges and faults, can be found on Venus.Dr Ghail has identified signs that Venus's crust is broken up into blocks measuring on the order of 500-1,000km across, which move around slowly in much the same way that pack ice floats on an ocean, pushing and rubbing against each other. The process is driven by convection (the process of heat transfer which pushes hotter material upwards and cooler, denser material down) in the mantle region below the crust.""They are moving into the block next to them, and that's moving the block next to it and so on. You can link those things together and see that everything is moving towards Ishtar in the northern hemisphere,"" the Royal Holloway researcher told BBC News.Ishtar Terra is one of the main highland regions of Venus, sometimes described as a ""continent"".""I think you take enough pack ice, you squeeze it into one place, thicken it up and you make a big high plateau,"" Dr Ghail explained.Dr Paul K Byrne, from North Carolina State University, says this idea might fit in well with a theory he has been developing about the relationship between the thickness of the lithosphere, the rigid outer shell of a planet, and its gravity.""The basic thinking is this: because on a world with lower gravity, you might get a thicker layer, we reasoned that if you've got higher gravity - like a Super Earth (a class of medium-sized planet seen around other stars but not in the Solar System) - then that brittle layer would be proportionally thinner.""He calculates that particular combinations of planetary mass, atmospheric pressure and composition, as well as the distance of a planet to its star, can produce something called a toffee planet, where the lithosphere is very thin.""For example, one of the ways that lava might come up is that magma will rise to some depth and make its way through fractures or dykes. But if you don't have a thick layer… then it won't come up in that nice easy way. It might come up in a larger mass, but it won't be concentrated so you won't expect to find chains of volcanoes,"" Dr Byrne explained.With regards to Venus, he said: ""Some parts of Venus we think might be quite thick, but some parts of Venus, in the lowlands, the brittle layer might be quite thin.""Under that scenario, the idea of blocks of crust moving like pack-ice becomes plausible, said Dr Byrne. If selected, EnVision will carry a synthetic aperture radar to test some of these ideas.""I think this is happening, other people think nothing's happening. The other possibility is that it's really Earth-like and really active… the only way to distinguish between those is with radar. We do that routinely on Earth, so let's take an Earth-observation radar to Venus,"" said Dr Ghail.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	New Horizons: Nasa waits for signal from Ultima Thule probe		"The American space agency is waiting for a signal from its New Horizons probe to confirm that it has made a successful flyby of Ultima Thule.The craft should have hurtled by the 30km-wide icy object earlier on Tuesday, acquiring a swathe of pictures and other scientific measurements.At 6.5 billion km from Earth, the encounter is the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System body.The ""phone home"" message should be picked up by Nasa around 15:30 GMT.It is expected to tell controllers that New Horizons is healthy and that its memory banks are full of data.Some choice pictures will then be downlinked for public release, most probably on Wednesday.Ultima is in what's termed the Kuiper belt - the band of frozen material that orbits the Sun more than 2 billion km (1.25bn miles) further out than the eighth of the classical planets, Neptune; and 1.5 billion km beyond even the dwarf planet Pluto, which New Horizons visited in 2015.It's estimated there are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to the formation conditions of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.""Go New Horizons!"" enthused chief scientist Alan Stern at 05:33 GMT, the moment when the spacecraft would have been at its closest point to Ultima Thule in the flyby sequence.""Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away.""Earlier, he said: ""I'd be kidding you though if I didn't tell you that we're also on pins and needles to see how this turns out.""We only get one shot at it. Nothing like this has ever been done before, and with any enterprise like this - there comes risk,"" he told reporters.The risk is that New Horizons runs into fragments of ice or rock in the vicinity of Ultima.With the spacecraft moving at 14km/s, even particles the size of a grain of rice would shred its interior components.New Horizons was programmed to get as close as 3,500km to Ultima's surface, and to observe its rotation, geology, composition and environment.Scientists want to know in particular how such far-off worlds were assembled. One idea is that they grew from the mass accretion of a blizzard of pebble-sized icy grains. This could say something about how all planetary bodies came into being at the start of the Solar System some 4.6 billion years ago - including the Earth.But the researchers will have to be patient. Because of the great separation between the New Horizons and Earth, transmissions take over six hours to arrive home.The data rates from New Horizons' 15-watt transmitter are also glacial as a consequence. Information trickles into Nasa's big antenna network at a maximum of 1,000 bits per second.New Horizons has had its long-range camera trained on the object since August. But only on the eve of closest approach did Ultima really start to make an impression in images.Mission scientist John Spencer presented a picture acquired on Sunday from a distance of 1.9 million km. It represented at that moment the best ever view of Ultima.""It's a blob, only a couple of pixels across,"" he said. ""But you can see from that blob that it's an elongated blob; it's not round. And so we're already seeing there is some interesting shape to this thing.""When the pictures taken at closest approach are returned, they should achieve a best resolution of about 33m per pixel - more than sufficient to trace different features on Ultima's surface.Mission control for the project is based at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. It got a sprinkle of celebrity stardust on Monday with the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May.The rock legend has written a song for New Horizons, and with a PhD in astrophysics he also plans to work on some of the probe's images.""[New Horizons at Ultima Thule] touches me because it's very emblematic in my mind of the human spirit having a need and a desire to reach out,"" he told BBC News. ""To me the song is about that quality in human beings that makes them question and makes them want to understand the Universe they live in.""The BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT. Presenter Chris Lintott will review the event and discuss some of the new science to emerge from the encounter with the New Horizons team.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Genetic secret of English salmon		"The salmon from the chalk streams of southern England appear to be genetically distinct from others.Evidence published in the Journal of Fish Biology suggests they may be a separate sub-species of Atlantic salmon.Scientists argue that the fish may need greater protection, because they would be impossible to replace with salmon from elsewhere in Europe.Many chalk streams are designated sites of special scientific interest.These meandering streams that flow through chalk hills generally have clear, slow-flowing water and are more alkaline than other waters.Scientists think the geology and chemistry of the rivers may affect the distribution of different salmon populations.Researchers studied salmon in stretches of five rivers in Hampshire and Dorset, where salmon have returned to breed for thousands of years.The rivers include the Frome, Piddle, Avon, Test and Itchen.The study found salmon in the rivers were genetically distinct from those in non chalk-stream rivers close by.""The fish in the chalk streams of Dorset and Hampshire are as different from their cousins elsewhere in Britain as they are to cousins much further afield, such as the Baltic,"" said Dr Jamie Stevens of the University of Exeter.Populations of salmons in chalk streams have plummeted in recent decades.The researchers say the rivers are under ""massive pressure"" from human activity.""The fish in these rivers seem to contain a unique component of the overall genetic diversity of the species,"" said Dr Stevens.""This makes them highly valuable; and it also makes them vulnerable. Because if they were to be lost through effects on their habitat or pollution it would be almost impossible to restock those chalk streams.""Like other salmon, those from chalk streams spend long periods at sea and swim hundreds of miles, but return to the rivers where they were born.Most of the world's chalk streams are found in the UK, but they are at risk of pollution as they pass through urban areas and through farmland.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Ancient sea reptile was one of the largest animals ever	Severn CrossingExtinction stories	Sea reptiles the size of whales swam off the English coast while dinosaurs walked the land, according to a new fossil discovery.The jaw bone, found on a Somerset beach, is giving clues to the ''last of the giants'' that roamed the oceans 205 million years ago.The one-metre-long bone came from the mouth of a huge predatory ichthyosaur.The creature would have been one of the largest ever known, behind only blue whales and dinosaurs, say scientists.The ancient jawbone was found near the village of Lilstock by fossil collector Paul de la Salle.He first thought it was a piece of rock but after seeing a distinctive ''groove and bone structure'' realised it might be part of an ichthyosaur.Dean Lomax, a world leading expert on ichthyosaurs from the University of Manchester, compared the bone with other specimens.''It was a giant piece of mandible from an ichthyosaur,'' the palaeontologist told BBC News.''We were mind blown to think that a sea creature the size of a blue whale was swimming off the English coast about 200 million years ago.''The discovery, reported in the journal, PLOS One, also clears up another long-standing mystery.In 1850, a large bone was found at Aust Cliff below the Severn Bridge in Gloucestershire.Prehistoric reptile's last meal revealed'Sea dragon' fossils 'new to science''Sea dragon' fossil 'largest on record'Scientists have been unable to work-out whether the fossil and several other large bones found at the site came from a dinosaur or from a mystery reptile.The two fossil experts now believe the Aust bones are also jaw bones from a giant, previously unrecognised ichthyosaur.''Every fossil tells a story,'' said Dean Lomax. ''It shows there are these things out there - hopefully someone's going to find a whole one.''During the age of the dinosaurs, the ocean was home to many types of ichthyosaur.They appeared in the Triassic, reached their peak in the Jurassic, then disappeared in the Cretaceous - several million years before the last dinosaurs died out.Ichthyosaurs were among the first skeletons to be discovered by early fossil-hunters, at a time when theories of evolution and concepts of geology were starting to take shape.The fossil hunter Mary Anning discovered the first complete fossil of an ichthyosaur in the cliffs near Lyme Regis, Dorset, in 1810.Her discovery shook up the scientific world and provided evidence for new ideas about the history of the Earth.Follow Helen on Twitter.
science	Nasa's New Horizons: 'Snowman' shape of distant Ultima Thule revealed	You might also like:What's so special about the Kuiper belt?What does New Horizons do next?	"The small, icy world known as Ultima Thule has finally been revealed.A new picture returned from Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft shows it to be two objects joined together - to give a look like a ""snowman"".The US probe's images acquired as it approached Ultima hinted at the possibility of a double body, but the first detailed picture from Tuesday's close flyby confirms it.New Horizons encountered Ultima 6.5 billion km from Earth.The event set a record for the most distant ever exploration of a Solar System object. The previous mark was also set by New Horizons when it flew past the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.But Ultima is 1.5 billion km further out.It orbits the Sun in a region of the Solar System known as the Kuiper belt - a collection of debris and dwarf planets.There are hundreds of thousands of Kuiper members like Ultima, and their frigid state almost certainly holds clues to how all planetary bodies came into being some 4.6 billion years ago.The mission team thinks the two spheres that make up this particular object probably joined right at the beginning, or very shortly after.The scientists have decided to call the larger lobe ""Ultima"", and the smaller lobe ""Thule"". The volume ratio is three to one.Jeff Moore, a New Horizons co-investigator from Nasa's Ames Research Center, said the pair would have come together at very low speed, at maybe 2-3km/h. He joked: ""If you had a collision with another car at those speeds you may not even bother to fill out the insurance forms.""The new data from Nasa's spacecraft also shows just how dark the object is. Its brightest areas reflect just 13% of the light falling on them; the darkest, just 6%. That's similar to potting soil, said Cathy Olkin, the mission's deputy project scientist from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI).It has a tinge of colour, however. ""We had a rough colour from Hubble but now we can definitely say that Ultima Thule is red,"" added colleague Carly Howett, also from SwRI.""Our current theory as to why Ultima Thule is red is the irradiation of exotic ices."" Essentially, its surface has been ""burnt"" over the eons by the high-energy cosmic rays and X-rays that flood space.Principal Investigator Alan Stern paid tribute to the skill of his team in acquiring the image as New Horizons flew past the object, reaching 3,500km from its surface at closest approach.The probe had to target Ultima very precisely to be sure of getting it centre-frame in the view of the cameras and other instruments onboard.""[Ultima's] only really the size of something like Washington DC, and it's about as reflective as garden variety dirt, and it's illuminated by a Sun that's 1,900 times fainter than it is outside on a sunny day here on the Earth. We were basically chasing it down in the dark at 32,000mph (51,000km/h) and all that had to happen just right,"" the SwRI scientist said.Less than 1% of all the data gathered by New Horizons during the flyby has been downlinked to Earth. The slow data-rates from the Kuiper belt mean it will be fully 20 months before all the information is pulled off the spacecraft.The best of the pictures shared by the team on Wednesday were taken while the probe was still 28,000km from Ultima and discern surface features larger than 140m across. Pictures are expected in February that were captured at the moment of closest approach and these will have a resolution of about 35m per pixel.Several factors make Ultima Thule, and the domain in which it moves, so interesting to scientists.One is that the Sun is so dim in this region that temperatures are down near 30-40 degrees above absolute zero - the lower end of the temperature scale and the coldest atoms and molecules can possibly get. As a result, chemical reactions have essentially stalled. This means Ultima is in such a deep freeze that it is probably perfectly preserved in the state in which it formed.Another factor is that Ultima is small (about 33km in the longest dimension), and this means it doesn't have the type of ""geological engine"" that in larger objects will rework their composition.And a third factor is just the nature of the environment. It's very sedate in the Kuiper belt.Unlike in the inner Solar System, there are probably very few collisions between objects. The Kuiper belt hasn't been stirred up.Prof Stern said: ""Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima - from its composition to its geology, to how it was originally assembled, whether it has satellites and an atmosphere, and that kind of thing - is going to teach us about the original formation conditions in the Solar System that all the other objects we've gone out and orbited, flown by and landed on can't tell us because they're either large and evolve, or they are warm. Ultima is unique.""First, the scientists must work on the Ultima data, but they will also ask Nasa to fund a further extension to the mission.The hope is that the course of the spacecraft can be altered slightly to visit at least one more Kuiper belt object sometime in the next decade.New Horizons should have just enough fuel reserves to be able to do this. Critically, it should also have sufficient electrical reserves to keep operating its instruments into the 2030s.The longevity of New Horizon's plutonium battery may even allow it to record its exit from the Solar System.The two 1970s Voyager missions have both now left the heliosphere - the bubble of gas blown off our Sun (one definition of the Solar System's domain). Voyager 2 only recently did it, in November.And in case you were wondering, New Horizons will never match the Voyagers in terms of distance travelled from Earth. Although New Horizons was the fastest spacecraft ever launched in 2006, it continues to lose ground to the older missions. The reason: the Voyagers got a gravitational speed boost when they passed the outer planets. Voyager-1 is now moving at almost 17km/s; New Horizons is moving at 14km/s.The BBC's Sky At Night programme will broadcast a special episode on the flyby on Sunday 13 January on BBC Four at 22:30 GMT.

science	Prehistoric reptile's last meal revealed		"The fossil of a marine reptile that lived 199 million years ago has been identified as a newborn that ate squid as its last meal.The reptile was an ichthyosaur, which gave birth to live young.It belongs to the group Ichthyosaurus communis, which was the first species of ichthyosaur to be recognised by science in 1821.The ""exceptional"" specimen is the first juvenile of its species to be identified, say researchers.The reptile had remnants of squid inside its stomach when it died.""Many tiny hook-like structures are preserved between the ribs,"" said Dean Lomax of the University of Manchester, UK.""These are from the arms of prehistoric squid. So, we know this animal's last meal before it died was squid.""Ichthyosaurs occupy a special place in the history of fossil collecting in the UK.Many of the first specimens were collected along the Dorset coast or in quarries in Somerset in the 19th Century.About 1,000 fossils are held in museums and other collections around the world. Yet, there are very few specimens of newborns and most are incomplete.The specimen was identified as a juvenile from the shape of its skull bones.""This specimen is practically complete and is exceptional,"" said Dean Lomax.Nigel Larkin of the University of Cambridge recognised the importance of the fossil when he was examining specimens from the Lapworth Museum of Geology at the University of Birmingham.However, there was no record of where the fossil was collected or its age.Researchers at the University of Birmingham analysed a tiny section of rock around the skeleton for the presence of microfossils.They deduced that the ichthyosaur hails from around 199-196 million years ago. The signature of the rock suggests it originally came from what is now Gloucestershire.""Many historic ichthyosaur specimens in museums lack any geographic or geological details and are therefore undated,"" said Nigel Larkin. ""This process of looking for microfossils in their host rock might be the key to unlocking the mystery of many specimens.""The study has been published in the journal Historical Biology.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	China Moon mission lands Chang'e-4 spacecraft on far side	Why is this Moon landing so significant?What else might we learn from this mission?Is there a 'dark side of the Moon'?How will scientists keep track of the rover?What are China's plans in space?	"China says it has successfully landed a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the Moon, the first ever such attempt and landing.At 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT), the un-crewed Chang'e-4 probe touched down in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, state media said.It is carrying instruments to analyse the unexplored region's geology, as well to conduct biological experiments.The landing is being seen as a major milestone in space exploration.There have been numerous missions to the Moon in recent years, but the vast majority have been to orbit, fly by or impact. The last crewed landing was Apollo 17 in 1972.Why China has its eye on the starsThe Chang'e-4 probe has already sent back its first pictures from the surface, which were shared by state media.With no direct communication link possible, all pictures and data have to be bounced off a separate satellite before being relayed to Earth.Previous Moon missions have landed on the Earth-facing side, but this is the first time any craft has landed successfully on the unexplored and rugged far side.Some spacecraft have crashed into the far side, either after system failures, or after they had completed their mission.Ye Quanzhi, an astronomer at Caltech, told the BBC this was the first time China had ""attempted something that other space powers have not attempted before"".The Chang'e-4 was launched from Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China on 7 December; it arrived in lunar orbit on 12 December.It was then directed to lower itself toward the Moon, being careful to identify and avoid obstacles, Chinese state media say.The Chang'e-4 probe is aiming to explore a place called the Von Kármán crater, located within the much larger South Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin - thought to have been formed by a giant impact early in the Moon's history.""This huge structure is over 2,500km (1,550 miles) in diameter and 13km deep, one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System and the largest, deepest and oldest basin on the Moon,"" Andrew Coates, professor of physics at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey, told the BBC.The event responsible for carving out the SPA basin is thought to have been so powerful, it punched through the Moon's crust and down into the zone called the mantle. Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity.The science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin, allowing them to identify variations in its composition.A third objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon.Chang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations.Scientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth. The spectrometer work will aim to test this idea.The lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere.The arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say.Other equipment/experiments include:The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.The lunar far side is often referred to as the ""dark side"", though ""dark"" in this case means ""unseen"" rather than ""lacking light"". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime.But because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.The far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the ""maria"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.In an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: ""The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link.""So the landers must communicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao - or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May.Queqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina.China wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia.In 2017 it announced it was planning to send astronauts to the Moon.It will also begin building its own space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022.The chief designer of China's lunar exploration programme, Wu Weiren, has described Thursday's landing as ""an important milestone"" for the country's space effort, state media report.The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says the propaganda value of China's leaps forward in its space programme has been tempered by careful media management. There was very little news of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt before the official announcement it had been a success.But Fred Watson, who promotes Australia's astronomy endeavours as its astronomer-at-large, says the secrecy could simply be down to caution, similar to that shown by the Soviet Union in the early days of its competition with Nasa.""The Chinese space agency is a young organisation, but perhaps in years to come, it will catch up,"" he told the BBC.Ye Quanzhi says China has made efforts to be more open.""They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,"" he said.China has been a late starter when it comes to space exploration. Only in 2003, it sent its first astronaut into orbit, making it the third country to do so, after the Soviet Union and the US.The far side landing has already been heralded by experts at Nasa as ""a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment""."
science	'Sea dragon' fossil is 'largest on record'		The fossil of a marine reptile ''re-discovered'' in a museum is the largest of its kind on record, say scientists.The ''sea dragon'' belongs to a group that swam the world's oceans 200 million years ago, while dinosaurs walked the land.The specimen is the largest Ichthyosaurus to be described, at more than three metres long.It was discovered on the coast of England more than 20 years ago, but has remained unstudied until now.Palaeontologist Sven Sachs saw the fossil on display at a museum in Hannover. He contacted UK palaeontologist, Dean Lomax, who is an expert on Ichthyosaurs.''It amazes me that specimens such as this [the biggest] can still be 'rediscovered' in museum collections,'' said the University of Manchester palaeontologist.''You don't necessarily have to go out in the field to make a new discovery.''The reptile belongs to the species, Ichthyosaurus somersetensis, which is named after the county in south west England where many ancient marine reptile specimens have been unearthed.It was dug up at Doniford Bay, Somerset, in the 1990s and eventually found its way into the collections of the Lower Saxony State Museum in Hannover.The reptile was an adult female that was pregnant at the time of death.''This specimen provides new insights into the size range of the species, but also records only the third example of an Ichthyosaurus known with an embryo,'' added Dean Lomax. ''That's special.''During the age of the dinosaurs, the ocean was home to many types of ichthyosaur or ''sea dragon''.They appeared in the Triassic, reached their peak in the Jurassic, then disappeared in the Cretaceous - several million years before the last dinosaurs died out.Ichthyosaurs were among the first skeletons to be discovered by early fossil-hunters, at a time when theories of evolution and concepts of geology were in their infancy.The famous fossil hunter Mary Anning discovered the first complete fossil of an ichthyosaur in the cliffs near Lyme Regis, Dorset, in 1810.Her discovery shook up the scientific world and provided evidence for new ideas about the history of the Earth.The study is published in the journal, Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.Follow Helen on Twitter.
science	New Horizons: Pluto's surface sharpens for Nasa probe		"As New Horizons bears down on Pluto, its images just get sharper and sharper.The probe's latest picture released on Saturday has started to give scientists some real indications of the geology on the dwarf world.The new black-and-white view reveals a vast band of patterned terrain stretching around the globe for roughly 1,500km.Nasa's spacecraft is due to flyby the distant mini-planet on Tuesday.When it does so, it will be just 12,500km above the surface.At that point, its telescopic camera, Lorri, will be acquiring images at a resolution that is better than 100m per pixel.But for the moment, features still have a rather blurred look about them.This latest shot from Lorri was taken on Thursday when New Horizons was still 5.4 million km from its target.At this distance, the resolution is 27km per pixel. Nonetheless, even at this range, there is plenty to excite the geologists.You can still see just below the patterned band the very dark terrain that scientists have dubbed ""the whale"". Not visible any more, however, is the very bright region that looked like a heart in earlier images. This has rotated out of view.It will, though, come back around, and will be the face of the 2,300km-wide world that is presented to New Horizons at closest approach.""Among the structures tentatively identified in this new image are what appear to be polygonal features; a complex band of terrain stretching east-northeast across the planet, approximately 1,000 miles long; and a complex region where bright terrains meet the dark terrains of the whale,"" said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern.New Horizons was launched from Earth in 2006. It is set to gather hundreds of pictures and other types of research data as it sweeps past Pluto and its five moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.The probe's difficulty is getting all that information back to Earth. The distance to the dwarf is vast - more than 4.7 billion km - and this makes for very low bit rates.The mission team expects it to take 16 months to return all the science from the flyby.The BBC will be screening a special Sky At Night programme called Pluto Revealed on Monday 20 July, which will recap all the big moments from the New Horizons flyby.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Chang'e-4: Chinese rover now exploring Moon	Why is this Moon landing so significant?What else might we learn from this mission?Is there a 'dark side of the Moon'?How will scientists keep track of the rover?What are China's plans in space?	"A Chinese robotic rover has got its wheels dirty after rolling off its landing craft and onto the lunar soil.The Chang'e-4 spacecraft touched down on the far side of the Moon at 10:26 Beijing time (02:26 GMT) on Thursday.Lunar exploration chief Wu Weiren echoed Neil Armstrong's famous quote, telling state media the event marked a ""huge stride"" for China.The rover and lander are carrying instruments to analyse the unexplored region's geology.It represents the first ever such attempt and landing on the far side of the Moon, which has distinct characteristics to the near side we can see from Earth.According to the Guardian newspaper, Weiren told the state broadcaster CCTV: ""The separation of Chang'e 4's rover was smooth and perfect.""""The rover rolled only a small step on to the Moon, but it represented a huge stride for the Chinese nation.""The rover touched the lunar surface at 22:22 Beijing time (14:22 GMT), about 12 hours after the landing.The event was captured by the camera on the lander and the images were sent back to the Earth via the relay satellite ""Queqiao"", China's Xinhua state news agency reported.China has also chosen a name for the rover - Yutu 2 - following a worldwide poll to name the rover in August.In Chinese folklore, Yutu is the white pet rabbit of Chang'e, the moon goddess who lent her name to the Chinese lunar mission.The number two at the end of the name acknowledges its predecessor, a Chinese rover called Yutu which touched down at Mare Imbrium on the Moon's near side in 2013.What does China want to do on the Moon's far side?Why China has its eye on spacePrevious Moon missions have landed on the Earth-facing side, but this is the first attempt to explore the rugged far side from the surface.Some spacecraft have crashed into the far side, either after system failures, or after they had completed their mission.Ye Quanzhi, an astronomer at Caltech, told the BBC this was the first time China had ""attempted something that other space powers have not attempted before"".Landing on the far side isn't fundamentally different to landing on the near side of the Moon.

Researchers will want to train the instruments on any mantle rocks exposed by the calamity.The science team also hopes to study parts of the sheet of melted rock that would have filled the newly formed South Pole-Aitken Basin, allowing them to identify variations in its composition.Another objective is to study the far-side regolith, the broken up rocks and dust that make up the surface, which will help us understand the formation of the Moon.Chang'e-4's static lander is carrying two cameras; a German-built radiation experiment called LND; and a spectrometer that will perform low-frequency radio astronomy observations.Scientists believe the far side could be an excellent place to perform low-frequency radio astronomy, because it is shielded from the radio noise of Earth.The lander also carried a container with six live species from Earth - cotton, rapeseed, potato, fruit fly, yeast and arabidopsis (a flowering plant) - to try to form a mini biosphere.The arabidopsis plant may produce the first flower on the Moon, Chinese state media say.Other equipment/experiments include:The mission is part of a larger Chinese programme of lunar exploration. The first and second Chang'e missions were designed to gather data from orbit, while the third and fourth were built for surface operations.Chang'e-5 and 6 are sample return missions, delivering lunar rock and soil to laboratories on Earth.The lunar far side is sometimes referred to as the ""dark side"", though ""dark"" in this case means ""unseen"" rather than ""lacking illumination"". In fact, both the near and far sides of the Moon experience daytime and nighttime. Scientists prefer to use far side to avoid confusion.But because of a phenomenon called ""tidal locking"", we see only one face of the Moon from Earth. This is because the Moon takes just as long to rotate on its own axis as it takes to complete one orbit of Earth.The far side has a thicker, older crust that is pocked with more craters. There are also very few of the ""maria"" - dark basaltic ""seas"" created by lava flows - that are evident on the near side.In an article for the US-based Planetary Society in September, Dr Long Xiao from the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), said: ""The challenge faced by a far side mission is communications. With no view of Earth, there is no way to establish a direct radio link.""So the landers must communicate with Earth using a relay satellite named Queqiao - or Magpie Bridge - launched by China last May.Queqiao orbits 65,000km beyond the Moon, around a Lagrange point - a kind of gravitational parking spot in space where it will remain visible to ground stations in China and other countries such as Argentina.China wants to become a leading power in space exploration, alongside the United States and Russia.It has long harboured ambitions to send its own astronauts to the Moon.It will also begin building a new space station next year, with the hope it will be operating by 2022.Commentators have focused on the secrecy surrounding this launch and landing. Details of the Chang'e 4 landing attempt were sketchy before the official announcement it had been a success.The careful news management echoes the way the Soviet Union handled its space missions in the latter half of the 20th Century.The far side of the Moon is more rugged than the near side, so the Chang'e-4 landing was more risky and complex. Scientists targeted a very flat area, but coming down on a sharp outcrop would have spelled instant failure for the mission.Caution by the Chinese authorities could have been behind the limited flow of news, which saw audiences searching for unofficial feeds of the launch on the social network Weibo due to the lack of coverage on state television.But Ye Quanzhi said China had made efforts to be more open.""They live-streamed the launch of Chang'e 2 and 3, as well as the landing of Chang'e 3. PR skills take time to develop but I think China will get there,"" he said.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Nasa suspends Mars mission over faulty instrument		"The US space agency, Nasa, has suspended the March launch of its next mission to Mars because of a fault in a key research instrument.Nasa said a problem with a seismometer provided by the French space agency meant the launch could not go ahead.It is feared the mission could now face a two-year delay.The InSight spacecraft was scheduled to take off between 4-30 March and land on the Red Planet six months later to examine Mars' geology in depth.Nasa said it had decided to call off the launch because the agency was unable to fix a leak affecting the seismometer, which required a vacuum seal to cope with harsh conditions on Mars.The instrument is designed to measure ground movements.""A decision on a path forward will be made in the coming months, but one thing is clear: Nasa remains fully committed to the scientific discovery and exploration of Mars,"" Nasa's John Grunsfeld was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.The next time the earth and Mars are favourably aligned for a launch will be in 2018.The mission is also intended to monitor the temperature on Mars, as well as the variations in its orbit."
science	Nasa's New Horizons probe strikes distant gold		"The American space agency's New Horizons mission has struck gold again.After its astonishing flyby of Pluto in 2015, scientists have just discovered that the probe's next target is not one object but very likely two.Earth-based observations suggest the small icy world, referred to simply as MU69, has a moonlet.It seems New Horizons will now be making a two-for-the price-of-one flyby when it has its encounter on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, 2019.The plan is for the spacecraft to pass the 30-40km-wide main object with a separation of just 3,500km, acquiring high-resolution pictures and other data.This should reveal new information on the Kuiper Belt - the band of distant, frozen material that orbits far from the Sun. On flyby day, New Horizons and MU69 will be some 6.5 billion km (4.5 billion miles) from Earth.""Besides being the farthest exploration in the history of humankind, this flyby is also going to the most primitive and pristine object ever explored,"" said Prof Alan Stern, the principal investigator on New Horizons.""We've really never been to anything like this. Of course, we've had lots of missions to comets that come from the Kuiper Belt, but they've come down into the inner Solar System where they're processed, sometimes through hundreds of passages by the Sun, and they're much smaller.""If you remember Rosetta's comet, 67P, which you saw so many pictures of from that great Esa/Nasa mission - this is a much larger target. It could fit about a thousand Rosetta comets inside itself.""Prof Stern was giving an update on preparations for the MU69 encounter here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.His team described efforts earlier this year to tie down details about the target object's precise movement and size using occultation.This involves making observations of MU69 as it passes in front of a far-off star.The tell-tale details are in the way the star blinks.What emerged from the studies was fascinating. Not only does it seem there is an accompanying moonlet perhaps 200-300km from MU69, but the main target itself may also actually be a double act - either two individual units with a small gap between them; or just touching, something called a contact binary.""This is very exciting. This is going to have a lot of surprises,"" said New Horizons science team-member Dr Marc Buie, of the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado.""We think this is probably a sign that the object itself was not a collision fragment; we think it was made this way. And so we really are going to see something that dates back to the birth of our Solar System.""The flyby campaign begins in earnest in August, when the first course corrections that may be required for New Horizons will be made.Observations will also take place to ensure there are no hazards in the vicinity of MU69 that might necessitate a wider pass.The serious business of the flyby occurs over a nine-day period starting on 25 December, 2018.New Horizons will focus on the Kuiper Belt object, hoping to return images that have a best resolution of about 30m per pixel.The first of these should come back to Earth a couple of days after closest approach, which currently is timed to occur at 05:33 GMT on 1 January, 2019.""Using New Horizons' suite of seven instruments, we'll be characterising the geology and morphology of the surface, looking to see whether there are any craters. We certainly expect to see craters,"" explained team member Dr Anne Verbiscer from the University of Virginia.""Possibly there could be grooves. We'll also map the surface composition, searching for possible ices as we saw on Pluto.""We also want to know what makes MU69 so dark and red. And we'll be searching for satellites and rings and asking if that moon is really there; and are there any others?""Follow Jonathan on Twitter"

On Twitter, contributors used the hashtag #100geosites.Among the final 100 selected by the Geological Society are cliffs and outcrops, peaks and ranges, quarries and mines, cathedrals, rivers, tunnels, caves, coves and islands.""The list highlights the huge range of incredible geology the UK and Ireland have to offer,"" said Prof Rob Butler from the University of Aberdeen, who chairs the society's Geoconservation Committee.""From the Outer Hebrides to Cornwall, from rocks showing how the crust formed billions of years ago to young sediments pushed around by ice sheets a few thousand years ago, we are unique in having such a diverse geological heritage over a relatively small area.""To identify 10 popular favourites, the society split the nominations into 10 categories, such as places of scientific or industrial importance, educational sites like museums and field-trip favourites, and prime examples of ""folding and faulting"" or ""fire and ice"" in the UK and Ireland's geological past.More than 1,200 people then voted in the poll.These were the most popular geosites in each of the 10 categories:Follow Jonathan on Twitter"
science	Antarctica's warm underbelly revealed		"This is the best map yet produced of the warmth coming up from the rocks underneath the Antarctic ice sheet.This ""geothermal heat flux"" is key data required by scientists in order to model how the White Continent is going to react to climate change.If the rock bed's temperature is raised, it makes it easier for the ice above to move.And if global warming is already forcing change on the ice sheet, a higher flux could accelerate matters.The map was made by researchers at the British Antarctic survey and is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.""The heat coming from the Earth's interior is important to understand the overall conditions that control the dynamics at the base of the ice sheet and hence the ice flow,” explained Yasmina Martos, currently affiliated to the US space agency.""If this heat flux is elevated, the ice base can melt and produce water that acts as a sliding film.""One result of our study is that the heat flux is higher underneath West Antarctica, where more ice is currently melting, than underneath East Antarctica.""Even a little melting at the base helps the ice sheet to slide faster. We also identified areas of low heat flux, which will help stabilise the ice sheet,"" she told BBC News.No-one has actually drilled through the kilometres of ice in Antarctica to take the temperature of the bed.Instead, the BAS team inferred the likely warmth of rocks from their magnetism.This property can be sensed by instruments flown across the surface of the ice sheet by planes.What happens next is a smart calculation.Scientists know the temperature (580C) at which hot minerals lose their magnetism, so if they can gauge how close to the rock-ice interface this is occurring then they have a means of estimating the heat flux.The new map is said to represent a 30-50% improvement on previous efforts.It supports - but with far more detail - the established idea that East and West Antarctica are very different provinces.The East is a giant chunk of old, cold continental crust. The West, however, underwent recent rifting in the Cretaceous (100 million years ago) that has pulled it apart.""This rifting has thinned the crust and brought hot material from deep down in the Earth - from hundreds of km down - to within 100km or so, or even maybe less, of the rock surface,"" said co-author Tom Jordan.""It confirms what you would expect from the sparse, exposed geology in West Antarctica where we have volcanoes.""One of the great advances in polar science in the past decade is the recognition that there is a really extensive hydrological network under the ice sheet.Rivers of water feed huge subglacial lakes that fill and burst their banks periodically. Satellites see the top of the ice sheet heave and relax when this happens.Any projections of future change in Antarctica and its contribution to sea level rise through the loss of ice have to take this basement hydrology into account, and the variations in geothermal heat flux are a critical part of the overall picture.One research project that will see an immediate benefit from the map's data is the quest to drill the oldest ice on the continent.Europe, America, China and others are seeking a location where they can collect a core of frozen material that contains a record of past climate stretching back at least 1.5 million years.This information - about historic atmospheric conditions including carbon dioxide levels - can be deciphered from tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice.But the whole endeavour depends on the base of the ice sheet being undisturbed. Places with a warm rock underbelly are therefore to be avoided, obviously.""It is very exciting to see the implications this new heat map has for many communities, including new generations of ice sheet and sea level models,"" said Dr Martos.""I am very glad we are contributing an important aspect at unprecedented detail. The Earth’s interior has a lot to tell us in terms on how the ice behaves.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Urbanisation signal detected in evolution, study shows	Seeds of changeEntering a new age?	"A ""clear signal"" of urbanisation has been identified in the evolution of organisms, which has implications for sustainability and human well-being.In analysis of more than 1,600 cases around the globe, researchers said the changes could affect ecosystem services important to humans.More than half of the world's human populations now live in urban areas, and this proportion is set to grow.The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.""We found that there is a clear urban signal of phenotypic change, and also greater phenotypic change in urbanising systems compared to natural or non-urban anthropogenic systems,"" said co-author Marina Alberti from the University of Washington's Department of Urban Design and Planning.""So urbanisation, globally, is clearly affecting things.""Phenotypic change refers to change in an organism's observable traits, such as it morphology, physiology, phenology, or behaviour.The changes in plants and animals included alterations in body sizes, shifts in behavioural patterns and adjustments in reproduction.In a separate study published in 2008, researchers in France observed a rapid evolutionary change in a plant's seed size in order for it to adapt to urban life.They found that the seeds on Crepis sancta, otherwise known as hawksbeard, were larger on specimens that lived in urban areas, when compared with the seeds from the plants growing in rural settings.As the plant's seeds were dispersed by the wind, the researchers suggested that heavier seeds fared better because they would drop on to nearby soil, whereas the lighter seeds would be carried by the wind, resulting in them being deposited on concrete and tarmac, where it was impossible to germinate.The speed in which this trait was expressed in the urban-dwelling plants surprised the researchers.Professor Alberti said the changes that were observed in more than 1,600 studies were having an impact on evolution and that human activity, in the form of urbanisation, would have a lasting legacy on life on Earth.These findings add weight to the idea that the planet is now entering an Anthropocene epoch, a geological measurement of time in which humans are having a significant global impact on the Earth's geology and ecosystems.Prof Alberti observed: ""The reason these changes are important is because they change ecosystem function, therefore they have implications for human well-being.""This is because those changes affect, for example, biodiversity but also nutrient cycling, seed dispersal and water purification.""Prof Alberti and colleagues suggested that these changes meant that the alteration in the functions performed by the species, such as food production or the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, would also be modified.""There have been a lot of studies on individual cities but there had been no studies that considered the global picture to identify a global urbanisation influence on evolution,"" she added.""We live on an urban planet already. This is a change that has implications for where we are heading in the future.""We are changing the evolution of Earth and urbanisation has a role, a significant role, in that.""Follow Mark on Twitter"
science	Fossil of oldest pine tree discovered	Serendipitous findPlant oddities	"Scientists have discovered the oldest-known fossil of a pine tree.The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land.Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere.The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires.""Pines are well adapted to fire today,"" said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada.""The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree.""The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry.""It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out,"" Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News.""They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there.""The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland.Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily.They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed.Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires.""One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet,"" explained Dr Falcon-Lang.""These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees.""Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens.He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Microscope observes life of the ocean floor		"Marine scientists have developed a microscope that for the first time provides a window into the small scale behaviour of marine life.The Great Barrier Reef, a huge collection of 600 types of coral, is so large it can been seen from space.It is therefore easy to forget that this form of marine life undergoes processes on a much smaller scale.The team from California and Israel outline details of the microscope in Nature Communications.The health and changing characteristics of coastal marine life such as kelp forests, mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs are significantly affected by activities that occur at sizes a thousand times smaller than a millimetre.Observing these processes though is a tricky business. The rapidly changing water currents, temperature, oxygen levels, and acidity have so far made studies on this scale impossible in their natural environment.Previously, researchers have taken marine life into the lab, once removed from the ocean, though, crucial information is lost about how the samples interact and behave.The new instrument was therefore developed to operate at the sea floor.""We are imaging the organism in its natural environment which is very complex and difficult to recreate in the lab,"" Dr Tali Treibitz, part of the microscope's development team, told BBC News.The group of scientists have demonstrated the impact of this microscope by recording the behaviour of individual polyps, the small animals that together make up coral reefs.They observed differing species of polyp attacking each other with extended stinging filaments, and also individual polyps connecting to share resources.As coral reefs around the world are declining in size due to human activities a deeper knowledge of the small scale processes causing this demise is required. This microscope has the potential to provide these observations.Explaining her passion for the work, Dr Treibitz from the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Haifa said: ""The ocean influences a lot of our lives, some people are not aware of the complexity and the richness of what is going on out there.""The microscope consists of shape changing lens made from a flexible membrane filled with fluid. By applying electricity the shape of the lens could be changed. Focused LED light ensured the marine life was well lit.All the equipment was contained in a compact system that could be taken down to the sea floor and operated by a diver.The scientists report that the new microscope will be able to impact upon a diverse range of scientific fields including ecology, physiology, biomechanics, fluid dynamics, marine geology and physics."
science	Why fatbergs present challenges for us all		"A difficult and disgusting operation to clear London's largest ""fatberg"" from a London sewer raises a number of issues about our approach to waste disposal.Fatbergs are not natural - they are creatures of the modern age - and the blockages they cause can lead to raw sewage flowing up into shops, offices and people's homes.It is not a subject for the faint-hearted but there are 10 large fatbergs in London right now and hundreds of smaller ones across the country.They form when oil and grease, poured down drains, coagulates around the likes of tampons, baby wipes and condoms flushed down toilets.The result is the creation of a pale, tough substance with the strength of rock - a form of artificial geology that in the case of the Whitechapel fatberg has choked 80% of the flow of the sewer.The basic problem is that we inherited a network of underground sewers built 150 years ago that was never designed to cope with what's now thrown into it.However far-sighted Sir Joseph Bazalgette and his fellow Victorian engineers were, they can have had no idea how the populations of our cities would explode and how changes in diet and lifestyles would create a potentially devastating onslaught.The gentle gradients of their designs were meant to create steady streams of human waste and water - not exactly fragrant but ""they don't smell bad if they're working properly,"" one sewage expert told me.By contrast, the noxious blast of fetid air that rose when the manhole cover was lifted during yesterday's operation was enough to make me gag and cover my face with my jacket.Three metres beneath the heavy East End traffic, a monstrous mass of fat is acting in the same way that plaque does in arteries and, as with heart trouble, the problem is usually unseen until it's too late.As the engineers donned what looked like spacesuits to head underground - double gloves, hoses bringing fresh air, electronic sensors to spot dangerous gases - a small crowd gathered to watch.The street is lined with fast-food restaurants, just the kind of places that have flourished as the demand for fried takeaways has soared. One of the onlookers wore the striped apron of a chef.Research by Thames Water mapped the locations of fatbergs and of restaurants, and came up with a remarkable conclusion: if you live within 50 metres of a fast-food place, your chances of being flooded with sewage are eight times higher than if you live further away.So the company has sent teams to visit more than 700 restaurants to explore what steps they're taking to stop the flow of fat leaving their kitchens.The answer? The vast majority are doing nothing at all.Thames Water executives believe this is not through wilfulness but ignorance. There are devices to trap fat, and they cost only a few hundred pounds, but few seem to have heard of them.So the first step in the battle against the bergs is to encourage, cajole or shame restaurant owners into forking out for the small boxes that sit atop a drain and clean the flow.Talks with the big chains are under way. The response so far has been one of surprise that the scale of the problem had not been realised, so maybe the coming months will see fat traps becoming more common.But the survey also found that where a small number of restaurants had invested in the devices, few had maintained them. So there lies another challenge.And the key to all this may be our own attitudes - whether any of us demand change.Just as it's become more common for people to expect vegetarian options or food prepared without gluten or dairy products, might anyone demand to know whether a restaurant's kitchen is sewer-friendly before paying for a meal?There's now a term for our unthinking but damaging approach to what we flush away: sewer abuse.One answer is to support and expand schemes to collect restaurant fat and turn it into fuel - a logical form of renewable energy - and this is what will happen to the fatbergs.At the heart of this question is our consumer culture's approach to waste, the belief that we can just chuck anything away without consequence, ""away"" being an abstract and distant concept that we need not care about.But ""away"" is a real place, like an east London sewer jammed with a fatberg weighing the same as 11 buses, and now being chipped away by shovel by brave teams straining in heat so intense they can last only 40 minutes at a time.The image of a dark figure hunched in a tiny tunnel working by hand is startling to us in 21st Century Britain. But in a curious way, it's also an unintended throwback to the grimmer Victorian times when the sewers were built in the first place."
science	'Alarmingly high' levels of arsenic in Pakistan's ground water		"Up to 60 million people in Pakistan are at risk from the deadly chemical arsenic, according to a new analysis of water supplies.The study looked at data from nearly 1,200 groundwater quality samples from across the country.The resulting risk map shows concentrations well above World Health Organization (WHO) safety guidelines across the Indus plain.The research has been published in the journal, Science Advances.Arsenic is a semi-metallic element found all over the world in varying concentrations. Humans come into contact with it because it leaches into groundwater from rocks and sediments.The WHO says about 150 million people around the world rely on groundwater contaminated with arsenic.Long-term exposure can lead to a variety of chronic health conditions, including skin disorders, cancers of the lung and bladder as well as cardiovascular issues.The WHO has established a level of 10 micrograms per litre as the permissible concentration in drinking water. In Pakistan, the government says that 50 micrograms per litre is acceptable.This new study shows that 50-60 million people living in the Indus valley, which runs through much of eastern Pakistan, are drinking water which very likely exceeds their government's safe level.The scientists collected ground water samples, taken from wells going down into the Earth, at 1,200 sites throughout the country. The team then used statistical methods to construct a ""hazard map"" and to estimate the size of population exposed to the threat.Lead author Dr Joel Podgorski from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology told BBC News that the findings were ""alarming"".""This is the first time we've been able to show the full extent of the problem in Pakistan. Because of the geology and the soil properties and based on all of the measurements we've taken, basically the whole Indus plain is at high risk of having high arsenic levels in the groundwater.""The researchers say that one important cause of the problem is that the sediments that contain the arsenic are relatively young.So if an aquifer has developed since the end of the last ice age around 10,000 years ago, it's more likely to have higher levels of arsenic in the water than older, deeper aquifers where most of the chemical has leached away.The scientists also believe that irrigation for farming is making the situation worse. The study found a strong correlation between high soil PH levels and arsenic concentrations.""There is massive irrigation in the Indus valley, it's a very hot and dry climate,"" said Dr Podgorski.""If you have a lot of water flooding the surface that is going to percolate down to the aquifer, that would be an easy way of bringing any released arsenic down to the groundwater.""The number of people who are likely impacted in Pakistan, according to the study, far exceeds the 20 million affected in China. Some researchers, who welcomed the study, have reservations about the scale of the impact.For David Polya, professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Manchester, there is a ""considerable amount of uncertainty in the new figures"".""Even if the population at risk was only half that estimated, it would mean that the estimates of the number of people around the world impacted by such high arsenic hazard groundwaters would need to be substantially upwardly revised,"" he said.""This reflects a trend over the the last few decades, where increasing numbers of people have been recognised to be exposed to high arsenic concentrations in their drinking water.""As further detailed studies such as this are conducted in other areas, no doubt the number of people known to be exposed to this poison through drinking water will further increase.""Other researchers in the field say that whatever the overall accuracy of the numbers, the study is bringing much-needed attention to an under-reported issue.""This new study contributes information on the causes and extent of arsenic contamination that will be useful for Pakistan as well as for the broader water sector,"" said Dr Rick Johnston from the WHO.""It points out the need for robust water quality surveillance and for either avoiding arsenic in drinking water by exploiting arsenic-free resources, or effectively removing arsenic from drinking water supplies.""The only way to get a definitive answer to the scale of exposure is to do more testing on the ground, says Dr Podgorski, the lead author.""Ultimately, what our map shows is that this whole area should really be tested,"" he said.""Some are fine, some are not, you need to go through every step to test each well.""Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook."
science	Best view yet of Ceres' spots		"The fascinating bright spots on the surface of the dwarf planet Ceres have come into sharper view.What were initially thought to be just a couple of brilliant, closely spaced features at one location now turn out to be a clutch of many smaller dots.The latest pictures were acquired by the US space agency's Dawn spacecraft on its first full science orbit since arriving at Ceres on 6 March.The spots were seen from a distance of 13,600km.Researchers on the mission concede they still have much to learn about the dots' true nature, but the new data is hardening their ideas.""Dawn scientists can now conclude that the intense brightness of these spots is due to the reflection of sunlight by highly reflective material on the surface, possibly ice,"" said Chris Russell, who is the principal investigator on the mission.With a diameter of 950km, Ceres is the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.Dawn will spend the coming months studying its geology and surface chemistry with a suite of cameras and remote-sensing instruments.The intention is to get some insights into the processes that have sculpted the dwarf since its formation with the rest of the Solar System some 4.5 billion years year ago.Having completed its first science orbit, Dawn is now heading downwards to get even closer to the body.This second mapping campaign, which will commence on 6 June, will see Dawn moving just 4,400km from the surface.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	British 'sea dragon' fossils are 'new to science'		Scientific detective work on fossils collected in Victorian times has identified two new species of Ichthyosaurs - the giant reptiles that swam at the time of the dinosaurs.It brings to six the known species of Ichthyosaurus - ''sea dragons'' that ruled the oceans in Jurassic times.Both fossils were unearthed in Somerset in the 1800s.One specimen has been on display at Bristol University for decades, under the gaze of countless students.The other was donated to a museum in Philadelphia, US, by Thomas Hawkins, a well-known Victorian fossil collector.He amassed a huge collection of marine reptiles from Somerset in the first half of the 19th Century.Such was the Victorian craze for skeletons of ichythyosaurs - the first was found by Mary Anning on the Dorset coast - that they ended up in museums and collections right across the world.Palaeontologists Dean Lomax of Manchester University and Judy Massare of Brockport College, New York, examined hundreds of ichthyosaur fossils in Europe and North America, including some that had been kept hidden for decades.''These are two new species - brand new species to science,'' Dean Lomax told BBC News.''They show that during the early Jurassic - around 200 million years ago - the ichythyosaur, and specifically this particular type, was a lot more diverse than previously thought.''Ichthyosaurs were fierce predators, growing up to 15m in length.The dolphin-shaped creatures patrolled the seas at a time when the UK was a series of small islands.They were among the first skeletons to be discovered by early British fossil-hunters, at a time when theories of evolution and concepts of geology were in their infancy.The reptile fossils were categorised as new species on the basis of distinctive features of their skull and other bones.One of the new species was identified from a complete skeleton of an ichthyosaur that has been on display at the University of Bristol for more than 30 years.The other - originally found in a quarry in Glastonbury - was donated to Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences in 1847.The specimen had been in storage, and few people even knew of its existence.''It's been hidden away behind the scenes for such a long time,'' said Dean Lomax.''It was quite amazing when Judy Massare and myself examined the specimen and then found that it was a practically complete skeleton and in my personal opinion the best example ever of the ichthyosaur genus to be collected and studied.''The Philadelphia specimen has been named Ichthyosaurus somersetensis, in honour of the county where so many specimens have been dug up or found in quarries.The Bristol University fossil has been called Ichthyosaurus larkini, in honour of British palaeontologist Nigel Larkin, whose whose family has lived in the Bristol area for centuries.A scholarly paper describing the research is published in the journal Papers in Palaeontology.Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.
science	Wavy Greenland rock features 'are oldest fossils'		"Some of the world’s earliest life forms may have been captured in squiggles found in ancient rocks from Greenland.The rocks were part of the seafloor 3.7 billion years ago, and the wavy lines, just a few centimetres across, would be remnants of primordial microbial colonies called stromatolites.The evidence is presented in the academic journal Nature.If confirmed, the colonies would predate the previously oldest known fossils by over 200 million years.To put that in context, travelling back a similar time from today would be to leap into the world of the first dinosaurs.But all claims of extremely early life are hotly contested, and this find is as well.The find was made in a desolate expanse of uplands that butt up against the Greenland ice cap, called the Isua Supercrustal Belt.The host rocks were exposed only recently after permanent snow cover melted.The region is famous in geoscience because it is the oldest surviving piece of the Earth’s surface.And in the late 1990s, Minik Rosing, a native Greenlander and professor of geology at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, identified chemical traces of life in its rocks – layers of carbon that had evidently once been part of living bacteria (although this interpretation has also been contested).Prof Rosing suggests those bacteria lived in the surface of the ocean, capturing sunlight and photosynthesising, until they died and “rained down” to the seabed.The layers of carbon are interleaved with volcanic ash that may have come from a nearby island.The stromatolites described by Martin van Kranendonk and colleagues in this week’s issue of Nature would have lived in a quite different way.Stromatolites are effectively living rocks formed of mineral grains glued together by sticky, colonial bacteria.They are rare today – the best known are in the harsh waters of Shark Bay, Western Australia, where bacteria slide up through each new layer of sediment washed up by the tides.Similar mounds found in the Western Australian outback are currently the oldest acknowledged fossils on the planet, at 3.48 billion years old.The older examples now claimed for Greenland appear to be remarkably similar, says Prof van Kranendonk, an early-Earth expert at the University of New South Wales.“We see the original unaltered sedimentary layers, and we can see how the stromatolite structures grow up through the sedimentary layering. And we can see the characteristic dome and cone-shaped forms of modern stromatolites.”The fossil structures are overlain by another thick layer of sediment – a sign the bacterial mats were fatally buried by mud or sand, perhaps during a storm.“There’s plenty of evidence this was a shallow-water environment,” Prof van Kranendonk suggests.“We can see the sands and rocks were moved around by energetic waves.”The stromatolites themselves are limestone – precipitated out of the coastal waters by the original microorganisms, more evidence the researchers say that these are truly ancient.There are no traces of the original microbes, only the mounds they built. But that is still incredibly important, says Prof van Kranendonk.“This helps us think about how life developed on Earth, how fast that process was. It pushes everything back a little further, narrows the window between when we know nothing, and when we begin to know something.”Prof Rosing, however, disagrees with almost every aspect of the analysis. The claim, he says, depends on the belief the samples come from a rare, well-preserved part of the original seabed. But since they were first part of the Earth’s surface, the Isua rocks have been twisted, stretched, crushed, and cooked by tectonic forces; the region is a geological “train-wreck” in the words of another geologist.For example, Prof Rosing argues, the carbonate minerals far from being original biological precipitates, were produced far later, by reactions involving scalding soda water deep in the Earth’s crust.The lines showing internal laminations, said to be primordial sedimentary layers, actually show where those waters percolated through the buried rocks. As for the dome- and cone-forms of the fossils, those are typical shapes seen where rocks of different strengths have been squeezed and stretched.“It’s clear from the pictures in the paper that these are highly deformed rocks,” Prof Rosing told the BBC.The problem is familiar in early Earth science – so much has happened to the rocks over geological history, it is hard to know what is original and what is an overprint by later processes.Many claims of early fossils have fallen on close examination. Only a few survive the intense scrutiny of peer review.Prof van Kranendonk stands by his argument that amidst the overall punishment suffered by the Greenland rocks, small pockets have survived well preserved – including the outcrop at the heart of this dispute.“They’re just exceptional windows of preservation, which give us the keys to what happened so long ago.”Geobiologist Michael Tice from Texas A&M University, US, who refereed the paper and approved its publication, takes a half-way position.“The trouble with this kind of science is you’re trying to look at life after geology has done all the nastiest things to it. You’re limited by nature. The study is not definitive, but the evidence has passed all the tests they could apply.""The point of publication is to stimulate more effort to find other examples.”Prof Rosing agrees that a joint visit to examine the rocks in their original setting in Isua would be the best way to resolve the dispute. And Prof van Kranendonk hopes there may be further examples, older ones even, in the Greenland record.What unites them is the belief that almost as far back as the rock record goes, life had already taken hold on the Earth. And the desire to know more about what that life was like.Prof van Kranendonk can be heard discussing the new find on this week's Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service."
science	Dawn probe sees Ceres' spots in more detail		"The US space agency has released a new picture of the brightest spots on the dwarf planet Ceres.Nasa's Dawn probe has just retuned the image - one of the first snapshots to come down from the satellite since getting into its latest mapping orbit, which is now just 4,000km above the surface.Mission scientists confess still to being puzzled by the features.The best guess is that their brightness stems from the presence of ice or salt.The spots sit in a crater that is about 90km wide.""The bright spots in this configuration make Ceres unique from anything we've seen before in the Solar System,"" said Dawn principal investigator Chris Russell""The science team is working to understand their source. Reflection from ice is the leading candidate in my mind, but the team continues to consider alternate possibilities, such as salt.""With closer views from the new orbit and multiple view angles, we soon will be better able to determine the nature of this enigmatic phenomenon,"" the University of California, Los Angeles, researcher explained in a Nasa statement.Ceres has a number of very bright surface features, but the pictured cluster is the standout example and has drawn most interest.The Dawn mission arrived at the dwarf, which is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, in March.It is due to spend at least the next year mapping the 950km-wide world, characterising its geology and composition.Scientists regard Ceres as an object that set out on the path to becoming a big planet like Earth and Mars, but whose growth got to a certain point and then stalled.The hope is that it will reveal information about the conditions that held sway in the early Solar System.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Mercury's hidden water-ice revealed		"A Nasa spacecraft has provided the first optical images of ice within shadowed craters on Mercury.It might seem curious that the closest planet to the Sun - where temperatures soar above 400C - could host water-ice.But some of the craters on this hothouse world are always shadowed from the Sun, turning them into cold traps.Using very low levels of light scattered off crater walls, scientists were able to build up a picture of what these frozen deposits look like.The work, by researchers involved with Nasa's Mercury Messenger mission, has been published in the journal Geology.Scientists suggested decades ago that water ice might be trapped in shadowed areas near the planet's poles. Then, in the 1990s, data from the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico revealed areas that strongly reflect radar - a characteristic of ice.Many of these corresponded to the locations of large impact craters mapped by the US spacecraft Mariner 10 in the 1970s.After the Messenger probe entered orbit around the planet in March 2011, it deployed a range of techniques to show that there are probably several billion tonnes of water ice locked up at the north pole.In the latest study, Dr Nancy Chabot and colleagues studied an impact crater called Prokofiev, the largest such depression at the planet's north pole.The uniform surface texture of presumed water-ice areas in Prokofiev crater suggest the deposits arrived relatively recently.In other areas, water-ice is covered by a thin layer of dark material rich in organic molecules. These dark deposits display sharp boundaries.""This result was a little surprising, because sharp boundaries indicate that the volatile deposits at Mercury's poles are geologically young,"" said Dr Chabot.She added: ""One of the big questions we've been grappling with is 'When did Mercury's water ice deposits show up?' Are they billions of years old, or were they emplaced only recently?""Understanding the age of these deposits has implications for understanding the delivery of water to all the terrestrial planets, including Earth.""Overall, the images indicate that Mercury's polar deposits either were delivered to the planet recently or are regularly restored at the surface through an ongoing process.Distinctions between the features of shadowed craters on the Moon and those on Mercury may also be instructive about the history of water in the Solar System.The Moon is also believed to host deposits of water-ice, also being home to areas of permanent shadow. They are also colder than those on Mercury. But there are significant differences in the properties of the surface as measured from orbit.One explanation could be that the deposits on Mercury are more recent.""If Mercury's currently substantial polar volatile inventory is the product of the most recent portion of a longer process, then a considerable mass of volatiles may have been delivered to the inner Solar System throughout its history,"" the paper in Geology says.""That's a key question,"" said Dr Chabot.""Because if you can understand why one body looks one way and another looks different, you gain insight into the process that's behind it, which in turn is tied to the age and distribution of water-ice in the Solar System.""This will be a very interesting line of inquiry going forward.""Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	How ancient collision shaped New York skyline	Find out more	"Tower One of the new World Trade Center in New York was completed last month and at 541m, it now stands proud over Manhattan, the highest skyscraper in the western world.It is a beacon of hope on this classic skyline, a symbol of modernity and a glimpse of the future. But this gleaming new skyscraper actually has roots in a long-lost world; Tower One, like all of the other skyscrapers in New York has its foundations in a past world.Skyscrapers seem to dominate this part of New York, but look a little closer and you can see very clearly that they are actually clustered in two distinct areas: Downtown, the financial hub of this great city, and Midtown - the home of the Empire State Building.To understand how this modern skyline came to be and why these tall buildings cluster as they do, you need to look downwards instead of up.Prof Iain Stewart, a geologist at Plymouth University, has been getting down and dirty in the foundations of skyscrapers in New York for Rise of the Continents, a new geology documentary series on BBC Two, and it is here that the clues to understanding New York's ancient past become clear.""New York's skyscrapers are built in two distinct clusters for a very good reason, one that is buried beneath each one of them,"" says Prof Stewart.Below the busy streets of Manhattan, amongst the foundations of these giants, Prof Stewart was hoping to spot a seemingly innocuous grey rock, known as the Manhattan schist.Charles Merguerian is a professor of geology at Hofstra University in New York and an established expert in this schist and its role in New York's history. He told the programme that ""geology totally controls the skyline of New York, in that the higher buildings are always found where the rock is close to the surface"".As Prof Stewart reiterated for the programme: ""It's the minerals in these rocks that are really key to understanding the conditions under which they were formed. Like in a car where your various instrument clusters tell you how it is working, minerals tell us how the rock was formed, particularly at what temperature and depth.""The minerals in this rock can provide clues that help explain the shape of Manhattan's skyline, but also reveal the story of America's long lost history.Prof Stewart was keeping an eye out for a mineral known as kyanite, a beautiful blue specimen commonly seen in the Manhattan schist. ""Kyanite is a key mineral to identify, we know it only forms at very deep depths and under extensive pressure,"" he said.""It's like a fingerprint, revealing a wealth of information.""The presence of this mineral reveals that the Manhattan schist was compressed under incredibly high pressure over 300 million years ago.The schist formed as a result of two enormous landmasses coming together to form a supercontinent, known as Pangaea.This giant continent was made up of all the land on Earth, and at this time present day New York would have been very close to its centre.As the two landmasses converged, the rocks at their margins were pushed together like an accordion, forcing mountains upwards. The Manhattan schist was buried 13km beneath this new mountain range.""The minerals give us a very clear indication that these rocks were formed at great depths at the bottom of a mountain range,"" says Prof Merguerian.Rise of the ContinentsProf Stewart explains: ""The former mountains of New York probably achieved heights similar to what we see in the Himalayas today - it's incredible to imagine mountains 15 times higher than the highest skyscraper on the skyline today."" Being buried and compressed under such a vast mountain range has made the Manhattan schist an exceptionally hard rock.The supercontinent that once embroiled New York was eventually ripped apart. 100 million years later, the component parts of Pangaea began their long and arduous journeys to become the continents we see today.After this split, fragments of the lost land of Pangaea were left behind, now stranded in today's modern metropolis of Manhattan as very hard schist.Walking through Central Park, you will see children playing, couples sunbathing and families picnicking on rocks protruding through the surface of the park.These rocks are Manhattan schist, part of that ancient supercontinent, fragments of Pangaea left behind when the continent split. They are just glimpses of what is below the surface in abundance in Downtown and Midtown.And it is these fragments of very hard rock that provide the perfect foundations for New York's highest buildings. Where Manhattan schist can be found very close to the surface you can build high, and so Downtown and Midtown have become home to Manhattan's tallest buildings.Elsewhere the ancient continent has been eroded away, the ground cannot support such skyscrapers and the buildings are much lower in height.""Geology totally controls the skyline of New York in that the higher buildings are always found where the rock is close to the surface,"" says Prof Merguerian.Tower One of the World Trade Center is the most recent icon in New York's majestic skyline, a skyline that has become a symbol of the modern world despite its origins being rooted in a long, lost world.""It's amazing to think that the modern city of New York has essentially been controlled by geology below and all that started with the construction of Pangaea,"" says Prof Stewart.Discover more about the lost world of Pangaea and how it has affected the way we live today in Professor Iain Stewart's new documentary series on BBC 2, The Rise of the Continents starting on June 9th at 9pm. Episode 3; The Americas will air on June 23rd."
science	New Horizons reveals more mountains in Pluto's heart		"The latest images from the New Horizons spacecraft have revealed another range of ice mountains on Pluto.The frozen peaks were found on the lower-left edge of the dwarf world's ""heart"" and are 1-1.5km-high.They sit between a patch of icy, flat terrain, called Sputnik Planum, which scientists believe is less than 100 million years old, and a dark area dating to billions of years ago.More close-ups will be unveiled on Friday at a press conference.Jeff Moore, who leads the geology, geophysics and imaging team on New Horizons, said: ""There is a pronounced difference in texture between the younger, frozen plains to the east and the dark, heavily-cratered terrain to the west.""There's a complex interaction going on between the bright and the dark materials that we're still trying to understand.""The newly spotted mountains are about 110km away from another range, which is now known as Norgay Montes, which appeared in some of the first images returned from last week's fly-by.Those peaks are much more lofty: standing at about 3.3km-high, they rival the Rocky Mountains in size.The New Horizons spacecraft has also zoomed in on two of Pluto's five moons.An image taken by the probe's high resolution camera, Lorri, reveals the most-detailed-view yet of Hydra, which is about 55km-long and 40km-wide.The little satellite seems to have at least two large craters, and its top half looks darker than its bottom, suggesting the make-up of its surface may be varied.Another picture snapped by the Ralph instrument reveals Nix with its colours boosted, which is a technique that helps scientists to identify details on the surface they would otherwise be unable to see.Through this, the team has identified a reddish spot, which may be a crater.""Additional compositional data has already been taken of Nix, but is not yet downlinked. It will tell us why this region is redder than its surroundings,"" said mission scientist Carly Howett.""This observation is so tantalizing, I'm finding it hard to be patient for more Nix data to be downlinked.""Follow Rebecca on Twitter."

Only by 25 December had the spacecraft's orbit brought it directly overhead.The published images were taken from an altitude of 150km.Yutu (""Jade Rabbit"") is China's first mission to make a soft landing at the Moon. After running down a ramp on to the lunar surface, Yutu trundled in an arc around its delivery lander.Scientists were able to check the vehicle's systems before putting the robot into hibernation for the long lunar night, which lasts two Earth weeks.When revived, Yutu will explore its landing zone, studying the dusty terrain and its geology."
science	Fossil gives clues to extinction 250 million years ago	Hammerhead fossil	"A newly-classified fossil gives clues to how life in the oceans recovered from a mass extinction about 250 million years ago.The reptile is an early relative of the ichthyosaurs - a large group of marine reptiles that swam at the time of the dinosaurs.With its tiny toothless head, the creature is something of a curiosity, say scientists.The specimen suggests marine reptiles evolved quickly after the event.Previous evidence has suggested it took a long time for animals in the seas to bounce back.Details of the specimen, Sclerocormus parviceps, are unveiled in Scientific Reports.Dr Nick Fraser, Keeper of Natural Sciences at National Museums Scotland, worked on the fossil alongside teams in the US and China.""Here's something that gives us a sense of the evolutionary pathway,"" said Dr Fraser.""We've still got a long way to go to see where the ichthyosaurs came from, however it's a step in the right direction.""And it all points to a very rapid radiation after this mass extinction - this mother of all extinctions at the end of the Permian, which had a major impact on the Earth.""The ichthyosaurs are a large group of marine reptiles that were common in the Jurassic and the Cretaceous periods.Most were dolphin-like in shape with streamlined bodies and long snouts.But the new animal is something of a mystery, with its short snout, long, whip-like tail and thick ribcage.And while many ichthyosaurs had teeth for catching prey, Sclerocormus lacked teeth and probably sucked up food.""It looked a bit like a small-headed porpoise with a fairly broad stiff body,"" Dr Fraser told BBC News.The creature fills the gap in the fossil record between primitive marine reptiles and the more advanced ichthyosaurs, which dominated the oceans for millions of years.""We don't have many marine reptile fossils from this period, so this specimen is important because it suggests that there's diversity that hasn't been uncovered yet,"" said co-researcher Dr Olivier Rieppel of The Field Museum in Chicago.""These ichthyosauriforms (ichythyosaurs and close relatives) seem to have evolved very quickly, in short bursts of lots of change, in leaps and bounds.""Prof Ryosuke Motani of the department of earth science at UC Davis also worked on the fossil.""Sclerocormus is one of the most surprising marine reptiles that I have seen,"" he explained.""Measuring 1.6 metres in total length it was one of the largest marine vertebrates of the time.""It appeared after the mass extinction, which was at the end of the Permian, and quickly became extinct.""China's geology is ideal for finding the remains of marine reptiles from the ancient oceans.There have been a wealth of recent fossil discoveries inside quarries, including Sclerocormus, which has taken several years to classify.Earlier this month, some of the same researchers unveiled another marine reptile fossil, which was also found in China.Named Atopodentatus, it lived 242 million years ago and had a distinctive hammer-shaped skull.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	New Horizons: Pluto displays rippling terrain		"A great swathe of Pluto that features a strange rippling terrain is perhaps the highlight of the latest image release from the New Horizons mission.The Nasa probe, which flew by the dwarf planet in July, continues to downlink its data, and as it comes in, the scientists get to work on it.The ripples stretch for many hundreds of km.""It looks more like tree bark or dragon scales than geology,"" observed mission team member Bill McKinnon.""This'll really take time to figure out; maybe it's some combination of internal tectonic forces and ice sublimation driven by Pluto's faint sunlight,"" the Washington University, St Louis, scientist said in a US space agency release.The best way to look at ""scales"" is to browse the new high-resolution enhanced colour view of Pluto that has been made available (PNG file, 70MB). The features are on the far eastern edge.This super image comes from the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera on New Horizons. It combines blue, red and near infrared (NIR) images.The enhanced view will help decode the various geological and climatological processes that have worked together to produce all the complex surface features seen on Pluto.Alex Parker, a team member from the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, worked on the Ralph portrait.""This image consumed the better part of this week for me,"" he tweeted.""I removed striping noise and deconvolved the images, massively improving sharpness.""Since the NIR, red and blue images used to make this colour composite are taken separately, they have to be precisely aligned in software.""The instrument is a TDI (time delay and integration) camera, and has funny spatial distortions. I removed all of these by hand to create the final colour product.""Also released this week are probably the highest-resolution images seen so far.They come from the Lorri camera and show details down to 270m across. Lorri is a black and white camera, but the imagery released by Nasa has been coloured with Ralph information.The mosaic includes a segment of so-called Sputnik Planum. Incorporating a series of large polygonal features, in previous releases the icy surface has appeared to be ultra-smooth. But in this new higher-resolution view, it is possible to see a more dune-like and pitted texture.New Horizons continues to move deeper into the outer Solar System even as it downlinks its flyby data.It has now gone 90 million km beyond the dwarf, which puts it very nearly five billion km from Earth.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	'Gigantic chasm under Antarctic ice'		"A vast, previously unrecognised canyon system could be hidden under the Antarctic ice sheet.Hints of its presence are seen in the shape of the white continent's surface, in a largely unexplored region called Princess Elizabeth Land.If confirmed by a proper geophysical survey - now under way - the winding canyon network would be over 1,000km long and in places as much as 1km deep.These dimensions would make it bigger than the famous Grand Canyon in the US.""We know from other areas of Antarctica that the shape of the ice surface is obviously dependent on the shape of the landscape underneath - because the ice is flowing over that landscape,"" explained Dr Stewart Jamieson, from Durham University, UK.""When we look in Princess Elizabeth Land with satellite data, there seem to be some linear features in the surface ice that to us look very reminiscent of a canyon.""We have traced these faint lineations from the centre of Princess Elizabeth Land all the way to the coast, off to the north. It's a pretty substantial system,"" he told BBC News.There are suggestions also that the canyon network is connected to a previously undiscovered subglacial lake.If confirmed, this lake would likely cover up to 1,250 square km, which is about 80 times as big as Windermere, England's largest lake.The initial interpretation of a canyon system is supported by radar data that has been gathered in a couple of locations.Radar sees through the ice layers to the hard rockbed below.The story is consistent, says team-member Prof Martin Siegert, from Imperial College London, UK, said.""Discovering a gigantic new chasm that dwarfs the Grand Canyon is a tantalising prospect.""Geoscientists on Antarctica are carrying out experiments to confirm what we think we are seeing from the initial data, and we hope to announce our findings at a meeting of the ICECAP2 collaboration, at Imperial, later in 2016.""Most of Antarctica has now been covered by full geophysical surveys that have imaged the continent's underlying topography.But there remain two ""Poles of Ignorance"" that need to be filled in. One of these is Princess Elizabeth Land; the other is the Recovery Basin.Both are in East Antarctica, and both are now the targets of intense study.International teams - comprising scientists from the US, the UK, Australia, China and other nations - are flying sensors back and forth across thousands of square kilometres of ice surface.When complete, Antarctic researchers will have a comprehensive view of what the landscape really looks like beneath all its accumulated ice. This is fundamental knowledge in trying to understand how the continent might react in a warming world.""If we don't know the shape of the rockbed, we cannot confidently build models that will produce sensible behaviours in the ice,"" asserted Dr Jamieson.The latest research is published in Geology journal.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Second EU radar Sentinel satellite launches		"The European Space Agency has launched a second radar satellite into the EU's new Sentinel constellation.Sentinel-1b was carried into orbit by a Soyuz rocket that flew out of Sinamary in French Guiana.The new platform will monitor shipping lanes for pollution and icebergs, and survey land surfaces for evidence of subsidence - to name just three of the myriad applications for radar imagery.Sentinel-1b will work alongside the 1a spacecraft, which was launched in 2014.Operating in the same orbit but separated by 180 degrees, the pair will be able to map the entire Earth every six days.This promises an avalanche of data - some five terabits per day - and both satellites are carrying laser communications systems to help get all the information to the ground.The Sentinels are a flagship space project for the European Union, which has committed billions of euros to the endeavour.The satellites fit into a programme the European Commission calls Copernicus, which draws together all sorts of data about the health of the Earth, not just from orbit.Copernicus will support a multitude of services, ranging from air quality updates to crop-performance monitoring, from water-resource management to transport infrastructure planning.Esa is acting as the technical agent, procuring the satellites for the EU. Sentinel-1b is the fourth to launch, with more platforms to follow.""At the moment, we have around 36,000 self-registered users (for Sentinel data), who have downloaded already about four million images, mainly from Sentinel-1a; although this is now picking up because Sentinel-2a (a visible colour camera) has just become operational as well,"" explained Esa's Earth-observation director Prof Volker Liebig.The Soyuz' lift-off from French Guiana occurred at 18:02 local time (21:02 GMT), following three postponements in previous days due to meteorological and technical issues.The 2.1-tonne Sentinel was ejected 23 minutes into the ascent. The planned injection altitude was 686km (426 miles).""We will not start commissioning until we have raised ourselves to the proper orbit (693km), which could take two weeks, a maximum of three,"" Esa's Sentinel-1 project manager, Ramon Torres told BBC News.""We will then go into detail with the calibration of the radar instrument. We plan the commissioning review (to declare Sentinel-1b operational) for 14 September.""Four other satellites were put in orbit on the same Soyuz flight.Three were university cubesats. One, however, was a French space agency mission called Microscope - a fundamental physics experiment.This satellite will spend the next couple of years investigating the so-called ""equivalence principle"".It is the concept in general relativity that holds that gravity accelerates all objects equally, regardless of their mass or composition.The Apollo 15 astronaut Dave Scott famously demonstrated the principle on the Moon in 1971 when he dropped a geology hammer and a falcon feather. Both hit the surface of the airless body at the same time.Microscope's examination will be much more exacting, of course. It will ""drop"" metal cylinders made from titanium-aluminium-vanadium and platinum-rhodium - to see if they also fall at the same rate in the vacuum of space.The experiment can sense accelerations that are a millionth of a billionth of Earth's gravity.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	New Horizons: Sharpest images of Pluto's surface		"The New Horizons probe has at last returned some of the super-sharp pictures it took of Pluto during its historic flyby in July.The images released by the US space agency on Friday show details on the surface of the dwarf planet at a resolution better than 80m per pixel.On Earth at this scale, one could easily discern a city park.With New Horizons, we see crystal clear views of mountains, craters and smooth ice fields.""These close-up images, showing the diversity of terrain on Pluto, demonstrate the power of our robotic planetary explorers to return intriguing data to scientists back here on Planet Earth,"" said John Grunsfeld, the head of Nasa's science directorate.""New Horizons thrilled us during the July flyby with the first close images of Pluto, and as the spacecraft transmits the treasure trove of images in its onboard memory back to us, we continue to be amazed by what we see.""The probe got to about 12,500km from the surface of the dwarf and acquired a mass of pictures and other instrument data.But because of the vast separation to Earth, and the modest transmitter on New Horizons, the flow of information back home has been extremely slow.Indeed, it is expected to take until late 2016 to get everything in the probe's memory back on the ground.The mission team prioritised what it wanted to see first, which included some general impressions of Pluto - the broad context. Now, nearly five months on from the flyby, we are being treated to some spectacularly detailed offerings.Friday's pictures come from a photographic strip that incorporates a segment of its icy flat terrain informally known Sputnik Planum, and the adjacent rugged al-Idrisi mountains.""These new images give us a breathtaking, super-high resolution window into Pluto's geology,"" said New Horizons' chief scientist, Alan Stern, of Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado.""Nothing of this quality was available for Venus or Mars until decades after their first flybys; yet at Pluto we're there already - down among the craters, ice fields and mountains - less than five months after flyby! The science we can do with these images is simply unbelievable.""All the pictures were acquired by New Horizons' telescopic Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (Lorri).The probe continues to move deeper into space. It is now about 167 million km beyond the dwarf planet and some 5.2 billion km from Earth.The spacecraft has been put on a course to fly by another object known simply as 2014 MU69. This will occur in just over three years' time.However, the team does not yet have a budget from the US space agency to operate the probe at the roughly 45km-wide body. The scientists plan to submit a formal request for funding in the next few months.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Indian monsoon's past analysed by scientists		"Fossils from the ocean floor are yielding clues to the Indian monsoon millions of years ago.Samples drilled from beneath the Indian Ocean are being used to reconstruct past rainfall and temperature records.Scientists are studying how the Indian monsoon behaved in the past, to shed light on the impact of climate change.The research will lead to a better understanding of how the monsoon over India might change, said Dr Kate Littler of the University of Exeter.As part of the larger-scale Asian monsoon, the monsoon over India is formed due to intense heat from the Sun in late spring, which warms the Northern Indian Ocean, along with the plains of northern India and the Tibetan Plateau.This results in 75% of the year's rain falling between June and September.Simulations of future climate generally suggest a 5-10% increase in monsoon rainfall over India, which could influence the economy and agriculture.Palaeoclimatology - the study of changes in climate taken on the scale of the entire history of Earth - can give valuable clues to how the Earth might respond to future climate change.Dr Littler was part of an expedition to the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea on a scientific drill ship belonging to the UK International Ocean Discovery Program.The team of international scientists collected sediment samples from the deep-sea at several locations.These are being analysed to reconstruct what the regional and global climate was like during the period when the small fossilised marine creatures contained in the sediments lived.""We wanted to capture the whole evolution of the India monsoon from when it intensified about 8 million years ago,"" said Dr Littler.""By analysing these hard-to-reach deep-sea sediments we will make important discoveries about the behaviour of the Indian monsoon in the deep past, and how its behaviour and intensity may change in the near future.""The data will give us a holistic idea of the past behaviour of the monsoon.""Some of the samples came from sites that had never been drilled before.Others contained volcanic ashes, which can be matched to ancient volcanic eruptions, helping in dating the sediments.Their chemistry, geology and biology will be analysed to build up a record of how the annual Indian monsoon cycle has historically been affected by climate change."
science	Fresh views of Ceres but 'spots' remain mysterious		"The team behind Nasa's Dawn mission to Ceres has released striking new images, but remains unable to explain the dwarf planet's most intriguing mystery.Bright spots within a 90km-wide crater have baffled scientists since the probe spied them on its approach.Now in orbit around Ceres, Dawn is gathering detailed data about the world's geology and its composition.Mission researchers described the latest images at the European Planetary Science Congress in Nantes, France.Currently, their best guess to account for the spots is an expanse of some type of salt - but this is speculation.""We haven't solved the source of the white material,"" said the mission's principal investigator Chris Russell from the University of California Los Angeles.""We think that it's salt that has somehow made its way to the surface. We're measuring the contours, trying to understand what the surface variations in that crater are telling us.""Ceres is a 950km-wide dwarf planet sitting in the Solar System's asteroid belt. Dawn is currently orbiting it at a distance of 1,470km and imaging the entire surface every 11 days.It was eight years ago this week that Dawn blasted off on its mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida.Before arriving at Ceres six months ago, the spacecraft dropped in on the asteroid Vesta for just over a year in 2011 and 2012.The latest release of data includes a new topographic map, showing the shape of Ceres' entire surface in the most detail yet.""The irregular shapes of craters on Ceres are especially interesting, resembling craters we see on Saturn's icy moon Rhea,"" said deputy mission chief Carol Raymond from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. ""They are very different from the bowl-shaped craters on Vesta.""There is also a colour-enhanced mosaic image that offers clues about what the dwarf planet is made of - arguably asking more questions than it answers.""There's an interesting blue ring here,"" Prof Russell told a media briefing at the conference. ""We have absolutely no idea what that blue ring is due to.""And there are streaks across the surface that point back to the Occator Crater with its bright spots. We are poking at this, and we're looking for ideas, but we haven't solved the problem yet.""An oddly shaped mountain that towers 6km above relatively flat surrounding terrain is also puzzling the team, Prof Russell added, because it does not look like the result of known geological processes.""We're having difficulty understanding what made that mountain,"" he told reporters.In October, Dawn will start dropping to its final target altitude of 375km for an even closer look at Ceres. This will be its final home. Even after it ceases operations in mid-to-late 2016, the probe is expected to stay in this stable orbit and become a permanent fixture in the dwarf world's sky.""We're not going to leave Ceres. We're going to stay in Ceres orbit forever,"" Prof Russell said.Follow Jonathan on Twitter"
science	Mars rover makes science 'pit stop'	Take a trip to Mars	"After two months of solid driving, the Curiosity Mars rover has finally parked for a few days of intense science.It will be studying the rocks under its wheels, trying to relate them to the outcrops seen earlier in the mission.The Nasa robot will be using just its remote-sensing instruments. There is no expectation to drill.Curiosity plans to make five such stop-overs as it pushes forward to the foothills of Mount Sharp, the big peak that dominates equatorial Gale Crater.Project scientist Prof John Grotzinger told BBC News the rover would be at its current location for ""a few sols only"". A sol is a Martian day, which is 39 minutes longer than an Earth day.Explore the Red Planet with Nasa's robotThe first waypoint will give researchers an opportunity once more to examine conglomerate, a rock type made up of small pebbles cemented together by finer material.On Earth, this is a product of sediment transport in rivers, and indicates that water also flowed across the floor of Gale billions of years ago.Curiosity has previously taken pictures of conglomerate as it rolled by the outcrops, but the stop-over is a chance to acquire much more detail.""As you recall, we never got to analyse the conglomerate [earlier in the mission]. However, if you look at the most recent images, you'll see that we may finally get our chance - we have passed by several exposures of the conglomerate and now we're parked on it. It's looking very promising,"" said Prof Grotzinger.The conglomerate location has been dubbed ""Darwin"".The mission team has divided the floor of the crater into series of squares each about 1.5km (one mile) wide.These quads are used to map out the geology in Gale and to help plan the drive to Mount Sharp.The two-month drive has taken Curiosity out of the square where it has spent most of its time on the planet since landing in August 2012 and into a new zone.""Darwin comes from a list of 100 names the team put together to designate rocks in the Mawson Quadrangle - Mawson is the name of a geologist who studied Antarctic geology,"" said Prof Grotzinger.""Recently, we left the Yellowknife Quadrangle, so instead of naming rocks after geological formations in Canada's north, we now turn to formation names of rocks from Antarctica, and Darwin is one of them. That will be the theme until we cross into the next quad.""Curiosity has now driven a total of 2.9km on Mars. More than two-thirds of this distance has been clocked up since early July.The rover is tracking the base of Mount Sharp, aiming to get to a point where it can cross a wide segment of sand dunes. This bridge provides the safest route to the spectacular foothills. It is, however, still several kilometres to the south west of Darwin, and it will be many months yet before Curiosity arrives at its target destination.Nonetheless, engineers have been delighted by the robot's progress to date. New software has allowed the vehicle to navigate itself on occasions, using pictures taken during a drive to calculate the best path ahead.It used this system, together with human commands, to cover 141m on 5 September - its biggest one-day drive so far.Curiosity has already fulfilled its main mission goal, which was to establish that Gale had conditions in its ancient past that could have permitted microbial life to flourish.The future investigations will fill out this picture.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Rocks record Totten Glacier's rapid retreat history	Unstable geometrySensitivity threshold	"Unchecked climate change could put Antarctica's huge Totten Glacier into an unstable configuration over the coming centuries, a study has warned.If that happens, the ice loss could push up global oceans by 2m, or more.The claim is based on an assessment of the rocks underlying the ice stream.Scientists tell the journal Nature that should the front of the glacier retreat about 150km from its current position, it will then enter a runaway reversal that takes it 200-250km further inland.Most of the big glaciers in the east of the White Continent appear relatively quiescent; Totten is something of an exception.It is experiencing a thinning rate of about half a metre per year, according to the latest satellite measurements.Previous research indicates this is probably being driven by warm ocean water getting under and melting the floating front of the glacier.What Alan Aitken and colleagues have now done is examine a possible future for Totten if the shrinkage continues.They have used gravity and magnetic data recorded over the entire catchment feeding the glacier to understand its past behaviour.They find that the underlying sedimentary rocks at the modern front of Totten are heavily eroded, as are the rocks in fjords deep in the interior of the catchment. The inference is that these sections are where persistent, moving ice has had time to grind down the geology.It is the mid-region, however, that piques the team's interest. Here, the sediments are relatively thick, suggesting that ice fronts have historically been resident in this section for only short periods.This mid-region is also where the rock bed dips inland - a geometry that glaciologists say is naturally unstable and accelerates any glacier retreat.""What this all tells us is that once the ice margin starts to go back, it goes back quite rapidly to a newer, stable position way inland. And if you do that our modelling indicates you will lose ice equivalent to 1.5-2m of sea level rise,"" co-author Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News.The last time Totten retreated to the deep interior of the France-sized catchment was probably in the Pliocene Epoch, he added.""Three-point-five million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were in the region of 400 parts per million - so about where they are now. The atmosphere was a couple of degrees warmer than it is now, which is in line with what we expect for the end of this century if we do nothing about it. The Pliocene is where we're headed.""Even so, the timescale for the far retreat inland would be on the order of centuries, on current trends.The international community has of course committed itself to doing something about climate change, promising at the Paris talks in December to try to keep the global atmospheric temperature rise above pre-industrial levels to ""well below 2C"".Various analyses, however, suggest a 2.7C increase is a more likely outcome, based on the voluntary national curbs to greenhouse gas emissions promised at the meeting.And that variance could be significant, according to research presented at the recent European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna last month.Prof Rob DeConto from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, US, has modelled possible ice losses from the Antarctic continent based on the two temperature figures.For a 2C rise, he found minimal change by the end of this century. On the other hand, for 2.7C he identified ice losses equivalent to many tens of centimetres of sea-level rise.""There's threshold behaviour in the Antarctic ice sheet system,"" Prof DeConto told reporters at EGU.""We don't know exactly where that line is, but according to these results somewhere between 2C and 2.7C makes a very big difference.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Scientists estimate Earth's total carbon store		"There are 1.85 billion, billion tonnes of carbon on Earth, with more than 99% of it resident beneath our feet.Scientists from the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) project have spent 10 years assessing the ""reservoirs and fluxes"" of the chemical element.In other words, they worked out where carbon is held and in what form, and how it moves through the Earth system.The findings will help understand the limits of life on our planet and in the forecasting of volcanic eruptions.""This work really came out of the realisation that much of the carbon that we are concerned about for climate change is only a tiny fraction of our planet's carbon. More than 90% of it is actually in the interior of the Earth - in the crust, in the mantle and the core,"" said Prof Marie Edmonds from Cambridge University, UK.""Very little was known about its form, how much there was, and how mobile it is. And, obviously, this all has huge importance for both the climate of the Earth, but also the habitability of our surface environment,"" the DCO collaborator told BBC News.The accounting was a painstaking process that included monitoring gas emissions from major volcanoes and examining the deep-sea muds that are drawn, or subducted, into the Earth's interior at tectonic plate boundaries.Through the use of lab experiments and models, the team was then able to simulate the likely stores and flows of carbon.Just two-tenths of 1% of Earth's total carbon - about 43,500 billion tonnes - is judged to be above the planet's surface, in the oceans, on land, and in the atmosphere. Everything else is in the deep reservoir, with two-thirds of the total contained within the core.In a fascinating exercise, the DCO attempted to describe how this inventory has changed through time. Working with the University of Sydney, it has reconstructed the history of plate tectonics - to in effect replay the movie of the Earth's inner workings.This revealed that the planet's carbon budget through much of the last billion years has been in a relatively steady state. Put another way, the carbon that has been drawn down into the Earth's interior is roughly equal to what has been outgassed to the atmosphere through the likes of volcanoes.Every now and then, however, there have been major catastrophic perturbations in this cycle.These disturbances were the result of asteroid impacts or prolonged, large-scale volcanism that put substantial volumes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - leading to warming, acidified oceans, and even mass extinctions.The suspicion, of course, is that we are now in another of these great perturbations.Over the past 100 years, carbon emissions from human activities such as through the burning of fossil fuels have been 40 to 100 times greater than our planet's geologic carbon emissions.""It's really revealing that the amount of carbon dioxide we're emitting in a short time period is very close to the magnitude of those previous catastrophic carbon events,"" said Dr Celina Suarez from the University of Arkansas""A lot of those ended in mass extinctions, so there are good reasons why there is discussion now that we might be in a sixth mass extinction.""While this might sound depressing, there is some hopeful news in the new study.In trying to gauge the amount of carbon emitted from volcanoes, the DCO scientists have discovered that eruptions are very often preceded by surges in gas discharge.""Putting very high-resolution sensors on crater rims allowed us to see very short time-scale changes in CO2 flux,"" explained Prof Edmonds.""The flux increased dramatically in the days and weeks before eruptions. We think this holds great promise for forecasting in the future, when used in tandem with things like volcano seismicity, and how the ground is moving.""The DCO has published its findings in several papers in the journal Elements.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Raspberry Pi computer looks down on Earth		"This is a neat image of Planet Earth, showing another beautiful day in the Mediterranean.The outlines of Italy, Corsica and Sardinia are unmistakable. The view to the west includes the Balearics.What's interesting about the picture is that it was taken with a commercial off-the-shelf Raspberry Pi computer and camera.The UK satellite company SSTL attached the equipment to a demonstration spacecraft to see how it would perform.To be clear, the single-board, educational computer has been flown in orbit before - and taken pictures.The European Space Agency sent two Raspberry Pi units to the International Space Station (ISS). But these were ruggedised units specially prepared for the purpose.The one flying on SSTL's Demonstration of Technology satellite (DoT-1) is the same set-up you would purchase on the High Street. SSTL spent £50.The only modification that's been made is to swap the standard lens for a fish-eye one.""We bought three (computers) and did some tests to see which one was performing the best - selected that and flew it,"" explained SSTL engineering director Rob Goddard.""We put it in a metal box but fundamentally we didn't do anything to the Pi Zero.""The Guildford-based company is so impressed with the way the Pi has worked, it's thinking of flying the mini-computer and accessory camera on a more regular basis.There are number of potential roles but the most obvious is as a ""selfie"" inspection tool.Satellites carry deployable structures such as solar panels, booms and antennas. A simple camera set-up might help engineers on the ground troubleshoot a mechanism that wasn't working properly.Outreach is another option; this is how the Pi's been used on the ISS. And, no doubt, there'll be smart people out there who can write algorithms to analyse the stills and videos for some ""quick and easy"" science.SSTL has pioneered the application of so-called COTS - ""commercial off-the-shelf"" - components. It's how the company opened up the market for small satellites, bringing down costs by reaching for solutions in the consumer electronics industry.You cannot put anything in orbit however and just expect it to work; reliability in the harsh of environment of space is hard won. But, at the same time, not everything needs to be gold-plated.The primary mission of DoT-1, launched in July, is to prove the performance of a new Core Data Handling System (Core-DHS). This avionics package is the brains of the satellite, consolidating among other equipment the main computer, GPS, the attitude and orbit control system, and the radio transmitter and receiver.""We used to have all this in different trays and now it's all on the same board,"" said Rob Goddard.""It's cut the mass down significantly. In future the Core-DHS will go in satellites that range in size from 20kg all the way up to 300-400kg. Obviously, in testing this core avionics we wanted to load it up with something as a payload and decided to go with this Raspberry Pi.""The Pi project was run in collaboration with the Surrey Space Centre at Surrey University."
science	SpaceX Starship prototype blows its top		"SpaceX's Starship rocket prototype experienced a major failure during pressurisation testing on Wednesday.A video from the scene in Texas showed the top part of the vehicle rupture.Cryogenic propellants that were being loaded at the time dispersed across the Boca Chica facility in a huge cloud.The US company bills Starship as an all-purpose transportation system of the future. It will be used to ferry people and cargo off Earth, and to destinations around the globe.The Mk-1 prototype was due to begin practice flights to an altitude of 20km in the coming weeks.In a tweet, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that could no longer happen and the ship would be retired.Development work is already being directed at another prototype, labelled the Mk-3.""[Mk-1] had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different,"" Mr Musk told his legion of fans on social media.A statement issued by SpaceX read: ""The purpose of today's test was to pressurise systems to the max, so the outcome was not completely unexpected.""Elon Musk has given regular updates on his plans for Starship, the most recent being in September when he spoke at length about the vehicle's engineering and its likely applications.The Mk-3 vehicle, he said, could be built much more quickly than the Mk-1. It was also capable of going into orbit.Like the SpaceX Falcon-9 rockets, Starship is designed to be reusable. More so, in fact.On the Falcon-9, only the lower booster comes back to Earth after a flight; the upper-stage is expendable.In the case of Starship, it and its booster, which is called the Super Heavy, will make a controlled landing following a mission.Starship has been touted as a rival to the US space agency's (Nasa) big new rocket called the Space Launch System (SLS), which will be used to send astronauts to the Moon and Mars.So far, Nasa is only considering Starship as a potential freighter, to deliver cargo to the lunar surface.SpaceX has experienced a number of very public hardware mishaps in recent times. In April, for example, its Dragon astronaut capsule suffered a dramatic explosion on a test stand.But the company is not afraid of these failures. It believes in a rapid process of ""build, test and iterate"".SpaceX's methods - and successes - have had the rest of the rocket industry racing to catch up."
science	UK satellite 'sets sail' for return to Earth		"A British satellite in space has just ""set sail"" to return to Earth.TechDemoSat-1 was launched in 2014 to trial a number of new in-orbit technologies but has now reached the end of its operational life.To bring it out of the sky faster than would ordinarily be the case, it has deployed a ""drag sail"".This large membrane will catch residual air molecules at its altitude of 635km and pull TDS-1 quickly into Earth's atmosphere where it will burn up.There is a lot of interest currently in ""clean space"" technologies.The orbital highways above the planet are set to become congested with thousands of spacecraft in the coming years, and serious efforts need to be made to tidy away redundant hardware and other space junk if collisions are to be avoided.TechDemoSat was built by SSTL of Guildford, and its 6.7-sq-m Kapton drag sail, called Icarus-1, was developed by Cranfield University.""It is fantastic to see an image of TechDemoSat's deployed drag sail captured by the onboard inspection camera,"" said SSTL's managing director, Sarah Parker.""This in-orbit image of a deployed drag sail on one of our satellites is a first for us and is a fitting culmination of mission operations for this highly innovative small satellite.""Already, the Icarus design is starting to appear on other satellites as well.TechDemoSat was part-funded by Innovate UK and was jointly operated by SSTL and by the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell.It had eight payloads, including one that was developed by students to measure high-energy particles in space.One of TechDemoSat's really big successes, however, was its Sea State experiment.This used a GPS receiver, rather like a radar, to monitor how signals from the Global Positioning System were reflected off the ocean surface.This gave scientists a powerful tool to assess the roughness of the sea surface, and from that to gauge the strength of the winds.The lessons learned with this reflectometry experiment on TDS-1 were incorporated into the instruments that were later flown on the US space agency's CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) mission.CYGNSS was put up specifically to peer through hurricanes to help forecast the strength of the winds when the storms make landfall.The Innovate UK agency, along with the Harwell Catapult, have continued the concept of in-orbit demonstration (IOD) satellites.They have just supported the launch of a small spacecraft that will test a compact microwave radiometer.US-based Orbital Micro Systems expects to use a network of these instruments to make rapid weather forecasting updates.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Europe 'takes too much of Earth resources'		"People in Europe are snatching more than their fair share of the world’s resources, a report says today.It says Europeans emit too much carbon, eat too much food, use large amounts of timber and occupy too much built space.The report for the green group WWF and the Global Footprint Network says Europeans contribute disproportionately to depleting resources.The UK government says it is leading the world in trying to reduce the impact of Europe on the planet.But the report says that if everyone in the world had the same environmental impact as the average EU resident, 10 May would be the date by which humans would have used as much from nature as the planet can annually renew.That's why the groups name 10 May as EU Earth Overshoot Day. For the rest of the year, they say, Europeans will live by depleting the “natural capital” of the Earth.This means more carbon emissions than the planet’s natural ecosystems can absorb; more plant life destroyed through deforestation than nature can regenerate; depleted fishing grounds; soil erosion and loss of species.The report says the EU and its citizens are currently using twice as many resources than the EU's own ecosystems are able to renew.It adds that the EU uses almost 20% of the Earth’s “biocapacity”, even though it comprises only 7% of the world population.In other words, 2.8 planets would be needed if everyone consumed at the rate of the average EU resident.The report comes a day after EU leaders held a summit on the Future of Europe in Romania, and two weeks before the European Parliament elections.It recommends urgent changes to fully protect and restore nature in Europe by 2030 and to cut EU carbon emissions almost completely by 2040.The EU does aspire to better use of the world's resources. It has a drive for a so-called ""circular economy"" in which resources are continually, re-used, re-purposed or recycled.The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, outlined proposals at this week's EU summit for the bloc to protect Nature better, improve farming practices and move towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions.Eight countries including France supported the ambition of net zero by 2050. But observers at the summit in Romania say the plan failed to get the backing of other nations including - crucially - Germany.The UK government is currently considering a proposal for net zero emissions.A spokesperson said: ""We want to leave our environment in a better state than we found it.""Our 25-year Environment Plan outlines steps to achieve this ambition and the forthcoming Environment Bill will put environmental ambition and accountability at the heart of government.""We share the Global Footprint Network's ambition to push back Overshoot Day.""Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	Planet Mercury passes across the face of the Sun		"Mercury has made a rare transit, where the planet passes across the face of the Sun as seen from Earth.During the transit, Mercury appeared as a dark silhouetted disc against the bright surface of our star.There are 14 transits in this century; the last before this was in 2016, but the next event will not occur until 2032.The transit began at 12:35 GMT, when the edge of Mercury appeared to touch the curvature of the Sun.It ended at 18:04 GMT when the edge of the silhouetted planet appeared to leave the Sun's disc.Professor Mike Cruise, president of the UK's Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), said: ""This is a rare event, and we'll have to wait 13 years until it happens again. Transits are a visible demonstration of how the planets move around the Sun.""The entire event was visible from the eastern US and Canada, the south-western tip of Greenland, most of the Caribbean, Central America, the whole of South America and some of West Africa.In Europe (including the UK), the Middle East, and most of Africa, the Sun set before the transit ended, and so the latter part of the event was not visible.In most of the US and Canada, and New Zealand, the transit was in progress as the Sun rose. Observers in eastern Asia, southern and south-eastern Asia, and Australia were not able to see the transit.Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System.It completes each orbit around the Sun every 88 days, and passes between the Earth and Sun every 116 days. As the orbit of Mercury around the Sun is tilted compared with the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, the planet normally appears to pass above or below our nearest star.A transit can only take place when the Earth, Mercury and the Sun are exactly in line in three dimensions."
science	Climate change: Scientists test radical ways to fix Earth's climate	Refreezing the polesRecycling CO2Ocean greeningThinking the unthinkable	"Scientists in Cambridge plan to set up a research centre to develop new ways to repair the Earth's climate.It will investigate radical approaches such as refreezing the Earth's poles and removing CO2 from the atmosphere.The centre is being created because of fears that current approaches will not on their own stop dangerous and irreversible damage to the planet.The initiative is the first of its kind in the world and could lead to dramatic reductions in carbon emissions.The initiative is co-ordinated by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Prof Sir David King.""What we do over the next 10 years will determine the future of humanity for the next 10,000 years. There is no major centre in the world that would be focused on this one big issue,"" he told BBC News.Some of the approaches described by Sir David are often known collectively as geoengineering.The Centre for Climate Repair is part of Cambridge university's Carbon Neutral Futures Initiative, led by Dr Emily Shuckburgh.She, said the initiative's mission would be to ""solve the climate problem"".""It has to be. And we can't fail on it,"" she said.It will bring together scientists and engineers with social scientists.""This really is one of the most important challenges of our time, and we know we need to be responding to it with all our efforts,"" Dr Shuckburgh told BBC News.One of the most promising ideas for refreezing the poles is to ""brighten"" the clouds above them.The idea is to pump seawater up to tall masts on uncrewed ships through very fine nozzles.This produces tiny particles of salt which are injected into the clouds, which makes them more widespread and reflective, and so cool the areas below them.Another new approach is a variant of an idea called carbon capture and storage (CCS).CCS involves collecting carbon dioxide emissions from coal or gas fired power stations or steel plants and storing it underground.Prof Peter Styring, of the University of Sheffield, is developing a carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) pilot scheme with Tata Steel in Port Talbot in South Wales which effectively recycles CO2.The scheme involves setting up a plant on-site which converts the firm's carbon emissions into fuel using the plant's waste heat, according to Prof Styring.""We have a source of hydrogen, we have a source of carbon dioxide, we have a source of heat and we have a source of renewable electricity from the plant,"" he told BBC News.""We're going to harness all those and we're going to make synthetic fuels.""Other ideas the centre would explore include greening the oceans so they can take up more CO2.Such schemes involve fertilising the sea with iron salts which promote the growth of plankton.Previous experiments have shown that they don't take up sufficient CO2 to make the scheme worthwhile and might disrupt the ecosystem.But according to Prof Callum Roberts of York University, approaches that are currently thought beyond the pale now have to be considered and, if possible, made to work.This is because the alternative of damaging and potentially irreversible climate change is considered beyond the pale.""Early in my career, people threw their hands up in horror at suggestions of more interventionist solutions to fix coral reefs,"" Prof Roberts said.""Now they are looking in desperation at an ecosystem that will be gone at the end of the century and now all options are on the table"".The options include genetically engineering heat-resistant coral or dumping chemicals into the sea to make the sea less acidic.""At the moment, I happen to think that harnessing nature to mitigate climate change is a better way to go. But I do see the legitimacy of exploring [more radical] options as a means of steering us towards a better future,"" Prof Roberts said.Such ideas have many potential downsides and may prove to be unfeasible.But Peter Wadhams, a professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University, said that they should be properly assessed to see if the downsides can be overcome, because he believes that reduction of CO2 emissions on its own won't be enough.""If we reduce our emissions all we are doing is making the global climate warmer a bit more slowly. That is no good because it's already too warm and we have already got too much CO2 in the atmosphere,"" Prof Wadhams said.""So climate repair can actually take it out of the atmosphere. We can get the level down below what it is now and actually cool the climate bringing it back to what it was before global warming,"" he added.Follow Pallabon TwitterSign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger"
science	America colonisation ‘cooled Earth's climate’	What does the study show?Where's the support for the connection?Are there lessons for modern climate policy?	"Colonisation of the Americas at the end of the 15th Century killed so many people, it disturbed Earth's climate.That's the conclusion of scientists from University College London, UK.The team says the disruption that followed European settlement led to a huge swathe of abandoned agricultural land being reclaimed by fast-growing trees and other vegetation.This pulled down enough carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere to eventually chill the planet.It's a cooling period often referred to in the history books as the ""Little Ice Age"" - a time when winters in Europe would see the Thames in London regularly freeze over.""The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas led to the abandonment of enough cleared land that the resulting terrestrial carbon uptake had a detectable impact on both atmospheric CO₂ and global surface air temperatures,"" Alexander Koch and colleagues write in their paper published in Quaternary Science Reviews.The team reviewed all the population data it could find on how many people were living in the Americas prior to first contact with Europeans in 1492.It then assessed how the numbers changed in following decades as the continents were ravaged by introduced disease (smallpox, measles, etc), warfare, slavery and societal collapse.It's the UCL group's estimate that 60 million people were living across the Americas at the end of the 15th Century (about 10% of the world's total population), and that this was reduced to just five or six million within a hundred years.The scientists calculated how much land previously cultivated by indigenous civilisations would have fallen into disuse, and what the impact would be if this ground was then repossessed by forest and savannah.The area is in the order of 56 million hectares, close in size to a country like modern France.This scale of regrowth is figured to have drawn down sufficient CO₂ that the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere eventually fell by 7-10ppm (that is 7-10 molecules of CO₂ in every one million molecules in the air).""To put that in the modern context - we basically burn (fossil fuels) and produce about 3ppm per year. So, we're talking a large amount of carbon that's being sucked out of the atmosphere,"" explained co-author Prof Mark Maslin.""There is a marked cooling around that time (1500s/1600s) which is called the Little Ice Age, and what's interesting is that we can see natural processes giving a little bit of cooling, but actually to get the full cooling - double the natural processes - you have to have this genocide-generated drop in CO₂.""The drop in CO₂ at the time of the Great Dying is evident in the ice core records from Antarctica.Air bubbles trapped in these frozen samples show a fall in their concentration of carbon dioxide.The atomic composition of the gas also suggests strongly that the decline is being driven by land processes somewhere on Earth.In addition, the UCL team says the story fits with the records of charcoal and pollen deposits in the Americas.These show the sort of perturbation expected from a decline in the use of fire to manage land, and a big grow-back of natural vegetation.Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at Reading University, was not involved in the study. He commented: ""Scientists understand that the so-called Little Ice Age was caused by several factors - a drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, a series of large volcanic eruptions, changes in land use and a temporary decline in solar activity.""This new study demonstrates that the drop in CO₂ is itself partly due the settlement of the Americas and resulting collapse of the indigenous population, allowing regrowth of natural vegetation. It demonstrates that human activities affected the climate well before the industrial revolution began.""Co-author Dr Chris Brierley believes there is. He said the fall-out from the terrible population crash and re-wilding of the Americas illustrated the challenge faced by some global warming solutions.""There is a lot of talk around 'negative emissions' approaches and using tree-planting to take CO₂ out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change,"" he told BBC News.""And what we see from this study is the scale of what's required, because the Great Dying resulted in an area the size of France being reforested and that gave us only a few ppm. This is useful; it shows us what reforestation can do. But at the same, that kind of reduction is worth perhaps just two years of fossil fuel emissions at the present rate.""The study also has a bearing on discussions about the creation of a new label to describe humanity's time - and impacts - on Earth.This epoch would be called the Anthropocene, and there is currently a lively debate over how it should be recognised in the geological record.Some researchers say it would be most obvious in deposits that record the great acceleration in industrial activity from the 1950s onwards.But the UCL team argues that the Great Dying in the Americas shows there are significant human interactions that left a deep and indelible mark on the planet long before the mid-20th Century.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	SpaceX Dragon demo capsule returns to Earth		"America's new commercial astronaut capsule has completed its demonstration flight with a successful splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean.The SpaceX Dragon vehicle left the International Space Station after being docked there for the past week, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere.It had a heat-shield to protect it from the high temperatures of re-entry.Four parachutes brought it into ""soft contact"" with water about 450km from Cape Canaveral, Florida.The mission - which had no humans aboard, only a dummy covered in sensors - went according to plan.The Dragon has set the stage for the US space agency Nasa to approve the vehicle for crewed flights.Not since the end of the Space Shuttle programme has the US been able to send its own astronauts into orbit. It has had to rely instead on Russia and its Soyuz spacecraft, launching from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.Nasa hopes to bring this near-eight year gap in capability to an end with the introduction of two new commercial transportation systems - the Dragon and another vehicle being developed by aerospace giant Boeing.The first crewed flight of the Dragon could occur as soon as July, although this target date is likely to slip into the summer as engineers work through the post-flight analysis.Splashdown occurred at about 08:45 EST (13:45 GMT). A boat, called GO Searcher, was waiting to recover the capsule. There were cheers at mission control as the capsule landed in the Atlantic.The Dragon's owner, SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, had previously expressed some anxiety about how the capsule would cope with re-entry, given that the vehicle's backshell, or conical upper-section, has a somewhat irregular shape that could lead to a roll instability at hypersonic speeds.The director of crew mission management at Space X, Benjamin Reed, spoke to Nasa TV moments after the capsule splashed down.""It was an incredible journey to get to this moment,"" he said. ""The teams have just done an amazing job - both the Space X and the Nasa teams jointly.""I can't believe how well the whole mission has gone. Pretty much everything at every point everything's been nailed all the way.""Nasa has seed-funded Boeing to produce a capsule of its own called the Starliner.This vehicle is scheduled to have its uncrewed demonstration flight in April or soon after.Ultimately, Nasa will be purchasing seats in both the SpaceX and Boeing systems to take its astronauts to the ISS. But the commercial nature of the relationship means the companies will be free to sell rides to secondary customers.These will no doubt include the space agencies of other nations, but perhaps some private space companies and individuals too.""We're driving down costs for low-Earth orbit; we're commercialising low-Earth orbit… with human activities where Nasa can be a customer. And then we can use the tax-payer resources that are bestowed upon us to do exploration, to go further, to go back to the Moon sustainably,"" said Nasa chief Jim Bridenstine.""We want to stay at the Moon and ultimately go on to Mars.""Nasa has already selected its first astronauts to fly aboard a crewed Dragon. They are Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.""We have a significant amount of training we need to go through that will walk through all the various phases of flight,"" Behnken said of the coming months.This will include understanding what to do if there is an emergency during their mission.One problem that could occur is a failure of the Dragon's carrier rocket during the ascent to orbit.The demonstration capsule's lift-off last Saturday was picture perfect, but some kind of booster anomaly can never be discounted.In such a scenario, a Dragon's powerful thrusters would push it away from the launcher to safety.SpaceX will practise this very procedure shortly.The team plans to take the current Dragon after its return and put it on another rocket and launch it out of the Kennedy Space Center. A minute into this flight, a deliberate abort will be commanded.The timing is significant because it's when the vehicle is experiencing maximum aerodynamic pressure.If the Dragon can stably depart in such circumstances, it ought be able to handle an escape at any stage in a flight.As with the present demo, no-one will be aboard for this hazardous test."
science	Killer frog disease 'part of Earth's sixth mass extinction'		"A fungus that kills amphibians is responsible for the biggest documented loss of nature from a single disease, say researchers.Better biosecurity and wildlife trade restrictions are urgently needed to prevent any more extinctions, they say.The disease, chytridiomycosis, has caused mass die-offs in frogs, toads and salamanders over the past 50 years, including extinctions of 90 species, according to a review of evidence.It has spread to over 60 countries.Australia, Central America and South America are particularly hard hit.""Highly virulent wildlife disease, including chytridiomycosis, is contributing to the Earth's sixth mass extinction,"" said Dr Ben Scheele of The Australian National University in Canberra.""We've lost some really amazing species.""Three decades ago, scientists began to notice amphibians were dying around the world. The suspect was identified as a fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which attacks the skin of amphibians, effectively ""eating them"" alive.A big review of the evidence, published in the journal Science, reveals:More stories you might like:The scientists say globalisation and the wildlife trade are the main causes of this global pandemic and are enabling the spread of the disease.""Humans are moving plants and animals around the world at an increasingly rapid rate, introducing pathogens into new areas,"" said Dr Scheele.According to two Canadian experts, the fungus is ""one more nail in the coffin for the state of amphibians globally"".Habitat loss, exploitation and climate change are still the main threat for thousands of species, say Dan Greenberg and Wendy Palen of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada.""These stressors often act in concert, but clear management actions exist to address at least some of them: protect habitat, limit collection of wild populations, and restrict trade,"" they wrote in an article commenting on the new research in Science.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	'Siberian unicorn' walked Earth with humans	What do we know about the ancient rhino?Why might it have gone extinct?What does it tell us about the fate of modern rhinos?Where do unicorn myths come from?	"A giant rhino that may have been the origin of the unicorn myth survived until at least 39,000 years ago - much longer than previously thought.Known as the Siberian unicorn, the animal had a long horn on its nose, and roamed the grasslands of Eurasia.New evidence shows the hefty beast may have eventually died out because it was such a picky eater.Scientists say knowing more about the animal's extinction could help save the remaining rhinos on the planet.Rhinos are in particular danger of extinction because they are very picky about their habitat, said Prof Adrian Lister of the Natural History Museum, London, who led the study.""Any change in their environment is a danger for them,"" he told BBC News. ""And, of course, what we've also learned from the fossil record is that once a species is gone, that's it, it's gone for good.""Weighing in at a mighty four tonnes, with an extraordinary single horn on its head, the ""Siberian unicorn"", shared the earth with early modern humans up until at least 39,000 years ago.The rhino, Elasmotherium sibericum, was thought to have become extinct between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago.By radiocarbon-dating a total of 23 specimens, researchers found the Ice Age giant in fact survived in Eastern Europe and Central Asia until at least 39,000 years ago.They also isolated DNA from the ancient rhino for the first time, showing it split from the modern group of rhinos about 40 million years ago.The extinction of the Siberian unicorn marks the end point of an entire group of rhinos.The study also involved examining the animals' teeth, confirming they grazed on tough, dry grasses.""It was walking along like a kind of prehistoric lawnmower really...it's just grazing along the ground,"" said Prof Lister.The rhino's specialised diet may have been its downfall. As the Earth warmed up and started to emerge from the Ice Age around 40,000 years ago, grasslands started to shrink, likely pushing the animal to extinction.Hundreds of large mammal species disappeared after the last Ice Age, due to climate change, loss of vegetation and human hunting.Today there are just five remaining species of rhino. Very few survive outside national parks and reserves due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over many decades.By studying fossilised rhinos, scientists can learn more about the fate of the many prehistoric rhino species that once roamed the planet and how they adapted to climate change and human pressures.Legends of the unicorn, or a beast with a single horn, have been around for millennia.Some have argued that the horn of the rhino may have been the basis of myths about unicorns, although other animals - such as the tusked narwhal - are more likely contenders.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Amount of deep life on Earth quantified	How did they work out the scale of life?What's the importance of carbon?What are the implications of this research?	"Scientists have estimated the total amount of life on Earth that exists below ground - and it is vast.You would need a microscope to see this subterranean biosphere, however.It is made up mostly of microbes, such as bacteria and their evolutionary cousins, the archaea.Nonetheless, it represents a lot of carbon - about 15 to 23 billion tonnes of it. That is hundreds of times more carbon than is woven into all the humans on the planet.""Something like 70% of the total number of microbes on Earth are below our feet,"" said Karen Lloyd from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, US.""So, this changes our perception of where we find life on Earth, from mostly on the surface in things like trees and whales and dolphins, to most of it actually being underground,"" she told BBC News.Prof Lloyd is part of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) project, a near-decade long effort to identify how the ubiquitous element is cycled through the Earth system. The consortium is reporting its latest discoveries here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) annual Fall Meeting in Washington DC.The mass numbers it quotes can only be a rough estimate.They are derived from multiple studies that have dug or drilled several kilometres into the crust, both on the continents and at sea.Scientists will routinely pull up rock and other sediment samples and count the number living cells in a given volume.The DCO teams have taken these inventories and used models to construct a broader picture of Earth's total biomass.""Even though these sample sites are but pinpricks around the planet, we've managed now to look at enough different environments that we can produce reasonable values for the total amount of carbon locked up in lifeforms,"" said Rick Colwell from Oregon State University.The DCO consortium reckons the deep biosphere constitutes about 2 to 2.3 billion cubic km. That is almost twice the volume of all the oceans.Bacteria and archaea (microbes with no membrane-bound nucleus) dominate. But there are also eukarya (microbes or multicellular organisms with cells that contain a nucleus as well as membrane-bound organelles) down there, such as the tiny nematode worms discovered in rock cracks at the bottom of deep mines.Science has barely begun to describe this microscopic menagerie.Deep microbes are often quite different to seemingly related species that thrive at the surface, with life cycles that operate on near-geologic timescales. And because these underground organisms persist far from sunlight they must exploit chemosynthesis - as opposed to photosynthesis - to nourish themselves. The minerals in the rocks around them are their larder.The role all these organisms play in shifting carbon about the Earth is profound, according to the DCO's executive director, Bob Hazen.""You cannot understand carbon on Earth without understanding the diversity and influence of life. Cells turn over carbon - they take carbon in, they breathe it out. They do amazing things to transform their local environments,"" he explained.""Although the total amount of carbon in other sources is much, much larger than in life, life has a disproportionate affect on Earth's carbon cycle.""Another aspect of the research is what is says about the absolute limits of life on Earth in terms of temperature, pressure, and the availability of energy.""The current known upper-limit for life is 122 degrees Celsius, which happens to be the temperature of sterilisation equipment we typically use in labs,"" said Dr Lloyd.""But there's no-one I know who thinks that's the theoretical limit. For example, we know some of the problems associated with high temperatures, such as the disordering of lipids and membranes, is at least partially compensated by higher pressures. Which means it's possible we could find even higher temperature organisms the deeper we go down.""And this has clear implications for the possibility that life exists somewhere else in the Solar System, adds Prof Colwell.""I think it's probably reasonable to assume that the subsurface of other planets and their moons are habitable, especially since we've seen here on Earth that organisms can function far away from sunlight using the energy provided directly from the rocks deep underground,"" he told BBC News.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: Blue planet will get even bluer as Earth warms		"Rising temperatures will change the colour of the world's oceans, making them more blue in the coming decades say scientists.They found that increased heat will change the mixture of phytoplankton or tiny marine organisms in the seas, which absorb and reflect light.Scientists say there will be less of them in the waters in the decades to come.This will drive a colour change in more than 50% of the world's seas by 2100.Phytoplankton play a hugely important role in the oceans.As well as turning sunlight into chemical energy, and consuming carbon dioxide, they are the bottom rung on the marine food chain.They also play an important role in how we see the oceans with our eyes.The more phytoplankton in the water, the less blue the seas will appear, and the more likely they will be to have a greenish colour.Previous research has shown that with warming, the oceans will see a reduction in phytoplankton in many places.This new study models the likely impact these changes will have on the colour of the ocean and the planet as the world warms up.""What we find is that the colour will change, probably not so much that you will see by eye, but certainly sensors will be able to pick up that there's a change,"" lead author Dr Stephanie Dutkiewicz from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US, told BBC News.""And it will likely be one of the earliest warning signals that we have changed the ecology of the ocean.""The researchers point out that the changes are an indirect impact of climate change, as warming is affecting the circulation of the seas, this is changing the amount of food available for phytoplankton.Another difference from previous studies is that this time, the researchers are looking solely at satellite measurements of reflected light from the phytoplankton.In the past, scientists have used satellite measurements of chlorophyll, a light harvesting pigment found in phytoplankton, to try and understand the impact of climate change.However they've had problems working out the difference between natural variability and human induced warming on this green pigment. They believe it will be 30-40 years before they can say for definite that climate change is having an impact on chlorophyll.""What we've shown is that the colour in the blue green range is going to show that signal of change sooner, in some places in maybe the next decade,"" said Dr Dutkiewicz.""More of the ocean is going to show a change in colour over the next few decades than we would see in chlorophyll, the changing colour is going to be more of a warning signal.""The researchers believe that the North Atlantic will be one of the first places to reflect the change - followed by locations in the Southern Ocean.The team modelled what would happen to the oceans by the end of this century if the world warmed by 3C, which is close to where temperatures are likely to be, if every country sticks to the promises they have made in the Paris climate agreement.""There will be a noticeable difference in the colour of 50% of the ocean by the end of the 21st century,"" Dr Dutkiewicz said.""It could be potentially quite serious. Different types of phytoplankton absorb light differently, and if climate change shifts one community of phytoplankton to another, that will also change the types of food webs they can support. ""The team also believe that the world will see changes in some of the green shades seen in the oceans as well.This will happen because some species of phytoplankton will respond well to a warmer environment and will create larger blooms of more diverse marine organisms. This is likely to show up with more green regions near the equator and the poles, the researchers say.The study has been published in the journal Nature Communications."
science	The violent solar storms that threaten Earth	What causes an extreme solar event?When will the next extreme weather event happen?Planning ahead	A violent storm on the Sun could cripple communications on Earth and cause huge economic damage, scientists have warned. Why are solar storms such a threat?In 1972, dozens of sea mines off the coast of Vietnam mysteriously exploded.It was recently confirmed the cause was solar storms, which can significantly disrupt the Earth's magnetic field.Today, the effects of a similar event could be much more serious - disrupting the technology we rely on for everything from satellites to power grids. The cost to the UK economy alone of an unexpected event has been estimated at £16bn.There are good reasons why we are vulnerable to events taking place millions of miles from Earth.The Sun is a star, a seething mass of electrified hydrogen. As this fluid moves around, it builds up energy within its complex magnetic field.This magnetic energy is released through intense flashes of light known as solar flares and through vast eruptions of material and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections or solar storms.While flares can disrupt radio communication on Earth, solar storms pose the greatest threat.Each storm contains the energy equivalent to 100,000 times the world's entire nuclear arsenal, although this is spread throughout an enormous volume in space.The Sun rotates like a vast spinning firework, launching eruptions into space in all directions.If one of these heads towards our planet, with a magnetic field aligned opposite to the Earth's, the two fields can merge together. As the solar storm washes past, some of the Earth's magnetic field is distorted into a long tail.And when this distorted magnetic field eventually snaps back, it accelerates electrified particles towards the Earth. Here, they strike the upper atmosphere, heating it and causing it to glow in a spectacular display known as the northern and southern lights.But this distortion of the Earth's magnetic field has other, more significant effects.It is thought to have triggered the sea mines back in 1972. The mines were designed to detect small variations in the magnetic field caused by the approach of metal-hulled boats. But their engineers hadn't anticipated that solar activity could have the same effect.Scientists are looking for clues as to what triggers these vast eruptions and, once they have been launched, how to track them through interplanetary space.Our records of the Earth's magnetic field go back as far as the mid-19th Century. They suggest an extreme space weather event is likely to occur once every 100 years, although smaller events will happen more frequently. In 1859, the Carrington Event - most extreme solar storm recorded to date - caused telegraph systems to spark and for the northern lights to be spotted as far south as the Bahamas.The next time it happens, the effects are likely to be far more serious.With every solar cycle, our global community has become more reliant on technology.In 2018, space satellites are central to global communication and navigation, while aeroplanes connect continents and extensive power grids crisscross the world.All of these could be badly affected by the aftermath of extreme solar events.Electronic systems on spacecraft and aeroplanes could be harmed as their miniaturised electronics are zapped by energetic particles accelerated into our atmosphere, while power networks on the ground can be overwhelmed by excess electrical currents.More like thisEnough satellites and power grids have failed during past space weather events to make it clear that the Sun must be closely monitored, to help predict when a solar storm will affect Earth.Forecasters are working on this all over the world, from the UK's Met Office to the Australian Met Bureau and the Noaa Space Weather Prediction Center in the US.All being well, they can detect when a storm is heading towards Earth and predict its arrival time within six hours. That still leaves relatively little time to prepare but forecasting would cut the cost to the UK economy from £16bn to £3bn.Space weather now appears on the UK government's risk register, alongside other, more familiar risks such as a flu pandemic and severe flooding. It has been rated at the equivalent risk as a severe heatwave or the emergence of a new infectious disease.Government agencies are now speaking to power companies, spacecraft and airline operators to ensure they have plans in place to limit the impact of an extreme space weather event.It is vital, for example, to make sure enough power is available to refrigerate supplies of food and medicine as well as to make sure water and fuel can be pumped as needed.If communication with some satellites is lost, familiar technologies such as sat-navs and satellite television could stop working.Spacecraft engineers study extreme events so they can build resilience into spacecraft, protecting vulnerable electronics and installing backup systems.An accurate space weather forecast would enable operators to further protect their assets by ensuring they were in a safe state as the storm passed.Many planes fly over the north pole en route from Europe to North America. During space weather events, aircraft operators re-route aeroplanes away from the polar skies, where most of the energetic particles enter Earth's atmosphere.This is to limit exposure to enhanced radiation doses and ensure reliable radio communication.We have learned much about space weather since the events of 1972 but as modern technologies evolve, we need to make sure they can withstand the worst the Sun can throw at us.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Chris Scott is a professor of space and atmospheric physics, at the University of Reading.

science	Robots ahoy! Mapping Earth's surface	Ocean Discovery XPRIZE rules for finalSEA-KIT Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV)	"One of the big favourites to win the ocean-mapping XPRIZE has formally confirmed its presence in the final.The GEBCO-Nippon Foundation Alumni Team has just completed 24-hour trials of its technology and is ready for the competition's ultimate challenge.This requires a mapping system inside a day to survey a section of seabed that is 500-sq-km in area and 4,000m-deep.GEBCO-NF will use a state-of-the-art underwater vehicle launched from the back of a robotic boat.The uncrewed surface vessel, known as SEA-KIT, will be of particular interest to British readers.It has been designed by Hushcraft of Essex, which believes its 12m-long XPRIZE concept is the forerunner for a new class of autonomous, ocean-going boats.The location of the final, due to take place in the next three months, is currently being kept a secret, but GEBCO-NF team lead Yulia Zarayskaya says her group will be well prepared wherever it is sent.""We're pretty much there,"" she told BBC News. ""We still have some things to work out in terms of how best to operate our system in 24 hours and to manage the data and data processing. Obviously, we've had some ups and down, but at this stage I'd say we know now how to bring it all together.""Today's maps of the ocean floor are woeful. Less than 15% of its bathymetry (depth) has been measured in a meaningfully accurate way.Most of what we know about the shape of the global seabed comes from gravity observations made by satellite and this method cannot see anything smaller than a kilometre in size.The $7m Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE was launched to find new technologies and new strategies to try to close the knowledge gap.Eight teams from around the world are expected to take on the year's-end challenge. They will be using all manner of robotic systems that operate above, on and below the water's surface.GEBCO-NF is a natural candidate. GEBCO stands for General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans - it is the official keeper, if you like, for maps of the sea-floor. And many of its XPRIZE team-members have gone through the organisation's postgraduate training course at the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping at the University of New Hampshire, US.In the group's solution, a top-of-the-range autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from the Norwegian Kongsberg Maritime company will make the sea-floor map using an echosounder. The submersible will be deployed and recovered by SEA-KIT.The rules of the competition demand that team-members cannot themselves be in the survey zone at the time and so that means the surface vessel also requires very efficient remote control and/or autonomy to get itself into the right place to release the Kongsberg sub - and get it back again after the mapping exercise.Key to this, says Hushcraft's Ben Simpson, is a communications and control system called Global Situational Awareness via Internet, or G-SAVI.""We are now not only able to view CCTV, thermal imaging and radar, but remotely control these from anywhere in the world,"" he explained. ""Other features include listening live to things going on onboard and repeat VHF to speak to other vessels in the vicinity of SEA-KIT - all from a remote office anywhere you have internet.""It's a great step towards safely operating a vessel over the horizon anywhere in the world.""The 12-tonne, aluminium-hulled SEA-KIT uses a conveyor belt mechanism in its aft section to launch the AUV.An acoustic connection ensures the pair always know each other's position.When the time comes for recovery, SEA-KIT manoeuvres itself in front of the sub, which then drives on to the rising ramp.Hushcraft envisions multiple roles for the uncrewed boat. Its remote-controlled and autonomous capabilities mean it could be sent into dangerous situations, for example to spread dispersants on an oil spill or to take scientific measurements in front of an ice shelf.The present design can carry a payload of up 2.5 tonnes. ""The key driver for me is it's universal platform,"" said Mr Simpson. ""You don't have to keep tweaking the design. SEA-KIT is agnostic with regards to the equipment you want to put on it. It's got lots of bolting on points.""The ocean community - scientific and industrial - has set itself a target to map the entire ocean floor to a reasonable standard by 2030. That will require higher investment, but likely also a few of the new approaches to be demonstrated in the XPRIZE final, says GEBCO-NF project coordinator Rochelle Wigley.""It can be done; it's possible, although it might cost the same as a Mars mission,"" she told BBC News. ""That funding is not immediately available. Ocean science hasn't been seen as sexy.

science	Nasa's IceSat space laser makes height maps of Earth	Other stories from the AGU meeting you might like:	"One of the most powerful Earth observation tools ever put in orbit is now gathering data about the planet.IceSat-2 was launched just under three months ago to measure the shape of the ice sheets to a precision of 2cm.But the Nasa spacecraft's laser instrument is also now returning a whole raft of other information.It is mapping the height of the land, of rivers, lakes, forests; and in a remarkable demonstration of capability - even the depth of the seafloor.""We can see down to 30m in really clear waters,"" said Lori Magruder, the science team leader on the IceSat mission. ""We saw one IceSat track just recently that covers 300km in the Caribbean and you see the ocean floor the entire way,"" the University of Texas researcher told BBC News.She was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting - the largest annual gathering of Earth and space scientists.Nasa has been showcasing the early data from the new satellite at the AGU meeting.IceSat-2 was sent up on 15 September. It carries just the single instrument - a half-tonne green laser that fires about 10,000 pulses of light every second.Each of those shots goes down to the Earth and bounces back up on a timescale of about 3.3 milliseconds. The exact time equates to the height of the reflecting surface.Scientists will be using this optical ""tape measure"" to look in particular for the elevation changes in Antarctica and Greenland that might indicate melting.And the great advantage of the new laser system is that it can detect behaviour in areas that have been beyond the vision of previous satellites.""We're resolving every valley in the mountains,"" said team-member Ben Smith from the University of Washington, Seattle.""These have been really difficult targets for altimeters in the past, which have often used radar instead of lasers and they tend to show you just a big lump where the mountains are. But we can see very steeply sloping surfaces; we can see valley glaciers; we'll be able to make out very small details.""As its name suggests, IceSat-2 is a follow-on mission. It is a successor and upgrade to the IceSat-1 mission that flew from 2003 to 2009.The old spacecraft helped pioneer the assessment of sea-ice volume in the Arctic. This is a measurement that involves sensing the difference in height between the top of the floating floes and the surface of the ocean.The offset - known as the freeboard - allows researchers to calculate that part of the ice submerged below water. But it requires the satellite to find the cracks in floes where the measurement can be made - and this has just become a whole lot easier thanks to the new laser's horizontal footprint of about 25-30m.""Eighty percent of the cracks are less than 50m across, so the resolution of IceSat is very important,"" said Ron Kwok from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.Heights are calculated from just 150 photons, or particles, of reflected light, but even from just this small number, IceSat-2 is able to produce an elevation number to an accuracy of a little over 2cm. The AGU meeting was shown some of the first efforts to build a sea-ice thickness map for the Arctic.Sample data was also presented of forested areas. The laser sees the tree canopy and the ground underneath, which will enable new assessments to be made of the amount of carbon stored in vegetation across the Earth.But it is probably the bathymetry information that grabs the immediate headlines.It was suspected that the laser might be able to measure the depth of shallow coastal waters, but not this well.Already a project is being developed to use IceSat to map the near-shores of about 100 small islands in the Pacific.""You need to know the bathymetry to understand how waves will move on to the reefs and atolls,"" explained Sinéad Farrell from the University of Maryland. ""If you have storm surges, for example, you need to know those depths to accurately model what those waves will do; and currently there's almost no bathymetry data at all for these islands.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	German satellites sense Earth's lumps and bumps	How was the map made?How precise is the map?What are the next steps?What comes after these satellites?	"The German space agency (DLR) has released a spectacular 3D map of Earth.Built from images acquired by two radar satellites, it traces the variations in height across all land surfaces - an area totalling more than 148 million sq km.DLR is making the map free and open, enabling any scientist to download and use it.There will be myriad applications, from forecasting where flood waters flow to planning big infrastructure projects.The two satellites involved are called TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X.Like all radar spacecraft, they send down microwave pulses to the surface of the planet and then time how long the signals take to bounce back.The shorter the time interval, the higher the ground. TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X fly virtually side by side, sometimes coming to within 200m of each other.This is complex to control, but it gives the pair ""stereo vision"", by allowing them to operate an interferometric mode in which one spacecraft acts as a transmitter/receiver and the other as a second receiver.The resolution of the newly released digital elevation model (DEM) is 90m, meaning the land surface has been divided up into squares that are 90m along the side.The absolute accuracy in those squares in the vertical dimension is 1m, making the DEM a powerful rendering of all the Earth's lumps and bumps.There are DEMs that have far higher resolution on regional scales, but this new product beats any other global, publicly available dataset. It also has no gaps.DLR has other versions of the map whose sampling squares are 30m and 12m across, but these are - for the time being - commercially restricted.TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X continue their mapping exercise.Having a static DEM is great but the shape of the Earth's surface is always changing and this needs to be captured as well.The orbiting pair are now getting quite old. TerraSAR-X was launched in 2007 and TanDEM-X was launched in 2010.DLR hopes to keep them running for a good few years yet, but planning for the replacements is well advanced.The future mission would be slightly different in that the radar instruments would operate not in the X-band but in the L-band - a longer wavelength.This would facilitate different types of application. ""In forests, for example, in the X-band you get, more or less, the top of the canopy,"" explained Dr Manfred Zink from DLR's Microwaves and Radar Institute.""You don't penetrate and see under the leaves. But with the L-band we will penetrate; we will see the solid ground. That would enable us to see the vegetation volume in real 3D. It's tomography,"" he told BBC News.""We would see the full vertical structure of the forest and that is key for precise biomass estimates.""Knowing exactly how much carbon is tied up in the world's forests is a big unknown, but vital for climate change assessments.Another application in the L-band would be to sense better the way the ground deforms during an earthquake.Scientists do this already using radar satellites operating at other wavelengths, but their observations can often be difficult to interpret in places where there is a lot of vegetation growth.TanDEM-L, as the future system will be known, would hope to get around some of these difficulties.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	DNA project to decode 'all complex life' on Earth	What will this genome sequencing effort achieve?How much will it cost?Why is this important?	"A mission to sequence the genome of every known animal, plant, fungus and protozoan - a group of single-celled organisms - is underway.The Earth BioGenome Project (EBP) has been described as a ""moonshot for biology"".A key aim is to use the information in efforts to conserve threatened species.Scientists say clues about how species adapt to environmental change could be hidden in their DNA code.As part of the project, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which played a major part in the human genome project, has committed to sequencing the genomes of all 66,000 UK species.Dr Jim Smith, director of science at the Wellcome Trust described the mission as timely, adding that it was ""incumbent upon human beings to raise awareness of biodiversity"".The aim is to create an entirely new inventory of life on Planet Earth by reading the genetic code of every organism belonging to a vast group known as eukaryotes - essentially, species made up of multiple cells with their DNA bound inside a nucleus.As Prof Harris Lewin from University of California, Davis, who is chair of the project pointed out, ""only about 3,300 of the 1.5 million known species have had their genomes sequenced"".""The gaps in our knowledge are a lot bigger than what we know,"" he told BBC News. ""So we're not even filling in the pieces of the puzzle; most of the puzzle is empty.""The main ambitions of the project are threefold:The price tag on an ""inventory of life"" is a projected US$4.7bn (£3.6bn), which, according to the project leaders, will come from charities and governments around the world. As of Thursday, 17 institutions have each committed to the common goal of completing the 1.5 million genomes. Raising the funding will be part of that decade-long mission.Although that cost sounds huge, it is actually slightly less than the final price of of the first human genome sequence, which was completed in 2003 at a cost equivalent today to US$5bn.The Wellcome Sanger Institute at Hinxton in Cambridgeshire will lead the UK contribution to the EBP and the Sanger's Dr Julia Wilson told BBC news that the project's value to society would be immense, laying ""a foundation for all strands of biology and biotechnology"".""We're talking about new medicines, new fuels for the future,"" she said. ""We're limited at the moment by our imaginations - we can't even imagine what this would tell us.""Prof Lewin stressed the value to humanity. ""Look at agriculture,"" he said. ""Three quarters of our global food supply depends on just 12 crop species.""We need to identify genetic sources of improved resistance, particularly to drought in the face of climate change, in order to protect our food supply.""This mission though reaches well beyond food sources; within the 1.5 million species are some of the weirder, tinier and overlooked organisms that Australian biologist Prof Jenny Graves from La Trobe University in Melbourne said could hold valuable secrets we haven't even thought of yet.""We don't know what's out there until we look.""Just from fungus gnats and pond scum, we've learned how chromosomes are built, what makes them stable and we've learned that genes can be there [in their genome] but not expressed.There are many organisms that we don't yet know anything about, she added. ""And they may have completely blinding insights that we just don't know anything about.""Follow Victoria on Twitter"
science	ICESat will get unprecedented view of Earth's ice	Why is this mission important?How does ICESat-2 work?What new information will be revealed?	"The American space agency has launched a laser into orbit to measure the condition of Earth's ice cover.The satellite mission, called ICESat-2, should provide more precise information on how these frozen surfaces are being affected by global warming.Antarctica, Greenland and the ice floating on the Arctic Ocean have all lost volume in recent decades.ICESat-2 will track ongoing change in unprecedented detail from its vantage point some 500km above the planet.The satellite was taken up by a Delta II rocket, flying out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.As the name suggests, ICESat-2 is a follow-on project. The original spacecraft flew in the 2000s and pioneered the laser measurement of the height of polar glaciers and sea-ice from space. But the mission was plagued by technical problems that limited its observations to just a couple of months in every year.Nasa has since re-modelled the technology, both to make it more reliable and to give it a sharper view.""ICESat-2 is going to observe the cryosphere with a spatial resolution at the level we have never seen before from space,"" explained Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.""The beam is split across-track into six - three pairs - so we can map more of the ice surface as well as estimating the surface slope, which can confuse our interpretation of height changes.""The orbit reaches to two degrees of the poles, and the same ground tracks are sampled every three months, giving us seasonal snapshots of ice height. From these data we can unravel the processes responsible for the ice loss in the polar regions,"" she told BBC News.Antarctica and Greenland lose billions of tonnes of ice every year - the result largely of warm water being able to melt land glaciers where they meet the ocean. This wastage is slowly but surely pushing up sea-levels worldwide.In the Arctic, the seasonal floes have also been in retreat. Sea-ice in the far north is thought to have lost two-thirds of its volume since the 1980s. And although this has no direct impact on the height of the oceans, the reduced ice-cover is working to amplify temperature rises in the region.Much of the change that is occurring at the poles can present itself in quite subtle ways, says Dr Tom Neumann, Nasa's ICESat-2 deputy project scientist, and a very precise tool is needed to characterise it properly.""An elevation change of just a centimetre over an ice sheet the scale of Antarctica represents a tremendous amount of water either gained to or lost by the ice sheet. 140 gigatonnes worth.""Weighing half a tonne, the new laser system is one of the largest Earth-observation instruments ever built by Nasa. It uses a technique called ""photon counting"".It fires about 10,000 pulses of light every second. Each of those shots goes down to the Earth and bounces back up on a timescale of about 3.3 milliseconds. The exact time equates to the height of the reflecting surface.""We fire about a trillion photons (particles of light) in every shot. We get about one back,"" says Cathy Richardson, who works on the team at Nasa that developed the instrument.""We can time that one photon when it comes back just as accurately as when it left the instrument. And from that we can calculate a distance to about half a centimetre on the Earth.""The laser is making a measurement every 70cm as it moves forward across the ice.It is hoped that ICESat-2 can help produce the first robust maps of sea-ice thickness in the Antarctic. At the moment, the technique for assessing ice floes really only works in the Arctic.It involves comparing the height of that part of the floating ice sticking above the water with the height of the ocean surface itself. Because scientists know the density of seawater and ice, they can then calculate how much ice must be submerged, and thus a total overall thickness.In the Antarctic, though, this approach is problematic. In the far south, the ice floes can get covered in substantial dumps of snow. This will sometimes push the sea-ice fully under the water and confound the thickness calculation.The proposed solution is to combine ICESat's laser observations, which reflect off the top of the snow surface, with those of radar satellites, whose microwave beams penetrate more deeply into the snow covering. This will reduce a lot of uncertainty.Scientists need thickness measurements to properly access the status of floes. Sometimes the wind will spread the ice out; other times it will pile the ice up. The difference is only apparent when the ice is viewed in three dimensions.And, no, the laser does not have the power to melt the ice from 500km up! But on a dark night you might just be able to see a green dot when ICESat flies overhead.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Global wildlife trade higher than was thought	What can be done?What did the research show?	"At least one in five vertebrate species on Earth are bought and sold on the wildlife market, according to a study.Scientists from universities in the US and UK, who jointly analysed data collated on a range of species, say they are ""astounded"" by the figure.They point out that it is about 50% higher than previous estimates.The wildlife trade - in the likes of horns, ivory and exotic pets - is the number one cause of animal extinction, tied only with land development.""The sheer diversity of species being traded is astounding - the risk that that will grow is very worrying,"" said Prof David Edwards of the University of Sheffield, a co-researcher on the study.The study, published in Science, identified hotspots for traded birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles in regions within the Andes mountain range and Amazon rainforest, sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Australia.The research also identified another 3,000 or so species that look set to be traded in the future, based on their similarities with animals currently bought and sold - for example if they have bright plumage or exotic horns.""If one species is traded, the chances are its evolutionary cousins are also traded,"" said Dr Brett Scheffers of the University of Florida.""Once we discovered that pattern, we could develop a new model that would predict which species are likely to be traded in the future, even if they are not traded now.""The scientists stress the need for proactive rather than reactive strategies, including a ""watch list"" of susceptible species, better detection of illegal imports, fighting corruption and engaging local people in conservation.Prof Edwards said: ""Without urgent focus on how to stem both the supply and demand for wild-caught species, there is a real danger that we will lose many traded species.""Individuals can help by not taking any illegal animal products offered to them abroad, he said, and by checking any exotic pets they buy have not been captured illegally from the wild.The UK/US team quantified for the first time the species most affected by the global wildlife trade based on a study of the tree of life.They used data from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna and the International Union for Conservation of Nature on about 30,000 bird, mammal, amphibian and reptile species. They did not look at invertebrates or marine animals.According to their analysis, 5,579 animals - 18% of vertebrates - are currently being traded globally.An additional 3,196 species are considered at risk - making a total of 8,775 species, or about one in three.Impacts of trade appeared to be higher in threatened species, among certain groups - birds and mammals - and concentrated in specific parts of the globe.Follow Helen on Twitter."

And then you look around and you hear the sound of gibbons echoing through the forest, calling out their territories.""You see the orangutan - the mother and baby swinging from tree to tree - and amongst all this different wildlife you see all these different macaques screaming at you. But then from moment to moment, you get silence when you hardly hear anything, before the echo of the forest comes back to life.""In the distance sometimes you can hear the sound of chain saws, you can hear the sound of destruction coming in closer. You know that there's something you can do to prevent that from happening. You know there's something you can do to stop the chainsaw from going deeper into the forest.""I became a conservationist initially because I watched too many BBC Blue Planet [programmes]. I fell in love with the ocean, with the coral reef, when I was quite young and I set in my heart that this was what I was going to do for the rest of my life.""Then, when I actually graduated as a marine biologist, I came back to the same patch of reef where I fell in love with the ocean the first time, to see it completely destroyed - all because of climate change - and that really made me angry.""So, in my naïve mind back then, I thought, maybe I'll try to protect forests. Maybe it's a bit easier, maybe I just need to put a fence around it and it'll be fine. And of course I was proven wrong time and time again.""The main threat to the Leuser Ecosystem has been pressure for exploitation and unsustainable development. Big companies that want to grow palm oil - one of the most profitable crops in the world - threaten to decimate this very fragile ecosystem.""When it comes to palm oil it's quite a complex issue. It's very difficult to narrow it down to say, 'Don't buy palm oil, or only buy sustainable ones' or 'boycott everything altogether'. The way we see palm oil - it's just a crop that is so profitable, and the problem is how the demand has driven the expansion.""The main problem with palm oil is its governance - how consumers in the developed world could push for a true conflict-free palm oil in their mode of consumption. Because we often look for short cuts. We want a sustainable product, but we are not willing to pay for it.""We live in the age of information overload. In the past, I would say read more or find out more. Now I would encourage people to pledge to see more or experience more of places that are going extinct.""Places like Sumatra, the Amazon, Madagascar. Those are the places that are under tremendous threat from exploitation, including palm oil. If you come to the place and see how it is now and you hear about that place in the future, you would have a stronger connection to know what to do when it comes to palm oil and deforestation.""Farwiza Farhan won a Whitley Award project in 2016 for her work.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Alien atmospheres recreated on Earth	What is haze, and why is it important?How to build a planetIn the eye of the beholderLife, but not as we know it	"Researchers have recreated the chemistry of atmospheres on distant planets for the first time in the lab, according to two new papers.They found that hazes, such as the hydrocarbons that shroud Saturn's moon Titan, can be produced on a class of exoplanets known as super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.Chemical hazes and clouds can influence surface temperature and the potential for a planet to support life.The work can help guide future studies.Exoplanets, or extra-solar planets, orbit stars other than our own.The team now has further work to do, analysing the composition of the haze particles they have generated.""We're really excited to figure out where particles form, what they're made out of, and what that means for organic inventories for the origin of life,"" Dr Sarah Hörst, lead author of the study published in Nature Astronomy this week, told BBC News.""I think we are going to learn a lot about [our] Solar System from doing these experiments. We don't want to learn about just one planet; we want to learn how planets work.""""This is a big step in exoplanet research,"" said Dr Christiane Helling of the Centre for Exoplanet Science at the University of St Andrews.""It demonstrates once again that experimental work and complex modelling are very powerful tools as they can work hand in hand,"" she told BBC News.Super-Earths and mini-Neptunes are the most common group of exoplanets discovered so far.The nearest super-Earth, Proxima b, is over 40 trillion km from Earth, making it very difficult to observe in detail.""Clouds and hazes determine the temperature and the chemistry of the atmosphere, and also how deep we can look into a planet's atmosphere,"" explained Dr Helling.""Exoplanet clouds can be made of sparkling minerals, in addition to the photochemical hazes just produced in the lab.""While clouds form from the continuous cycling of material, much like the hydrological cycle on Earth, the process of producing hazes is ""more of a one way trip"" according to Dr Hörst.The solid particles then remain in the planet's atmosphere, where they can scatter light and affect the surface temperature, or travel to the surface via precipitation.Dr Hörst's team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore replicated the atmospheres of nine potential worlds, to take a closer look at how this atmospheric chemistry might function.Distinctive gas mixtures, each rich in hydrogen, water or carbon dioxide, were exposed to a cold plasma discharge. This initiated chemical processes very like the polar aurorae visible in our own Solar System.There were some similarly colourful side effects.The ""atmospheres"" then generated haze particles over the course of three days, which were collected on quartz discs in the reaction chamber.The colourful discoveries continued when one of the hydrogen-rich atmospheres generated an olive green haze.""That was really exciting for us,"" says Dr Hörst. ""With particles that have that extreme a colour, there's the possibility that if there aren't a lot of them they might still have a really strong impact on the way energy moves in an atmosphere.""Back in our Solar System, atmospheric haze also plays a surprising role in Saturn's atmosphere.""One of the reasons Jupiter is more striking in visible light, is because it has fewer haze particles. If you look at Saturn in the infrared you see that there's a lot more structure in the atmosphere that you don't see in the visible, and it's because of the haze,"" explains Dr Hörst.The James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in 2019, will be able to look more closely at the atmospheres of exoplanets and potentially hunt for biosignatures - signs of life.Dr Hörst is hopeful that her team's work will be helpful in ruling out erroneous organic signatures, yet she notes that the results do show exoplanets may be capable of creating the building blocks for life.""If there is life on any of those planets there is a decent chance that the organics in the atmosphere played a role in the origin or evolution."""
science	Grace mission launches to weigh Earth's water		"A joint US-German mission has gone into orbit to weigh the water on Earth.The Grace satellites are replacing a pair of highly successful spacecraft that stopped working last year.Like their predecessors, the new duo will circle the globe and sense tiny variations in the pull of gravity that result from movements in mass.These could be a signal of the land swelling after prolonged rains, or of ice draining from the poles as they melt in a warming climate.The satellites were launched on Tuesday aboard a SpaceX rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force base in California.It will take a number of weeks to prepare and test the spacecraft before they can start gathering data.The first Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace), which ran from 2002 to 2017, was widely regarded as transformative in the type of information it was able to gather, and maintaining the capability is now seen as a top priority for the American space agency (Nasa).The follow-on mission again draws heavily on expertise from Europe, in particular from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). Europe's biggest space company, Airbus, assembled the satellites at its factory in Friedrichshafen.The Grace duo will obtain their data by executing a carefully calibrated pursuit in orbit.As the lead spacecraft lurches and drags through the Earth's uneven gravity field, the second satellite will follow 220km behind, measuring changes in their separation to the nearest micron (a thousandth of a millimetre).""That is about a tenth of the width of a human hair over the distance between Los Angeles and San Diego,"" Prof Frank Flechtner, the Grace-FO project manager at GFZ, told BBC News.What the Grace concept is brilliant at sensing is the big changes that occur in the hydrological cycle.These could, for example, be major movements of water from the ocean to the land during precipitation events.""There was a period in 2011 when sea-level rise slowed down and went in the other direction very briefly,"" explained Nasa project project scientist Dr Frank Webb.""From the Grace data we could see there were heavy rain seasons in Australia and South America, and that equivalent of mass was going into storage on land. Eventually, it was released back to the oceans and sea-level rise continued.""One of the great contributions from the first Grace mission was to confirm the scale of change at the poles - to essentially weigh the ice sheets year on year.Satellites carrying altimeters can do this by measuring the change in shape of Antarctica and Greenland - but Grace provided completely independent insight through its gravity assessments. Antarctica was seen to be losing some 120 billion tonnes of ice a year; for Greenland, the figure was 280 billion tonnes.""Mass loss from the ice sheets is an increasing contribution to total sea-level rise and, even though the poles are remote, this mass loss will have large impacts all around the world,"" said Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.""With the launch of Grace-FO, we can now continue to detect changes in the ice mass, to determine the extent to which ice is being lost, and find out if there has been any acceleration,"" she told BBC News.The previous Grace pair used a microwave-ranging instrument to measure their separation.The new satellites carry the same technology, but have now a laser system incorporated as well. It should give a roughly 10 times improvement in precision.And although this is unlikely to deliver an equivalent jump in the resolution of the gravity field, scientists are still hopeful they can get significant gains in performance.The total cost for Grace-FO is on the order of $520m (€440m; £390m). The mission should work for at least five years.As to what follows the follow-on, there is already talk about trying to widen involvement to include more EU member states.This could eventually see a future Grace-like gravity mission pulled into the European Commission's Sentinel Earth-observation programme.The same has already happened with the US-French Jason series, which has been measuring sea-surface height since 1992.Future Jasons will be known as the Sentinel-6 mission - a status that has helped secure long-term funding.""I think it's important we get an operational mission,"" commented Prof Flechtner.""The 'e' in Grace stands for 'experiment', but the data is now being used for services, such as flood monitoring. My strong opinion is that it could be a Sentinel.""To be clear, however, the EC does not have a gravity option among the possibilities it is currently scoping for Sentinel expansion.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: 'Hothouse Earth' risks even if CO2 emissions slashed	What exactly is a Hothouse Earth scenario?Are the current heatwaves in the UK and Europe evidence of a Hothouse Earth?Surely we've known about these risks before?Any good news here at all?What do other scientists say?	"It may sound like the title of a low budget sci-fi movie, but for planetary scientists, ""Hothouse Earth"" is a deadly serious concept.Researchers believe we could soon cross a threshold leading to boiling hot temperatures and towering seas in the centuries to come.Even if countries succeed in meeting their CO2 targets, we could still lurch on to this ""irreversible pathway"".Their study shows it could happen if global temperatures rise by 2C.An international team of climate researchers, writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says the warming expected in the next few decades could turn some of the Earth's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies.Each year the Earth's forests, oceans and land soak up about 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon that would otherwise end up in our atmosphere adding to temperatures.But as the world experiences warming, these carbon sinks could become sources of carbon and make the problems of climate change significantly worse.So whether it is the permafrost in northern latitudes that now holds millions of tonnes of warming gases, or the Amazon rainforest, the fear is that the closer we get to 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the greater the chances that these natural allies will spew out more carbon than they currently now take in.Back in 2015, governments of the world committed themselves to keeping temperature rises well below 2 degrees, and to strive to keep them under 1.5. According to the authors, the current plans to cut carbon may not be enough if their analysis is correct.""What we are saying is that when we reach 2 degrees of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself,"" co-author Prof Johan Rockström, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, told BBC News.""We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2 degrees, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe. We totally hand over our fate to an Earth system that starts rolling out of equilibrium.""Currently, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and they are rising by around 0.17C per decade.In their new study the authors looked at 10 natural systems, which they term ""feedback processes"".Right now, these help humanity to avoid the worst impacts of carbon and temperature rises, and include forests, Arctic sea-ice, and methane hydrates on the ocean floor.The worry is that if one of these systems tips over and starts pushing large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, the rest could follow like a row of dominoes.In short, it's not good.According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years.The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now.Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable.The impacts would be ""massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive,"" say the authors.The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts.The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C.However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought.""One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious,"" said Prof Rockström.""It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought.""What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems.People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century.But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an ""irreversible pathway"" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution.Surprisingly, yes!We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet.""Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions.""This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so,"" says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen.So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air.The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth.Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound.""As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord',"" said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK.""Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for ‒ thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth.""Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced.""Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,"" said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London.""At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero."""
science	A manifesto to save Planet Earth (and ourselves)		"The impacts of human actions on our home planet are now so large that many scientists are declaring a new phase of Earth’s history. The old forces of nature that transformed Earth many millions of years ago, including meteorites and mega-volcanoes are joined by another: us. We have entered a new geological epoch, called the Anthropocene.As scientists we agree that society has entered a dangerous new time. But what is to be done?In our new book, The Human Planet, published on Thursday, we present a new view of how humans climbed down from the trees of Africa to become a geological superpower.We argue that to avoid ever-larger environmental changes causing a societal collapse, we need to acknowledge the incredible power that modern society possesses and direct it towards a shift to a new type of society in the 21st Century.Our influence is more profound than many of us realize.Globally, human activities move more soil, rock and sediment each year than is transported by all other natural processes combined.The total amount of concrete produced by humans is enough to cover the entire Earth’s surface with a layer two millimetres thick. Micro-plastics are found in every ocean.We have cut down half of Earth's trees, losing three trillion, with extinctions becoming commonplace.Factories and farming remove as much nitrogen from the atmosphere as all of Earth's natural processes, and the climate is changing fast because of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use.Beyond these grim statistics, the critical question is: will today’s interconnected mega-civilisation that allows 7.5 billion people to lead physically healthier and longer lives than at any time in our history continue from strength to strength? Or will we keep using more and more resources until human civilisation collapses?To answer this, we re-interpret human history using the tools of modern science, to provide a clearer view of the future.Tracing the ever-greater environmental impacts of different human societies since our march out of Africa, we found that there are just five broad types that have spread worldwide.Our original hunter-gatherer societies were followed by the agricultural revolution and new types of society beginning some 10,500 years ago.The next shift resulted from the formation of the first global economy, after Europeans arrived in the Americas in 1492, which was followed in the late 1700s by the new societies following the Industrial Revolution.The final type is today’s high-production consumer capitalist mode of living that emerged after WWII.A careful analysis shows that each successive mode of living is reliant on greater energy use, greater information and knowledge availability, resulting in an increase in the human population and an increase in our collective agency.These insights help us think about avoiding the coming crash as our massive global economy doubles in size every 25 years, and on to the possibilities of a new and more sustainable sixth mode of living to replace consumer capitalism.Seen in this way, renewable energy for all takes on an importance beyond stopping climate breakdown; likewise free education and the internet for all has a significance beyond access to social media – as they empower women, which helps stabilise the population.More energy and greater information availability appear to be the necessities for any new kind of society - although these changes alone could increase our environmental problems, as in the past. To usher in a new way of living today’s core dynamic of ever-greater production and consumption of goods and resources must also be broken, coupled with a societal focus on environmental repair.Two increasingly discussed ideas do just this.Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a policy whereby a financial payment is made to every citizen, unconditionally, without any obligation to work, at a level above their subsistence needs.Most people would still work, but UBI could break the link between paid work and consumption.We all do it – saying, I work so hard, I deserve that fancy over-packaged sandwich, new gizmo, or long-haul holiday.Consumption is the pay-back for being ever-more productive at work. With UBI we could think long-term, well beyond the next pay cheque, as living in the Anthropocene demands.Small-scale trials of UBI suggest we would educate ourselves, do useful work, while caring for others and the wider environment.Environmental repair could come from the simple but profound idea that we allocate half the Earth's surface primarily for the benefit of other species.This is less utopian than it first appears. As we increasingly recognise that humans are part of nature, new ideas of ""re-wilding"" (large areas managed to allow natural processes to run) and ""restoration"" (bringing back forests) are taking hold.Recent commitments across 43 countries to restore 292 million hectares of degraded land to forest, ten times the area of the UK, show that repair is on the agenda.Universal Basic Income and Half-Earth are, of course, not the remedies for all of society's ills. But, if acknowledging that we live in the Anthropocene does anything, it shows us that our actions will have major impacts on the only planet in the Universe known to harbour life.It would be wise to use this immense power to give the best chance for people, and the rest of life, all to flourish.The Human Planet: How we created the Anthropocene, by Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin is published by Penguin."
science	RemoveDebris: Mission to clear a huge mess above Earth		Go! This is the moment the UK-led RemoveDebris mission left the International Space Station (ISS).The small satellite has a big job ahead - to trial the technologies that could one day be used to clean up orbiting junk.It carries a net to trap an object, and a harpoon that it will fire at a target to prove such projectiles can be used effectively in weightless conditions.At 100kg, RemoveDebris is actually the largest sat yet released from the ISS.The time for its ejection last week was chosen very carefully so that the spacecraft would immediately fly over its control station - in Guildford, southern England.Engineers picked up its signal on the first pass overhead.The movie sequence was captured by American space agency astronaut Ricky Arnold. He manages to get a clear view not just of RemoveDebris flying free after its ejection from the ISS - but of the unmistakeable shape of southern England and The Channel below the departing satellite.The RemoveDebris project has its scientific leadership at the Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey; and was assembled at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.But the mission has technical input from across Europe, and it is the European Commission that has put up half the €15m (£13m) cost.RemoveDebris will go through a few weeks of commissioning tests before beginning its experiments.There is some 7,500 tonnes of old space hardware circling above the Earth.This junk includes old rocket segments; bits that have fallen off satellites; flecks of paint - even tools dropped by spacewalking astronauts.The concern is that this material is becoming so abundant it could pose a collision hazard to operational missions that provide important services, such as telecommunications and environmental monitoring.RemoveDebris was designed to test relatively simple - and therefore low-cost - methods of clean-up.Other missions will try alternatives, including robotic arms that reach out and grab junk. But this kind of approach is very complex and therefore much more expensive to implement.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
science	Climate change: ‘Clear and unequivocal’ emergency, say scientists	How does this differ from other reports on climate change?So who are the scientists who have endorsed the report?What do the authors want to happen now?So what about human population growth?	"A global group of around 11,000 scientists have endorsed research that says the world is facing a climate emergency.The study, based on 40 years of data on a range of measures, says governments are failing to address the crisis.Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing ""untold human suffering"" the study says.The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat.Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world.So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a ""suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years"".These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption.Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018.Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency.""An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date,"" said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney.""That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people.""The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor.Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference.These are:Energy: Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables.Short-lived pollutants: These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades.Nature: Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2.Food: A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical.Economy: Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence.Population: The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day.Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the researchThe authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research.All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online.""We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a a problem,"" said Dr Newsome.The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action. However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope.""We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change.""As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress.""The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option.""It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth,"" said Dr Newsome.""It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Earth's magnetic ocean tides mapped from space		"This is the European Space Agency's spectacular new view of ocean tides as they sweep around the Earth.The movie shows not the bulging movement of water directly, but rather its magnetic signature.As the Moon pulls the salty seas through our planet's global magnetic field, electric currents are generated.And these currents then induce their own magnetic signals, which have now been mapped in exquisite detail by a trio of Esa satellites known as Swarm.It is a remarkable achievement because the effect is actually very small.""It's a really tiny magnetic field. It's about 2-2.5 nanotesla at satellite altitude, which is about 20,000 times weaker than the Earth's global magnetic field,"" Nils Olsen, from the Technical University of Denmark, told BBC News.The professor was speaking at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly (EGU) in Vienna, Austria, where a clutch of new Swarm results have been released.The mission was sent into orbit in 2013 to bring fresh insight on Earth's magnetic behaviour.Most of the global field is produced by convection of molten iron in the planet's outer core. But there are secondary components that contribute to the overall signal - such as that coming from the oceans.Other satellites will sense the tides as a change in sea-surface height. What is different about the Swarm trio's magnetic view is that it reveals the movement of the entire water column, right down to the seabed.This is important for climate studies. The oceans store and transport vast amounts of heat energy, and getting the more integrated perspective from Swarm enables scientists to build better models of the Earth system.There were hopes before Swarm launched that it might even be possible to tease out the magnetism related to specific currents as well, such as the famous Gulf Stream that shifts warm waters across the North Atlantic.The desire is still there, but Prof Olsen is a little pessimistic. It is the well-known periodicity of the Moon's orbit around the Earth that helps betray the tidal signature.The Gulf Stream, on the other hand, is a steady flow, and this consistency helps to keep its individual magnetism hidden amongst the much stronger components of the global field.One of these bigger signatures is the magnetism retained in the planet's surface rocks. And Swarm's most detailed map yet of this aspect was also released at the EGU meeting.It incorporates four years of Swarm measurements, data from a previous German spacecraft called Champ, and information gathered by aeroplanes and ships. Regional features as small as 50km across can be discerned.Easy to spot are the famous ""zebra stripes"" at mid-ocean ridges where upwelling magma creates new seafloor and locks the prevailing magnetic field into cooling rock minerals. The discovery of the stripes in the 1960s was a major proof in the theory of plate tectonics.""Magnetic fields are one of the keys to understand the sub-surface of the planet, in combination with other pieces of information such as gravity and seismic measurements,"" said Rune Floberghagen, Esa's Swarm mission manager.""In the end this will allow us to determine the best ever model of the upper layers of the planet. This is the very clear, sworn ambition of the Swarm mission.""The EGU General Assembly has been treated to a bounty of Swarm results to fascinate the specialists. But there is one observation that will certainly have more general interest - that of the position of the north magnetic pole.Most people know that it is not aligned with the geographic north pole and instead drifts around.Recent decades have seen it shift in a direction that is taking it away from Canada towards Russia. Swarm is watching this movement closely.""This year we are in a rather special situation because in 2018 the magnetic pole will be at its closest to the geographic pole. There is a separation of only 390km. The magnetic pole moves at a speed of about 55km per year,"" said Prof Olsen. The expectation is that the gap between the two versions of the pole will widen again from next year.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Nasa astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir in all-women spacewalk		"Nasa astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir have made history by completing the first ever all-female spacewalk.They spent seven hours outside the International Space Station (ISS) replacing a failed power control unit.Ms Koch had already carried out four spacewalks but it was the first such mission for Dr Meir, who became the 15th woman to walk in space, Nasa said.US President Donald Trump congratulated them in a video call. ""You are very brave, brilliant women,"" he told them as they carried out the spacewalk.Ms Koch, an electrical engineer, and Dr Meir, who has a doctorate in marine biology, stepped outside in their Nasa spacesuits at 11:38 GMT (07:38 EDT) on Friday. They made their way to a location called the Port 6 truss structure to replace the battery charge-discharge unit (BCDU).They then returned to the airlock with the failed part which will subsequently be loaded on to the next SpaceX Dragon resupply ship for inspection on Earth.Back on Earth, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris tweeted that the spacewalk was ""more than historic"".Nasa had announced in March that Ms Koch would take part in the first all-female ""extra-vehicular activity"" (EVA) with colleague Anne McClain. But the spacewalk was called off because a medium-sized suit wasn't available in the near-term for McClain.The first woman to spacewalk was the Russian Svetlana Savitskaya, who went outside the USSR's Salyut 7 space station for three hours, 35 minutes on 25 July 1984.The first person in history to spacewalk was Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, who died earlier this month aged 85.On Tuesday, Nasa unveiled a prototype for a new spacesuit that might be worn by the next astronauts on the Moon. It said the new Moon suit, known formally as the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU), is designed to give the wearer a customised fit whatever their shape or size."
science	Nasa probes oxygen mystery on Mars	Soil sink	"The oxygen in Martian air is changing in a way that can't currently be explained by known chemical processes.That's the claim of scientists working on the Curiosity rover mission, who have been taking measurements of the gas.They discovered that the amount of oxygen in Martian ""air"" rose by 30% in spring and summer.The pattern remains a mystery, but researchers are beginning to narrow the possibilities.While the changes are most likely to be geological in nature, planetary scientists can't completely rule out an explanation involving microbial life.The results come from nearly six Earth years' (three Martian years') worth of data from the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument, a portable chemistry lab in the belly of the Curiosity rover.The scientists measured seasonal changes in gases that fill the air directly above the surface of Gale Crater on Mars, where Curiosity landed. They have published their findings in the journal JGR-Planets.The Martian atmosphere is overwhelmingly composed of carbon dioxide (CO2), with smaller amounts of other gases such as molecular nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), molecular oxygen (O2) and methane (CH4).Nitrogen and argon followed a predictable seasonal pattern, changing according to how much CO2 was in the air (which is in turn linked to changes in air pressure). They expected oxygen to follow this pattern too, but it didn't.Oxygen rose during each northern hemisphere spring and then fell in the autumn.They considered the possibility that CO2 or water (H2O) molecules released oxygen when they broke apart in the atmosphere, leading to a short-lived rise. But it would take five times more water than there actually is to produce the additional oxygen, and CO2 breaks up too slowly to generate it over such a short time.""We know oxygen is created and destroyed on Mars through the energy provided by sunlight breaking down CO2 and H2O, both of which are observed in the atmosphere of Mars. The thing that doesn't make sense is the size of the variation - it doesn't match what we expect to see,"" Dr Manish Patel, from the Open University - who was not involved with the study, told BBC News.""Given that Curiosity makes measurements at the surface of Mars, it is tempting to think that this is coming from the surface - but we have no evidence for that. Geologically-speaking, it seems unlikely - I can't think of a process that would fit.""Dr Timothy McConnochie, from the University of Maryland in College Park, who is one of the authors on the JGR-Planets paper, told the BBC: ""You can measure the water vapour molecules in the Martian atmosphere and you can measure the change in oxygen... There just aren't enough water molecules.""Mars in general has a pretty small amount of water vapour, and there's several times more oxygen atoms that mysteriously appear than there is in the water vapour on the entire planet.""They also considered why the oxygen dropped back to levels predicted by known chemistry in the autumn. One idea was that solar radiation could break up oxygen molecules into two atoms, which then escaped into space. But after running the numbers, scientists concluded it would take at least 10 years for the oxygen to disappear in this way.In addition, the seasonal rises aren't perfectly repeatable; the amount of oxygen varies between years. The results imply that something is producing the gas and then taking it away.Dr McConnochie thinks the evidence suggests a source of oxygen in the near-surface. ""I think it points to a reservoir (of oxygen) in the soil that interchanges with the atmosphere,"" he said.""To exchange (with the atmosphere) fairly rapidly on a seasonal timescale it has to be close to the surface. If it's deeper, any process is going to be slower,"" he told BBC News.Some supporting evidence for this comes from Nasa's Viking landers, which touched down on the Red Planet in the 1970s. Results from the Viking Gas Exchange Experiment (GEX) showed that when the humidity was increased in a chamber containing a sample of Martian soil, it led to a release of oxygen.However, says Dr McConnochie, the temperature in the Viking spacecraft chamber was much warmer than it would be outside, even during spring and summer. This complicates any attempt to apply the results to the Martian environment: ""It's a tantalising clue, but it's not helping us solve the problem directly,"" he explained.Mars does become more humid during spring and summer. Water-ice gets deposited on the poles during the winter. Then, throughout the summer, there is a release of water vapour in the polar regions.There could be a link between the humidification of the entire planet at this time and the release of oxygen.Intriguingly, the changes in oxygen are similar to those seen for methane, which increases in abundance by about 60% in summer for inexplicable reasons. It's unclear whether there's any connection though.The methane mystery has attracted much attention over the years because most of Earth's methane is produced by living organisms. Though there are several ways that methane could be released by geological processes on Mars, the production of this gas by microbes living deep beneath the surface remains a tantalising possibility.Oxygen, too, can be produced by microorganisms. The possibility that biology is behind the changing levels of the gas in the Martian atmosphere can't be ruled out. But the scientific bar on such claims is set very high indeed.It's a very remote possibility, but we still don't understand enough about the behaviour of oxygen to use it as an indicator for life.In addition, the near sub-surface of Mars is a very difficult place to live because of the high levels of radiation that leak through the Martian atmosphere, large variations in temperature and limited availability of water.""With current instruments on Mars spacecraft, we have no way of knowing whether biology is producing the springtime rise in oxygen. Abiotic processes look very promising, so we'll need to firmly rule them out first before pursuing microbial contribution,"" Prof Sushil Atreya, from the University of Michigan, who is a co-author on the study, told BBC News.But he added that future missions would make interrelated measurements that could shed light on Martian habitability.Dr Patel said: ""Whilst I believe biological activity in the Martian sub-surface at some point in Mars' history is a real possibility, there is no way to explain this through oxygen-producing microbes - we are missing the copious other indicators that would come along with that.""Maybe it's all hidden, but as a scientist, I can only comment on what we observe - and an extraordinary claim requires an extraordinary observation.""The notion of oxygen being locked up in some chemical form in the Martian soil remains much more likely.""One phenomenon that applies to most gas molecules is they stick to surfaces... especially anything with a lot of surface area. That sticking, that adsorption, changes on the basis of temperature,"" Tim McConnochie explained.""Oxygen is a very active molecule, so it changes to some other form and then sticks and then changes back. The tricky thing is the forms of oxygen we know about in the Martian soil are the ones that are pretty stable.""One of these stable molecules is a compound called perchlorate, which is widespread in Martian soil. It doesn't give up its oxygen easily, but it's possible that exposure to high energy radiation - cosmic rays, for example - could make some of it break down, leaving by-products.One potential by-product is hypochlorite - found in bleach - which is less stable and thus more prone to releasing its oxygen.""I feel we're closer to an idea of how to release it from the soil than we are to an idea of how to sequester it back into the soil,"" said Tim McConnochie. But he explained: ""Presumably there is some cycle that sequesters it.""Prof Atreya explained: ""There are at least three potential abiotic reservoirs of oxygen in the surface/subsurface of Mars - oxidant, in the form of perchlorates; oxidant in the form of hydrogen peroxide; and oxidised rocks or hydrated minerals.""Water-rock reactions in the past, or even today if liquid water exists beneath the surface or as brines, were most likely responsible for the third reservoir.""Dr Patel believes it may not be possible to apply the result from Gale Crater to the whole of Mars. ""This has been highlighted by the recent methane measurement, where Curiosity measured a huge amount of methane, but it wasn't detectable by the NOMAD and ACS instruments on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which makes measurements of these things at a global-scale and at higher sensitivity.""The authors of the study in JGR-Planets say they are throwing out the problem to scientists in the field, in a bid to harness expertise from across the community.We've learned huge amounts about the Red Planet over the last few decades, but it's clear from this there are still lots of puzzles to crack.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Hundreds of temperature records broken over summer	European heatwavesWarmest month everHow years compare with the 20th Century average	"Almost 400 all-time high temperatures were set in the northern hemisphere over the summer, according to an analysis of temperature records.The records were broken in 29 countries for the period from 1 May to 30 August this year.A third of the all-time high temperatures were in Germany, followed by France and the Netherlands.The analysis was carried out by the California-based climate institute Berkeley Earth.Over the summer, there were 1,200 instances of places in the northern hemisphere being the hottest they'd ever been in a given month.Sorry, your browser cannot display this mapSource: Robert A. Rohde/Berkeley Earth. Map built using CartoThe data included measurements from weather stations in the northern hemisphere that had at least 40 years of observations.Some of this data has not yet been subjected to formal review by weather agencies. These reviews, to check for problems that might have produced false readings, sometimes cause a small fraction of the records to be discounted.Heatwaves in Europe in June and July sent temperatures soaring, smashing a number of local and national records.France set an all-time high-temperature of 46C, while the UK, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands also reported new highs.This summer was notable for the very large number of all-time temperature records set in Europe, according to Dr Robert Rohde, Lead Scientist at Berkeley Earth.""Some places in Europe have histories of weather observations going back more than 150 years, and yet still saw new all-time record highs,"" he told the BBC.The extent of the hot spells on the continent is clearly visible when looking at a breakdown of when the most temperature records were broken. In late July, all-time temperature records were set in a number of European countries including the UK.Elsewhere, more than 30 all-time records were broken in the US, according to the Berkeley Earth data. In Japan, where 11 people who died as a result of the summer heatwave, 10 all-time temperature record highs were set.The summer saw 396 all-time high temperatures in total.Most all-time temperature records in measuring stations covered by the data were broken in 2010, followed by 2003.The increasing number of record high temperatures are a part of the long-term trend of global warming, said Dr Rohde.""As the Earth warms, it has become easier for weather stations to set new all-time records. In the past, we would usually only see about 2% of weather stations recording a new record high in any given year,"" he explained.""But, recently, we sometimes see years, like 2019, with 5% or more of the weather stations recording a new all-time record high.""In part, the number of new records is affected by where heatwaves occur, as well as the temperatures recorded. There are more weather stations in the United States and Europe, meaning that a heatwave in those areas has the potential to break more records.But with climate change making hot spells like those in Europe this summer more intense, Dr Rohde says that while new records won't be set every year at every location, they will be more likely.Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the worldJuly 2019 was the warmest month ever recorded worldwide.Globally it was marginally warmer - by 0.04 degrees Celsius (0.072 Fahrenheit) - than the previous hottest month on record, July 2016.The new July record followed on from a global record for June, which was confirmed by data from several different agencies.2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAA(If you can't see this chart tap or click here)Scientists say it's the latest sign that Earth is experiencing unprecedented warming.The scorching July heatwave that hit Europe was made both more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change, scientists reported.A study reported that warming increased the intensity of the event that impacted the UK, France and the Netherlands by between 1.5 and 3C.""This July 2019 heatwave was so extreme over continental Western Europe that the observed magnitudes would have been extremely unlikely without climate change,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, and one of the authors of that report.The heatwave in France was made at least 10 times and up to 100 times more likely by human activities.In the UK, the shorter event was made at least three times as likely, experts said."
science	Space lasers to track Earth's ice		"With new space missions come new and improved capabilities. And for those interested in what's happening to the ice on Planet Earth, we have two ventures this year that are going to make a major contribution to our understanding.Ice is the ""climate canary"". The loss, and the rate of that loss, tell us something about how global warming is progressing.In the Arctic, the most visible sign is the decline of sea-ice, which, measured at its minimum extent over the ocean in September, is reducing by about 14% per decade.At the other pole, the marine floes look much the same as they did in the earliest satellite imagery from the 1960s, but land ice is in a negative phase.Something on the order of 160 billion tonnes are being lost annually, with most of that mass going from the west of the White Continent.The two 2018 missions of interest that will pick up these trends and extend them into the future are Grace Follow-On and IceSat-2.The former is the successor to the highly successful US-German gravity spacecraft that operated from 2002 to 2017.Grace is actually a pair of satellites that pursue each other around the globe in formation with a separation of 220km.They accelerate and decelerate in turn as they pass over variations in the local gravity field. It is a very small effect - a change in distance equivalent to the thickness of a human hair - but discernible to the microwave ranging instrumentation carried on the satellites.Because the gravity variations are a function of changes in mass, the pair are able, literally, to weigh the ice sheets sitting below them on land as they pass overhead.Its from the first Grace mission's observations, for example, that we know Greenland is currently losing about 280 billion tonnes of ice to the ocean every year.It's a significant contribution to the 3.4mm per annum rise in global sea levels.Grace Follow-On will work in the same way as its predecessor did, but it will also demonstrate a laser range-finder.""It's a first in space, and it allows us to do the ranging with much higher precision - a factor of 10 to 20 times better,"" says US space agency (Nasa) deputy project scientist Felix Landerer. ""So, we go from that human hair thickness down to the scale of large viruses.""Stop and think about that for a second - measuring the distance between London and Sheffield to the accuracy of the width of a large virus.This impressive German laser technology will form the basis of the orbiting instruments that will eventually be used to detect the cataclysmic collisions of the biggest black holes in the cosmos. Stay tuned. That mission to sense gravitational waves - it's called Lisa - will launch in the 2030s.Back here on Earth, the other ice project this year also involves a laser. IceSat-2 will fire six green beams of light at the Arctic floes and land ice-sheets to measure their shape.Simple but effective: the satellite times the return of the reflected beams and converts that into a range, which in turn is converted into an elevation.Again, the new satellite is a successor. The previous effort in the 2000s, known as IceSat-1, showed remarkable promise as an ice-sensing tool. However, its mission was blighted by fragile diode technology, and it could only use its laser for a handful of months a year.""IceSat-2 is a micro-pulse laser,"" says Nasa project scientist Thorsten Markus. ""The strength of the laser pulses is much, much smaller than it was on IceSat-1, and we also have a very high pulse repetition frequency of 10kHz. Basically, the laser is always on, which makes it much less stressful on the diodes.""We've had some diodes running [in test form] for seven, eight years now. So, conceptually, one laser should last a whole mission of seven years and we have two lasers onboard,"" he told BBC News.The hope is IceSat-2 will be up and operating before Europe's ageing CryoSat mission dies.CryoSat has been pursing very similar objectives, except its ""tape measure"" is a radar altimeter.A period of overlap would allow for an inter-comparison. This is not wholly straightforward. The laser on IceSat and the radar on CryoSat don't range to exactly the same surface.In the former's case, the light beams are reflected off the very top of any snow covering the ice. In the latter's case, the radar can penetrate the snowpack for many tens of centimetres, depending on conditions, before scattering back to the spacecraft.Scientists have to use modelled assumptions based on the regional climatology to account for any bias.""It's an important consideration,"" says CryoSat scientist Anna Hogg from Leeds University, UK.""If you get an extreme melt year, you can actually get a new ice layer forming in the snowpack as water trickles down from the surface and refreezes. That's what happened during 2012 when the whole of Greenland experienced melt.""Afterwards, CryoSat saw a step change in elevation equivalent to a 0.5m increase just because the scattering horizon had risen. It made it look like Greenland had grown ice, whereas in reality it had very probably lost mass.""Dr Hogg has just returned from Antarctica where she has been drilling cores to try to understand better the layering in the snowpack and its influence on the radar's return signal.She did this as CryoSat flew overhead, in addition to an aeroplane equipped with two types of radar ranging instrument. One used the same radio frequency (Ku-band) as Cryosat; the other used a higher frequency (Ka-band) which should scatter a lot closer to the actual surface of the snowpack.The thinking in Europe is that if CryoSat has a follow-on, it should be dual, Ku-Ka band to try to get a more direct measure of the amount of snow lying on top of the ice. This would be particularly important for sensing sea-ice thickness.In the Arctic, CryoSat does this by measuring the height (the freeboard) of the floating ice sticking just above the ocean water and then calculating the corresponding submerged (the draft) ice. It is roughly 1/9th above and 8/9ths below.""That becomes problematic in the Antarctic where the snow can be so heavy that it compresses the ice to the point that it's sitting at the water-line; in other words, there is no ice freeboard,"" explains Leeds colleague Rachel Tilling.While Dr Hogg was examining snow-layering conditions on land in recent weeks, Dr Tilling was doing the same with the marine floes surrounding Antarctica.She's hopeful that the data gathered as she cruised across the Weddell Sea will lead to some of the first robust satellite sea-ice thickness maps for the region. And, certainly, this effort should be greatly assisted in the short-term if IceSat and the existing CryoSat can also run alongside each other for a good period of time. That's because the differences in how each senses the surface would lead to a much improved description of snow loading, too.""It's a new opportunity that we haven't had before and can only mean we will get more accurate sea-ice thickness measurements. That's exciting,"" Dr Tilling told BBC News.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	UK satellite makes HD colour movies of Earth		"A British spacecraft is now routinely making movies of the Earth’s surface.Carbonite-2 was built by Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) in Guildford and launched in January.It is the forerunner of a network of spacecraft that will be sent up in the years ahead to be operated by Earth-i, an analytics firm also of Guildford.Carbonite's short clips are the first high-definition, full-colour videos to be delivered from orbit by a commercial satellite on a regular basis.The sequences have a resolution of one metre, which means the movement of cars, lorries, boats and planes is easily discerned.To mark the end of the satellite's commissioning phase, SSTL has released a number of videos that have been prepared with Earth-i.These include views of Dubai Airport, Buenos Aires, Puerto Antofagasta, Rio de Janeiro, Diego Garcia and Mumbai Airport.Andrew Cawthorne, the director of Earth observation at SSTL, told BBC News: ""We've made now coming up to 500 videos. We have an automated chain, which we had to fine-tune during commissioning, but now the files come down off the spacecraft and pop out a few minutes later.""The way this satellite works is that it has to point at a target and hold its gaze, even though it's flying overhead at several km per second. The longest video we've made so far is 60 seconds, and I think the accuracy of the pointing speaks for itself.""Earth observation has long made use of great swathes of still imagery, and at much higher resolution than Carbonite can provide. But video brings some additional capabilities.For example, seeing movement within a scene helps with interpretation.If there are transient clouds crossing the target, having video increases the chances of getting a clear view.Analytics experts can also use the multiple frames in the sequence to make 3D models of the ground, or to ""stack"" those frames, one on top of the other, to synthesise a more resolved image, down to 60cm in Carbonite's case.The satellite was designed by SSTL to be small (100kg), low cost and quick to assemble. To that end, it incorporates the sorts of components one would normally find in high-volume consumer electronics.This puts Carbonite-2 at the centre of the emerging trend that is dubbed ""new space"".A growing number of start-ups, many with their roots in the IT sector, are exploiting the cheaper technologies to challenge ""old"" practices in the established space sector.One key innovation they are promoting is high-repeat imagery. That is, acquiring views of the same scene several times a day. This makes detecting ""change"", and the causes of change, in an Earth scene much more straightforward.But achieving this requires flying a whole train of satellites, and Earth-i plans to loft at least 15 Carbonites into a constellation it will call Vivid-i.The first five of these platforms have been contracted from SSTL and should be ready for launch at the end of 2019.""[Carbonite-2] is delivering the world's first commercially available colour video from space. This is a big thing for the UK,"" said Richard Blain, CEO of Earth-i.""People might say, 'well, so what?' But this is a new paradigm in space data. One very simple, easy-to-understand example: if you take a still image of a wind farm, you can't tell if the blades are turning. If you take a video, you will know not only which turbines are turning but how fast. At that point, you can start to calculate outputs, and that kind of information is of interest to energy traders.""Earth-i describes some of the analysis that can be done using video in this explainer.Many of the new-space constellations that are coming online are American.Earth-i will be a prominent European challenger, as will Iceye, a Finnish start-up that launched the first of its network of radar imagers on the very same rocket that orbited Carbonite-2.Space officials on this side of the Atlantic are keen to help these companies mature and grow their markets.Josef Aschbacher is the director of Earth observation at the European Space Agency. He told BBC News: ""Earth-i don't need us to build their satellites; they have their own supplier in SSTL for that. But Esa can help them get their data well understood, calibrated and 'certified' as being of good quality, and then introduce them into a large market.""Esa has access to a lot of users of Earth observation data [within the European Union's Copernicus Earth observation user community], and many of them will be interested in the movies because they're an added new type of information.""Another major potential customer for future Vivid-i products is the British military.It is now working with Carbonite-2's still and moving pictures to assess how they could be best used by the armed forces.The MoD has a future vision of video being beamed directly into the cockpit of fighter jets, to help improve the situational awareness of UK pilots.Air Vice Marshal ""Rocky"" Rochelle, Chief of Staff (Capability) for the Royal Air Force, said: “I’m delighted to see how Carbonite-2 has progressed through commissioning; the images and video captures have been of high quality and will be of great utility to defence.""We are excited to see what this capability demonstrator will teach us about how we can use small satellites, as a single platform and as a future constellation."""
science	2019 ozone hole could be smallest in three decades		"The ozone hole over Antarctica this year could be one of the smallest seen in three decades, say scientists.Observations of the gas's depletion high in the atmosphere demonstrate that it hasn't opened up in 2019 in the way it normally does.The EU's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) says it's currently well under half the area usually seen in mid-September.The hole is also off-centre and far from the pole, the EU agency adds.CAMS' experts, who are based in Reading, UK, are projecting stable levels of ozone or a modest increase in the coming days.Ozone is a molecule that is composed of three oxygen atoms. It is responsible for filtering out harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.The gas is constantly being made and destroyed in the stratosphere, about 20-30km above the Earth.In an unpolluted atmosphere, this cycle of production and decomposition is in equilibrium. But chlorine and bromine-containing chemicals released by human activity have unbalanced the process, resulting in a loss of ozone that is at its greatest in the Antarctic spring in September/October.The Montreal Protocol signed by governments in 1987 has sought to recover the situation by banning the production and use of the most damaging chemicals.This past week has seen the area of deep thinning cover just over five million square km. This time last year it was beyond 20 million square km, although in 2017 it was just above 10 million sq km. In other words, there is a good degree of variability from year to year.The conditions for thinning occur annually just as the Antarctic emerges from Winter. The reactions that work to destroy ozone in the cold stratosphere are initiated by the return of sunshine at high latitudes.Scientists say that while losses started earlier than normal this year, they were truncated by a sudden warming event that lifted temperatures in the stratosphere by 20-30 degrees. This destabilised the ozone destroying process.Richard Engelen is the deputy head at CAMS. He says the small size seen so far this year is encouraging but warns against complacency.""Right now I think we should view this as an interesting anomaly. We need to find out more about what caused it."" he told BBC News..""It's not really related to the Montreal Protocol where we've tried to reduce chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere because they're still there. It's much more related to a dynamical event. People will obviously ask questions related to climate change, but we simply can't answer that at this point.""CAMS is an EU service run by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).It has access to a range of space-borne observations. Principal data sources include the European Metop weather satellites and the EU's own Sentinel-5P spacecraft. The four platforms all carry ozone sensors and routinely cross the pole.Their information is combined with models of atmospheric behaviour.The World Metrological Organization-sponsored 2018 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion said a recovery of the ozone layer to pre-1970 levels could be expected around 2060."
science	Ice loss causing Arctic to reflect less heat	Understanding the Arctic albedoCauses of warming	"A loss of snow and ice cover are the main reasons for a reduction in the Arctic's ability to reflect heat, not soot as had been previously thought.The capacity of the Arctic to reflect heat is determined by something known as the albedo effect.This is a measurement of how well a surface, such as snow or ice, bounces sunlight back into space.Scientists say soot is not the major contributor, as levels have dropped recently, while warming has continued.The findings have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The Arctic region has warmed significantly since the 1980s, up to three times as much as the average seen elsewhere across the globe.Much of this warming has been attributed to the reduction of the surface albedo effect.When sunlight hits a white surface such as snow and ice, more of it is reflected back into space without warming its surroundings than when light hits a darker surface.Thus, darker surfaces tend to absorb more heat. As the albedo effect in the Arctic is reduced, there is a positive feedback effect because, as the region warms, more and more ice and snow cover is lost. As a result, more dark areas are left exposed to sunlight.This results in an amplification in the cycle of warming, a phenomenon that has been described as the Arctic Amplification.The team of scientists from the US used satellite data, which stretches back to the early 1980s, to determine the level of the albedo effect in the Arctic.They found that sea-ice, snow on top of sea-ice and ice on land contributed equally to the region's albedo effect.""These three factors contributed almost equally to the reduction of the surface albedo,"" explained co-author Hailong Wang, an earth scientist from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the US.Within the scientific community, there had been a considerable level of debate over the role of soot blowing up from urban areas to the Arctic. One view was that it played a significant role in the reduction of the albedo effect in the Arctic because the dark soot would absorb more sunlight, thus increasing warming.Dr Wang and his team considered this in their study: ""We tried to quantify that impact as well,"" he said.""Soot absorption in snow and ice have had a minimal impact on the reduction of the albedo effect.""He told BBC News that the study was able to calculate for the first time the impact of snow cover on sea ice - considered to be equal to the albedo effect of sea-ice and terrestrial ice - as a result of the study's modelling.The study showed that there was a 1.25%-1.51% per-decade reduction in the surface albedo effect in the Arctic during the springs and summers from 1982 to 2014.Climate modelling around the globe shows that the warming has lead to an increase in precipitation levels.Dr Wang say this was true for the Arctic as well. However, he added, the increase in precipitation was mainly rain, not snow despite it being in the northern polar region.""Snowfall actually has been decreasing as well, so that is a decrease contribution of about 30% to the snow cover reduction,"" he observed.Although not covered in the study, one hypothesis is that the reduction in snowfall has been a result of warming in the region.As the temperature warms, the albedo effect will continue to fall thus generating a positive feedback loop that will result in continual warming until the loop is broken."
science	Victor Vescovo: Adventurer reaches deepest ocean locations		"US adventurer Victor Vescovo has become the first person to visit the deepest points in every ocean.His fifth and final dive in a prototype submersible was made to the bottom of the Arctic's Molloy Trench, some 5.5km (3.4 miles) below the sea surface.This followed dives during the past 10 months to the floor of the Pacific, Indian, Southern and Atlantic oceans.The millionaire financier's team also visited the wreck of the Titanic.All Mr Vescovo's dives were made using the 12-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor, launched and recovered from a dedicated support ship, the DSSV Pressure Drop, ironically a one-time navy submarine hunter.The last leg of the ""Five Deeps Expedition"" was concluded on 24 August when the explorer reached a spot known as the Molloy Hole, which is about 275km (170 miles) west of Norway's Svalbard archipelago.The recorded depth on the solo dive was 5,550m, plus or minus 14m. It is the first time any human has been to this location.Mr Vescovo spoke of his elation and deep gratitude to the people who had worked with him.""These things need to be done,"" he told BBC News. ""I come from a philosophy that says we're put here not just to survive, or even just to be comfortable - but to contribute in some way. And the path I chose was to have some adventure whilst also doing something that could move us forward as a species.""The former US Navy reservist's wealth and drive have previously led him to ski to both poles and to climb the highest mountains on every continent. But it's evident when you talk to him that he is utterly absorbed by the science he's facilitated.Over the course of the worldwide tour, researchers deployed more than 100 landers. These are instrumented frames that sink to the seafloor and record what they see and sense on the way down, and at the seabed.The Five Deeps science team says it has discovered upwards of 40 new species in the process. A large catalogue of biological and water samples awaits analysis in the lab, including a unique set of bottom-water samples retrieved at every one of the five deeps visited.Dr Alan Jamieson is the expedition's chief scientist. He highlighted the measurements of salinity, temperature and depth that were made by the sub and the landers.""You cast on the way down and on the way up, and if you add up the metres we measured - it works out at 1.5 million metres of water,"" he said. This will help researchers better understand ocean circulation, which is needed to improve the computer models that project future climate scenarios.""We have so few measurements from the deepest parts of the oceans, from below 6,000m,"" the Newcastle University, UK, marine biologist added.The DSSV Pressure Drop mapped the seafloor as it traversed the five oceans. This bathymetric (depth) data covers roughly 300,000 sq km - an area equivalent to Italy.This is being donated to the international project that seeks to chart the entire global ocean floor by 2030. Currently, less than 20% has been mapped to an acceptable resolution.But the Five Deeps Expedition has also fundamentally demonstrated the capability of the latest deep-sea technology.The hope is that the DSV Limiting Factor will now be followed by many more such vehicles.""I think what Victor has done is remarkable and others are going to want to continue what he's started by going back to some of these places and spending more time there,"" said Patrick Lahey, co-founder of Triton Submarines which built the Limiting Factor.""You're starting to see more privately funded marine research being conducted by wealthy individuals who bought subs they thought they would use recreationally but are now using to complete scientific expeditions, to give people like Al Jamieson a platform to work from.""It is no surprise to learn that Victor Vescovo has set his sights on going into space; he's actively talking to those who might help him get there.However, he's far from done with ocean research and expects next year to conduct further dives in previously unexplored trenches around the Pacific rim.The American oceanographer Don Walsh made history in 1960 when he joined Jacques Piccard in making the first crewed dive to the deepest point on Earth - the Challenger Deep, part of the Pacific's Mariana Trench. Mr Walsh marvels at the latest technology.""What you have here is a system - the ship, the sub and the landers. They interact and cooperate, and when you see them working together it's like a ballet,"" Mr Walsh told BBC News.""What's impressive is the repeatability - being able to dive time and time again.""Atlantic Productions is making a five-part documentary about the Five Deeps Expedition for the Discovery Channel.

science	Space agencies aim to deliver rocks from Mars to Earth	Protecting the planet	"The US and European space agencies are edging towards a joint mission to bring back rock and soil samples from Mars.Nasa and Esa have signed a letter of intent that could lead to the first ""round trip"" to another planet.The move was announced as a meeting in Berlin, Germany, discussed the science goals and feasibility of a Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission.The venture would allow scientists to answer key questions about Martian history.Those questions include whether the Red Planet once hosted life.Scientists at the Mars meeting said that there was only so much they could learn from Martian meteorites and from the various rovers and static landers sent to the Red Planet.The next step had to be a mission that would retrieve samples from the Martian surface, blast them into space in a capsule and land them safely on Earth.They could then be subjected to detailed analysis in laboratories, using instruments that are too big and power-hungry to carry as part of a robotic rover's payload and techniques that are difficult to perform from 55 million kilometres away.Making the announcement at the ILA Berlin Air and Space Show, which is taking place at the same time as the Mars science meeting, Dr Thomas Zurbuchen, Nasa's associate administrator for science, said: ""We want to partner with the European Space Agency, but also with other partners.""He said this included potential link-ups with the commercial space sector, adding: ""We will at every point look at what is available in the commercial market. Nasa has no interest whatsoever in developing things that we can buy.""Dave Parker, director of human and robotic exploration at Esa, commented: ""It's very important that every mission we send to Mars discovers something slightly unusual. It's on the basis of that that we tend to plan the next mission or next missions.""Nasa's 2020 rover mission is expected to help pave the way for Mars Sample Return, by drilling into the surface and caching the cores in containers. But this is intended as a demonstration.A mission design would need to be drawn up in coming years. Previous sample return concepts envisaged a rover storing geological samples from scientifically desirable locations on Mars.The cached samples would then be loaded on to an ascent vehicle which would lift off from the Martian surface. After the cruise back to Earth, a descent module would parachute down through Earth's atmosphere, delivering the first retrieved Martian samples directly into the hands of experts waiting on the ground.Dr Caroline Smith, head of Earth sciences collections at London's Natural History Museum, is attending the Berlin meeting. ""I would say it's a reinvigoration of the process,"" she told BBC News.""Numerous studies have said the only way it's going to be achieved is through international co-operation. So I think this is a really good message from Nasa and Esa, that we are really going to work together to achieve this - the next frontier of exploration of the Solar System.""She added: ""There's a real buzz in the room. I've spoken to my colleagues and they've said: 'Wow, we're really going to do this'!""If life existed in the past on the Red Planet, it would likely have been microbial in nature. Scientists want to first know whether conditions were right for life to get started in the past and, if so, whether evidence of fossil microbes remains. They also want to resolve whether there's life on the Red Planet now. ""We'll only be able to conclusively answer those questions by bringing samples back,"" she explained.The current high levels of cosmic radiation on Mars' surface - a consequence of its thin atmosphere - would create a hostile environment for any organisms. But there are ways life might be able to cling on. The possibility that organisms live in the Martian subsurface today means the mission would be subject to strict quarantine, or ""planetary protection"", measures.""We have to be careful we're not contaminating Mars with material from our planet, and we want to make sure we're not accidentally contaminating the samples in a way that would interfere with experiments we want to do on Earth,"" explained Dr Smith. She added: ""If there's something hazardous on Mars, we don't want to accidentally release that into Earth's biosphere.""We are used to handling hazardous materials, whether they be biological or nuclear. There are technologies that exist to be able to handle these in a safe way.""Dr Zurbuchen said the sample return mission could also be crucial for later planned human exploration of Mars, which he said Nasa should start thinking about in the 2030s.""I can imagine a lot of scenarios where the samples are actually critical for how we explore as humans,"" he said.For example, scientists want to sample dust from both the atmosphere and soil, because it could have an important impact. If future human ""bases"" were to rely on solar cells, atmospheric dust might block out sunlight - hampering electricity generation.It might also cause problems inside the crew habitats. Dr Smith commented: ""If that dust is ubiquitous, and gets everywhere and you've got people living there who are breathing in the dust, is it going to be a potential hazard to astronauts?""While rocks relevant to the life question are an obvious target for sample return, igneous rocks formed by magma from Mars' interior are also on the wish-list. ""By collecting igneous rocks, we get to understand the geochemical evolution of the planet Mars, we get to know when lavas were being erupted,"" said Caroline Smith.Analysis of these rocks could help provide a much more accurate chronology for the Red Planet, which currently relies in part on values worked out from studies of the Moon.In 2009, Nasa and Esa agreed to collaborate on the Mars Joint Exploration Initiative, which would have culminated in the recovery of samples in the 2020s. But in 2011, Nasa cancelled its participation amid a budgetary squeeze.The 2nd International Mars Sample Return Conference is taking place from 25-27 April 2018 in Berlin.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Project Oberon: UK eyes cluster of military radar satellites		"The UK government is pushing ahead with its plans for a cluster of military radar satellites, placing a design study with Airbus.Project Oberon, as it's known, has been in discussion for a while.It envisages a network of small spacecraft capable of seeing the Earth's surface in all weathers and at night, and at very high resolution.The satellites would also have sensors to locate the use of radio transmissions.This is information that can be used in tandem with the radar pictures to better identify targets on the ground and interpret their behaviour.Currently, British forces do not have the benefit of a sovereign Earth observation system. They must rely on commercial imagery or data supplied by allies.Radar satellites have traditionally been big, expensive beasts, but technology developments are shrinking the size and cost of these platforms.The Airbus study anticipates a demonstrator spacecraft being launched in 2022 with an operational capability in orbit possibly as early as 2025.""Project Oberon builds on Airbus' expertise in space radar technology developed over 40 years,"" said Colin Paynter, the managing director of Airbus Defence and Space UK.""I look forward to seeing this study leading to a new world-class surveillance capability for the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), helping to protect our armed forces across the world.""News of the study was announced by Gary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), an executive agency of the MoD.He was speaking at the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEi) trade show at London's ExCel conference centre.""This addition to our capability is a valuable part of the future of Defence Space. Partnership between Dstl and Airbus on this project secures UK jobs as well as continuing to exploit advances in the UK space sector.""The armed forces have been testing data gathered by the NovaSar satellite, which was launched a year ago.This first all-British radar spacecraft was developed by Airbus and its subsidiary Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.At 430kg, it is small by historic comparison, but still large when set against the very latest platforms now being built by commercial operators, such as the Finnish Iceye company and the US start-up Capella. Their satellites weigh well under 100kg.Airbus says it too can achieve similar compactness whilst also delivering very high performance.The new satellites would likely use the innovate antennas from Oxford Space Systems (OSS).These carbon-fibre structures stow away in very small volumes for launch but then spring into shape once in orbit.The ""wrapped rib"" design would transmit (via a smaller inner-structure) and receive the radar pulses that are used to map the surface of the Earth.The MoD is already funding R&D work at OSS.Sensing and geo-locating the source of radio frequency (RF) transmissions is an emerging Earth observation technique.A good example where this can be useful is in maritime patrol.Pirates and illegal fishers will often switch off their GPS trackers to try to hide from the authorities, but they will still be visible to satellite-borne RF sensors if they are using radios and other equipment to coordinate their illegal activities.The tender for the Project Oberon study was issued at the end of last year.The DSEi event on Wednesday also saw the MoD announce the competition to run its next-generation Skynet telecommunications network.The current Skynet-5 system was procured as a complete service (satellites and operations) from Airbus under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) in 2003.For Skynet-6, the MoD will be moving to a model where it retains ownership of the satellites but brings in a commercial partner to manage the secure communications these spacecraft enable.At the moment, just one geostationary satellite, Skynet-6a, has been ordered (from Airbus) for the new network.Skynet-5 has four spacecraft in orbit providing global connectivity for British armed forces.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	How space affects women and men differently	Does space affect men and women differently?What about periods in space?Why are toilets in space sometimes a challenge for women?Does space travel affect your ability to have children?How did you become a space gynaecologist?Would you go into space yourself?	Some 564 people have been into space - 65 of them women. That's despite the fact that the first woman in space, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, went into orbit as early as 1963.It took Nasa 20 years to catch up and in 1983 Sally Ride became the third woman, and first American woman to go into space. Before her voyage she was asked by the media if she was taking any makeup on her trip and whether she cried when there were malfunctions in the flight simulator.On Friday 18 October, Nasa conducted its first ever all-female spacewalk, after plans earlier this year were scrapped because of a lack of medium-sized spacesuits to fit one of the astronauts.For the last decade, Dr Varsha Jain has been working part-time as a space gynaecologist. She combines her PhD work at the MRC Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Edinburgh with research alongside Nasa into women's health in space.She's been speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 Live.VJ: Overall adaptation to the space environment is roughly the same for men and women but there are some differences.Women are more likely to feel sick when they go into space, men are more likely to get re-entry sickness when they come back to Earth.Men have more problems with their vision and hearing when they get back from space which women don't get. When women return they do have problems managing their blood pressure so they feel quite faint.So there are some subtle differences and we don't know if that's to do with hormonal differences or more physiological changes that are occurring. And long-term, understanding those differences will help us understand more about human health on Earth.VJ: When the Americans sent Sally Ride up into space, the questions that Nasa had were about what would happen to women's periods and how do we account for this.Female astronauts said at the time, 'let's consider it non-problem until it becomes a problem'. But space travel is a bit like a camping trip and the engineers had to plan things like how many sanitary products were needed.Because it was a very male dominated world, the figures that they thought they needed were 100 or 200 tampons for a week! They shortly came to the conclusion that that many weren't needed.Most female astronauts now use the contraceptive pill to stop their periods and it is safe for them to do so because they are healthy women.One of the parts of my work was to research other ways for women to stop their periods to see if things like the contraceptive coil could be more effective.VJ: There are two toilets on the International Space Station, but the engineers hadn't originally accounted for blood.In space, urine isn't wasted, it's recycled and drinking water is reclaimed from it. Period blood is considered a solid material and none of the toilets on the space station can differentiate solid from liquid material, therefore the water in it is lost and not recycled.There are also limitations on how water can be used for washing, so the practicalities of personal hygiene while menstruating during spaceflight can be challenging.VJ: There is no obvious demonstrable effect that going into space has on an astronaut's ability to have children. It is important to remember that both male and female astronauts have successfully had children after spaceflight missions.However, female astronauts are, on average, 38 years old during their first mission.This is an area where I think Nasa is leading the way in being a supportive working environment. Ultimately, freezing of eggs or sperm is entirely a personal choice and, as far as I am aware, Nasa does not have any protocols on what their astronauts should do prior to spaceflight missions.We know astronauts are at risk of radiation in space and we haven't any idea how that will impact a women's fertility.The quality of sperm and sperm count decreases after space travel, but then sperm regenerates back on Earth, so there is no known long-term damage. Women are born with all the eggs they need for their lifetime, so Nasa is very supportive of female astronauts freezing their eggs before their missions.VJ: My interest in space came before my fascination with medicine. As a child, my brothers were both into Star Trek and seeing strong female characters like Beverly Crusher and Captain Kathryn Janeway really inspired me and shaped my goals.I knew that I wanted to work in the area of space medicine and because I was practising gynaecology at the time I found a huge knowledge gap in terms of women's health that I thought deserved a platform.My first day at Nasa, I was like a kid in a candy store. Driving up to the Nasa Johnson Space Centre, the first time I saw the sign I remember screaming because I was so excited. Every single day I remember waking up at 05:00 because I just couldn't wait to get to work.VJ: Not for a long duration mission! I know too much about the physiological changes and that puts me off.The changes that happen to the human body are like an accelerated aging process. If we take bone changes, astronauts lose bone mass when they go into space and parts of that bone mass are never regained despite the excellent counter measures and programmes the astronauts have when they get back.Obviously, I would love to see what Earth looks like from space, but long-term as a goal I think I know I'm doing my dream job already.Dr Varsha Jain was one of the first academic doctors to focus on researching women's health in relation to space.

science	The algae that terraformed Earth		"A planetary takeover by ocean-dwelling algae 650 million years ago was the kick that transformed life on Earth.That's what geochemists argue in Nature this week, on the basis of invisibly small traces of biomolecules dug up from beneath the Australian desert.The molecules mark an explosion in the quantity of algae in the oceans.This in turn fuelled a change in the food web that allowed the first microscopic animals to evolve, the authors suggest.""This is one the most profound ecological and evolutionary transitions in Earth's history,"" lead researcher Jochen Brocks told the BBC's Science in Action programme.The events took place a hundred million years before the so-called Cambrian Explosion, an eruption of complex life recorded in fossils around the world that puzzled Darwin and always hinted at some kind of biological prehistory.Scattered traces of those precursor multi-celled organisms have since been recognised, but the evolutionary driver that led to their rise has been much argued over.Cambridge University palaeontologist Nick Butterfield has said the period ""was arguably the most revolutionary in Earth history"", and not just because of the rapid biological changes. There were violent swings in climate, too, that experts have long suspected are intertwined.The context was a planet that previously had long had life-sustaining oceans and a benign climate. Yet, for over three billion years - since 3.8 billion years before present according to most estimates - all life was single-celled, mostly bacteria; little evolutionary innovation had happened.Algae, more complex than bacteria but still single-celled, had themselves been around for over a billion years (the ""boring billion"" some palaeontologists call it), but without making much of an ecological impact.With their DNA packed away safely inside a nucleus (so-called eukaryotes, like all animals and plants today), they had an evolutionary advantage over bacteria they seemed unable to exploit.That changed about 650 million years ago, according to the new study.There are no fossils of the algae. Instead, Brocks and his team at the Australian National University, have tracked down molecular remnants of their cell walls, molecules closely related to the cholesterol in our bodies, ""the most stable thing of any organism - fat,"" Brocks quips.After every other trace of the cells had decayed, these fat molecules remained and were absorbed into sediments, and over geological time became cemented into the bedrock of Australia. To be drilled up and analysed hundreds of millions of years later.""The signals that we find show that the algal population went up by a factor of a hundred to a thousand and the diversity went right up in one big bang, and never went back again,"" Brocks says.This ecological flip happened just after one of the greatest environmental catastrophes the planet has ever seen - the ""Snowball Earth"" period when ice extended from pole to pole, and even at the equator temperatures could have plunged to minus 60 degrees.The episode ended after 50 million years, when the build-up of volcanic CO2 in the atmosphere created a supergreenhouse that melted the ice in a second cataclysm.The connection, Brocks believes, is that glacial action ground up continental rocks, releasing the nutrient phosphate which was then washed into the oceans as the thaw progressed.Today's agricultural green revolution is dependent on phosphates dug up in giant mines around the world, and the pre-Cambrian biological revolution may have been powered the same way, the researchers believe.""This rise in algae happens just around the time the first animals appeared on the scene,"" Brocks explains. ""It was algae at the bottom of the food web that created this burst of energy and nutrients that allowed larger and more complex creatures to evolve.""Yale University's Noah Planavsky, whose study earlier this year [Nature link] revealed the phosphate nutrient outburst following the Snowball Earth, says the new revelations are ""incredibly important"".""It gives the first evidence of ecosystems dominated by complex lifeforms - the eukaryotes,"" he told the BBC.In a commentary also in Nature, Andrew Knoll of Harvard University, a world authority on pre-Cambrian life, says the new work makes ""a substantial contribution"" to revealing ""the relationship between life and the surrounding physical environment"" at a critical time in animal evolution.""Food source changes might have helped to pave the way for the animal radiation,"" he agrees, though adding ""key questions remain"".Getting the data was painstaking work, says MIT's Roger Summons, who has previously collaborated with Brocks. The nanogram traces of pre-Cambrian oil measured in the study had to be picked out from a fog of contamination made by fossil fuels.""I applaud Jochen's insight and his tenacity,"" Summons wrote in an e-mail. ""The results show how fastidious attention to detail ultimately pays off.""However, he suggests the tale is not complete. Likewise, Cambridge University's Nick Butterfield, while accepting the data, disagrees with the interpretation.In fact, he thinks that Brocks has got cause and effect back to front; the explosion of algae did not drive the rise of animals, he says.""There's no evidence for animal evolution being constrained by a shortage of food,"" he argued in an e-mail.Instead, he says, it was the rise of animals - sponges to be precise - that cleared the ecological path for algae.Brocks and Butterfield debated the interpretation in the corridors of the Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Paris this week, as others looked on.Brocks remains unswayed - that the outburst of algae 650 million years ago ""kicked off an escalating arms race"" in which larger creatures, fuelled by their ocean-grazing, become prey to yet larger ones - until you end up with the complexity we see today."
science	High-energy 'ghost particles' absorbed by Earth		"Neutrinos are known as ""ghost particles"", because they are known to travel through solid objects with ease.But a new study demonstrates that some of these sub-atomic particles are stopped in their tracks when they encounter our planet.Neutrinos interact so weakly with matter that a single one can pass through a light-year (10 trillion km) of lead without hitting an atom.The results come from the IceCube experiment, located in Antarctica.It's an important measurement that's consistent with the Standard Model - the theory that describes the behaviour of fundamental forces and particles, such as neutrinos.The neutrinos seen by the IceCube detector had very high energies. This was a critical factor since the higher the energy, the more likely the neutrinos are to interact with matter and therefore be absorbed by the Earth.IceCube consists of an array of 5,160 basketball-sized optical sensors called Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) that are encased within a cubic kilometre of very clear Antarctic ice near the South Pole.The experiment's sensors do not directly observe neutrinos, but instead measure flashes of blue light known as Cherenkov radiation. These flashes are emitted by other particles such as muons, which are produced when neutrinos interact with the ice.By measuring the light patterns from these interactions in or near the detector array, IceCube can estimate the neutrinos' directions and energies.The team found there were fewer energetic neutrinos making it all the way through Earth to the IceCube detector than those that reached it from less obstructed paths - such as near-horizontal trajectories.""Understanding how neutrinos interact is key to the operation of IceCube,"" said Francis Halzen, chief scientist for IceCube and a professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.The results will allow team members to calculate something called the neutrino ""cross-section"" with a high degree of accuracy. The cross-section describes the probability that neutrinos of a given energy will interact with matter.""We were of course hoping for some new physics to appear, but we unfortunately find that the Standard Model, as usual, withstands the test,"" said Prof Halzen.The finding, published in Nature journal, provides the first cross-section measurements for a neutrino energy range that is up to 1,000 times higher than previous measurements at particle accelerators.Most of the neutrinos selected for this study were more than a million times more energetic than those produced by more familiar sources, such as the Sun or nuclear power plants.The analysis could also be of interest to geophysicists who would like to use neutrinos to image the Earth's interior, though this will require more data than was used in the current study.Most of the neutrinos used in the study were generated in the Earth's atmosphere, through a process initiated by cosmic rays. But the results also include a small number of ""astrophysical neutrinos"", which are produced by unknown sources beyond the Earth's atmosphere.Another neutrino experiment, known as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune), is currently in development, and is due to switch on in the 2020s.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Satellite will gain hi-res view of greenhouse effect		"Europe will launch a satellite to obtain a high-resolution view of Earth's greenhouse effect.The Forum mission will carry a spectrometer to sense the far-infrared radiation coming up off the Earth.It's in this long wavelength portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that water vapour and carbon dioxide absorb energy very efficiently, warming the planet in the process.Remarkably, it's not a region that has been mapped extensively before.This means scientists are missing a number of key features in their climate models, including the detailed workings of some of the feedbacks in the planet's atmosphere that amplify or mitigate warming.These omissions would include the behaviour of certain types of cloud.""Satellite missions up until now have mostly measured wavelengths in the mid-infrared - that's shorter than 15 microns,"" explained Dr Helen Brindley from Imperial College London and the UK National Centre for Earth Observation.""We're now looking to measure longer than 15 microns which has never been done before from space, with very high accuracy and with what we call very high spectral resolution which means we can really see the fingerprints of different gases in the atmosphere, particularly water vapour, and really get an idea of how the energy is changing with time,"" she told BBC News.Forum is an acronym that stands for Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring.The satellite concept was selected for development on Tuesday by delegates to the European Space Agency's (Esa) Earth observation programme board at a meeting in Frascati, Italy.It falls in the organisation's Earth Explorer class. These are experimental missions that do novel science in areas of pressing environmental interest. Forum would be the ninth in the series.It is expected to go into orbit on a Vega rocket around 2025 or 2026. The budget is targeted not to exceed €260m (£230m).The project has strong UK scientific support, led from Imperial, but also considerable industrial engagement.The British arms of Airbus and Thales Alenia Space are directing the two consortia currently advising on the best way to build the half-tonne spacecraft.Earth's surface temperature would be many degrees below zero were it not for its atmosphere.Incoming shortwave radiation from the Sun is absorbed at the surface and re-emitted at longer wavelengths, in the infrared.In the absence of water vapour, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the air, this energy would pass straight back out into space.But the molecules of these gases trap the radiation, warming the planet. And most of that absorption, more than 50%, occurs in the far-infrared.Meteorological satellites routinely observe at mid-infrared wavelengths to get an idea of where water in the atmosphere will build into new weather fronts. But given the significance of water vapour to the greenhouse effect, it begs the question why the far-infrared is not also routinely being mapped.That comes down to technology, says Esa's Dr Hilke Oetjen. The necessary innovations have only recently become available, and even though such observations are now possible, Forum will still have to spot map the atmosphere as it circles the globe at 7km/s.""The problem is not the spectrometer instrument; it's the detectors. They're relatively new,"" explained the agency's Forum project scientist.""We also have to use this 'step and stare' technique. We need that because we're integrating (the information) for seven to eight seconds for one measurement, which is an enormous amount of time given how fast a satellite flies.""Step and stare will see the satellite sample a 15km-wide spot in the atmosphere about every 100km. Nonetheless, this should give a very good picture of the far-infrared energy budget across the entire globe every month. If the mission operates for its initial four-year period, Forum will capture all the seasonal and inter-annual behaviour that the scientists need to start to improve their models.The work should ultimately take out some of the uncertainty that currently surrounds the projections of future climate change.This will come from a better representation of features such as ice clouds in the models.""We've effectively tuned our models of what cirrus clouds look like to the measurements we have in the mid-infrared and the visible, said Dr Brindley.""What I suspect we'll find is the models are not necessarily right for the far-infrared and we'll have to adjust those models with improved understanding of things like the size and shape of ice crystal particles. That will probably have implications for whether those clouds are heating or cooling the planet.""Beth Greenaway, the head of Earth observation and climate at the UK Space Agency, welcomed the selection of Forum.She said: ""Thanks to investment from the UK Space Agency, Britain could be a big player in this mission and the 'go ahead' from Esa was based on fantastic science from Imperial College London and the cross-European Mission Advisory Group, supported by detailed technical mission feasibility from studies led by UK industry teams.""The selection of Forum - over some other very credible missions - is a real indication of the strength of the UK's Earth Observation capability which spans across universities and companies.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Earth is becoming 'Planet Plastic'		"US scientists have calculated the total amount of plastic ever made and put the number at 8.3 billion tonnes.It is an astonishing mass of material that has essentially been created only in the last 65 years or so.The 8.3 billion tonnes is as heavy as 25,000 Empire State Buildings in New York, or a billion elephants.The great issue is that plastic items, like packaging, tend to be used for very short periods before being discarded.More than 70% of the total production is now in waste streams, sent largely to landfill - although too much of it just litters the wider environment, including the oceans.""We are rapidly heading towards 'Planet Plastic', and if we don't want to live on that kind of world then we may have to rethink how we use some materials, in particular plastic,"" Dr Roland Geyer told BBC News.A paper authored by the industrial ecologist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and colleagues appears in the journal Science Advances. It is described as the first truly global assessment of how much plastic has been manufactured, how the material in all its forms is used, and where it ends up. Here are some of its key numbers.There is no question that plastics are a wonder material. Their adaptability and durability have seen their production and use accelerate past most other manmade materials apart from steel, cement and brick.From the start of mass-manufacturing in the 1950s, the polymers are now all around us - incorporated into everything from food wrapping and clothing, to aeroplane parts and flame retardants. But it is precisely plastics' amazing qualities that now present a burgeoning problem.None of the commonly used plastics are biodegradable. The only way to permanently dispose of their waste is to destructively heat it - through a decomposition process known as pyrolysis or through simple incineration; although the latter is complicated by health and emissions concerns.In the meantime, the waste mounts up. There is enough plastic debris out there right now, Geyer and colleagues say, to cover an entire country the size of Argentina. The team's hope is that their new analysis will give added impetus to the conversation about how best to deal with the plastics issue.""Our mantra is you can't manage what you don't measure,"" Dr Geyer said. ""So, our idea was to put the numbers out there without us telling the world what the world should be doing, but really just to start a real, concerted discussion.""Recycling rates are increasing and novel chemistry has some biodegradable alternatives, but manufacturing new plastic is so cheap the virgin product is hard to dislodge.The same team - which includes Jenna Jambeck from the University of Georgia and Kara Lavender Law from the Sea Education Association at Woods Hole - produced the seminal report in 2015 that quantified the total amount of plastic waste escaping to the oceans each year: eight million tonnes.This particular waste flow is probably the one that has generated most concern of late because of the clear evidence now that some of this discarded material is getting into the food chain as fish and other marine creatures ingest small polymer fragments.Dr Erik van Sebille from Utrecht University in the Netherlands is an oceanographer who tracks plastics in our seas. Of the new report, he said: ""We're facing a tsunami of plastic waste, and we need to deal with that.""The global waste industry needs to get its act together and make sure that the ever-increasing amounts of plastic waste generated don't end up in the environment.""We need a radical shift in how we deal with plastic waste. On current trends, it will take until 2060 before more plastic gets recycled than landfilled and lost to the environment. That clearly is too slow; we can't wait that long,"" he told BBC News.And Richard Thompson, professor of marine biology at Plymouth University, UK, commented: ""If plastic products are designed with recyclability in mind they can be recycled many times over. Some would say a bottle could be recycled 20 times. That's a substantial reduction in waste. At the moment poor design limits us.""To illustrate that point, Dr Geyer said: ""The holy grail of recycling is to keep material in use and in the loop for ever if you can. But it turns out in our study that actually 90% of that material that did get recycled - which I think we calculated was 600 million tonnes - only got recycled once.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: Thousands invited to join citizens' assembly	Random selectionComplex issues	"Letters are being sent to 30,000 households across the UK inviting people to join a citizens' assembly on climate change.Once participants are selected, the assembly will meet next year, with the outcome of their discussions reported back to Parliament.The initiative, set up by cross party MPs, will look at what members of the public can do to reduce CO2.The UK government has committed to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee, one of six select committees who commissioned the climate assembly, said a clear roadmap was needed to achieve this goal.""Finding solutions which are equitable and have public support will be crucial,"" she said.""Parliament needs to work with the people and with government to address the challenge of climate change.""The invitees to Climate Assembly UK have been selected at random from across the UK. From those who respond, 110 people will be chosen as a representative sample of the population.They will meet over four weekends from late January in Birmingham, and will discuss topics ranging from transport to household energy use.A citizens' assembly has been a key demand of the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, whose protests caused widespread disruption this year.The group said they welcomed this as a first step, but warned that the assembly should be focussing on cutting carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 not 2050.Spokesperson Linda Doyle said: ""Waiting 30 years to reach zero net carbon emissions is a death sentence to people around the world and in the UK - it gives us a higher chance of breaching irreversible tipping points as the climate breaks down and it only serves short term 'business as usual'.""Environmental group Friends of the Earth said citizens' assemblies could play an important part in policy-making.Dave Timms, head of political affairs at FOE, said: ""Tackling the climate emergency with the speed required will require radical changes to our economy, infrastructure and even to society so it's important that there is a consensus among citizens.""Much of what needs to be done already commands widespread public support and it is politicians that just need to bloody-well get on with it now.""Citizens' assemblies have been used in a number of countries around the world.In Ireland, a panel of 99 people was established in 2016 to look at a range of political questions, including abortion.They recommended that the country should overturn its ban and suggested a referendum, which went on to support repeal.In Canada and the Netherlands, the approach has been used to discuss electoral reform."
science	A brief history of the Earth's CO2		"Climate change has been described as one of the biggest problems faced by humankind. Carbon dioxide is is the primary driver of global warming. Prof Joanna Haigh from Imperial College London explains why this gas has played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's climate.Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been present in the atmosphere since the Earth condensed from a ball of hot gases following its formation from the explosion of a huge star about five billion years ago.At that time the atmosphere was mainly composed of nitrogen, CO2 and water vapour, which seeped through cracks in the solid surface. A very similar composition emerges from volcanic eruptions today.As the planet cooled further some of the water vapour condensed out to form oceans and they dissolved a portion of the CO2 but it was still present in the atmosphere in large amounts.Tomorrow's WorldWhat is climate change?The first life forms to evolve on Earth were microbes which could survive in this primordial atmosphere but about 2.5 billion years ago, plants developed the ability to photosynthesise, creating glucose and oxygen from CO2 and water in the presence of light from the Sun.This had a transformative impact on the atmosphere: as life developed, CO2 was consumed so that by around 20 million years ago its concentration was down to below 300 molecules in every one million molecules of air (or 300 parts per million - ppm).Life on Earth has evolved under these conditions - note that humans did not appear until about 200,000 years ago - and atmospheric CO2 has not exceed that concentration until the industrial revolution brought with it massive emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels: coal and oil.CO2 plays an important role in climate because it is one of the atmospheric ""greenhouse"" gases (GHGs) which keep the Earth's surface about 33 degrees warmer than the -18C temperature it would be at were they not present.They do this by being fairly transparent to the Sun's rays, allowing them through to warm the surface, but then absorbing the radiant heat that the surface emits, so trapping it and enhancing the warming. In the present climate the most effective GHGs are water vapour, which is responsible for about two-thirds of the total warming, and CO2 which accounts for about one quarter.Other gases, including methane, make up the remainder. The atmospheric concentration of water vapour is less than 1% and, with CO2 making up only a few molecules in every ten thousand of air, it may be surprising that they can have such a significant impact on the surface temperature.They are able to do this, however, because the structure of their molecules makes them especially effective at absorbing heat radiation while the major atmospheric gases, nitrogen and oxygen, are essentially transparent to it.The greenhouse effect means that as the atmospheric loading of GHGs increases the surface temperature of the Earth warms. The overall increase in global temperature of about 1C over the past 150 years is almost entirely due to the human activities that have increasing amounts of atmospheric GHGs.Most significantly, the concentration of CO2 has been rising exponentially (at a rate of about 0.17% per year) since the industrial revolution, due mainly to the combustion of fossil fuels but also to large-scale tropical deforestation which depletes the climate system's capacity for photosynthesis.In 2015, it passed 400ppm, more than 40% higher than its pre-industrial value of 280ppm and a level that has not existed on Earth for several million years.While the basic science of how GHGs warm the Earth is very well understood, there are complications. The climate system responds in various ways which both enhance and ameliorate the effects of these gases.For example, a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour (before it condenses out in clouds or rain) and because water vapour is a GHG, this increases the temperature rise. Another example: as the oceans warm they are less able to hold CO2 so release it, again with the result the initial warming is enhanced.The global temperature record over the past century does not show the same smooth increase presented by CO2 measurements because the climate is influenced by other factors than GHGs, arising from both natural and human sources. Some particles released into the atmosphere by industrial activities reflect sunshine back to space, tending to cool the planet.Similarly, large volcanic eruptions can eject small particles into the higher atmosphere, where they remain for up to about two years reducing the sunlight reaching the surface, and temporary dips in global temperature have indeed been measured following major volcanic events.Changes in the energy emitted by the Sun also affect surface temperature, though measurements of the solar output show this effect to be small on human timescales.Another important consideration in interpreting global temperatures is that the climate is inherently complex. Energy moves between the atmosphere and oceans in natural fluctuations - an example being El Niño events. This means that we cannot expect an immediate direct relationship between any influencing factor and surface temperature.All these factors complicate the picture. Nevertheless, it is indisputable that the global temperature rise over the past century is a result of human-produced GHGs, mainly CO2.While, until the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration has not exceeded the 280ppm value that last occurred several million years ago, it has gone through periods when it was considerably lower.Notably, during the ice ages which have occurred roughly every 100,000 years over at least the past half million, drops in global temperature of perhaps 5C have been accompanied by reductions in CO2 concentration to less than 200ppm.The ice ages, and associated warmer interglacial periods, are brought about by changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun which take place on these long timescales. The cooling in response to a decline in solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface results in a greater uptake of CO2 by the oceans and so further cooling due to a weakened greenhouse effect.This is an entirely natural phenomenon and it is worth noting that such amplification of temperature fluctuations will occur in response to any initiating factor regardless of its source and including human-produced greenhouse gases.The effects of increasing CO2 are not limited to an increase in air temperature. As the oceans warm they are expanding so producing a rise in sea level, this being exacerbated by the melting of some of the ice present on land near the poles and in glaciers. The warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour resulting in increased occurrences of heavy rainfall and flooding while changes in weather patterns are intensifying droughts in other regions.If human emissions of GHGs into the atmosphere continue unabated then the global temperature will continue to rise and the associated weather impacts become ever more severe. The UN climate conference in Paris in December 2015, at which 195 nations unanimously agreed on an aim to restrict the temperature rise to less than 2C, or preferably 1.5C, above the pre-industrial ""baseline"" was an extraordinary political achievement.To achieve this, however, will require a complete cessation of global CO2 emissions by the second half of this century and, while the world considers how this might be achieved, the crossing of the 400ppm mark in CO2 concentration has been matched by a global warming of 1C."
science	Nasa carbon space observatory 'watches Earth breathe'		"A Nasa satellite has provided remarkable new insights on how CO2 is moved through the Earth's atmosphere.The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) tracked the behaviour of the gas in 2015/2016 - a period when the planet experienced a major El Niño event.This climate phenomenon boosts the amount of CO2 in the air.The US space agency's OCO satellite was able to show how that increase was controlled by the response of tropical forests to heat and drought.The forests' ability to draw down carbon dioxide, some of it produced by human activity, was severely curtailed.The science has significant implications because the kind of conditions associated with El Niños are expected to become much more common under global warming.""If future climate is more like this recent El Niño, the trouble is the Earth may actually lose some of the carbon removal services we get from these tropical forests, and then CO2 will increase even faster in the atmosphere,"" explained Scott Denning, an OCO science team member from Colorado State University in Fort Collins. That would amplify warming, he told reporters.Technical papers describing OCO's work have just been published in Science Magazine.El Niños occur when warm waters in the western Pacific periodically shift eastwards. This sets off a global perturbation in weather systems, redistributing rainfall and bumping up temperatures.The 2015/16 event was one of the strongest on record and this was evident in the rise of CO2.Normally, the concentration of the gas in the atmosphere goes up each year by about two parts per million by volume (ppmv) of air molecules - the equivalent of four gigatonnes of extra CO2. The current total is just over 400ppmv.But in this extraordinary El Niño period, the jump was 3ppmv, per year - or six gigatonnes.It is a rate of increase not seen on Earth in at least 2,000 years.What was remarkable, however, was that human emissions of carbon dioxide were thought to have been relatively static over the same period, meaning something strikingly went wrong with the processes that would normally scrub CO2 from the atmosphere.OCO's ability to track the gas and sense the rate of photosynthesis in plants provided the answers.In South America, it could show that the biggest drought in 30 years limited vegetation's ability to consume CO2.In Africa, hotter than average temperatures increased decomposition of plant material, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.And in Asia, tinder-dry conditions fed rampant fires, particularly in Indonesia. ""The fires released peat carbon that had accumulated over thousands of years,"" said Junjie Liu, an OCO research scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.""This is the gold star for OCO: we wanted to understand what happened in different regions of the world,"" said Nasa deputy project scientist Annmarie Eldering.""We used to think of the tropics in a monolithic way, but now we can say one region behaved this way and another region behaved in a different way; and together they created this effect of more carbon in the atmosphere,"" she told this week's Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service.Paul Palmer, an atmospheric scientist at Edinburgh University in the UK, described the OCO observations as groundbreaking.""This is the first major climate variation where we've had satellite observations of atmospheric composition, and of land properties and of ocean properties - all at the same time,"" he said.""The last major El Niño was 1997/8 and that was really just the start of the satellite tropospheric chemistry missions.

We're not quite there yet, but this is a really good start.""The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is described as a pathfinder for the types of carbon-monitoring satellites that will come later.OCO is very accurate in its measurements but it only sees a very narrow swath (10km wide) of the Earth when it flies overhead.Europe is planning a constellation of satellites called Sentinel-7 that will map CO2 over a much wider area, but still at very high precision.S7 will trace in much more detail the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide.This orbiting network would even make it possible to police individual countries' commitments to reduce carbon emissions under international agreements such as the Paris climate accord of 2015.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Voyagers shed light on Solar System's structure		"Data sent back by the two Voyager spacecraft have shed new light on the structure of the Solar System.Forty-two years after they were launched, the spacecraft are still going strong and exploring the outer reaches of our cosmic neighbourhood.By analysing data sent back by the probes, scientists have worked out the shape of the vast magnetic bubble that surrounds the Sun.The two spacecraft are now more than 10 billion miles from Earth.Researchers detail their findings in six separate studies published in the journal Nature Astronomy.""We had no good quantitative idea how big this bubble is that the Sun creates around itself with its solar wind - ionised plasma that's speeding away from the Sun radially in all directions,"" said Ed Stone, the longstanding project scientist for the missions.""We certainly didn't know that the spacecraft could live long enough to reach the edge and leave the bubble to enter interstellar space.""The plasma consists of charged particles and gas that permeate space on both sides of the magnetic bubble, known as the heliosphere.Measurements show that the identical probes have exited the heliosphere and entered interstellar space - the region between stars. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012, Voyager 2 crossed over late last year. The key sign in both cases was a jump in the density of plasma.This showed that the spacecraft were passing from an environment with hot, lower density plasma characteristic of the solar wind and entering a region with the cool, higher density plasma thought to be found in interstellar space.The boundary between the two regions is known as the heliopause.""We saw the plasma density at the heliopause jump by a very large amount - a factor of 20, at this rather sharp boundary out there,"" said Prof Don Gurnett, from the University of Iowa.""Actually, with Voyager One we saw an even bigger jump.""The findings suggest that the heliosphere is symmetrical, at least at the two points that the Voyager spacecraft crossed. The researchers say these points are almost at the same distance from the Sun, indicating a spherical front to the bubble - ""like a blunt bullet"", according to Prof Gurnett.The results also provide clues to the the thickness of the ""heliosheath"", the outer region of the magnetic bubble. This is the point where the solar wind piles up against the approaching wind of particles in interstellar space, which Prof Gurnett likens to the effect of a snow plow on a city street.The heliosheath appears to vary in its thickness. This is based on data showing that Voyager 1 had to travel further than its twin to reach the heliopause, where the solar wind and the interstellar wind are in balance.Some had thought Voyager 2 would make that crossing into interstellar space first, based on models of the magnetic bubble.""In a historical sense, the old idea that the solar wind will just be gradually whittled away as you go further into interstellar space is simply not true,"" says Don Gurnett.""We show with Voyager 2 - and previously with Voyager 1 - that there's a distinct boundary out there. It's just astonishing how fluids, including plasmas, form boundaries.""Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Water found for first time on 'potentially habitable' planet	What is an exoplanet?Long haul	"Astronomers have for the first time discovered water in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting within the habitable zone of a distant star.The finding makes the world - which is called K2-18b - a plausible candidate in the search for alien life.Within 10 years, new space telescopes might be able to determine whether K2-18b's atmosphere contains gases that could be produced by living organisms.Details were published in the scientific journal Nature Astronomy.The lead scientist, Prof Giovanna Tinetti of University College London (UCL), described the discovery as ""mind blowing"".""This is the first time that we have detected water on a planet in the habitable zone around a star where the temperature is potentially compatible with the presence of life,"" she said.The habitable zone is the region around a star where temperatures are considered sufficiently benign for water to exist in liquid form on the surface of a planet.The new planet is just over twice the size of Earth - in a planet category known as a ""super Earth"" - and has a temperature cool enough to have liquid water, between zero and 40C.K2-18b is 111 light-years - about 650 million million miles - from Earth, too far to send a probe. So the only option is to wait for the next generation of space telescopes to be launched in the 2020s and to look for gases in the planet's atmosphere that could only be produced by living organisms.The team behind the discovery looked through the planets discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope between 2016 and 2017. The researchers determined some of the chemicals in their atmosphere by studying the changes to the starlight as the planets orbited their suns. The light filtered through the planets' atmospheres was subtly altered by the composition of the atmosphere.Only K2-18b revealed the molecular signature of water, which is a vital ingredient for life on Earth.Dr Angelos Tsiaras, a member of the UCL team, said that finding water in the atmosphere of a ""potentially habitable exoplanet was incredibly exciting"".Other astronomers, however, dispute the claim that the planet is potentially habitable. One analysis indicates that planets that are 1.5 times the mass of the Earth are unlikely to have a rocky surface. There is also concern that K2-18b's size and gravity would make it difficult for the world to support life.Other critics suggest that the planet should not be classified as a super-Earth, but as a mini Neptune instead. This is a class of planet that is typically more massive than a super-Earth (it includes worlds that are up to 10 times the mass of our own planet). Prof Tinetti, however, maintains her view that the new world is potentially habitable.She said it had a mean density that's comparable to that of Mars (which is composed of silicates) and Jupiter's moon Europa, and much higher than Neptune's.""K2-18b cannot be classified as a mini-Neptune, it is more likely to be a planet with an interior of rock and ices. These types of planets, [are] sometimes called 'ocean planets',"" she told BBC News.""Now, whether this planet really has an ocean at the surface or rock, we cannot tell with current observations, but having water in the atmosphere is a good start.""But it is a view that Dr Laura Kreidberg, of the Centre for Astrophysics at Harvard University does not agree with.""The interior of the planet is much more like Neptune. Pressure and temperature increase with depth, so that before a rocky surface is reached, it is too hot and too high-pressure for complex molecules like DNA or any of the other building blocks of life to form,"" she told BBC News.Prof David Charbonneau, also from Harvard University, said the fact that K2-18b's atmosphere was detected was proof in itself that it could not support life.""If the planet had a thin secondary atmosphere similar to Earth it would be so thin that Hubble couldn't detect it.""Another issue is that astronomers can't agree what conditions are needed for habitability. We only have the Earth to go on but life may also be possible on other types of worldsIt is likely to require a survey of the chemical composition of, perhaps, hundreds of worlds and an understanding of how they are created and evolve, according to Prof Tinetti.""The Earth really stands out in our own Solar System. It has oxygen, water and ozone. But if we find all that around a planet around a distant star we have to be cautious about saying that it supports life,"" she said.""This is why we need to understand not just a handful of planets in the galaxy but hundreds of them. And what we hope is that the habitable planets will stand out, that we will see a big difference between the planets that are habitable and the ones that are not.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"
science	Asteroid set for 'close' 43,300 mile flight past Earth on Friday		"An asteroid up to 40m in size and only discovered five days ago, is due to skim past the Earth on Friday.Asteroid 2018 CB will pass by at just less than one-fifth the distance between the Earth and the Moon.It was first spotted by the Catalina Sky Survey in Tucson, Arizona, a Nasa-funded project to record potentially hazardous asteroids.However, while the pass is relatively close in astronomical terms, it's nowhere near enough to be a threat.The 15-40m space rock is set to make its closest approach to Earth at 22:27 GMT.""Although 2018 CB is quite small, it might well be larger than the asteroid that entered the atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia, almost exactly five years ago, in 2013,"" said Paul Chodas, manager of Nasa's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies.""Asteroids of this size do not often approach this close to our planet - maybe only once or twice a year.""CB 2018 will buzz us at a distance of 69,700km (43,300 miles), which is roughly twice as far as the belt of satellites which orbit Earth in geostationary orbit.Another small asteroid passed within lunar distance this week. Known as 2018 CC, the object made its closest approach to Earth on 6 February at a distance of about 184,000km (114,000 miles).That asteroid, also discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey, was estimated to be between 15m and 30m (50-100ft) in size."
science	The oldest living thing on Earth		"Mayflies live a day, humans live a century, if we're lucky, but what is the oldest living organism on the planet? For scientists, accurately proving the age of any long-lived species is a hard task.Under the boughs of a 300-year-old sweet chestnut tree in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum, confirms that trees are capable of outliving animals.Proving this can involve some traditional detective work, as he explains: ""First of all we can look at previous records, to find out if a tree was growing there at a set date. Then we look at paintings and artwork, to look to see if that tree was present. And old Ordnance Survey maps quite clearly show ancient trees, especially important ones.""A well-known way of measuring the age of a tree is by counting the rings in its trunk: one ring per year of growth. It's a process known as dendrochronology and only works for certain types of tree that have an annual growth spurt.The obvious problem is that counting rings normally involves cutting down the tree.Arboriculturalists get around this by using an increment borer, a drill that allows them to take out a core, and count the rings without fatally damaging the tree.It's a delicate art, and, Tony says, back in the 1960s, one scientist's drill broke off inside the bristlecone pine tree he was sampling.The kit is expensive, and to help him recover the lost instrument, a forester helpfully cut down the tree. Once felled, the tree could be easily aged, and was found to be 5000 years old.""It was terrible but so much science came out of that opportunity, and since then, we've found trees that are as old, if not older,"" admits Tony.A team of researchers in the US keeps a list, called the Old List, of officially dated ancient trees.They've found a sacred fig tree in Sri Lanka that is at least 2,222 years old.There's a Patagonian cypress tree in Chile which, at 3,627 years old, is as old as Stonehenge.A Great Basin bristlecone pine in California's White Mountains named Methuselah comes in at 4,850 years old. But the oldest tree on the list, an unnamed bristlecone pine from the same location, has a core suggesting it is 5,067 years old.This time-worn tree has lived through the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. It was already established when the Ancient Egyptians started building pyramids.We investigated the bristlecone pine tree after William Adams from London asked us: ""What's the oldest tree or other living organism on Earth?"" If you've got a science question you want BBC CrowdScience to look into, get in touch via the form below.If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question.Is this 5,000-year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine the oldest single living thing on the planet? That depends on your definition of a ""single tree"".In Fishlake National Park in Utah in the US lives a quaking aspen tree that most people would struggle to see as ""a tree"".It's a clonal tree called ""Pando"", from the Latin meaning ""I spread"", and for good reason.It is so large that it is easy to mistake for a forest. However, Pando, despite being the size of Vatican City, has all sprung from one seed, and, over the years, has grown a single vast rootstock supporting an estimated 50,000 tree trunks. Accurately estimating how many years is problematic, says population geneticist Prof Karen Mock from Utah State University, who works on the aspen.""There have been all kinds of different estimates but the original tree is almost certainly not there,"" he told the BBC.Clonal trees grow in all directions and regenerate themselves as they go. This means taking a core from a trunk will not give you the age of the whole tree.Scientists try to get around this problem by equating size to age. It's an inaccurate process and Pando's estimated age ranges from a few thousand to 80,000 years old.Prof Mock hopes that a new technique, looking at how many DNA mutations are accumulated over time, could give them another way of assessing the age of this remarkable tree.Take the quizQuiz: What are the oldest living things on Earth?If a tree can live to 80,000 years old, why stop there?Is any organism on Earth immortal? No, according to ageing expert Joao Pedro de Magalhaes from the University of Liverpool.""All organisms can die, so there's no immortal species per se,"" he says.""You do have complex vertebrate species that appear not to age, like the Galapagos tortoise or a cave-dwelling salamander called the olm. I do say 'appear not to age'; we haven't studied any of them for 500 years. It's hard enough to get grants for five-year projects,"" he jokes.How long you live depends partly on your place in the world; your ecological niche.The organisms at the top of the food chain have very few predators, so are likely to live longer and to pass down that trait through generations.Cold weather also plays a part: Antarctic glass sponges take the title of 'oldest living animal', with an estimated life span of 15,000 years.""We don't know for sure,"" says Dr Magalhaes, ""because, of course, nobody was there to check them 15,000 years ago.""The estimates are prone to error but according to Dr Magalhaes, sponges in Antarctica do grow very slowly because of the cold, which fits the model of slow-growing creatures having longer life spans.However, the oldest, precisely measured organism living on Earth today remains, for now, a Great Basin Bristlecone pine tree. Pando the quaking aspen and Antarctic glass sponges could be much older but their ages are assumed from indirect measurements and educated guesswork.Tantalisingly, Prof Mock and Tony Kirkham agree that there's still more to hunt for; the actual oldest living organism on the planet almost certainly has not yet been found."
science	Earth-i plans space video network		"A British company has announced its intention to launch a big constellation of Earth observation satellites.A prototype spacecraft will go up later this year for testing, with the expectation that a further five platforms will follow in 2019.Earth-i, based in Guildford, says its train of satellites will deliver rapid, high-resolution imagery of the planet in still and video formats.At best resolution, these products will see features just under a metre across.The video is promised in full colour. It could be used to track moving objects such as cars and other vehicles; or, if the scene is held fixed on a specific point, it would enable 3D models of the ground to be constructed.Earth-i is already well established in the analytics business, processing and selling space pictures to a strong customer base. But this move, announced on the opening day of the biennial UK space conference in Manchester, would see the company operate its own satellites as well.These platforms are the fruit of an R&D project coming out of Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), also in Guildford.The manufacturer has developed a new class of Earth observation spacecraft codenamed Carbonite.The first in this series was built in just six months and was launched in 2015. The lessons learned from that experience were then applied to a second satellite which is now set to be the pathfinder in the Earth-i constellation.""We worked on Carbonite-1 with SSTL and studied the performance to help develop the technology for Carbonite-2 which we will be calling EiX2,"" explained Richard Blain, the CEO of Earth-i.""As for the constellation, we will launch that in batches of five. And in terms of the architecture, our baseline plan is for the first batch to go into one orbital plane, and then for the following batches to go into different planes, so that not only do we get high-frequency revisit to places on Earth but we also get to see places at different times of the day.""The total number of satellites in the constellation will depend on how the business for the pictures grows.Earth-i is chasing a burgeoning market that is attracting new types of customers who are only now beginning to understand the potential of daily, fast-turn-around imagery.So, for example, whereas governments have long made use of Earth observation (EO) data for mapping towns and cities, to plan major infrastructure ventures and to track land-use changes - the likes of the financial sector is really just beginning to appreciate the intelligence value of space pictures.Those who trade in commodities are now gaining insights on supply chains, and on the activities at particular factories, ports, mines and oil fields; activities that all have financial implications.And just as satellite-navigation data - knowing where things are positioned in the world - has become a mainstay of the smartphone applications revolution, there is a feeling that the exploitation of EO data in this domain has barely scratched the surface.This was part of the motivation for the UK government last year committing more money than any other member state to the Earth observation programme of the European Space Agency (Esa). There are big economic opportunities coming.""There is an almost insatiable demand for data from space as people are realising its true value to both their planning and daily operations,"" said Josef Aschbacher, director of Earth observation at the European Space Agency.""Higher resolution image data from commercial organisations is likely to be very valuable either in its own right or when used in conjunction with other data sources including medium-resolution image data such as that provided under the European Copernicus Programme.""Earth-i's constellation would be the first European system to provide HD video of activity on the ground.Two North American companies have already started doing this - Urthecast of Canada, and US firm Terra Bella (recently acquired by Planet Labs).Earth-i currently exploits the imagery coming from SSTL's DMC3 satellites. The capacity on this trio of spacecraft, which take 1m resolution pictures, is wholly leased by a Chinese concern called 21AT. Earth-i is the Beijing company’s international distributor.Richard Blain would not discuss the detail of the financing of the new constellation but said that a number of contracts were in place with SSTL.""We are a well funded private company with a clear financial roadmap, supported by world class professional advisers and with a number of financial instruments at our disposal in order to ensure the continued successful deployment of our constellation following on from the next prototype satellite due for launch later this year,"" he told BBC News.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	'Oldest plants on Earth' discovered	Tree of life	"The origins of plants may go back hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thought, according to fossil evidence.Ancient rocks from India suggest plants resembling red algae lived 1.6 billion years ago in what was then shallow sea.The discovery may overturn ideas of when relatively advanced life evolved, say scientists in Sweden.They identified parts of chloroplasts, structures within plant cells involved in photosynthesis.The earliest signs of life on Earth are at least 3.5 billion years old.The first single-celled microscopic life forms evolved into larger multi-cellular eukaryotic organisms (made up of cells containing a nucleus and other structures within a membrane).Therese Sallstedt of the Swedish Museum of Natural History discovered some of the fossils. She described them as ""the oldest fossil plants that we know of on Earth in the form of 1.6 billion year old red algae"".""They show us that advanced life in the form of eukaryotes (like plants, fungi and us humans/animals) have a much deeper history on Earth than what we previously have thought,"" she told BBC News.The scientists found thread-like fossils and more complex ""fleshy"" colonies in sedimentary rock from central India. Both have characteristics of modern red algae, a type of seaweed.Other stories you might like to read:Fossil footprints tell human storyFossilised berry clue to plant evolutionEarliest known croc eggs discoveredCo-researcher Prof Stefan Bengtson of the Swedish Museum of Natural History added: ""You cannot be 100% sure about material this ancient, as there is no DNA remaining, but the characters agree quite well with the morphology and structure of red algae.""The oldest known red algae before the present discovery date back 1.2 billion years. The Indian fossils are 400 million years older, suggesting that the early branches of the tree of life began much earlier than previously thought.Claims of ancient life are always controversial. Without DNA evidence, confirmation must rest on whether more fossils can be found.There is also debate over whether red algae belong in the plant kingdom or in a class of their own.Modern red algae is perhaps best known for two commercial products - gelatinous texturing agents used in making ice cream - and nori - the seaweed used to wrap sushi.The research is published in the journal, PLOS Biology.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Nasa's IceSat space laser tracks water depths from orbit		"Scientists say one of the US space agency's (Nasa) new Earth observers is going to have a transformative impact in an unexpected area.The IceSat-2 laser mission was launched a year ago to measure the shape of Antarctica and Greenland, and to track the thickness of Arctic sea-ice.But early results show a remarkable capability also to sense water depths.IceSat's laser light penetrates up to 40m in the clearest conditions, opening up a raft of new applications.""As much as people think all areas on Earth have been reasonably well mapped, it's really not true when you start looking at shallow water areas,"" said Dr Christopher Parrish from Oregon State University.""We've got huge data voids from the shoreline out to about 5m water depth.""This hinders our ability to study things like inundation, the effects of major storms, and the changes to coral reef habitat.""A project has already started to map the seafloor around low-lying Pacific islands and atolls, which will assist tsunami preparedness for example.The capability should also enable scientists to work out the volumes of inland water bodies to help quantify Earth's global freshwater reserves.IceSat-2 was launched in September 2018 with just the single instrument - a half-tonne green laser called Atlas that fires about 10,000 pulses of light every second.Each of those shots goes down to the Earth and bounces back up on a timescale of just a few milliseconds. The exact time equates to the height of the reflecting surface.Scientists knew they could use this optical ""tape measure"" to look for elevation changes in Antarctica and Greenland that might indicate melting.Assessing forests was also part of the mission objectives because the laser will reflect off canopies to reveal tree heights.But quite so prominent a role for bathymetry (the mapping of underwater topography) was not expected.""Before launching IceSat-2 we flew an aircraft instrument called Mable, which had a lot of the same measurement characteristics, and we did see some bathymetry but only down to a couple of metres,"" recalled Nasa's Tom Neumann.""So before launch when people asked me about what IceSat-2 could achieve I said 'let's wait and see'.""But the optics in Atlas have better efficiency than the specifications; we've exceeded the performance requirements. And so folks like the US Coast Guard and the US Geological Survey are interested in the data because you now have the ability to measure near-coastal bathymetry, essentially worldwide.""There are obvious limitations. The more turbid the water, the more difficult it is to get a laser reflection from the seafloor. And, of course, this kind of laser technique is of no use in the open ocean where depths can reach 6km or more.Also, because the satellite is geared towards polar mapping, its orbital path means mid- and low-latitude regions of the Earth are sampled less frequently.But it's not necessary to have completely full coverage across an area. That's because one IceSat track through a scene can be used to calibrate other information.""What people are doing is using visual imagery from other satellites which will give you a relative depth,"" explained Dr Neumann.""So the deeper the blue colour, the deeper the depth; the lighter the blue, the shallower it is. And then you combine that with an IceSat track and that gives an absolute measurement across that scene.""In the Antarctic and the Arctic, this is being used to look at meltponds - the large bodies of meltwater that form on ice surfaces in the warmer temperatures of Summer.The volumes involved can be prodigious and can affect the stability of the ice - if that water drains through the ice - either speeding its flow to the ocean or, in some cases, helping to break it apart. With IceSat-2 scientists can now say more precisely how much water is sitting on top of the ice.Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography has been testing this approach over the Amery Ice Shelf, the third largest ice shelf in Antarctica.She sees it as another variable to monitor climate change at the poles.""It's important to keep track of how much surface meltwater is being produced every year. The other thing to keep track of is the timing - when the melting starts and when the meltwater refreezes at the end of the season. Also the locations of meltponds: are they changing? Are they moving further north with time?""To mark the one-year anniversary of IceSat-2 launch, mission scientists have published a review of achievements to date in Eos, the weekly magazine of the American Geophysical Union.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	'Gibraltar-sized' space rock passes Earth		A large asteroid the size of the Rock of Gibraltar has passed safely by Earth.The object, measured to be almost a kilometre wide, came within five times the distance between the Earth and the Moon.Known as 2014 JO25, the asteroid is the biggest such space rock to skim our world since 2004.Astronomers say the best opportunity to view the rock will come in the dark hours of Wednesday night.Radar imagery using Nasa's 70m (230 ft) antenna at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California reveal a peanut-shaped asteroid that rotates about once every five hours.The asteroid passed Earth at a distance of 1.8 million km (1.1 million miles) at 13:24 BST on Wednesday, 19 April.The next known encounter of an asteroid of about this size will occur in 2027 when the 800m-wide (half-mile-wide) asteroid 1999 AN10 will fly by at one lunar distance, about 380,000 km (236,000 miles).
science	Space view of Earth's magnetic rocks		"It is the best depiction yet of the magnetism retained in Earth's rocks, as viewed from space.The map was constructed using data from Europe’s current Swarm mission, combined with legacy information from a forerunner satellite called Champ.Variations as small as 250km across are detectable.Clearly seen are the ""stripes"" of magnetism moving away from mid-ocean ridges - the places on the planet where new crust is constantly produced.This pattern - the consequence of periodic changes in Earth's polarity being locked into the minerals of cooling volcanic rock - was one of the key pieces of evidence for the theory of plate tectonics.On land, the signal tends to reflect the composition and thickness of the different rock layers that make up the continents.Generally speaking, younger crust will be thinner and have a low content in magnetic minerals. Whereas, the old cratons, those stable interior sections of continents, will tend to be thicker and have a higher magnetic mineral content.Detecting any of this from orbit is a challenge because the signals are dwarfed by that part of the global magnetic field coming from the dynamo - the movement of liquid iron in the Earth's outer core.Stand on the surface of the planet and the intensity of the global field may be between 25,000 and 65,000 nanoTeslas (a fridge magnet is a thousand times stronger).""Again it depends where you are but the lithospheric signal is well below 100nT, even 50nT, on average,"" explained Nils Olsen from the Technical University of Denmark and one of the scientists who created the new space map.""But we have certain regions where it can reach up to 2,000nT, and one of these regions is the Bangui anomaly in western Africa,"" he told BBC News.This sharp signal in the Central African Republic is the possible impact site of a large iron asteroid more than 500 million years ago.Another high intensity region in the crust is the famous Kursk anomaly in central Russia where substantial reserves of iron ore have been mined.The German Champ spacecraft measured Earth's magnetic field from orbit between 2000 and 2010.It was succeeded in 2013 by the Swarm trio of satellites operated by the European Space Agency (Esa).Champ was lower in the sky than Swarm is currently, and so found it easier to detect the lithospheric magnetism. However, the sophistication of the new mission and the subtle differences the newer satellites can sense in side-by-side observations mean further detail still can be extracted from the data.Champ alone was getting a resolution of 300-330km, so the combined model is a big step forward.Our very best global view of crustal magnetism is the World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map (WDMAM), which was put together by scientists over many years, and includes much high-resolution aero- and ship-borne measurements.But the WDMAM would be very patchy if it did not also include space data, said Mike Purucker from the US space agency.""The World Digital Magnetic Anomaly Map is a 5km grid at 5km altitude around the world. The longwave component is provided by satellite observations and the shorter wavelengths by aero and marine surveys.""[The satellite data] defines better the magnetic field under the auroral ovals where it has been very difficult to separate internal from external fields,"" he told the BBC.Future versions of the WDMAM will now make use of the updated Champ/Swarm view.Having maps of crustal magnetism is important for investigating the geological history of Earth and for understanding the distribution of commercially important mineral resources, says Kathy Whaler from Edinburgh University, UK.""[The new Swarm/Champ] model should mean estimates to the depth at which magnetisation is lost are better.""Our assumption is this is where the temperature reaches the Curie point. There has previously been a suggestion that this is deeper in some subduction regions, as well as possibly over old, thick, stable cratons, for example.""We should be able to estimate these depths as a function of position on the surface more accurately, and thereby understand some of the large-scale tectonics better.""Swarm itself is trying to provide greater insights on all of the different contributors to the global magnetic field.As well as the rocks and that dominant signal coming from the swirling convection of molten iron in the core, there are other inputs pulling on the needle of every compass.These include the magnetism generated by electric fields high above the Earth, and even a very subtle effect derived from the movement of salt water ocean currents.Long-term observations will tease apart the size of each contribution and how it varies through time.""The Bravo satellite is still at slightly above 500km and the Alpha and Charlie satellites are at 443km, roughly. So we are still at a good altitude,” said Esa's Swarm mission manager, Rune Floberghagen.“Considering the fuel situation, we are set for a very, very long mission - far beyond the upcoming solar minimum and following solar maximum, and perhaps even up to the solar minimum after that.""This would mean at least one Swarm satellite still working in 2031.It is a fascinating prospect because one key to understanding Earth's magnetic field is seeing how it interacts with the magnetic fields and particle matter emanating from the Sun over its 11-year cycle of activity.The new lithospheric magnetic field map was presented on Tuesday at an Esa Swarm science meeting in Banff, Canada."
science	Hawking says Trump's climate stance could damage Earth	'Great danger'	"Stephen Hawking says that US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement could lead to irreversible climate change.Prof Hawking said the action could put Earth onto a path that turns it into a hothouse planet like Venus.He also feared aggression was ""inbuilt"" in humans and that our best hope of survival was to live on other planets.The Cambridge professor spoke exclusively to BBC News to coincide with his 75th birthday celebrations.Arguably the world's most famous scientist, Prof Hawking has had motor neurone disease for most of his adult life. It has impaired his movement and ability to speak.Yet through it all, he emerged as one of the greatest minds of our time. His theories on black holes and the origin of the Universe have transformed our understanding of the cosmos.Prof Hawking has also inspired generations to study science. But through his media appearances what has been most impressive of all has been his humanity.His main concern during his latest interview was the future of our species. A particular worry was President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement to reduce CO2 levels.What is climate change?What is in the Paris climate agreement?""We are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid,"" he told BBC News.""Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it's one we can prevent if we act now. By denying the evidence for climate change, and pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, Donald Trump will cause avoidable environmental damage to our beautiful planet, endangering the natural world, for us and our children.""The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also highlights the potential risk of hitting climate tipping points as temperatures increase - though there are gaps in our knowledge of this topic.In its Fifth Assessment Report, the IPCC authors wrote: ""The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger tipping points (thresholds for abrupt and irreversible change) remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points in the Earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature.""When asked whether he felt we would ever solve our environmental problems and resolve human conflicts, Prof Hawking was pessimistic, saying that he thought our days on Earth were numbered.""I fear evolution has inbuilt greed and aggression to the human genome. There is no sign of conflict lessening, and the development of militarised technology and weapons of mass destruction could make that disastrous.

science	Plate tectonics: When we discovered how the Earth really works		"What would you put on your list of the great scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century?General relativity? Quantum mechanics? Something to do with genetics, perhaps?One discovery that ought to be on everyone's rundown is plate tectonics - the description of how the rigid outer shell of our planet (its lithosphere) moves and is recycled.The theory celebrates its 50th anniversary this year and some of the key players who put the framework together are currently in London to mark the occasion with a special conference at The Geological Society.The truly great ideas in science not only seem brilliantly simple and intuitive when they come into focus, they also then have this extraordinary power to answer so many other questions in Nature.Plate tectonics is a perfect example of this.It tells us why the Himalayas are so tall; why Mexico experiences damaging earthquakes; why Australia developed a diverse group of marsupials; and why Antarctica went into a deep freeze.But when you're on the inside of the bubble, trying to make all the pieces of evidence fit into a coherent narrative - the solution seems very far from obvious.""We had no idea what were the cause of earthquakes and volcanoes and things like that,"" recalls Dan McKenzie. ""It's extraordinarily difficult now to put yourself back into the state of mind that we had when I was an undergraduate. And of course, the ideas I came up with are now taught in primary school.""McKenzie is regarded as one of the architects of modern plate tectonics theory.In 1967, he published a paper in the journal Nature called ""The North Pacific: An Example of Tectonics on a Sphere"" with Robert Parker, another Cambridge University graduate.It drew on a rash of post-war discoveries to paint a compelling picture of how the sea floor in that part of the globe was able to move, much like a curved paving stone, initiating earthquakes where it interacted with the other great slabs of solid rock covering the Earth.Although seen as an ""aha!"" moment, it was actually a long run-up to that point with a group of committed scientists all sprinting and dipping for the line in 1966/67/68.The story goes back to 1915 to Alfred Wegener, the German polar explorer and meteorologist, who we most associate with the idea of continental drift.Wegener could see that the continents were not static, that they must have shifted over time, and that the coastlines of South America and Africa looked a suspiciously snug fit, as if they were once joined together. But he couldn't devise a convincing mechanism to drive the motion.Things really had to wait for WWII and the technologies it spawned, such as echosounders and magnetometers. Developed to hunt down submarines and to find mines, these capabilities were put to work in peacetime to investigate the properties of the sea floor. And it was these investigations that revealed how plates are made at mid-ocean ridges and destroyed at their margins where they underthrust the continents.“Plate tectonics really comes from the oceans. It was when we discovered the oceanic ridges, subduction zones and transform faults, and so forth,” said John Dewey from Oxford University, another of those sprinting scientists. “In the sixties, there was this massively increased knowledge through oceanographic expeditions.""Until that time we’d been looking down microscopes at thin sections of rock, looking at faults and outcrops on land. And every now and then we’d be lucky enough to find some component of plate tectonics, but we didn’t know it was plate tectonics because we didn’t have the oceans. Without the oceans, you have nothing,"" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme.One of the key observations was that of sea-floor spreading - the process that creates new crust at the ridges from upwelling magma.As the rock cools and moves away from a ridge, it locks into its minerals the direction of Earth's magnetic field. And as the field reverses, as it does every few hundred thousand years, so does the polarity in the rocks, presenting a zebra-like, striped pattern to traversing research ships and their magnetometers.In 1967, all roads led to the spring meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Some 70 abstracts (summaries of research) were submitted on sea-floor spreading alone. A heady time, it must have been.The coherent narrative of plate tectonics was about to fall rapidly into place. McKenzie's paper was published in December that year. Concurrently, other researchers were extending the model to describe all the other plates.As to the mechanism that eluded Wegener, scientists can now see how the weight of underthrusting plates plays such a major role in driving the whole system.Much as the slinky dog needs no encouragement once it has started its journey downstairs, so the descending rock appears to have an unstoppable momentum.Tony Watts, an Oxford geologist and a convener of this week's Plate Tectonics at 50 conference, explains: “We know that the fastest moving plates, the ones spreading the fastest, have very long slabs, long pieces of lithosphere, that are going under at ocean trenches.""So, it looks as though something called ’trench pull’ is a very important force and it’s generally agreed to be larger than 'ridge push'. Of course, everything is connected in the deep mantle through convection, but trench pull does seem to be key.""Nothing is ever done and dusted in science. There is still a lively debate for example about precisely when and how plate tectonics got going on Earth. More than four billion years ago as the result of asteroid impacts, argued one recent Nature Geoscience paper.Today, we have extraordinary tools such as GPS and satellite radar interferometry that allow us to watch the march of the plates, millimetre by millimetre. Even more remarkable is the technique of seismic tomography, which uses the signals of earthquakes to build 3D visualisations of sunken rock slabs.""Plate tectonics was a revolution. I’m a geologist, so I would say that,"" Tony Watts told BBC News.""Looking back, the history of geology is very long. The Geological Society was founded in 1807, so plate tectonics came really late in its history. But it needed the right technologies and a relatively small group of scientists from strongly led institutions to make it happen.""The other thing to remember is how young some of these scientists were: Dan McKenzie had only just finished his PhD thesis.""The Geological Society has set up a website that archives many resources related to Dan McKenzie and the theory of plate tectonics.

science	Florence: Largest asteroid in century to safely fly by Earth		"The largest asteroid in more than a century is set to pass by Earth at a relatively close distance of 4.4 million miles (7 million km), Nasa says.Florence measures 2.7 miles (4.4km) in diameter and will not pose a threat to Earth for centuries to come.While other asteroids have passed closer to Earth, they were all estimated to be smaller.Asteroids are the rubble left over from the formation of the Sun and planets.At its closest point, Florence - which was discovered in 1981 - will be at about 18 times the average distance between the Earth and the Moon.""Florence is the largest asteroid to pass by our planet this close since the [American space agency] Nasa program to detect and track near-Earth asteroids began,"" Paul Chodas, manager of Nasa's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said in a statement.The 2017 encounter is the closest by this asteroid since 1890 and the closest it will ever be until after 2500, the US space agency added.Scientists plan to study the asteroid up close, using ground-based radar imaging in California and Puerto Rico.Amateur astronomers will also be tracking it, says Sky and Telescope Magazine.The rock is relatively easy to see with good observing equipment, not just because it is large but also because it reflects more than 20% of the sunlight that hits its surface. The Moon in contrast has an average reflectivity of just 12%.An object of Florence's size would have global effects were it to hit the Earth. Scientists believe they have now identified more than 90% of such monster rocks moving through space near our planet."
science	Sentinel satellite launched to picture Planet Earth	Using Sentinel-2 data to make maps	"One of the key spacecraft in Europe's new multi-billion-euro Earth observation programme has launched from French Guiana.Sentinel-2B carries a large camera to image all land surfaces and coastal waters in visible and infrared light.It joins an identical spacecraft, Sentinel-2A, already in orbit.The duo will be flown on the same path but 180 degrees apart so that they can provide a complete map of Earth - clouds permitting - every five days.The Sentinels constitute the space segment of the European Union's Copernicus environmental monitoring programme.A suite of sensors is being lofted over the next few years to gather critical information on the state of the planet and to acquire the data needed to inform and enforce EU policies.Applications range from urban planning and air-quality monitoring to tracking deforestation and glacier retreat.Sentinels 2A and 2B are, in many senses, the centrepiece of this effort because their free and open picture resource will almost certainly find the widest use.""To say they are the 'heartbeat' is a good way to describe them because they take the images that are most easily understandable,"" Josef Aschbacher, the director of Earth observation at the European Space Agency (Esa), told BBC News.The lift-off aboard a Vega rocket occurred on cue at 22:49 local time, Monday (01:49 GMT, 02:49 CET, Tuesday).Ejection of the satellite happened about an hour later, close to 775km above the Earth.Controllers in Darmstadt, Germany, were waiting to pick up a signal and begin early operations.""We will slowly acquire the reference orbit (786km altitude) over the next two weeks,"" explained Bianca Hoersch, Esa's mission manager for the Sentinel-2 spacecraft.""Then we have the commissioning phase; that takes us to early June. At that point we should be producing lots of data, and after a short ramp-up, around the October timeframe, we should be in full constellation readiness.""The colour cameras on the Sentinel-2 pair are designed to see features as small as 10m across.Sensitive to 13 bands of light, the instruments will observe a range of properties in the things they see, allowing for example the distinction to be made between different types of crops and for an assessment to be made about their health.Together, they will be producing something like four terabytes of data daily. It is a prodigious volume that will lean on the assistance of a laser relay link.For a 10-minute spell on each orbit, the spacecraft will each fire their images not down to Earth but higher into the sky, to a geostationary satellite that will then bounce them to the ground.Thousands of users have registered to have access to the pictures. Downloading them from the various distributed servers has been made easier by chopping the ""scenes"" up into more manageable chunks.""With Sentinel-1A, we had at the beginning huge products that were 8GB to 9GB per file, which were really hard to access and download,"" said Dr Hoersch.""In September, we switched to single tiles, a product of 100km by 100km, and I think that has led to an explosion in data access. We've had 2.7 million products downloaded in the last two months.""Sentinels are designed to fly in pairs to shorten the revisit time to any one point on Earth.Sentinel 1 is a radar platform and has had its duo fully operational in orbit since last year. Sentinel 2 is the next to complete its pairing; Sentinel 3, which carries predominantly ocean sensors, should have an orbiting pair aloft come next year.Sentinels 4 and 5, which study the atmosphere, and Sentinel 6, to measure ocean height, have no presence in orbit yet.But even though the programme is still to complete its initial roll-out, the EU and Esa have already begun to discuss how to extend it.In this future-scoping, Sentinel 7 is envisaged to be a constellation of satellites that monitors carbon dioxide; Sentinel 8 could be a thermal infrared sensor, useful for understanding phenomena such as drought; and Sentinel 9 might be a polar mission, either to study the extent and thickness of ice surfaces or to provide better weather imaging and communications at high latitudes.""But I should stress that all these candidate missions are a work in progress and will have to be consolidated through an extensive consultation process, both on the user side and on the technical side,"" said Dr Aschbacher.""And we also have to put together a whole scheme, not just on content but but also in terms of cost and funding.""The European-funded Sentinel seriesWhat is the Copernicus programme?Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	European SolO probe ready to take on audacious mission		"The European spacecraft that aims to take the closest ever pictures of the Sun is built and ready for launch.The Solar Orbiter, or SolO, probe will put itself inside the orbit of Planet Mercury to train its telescopes on the surface of our star.Other instruments will sense the constant outflow of particles and their embedded magnetic fields.Scientists hope the detailed observations can help them understand better what drives the Sun's activity.This goes up and down on an 11-year cycle. It's sure to be a fascinating endeavour but it's one that has direct relevance to everyone on Earth.The energetic outbursts from our star have the ability to damage satellites, harm astronauts, degrade radio communications, and even knock power grids offline.""We're doing this not just for the sake of increasing our knowledge but also for being able to take precautions, for example by putting satellites in safe mode when we know big solar storms are coming or letting astronauts not leave the space station on these days,"" said Daniel Müller, the European Space Agency (Esa) project scientist on SolO.The probe was assembled in Stevenage, UK, by Airbus (Britain has invested €220m in the €1.5bn project), with the past year spent here at the IABG facility in Ottobrunn, Germany, for testing.The spacecraft has cleared its checks and will now ship out to Florida to be mated with the United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket that will hurl it towards the Sun in early February.SolO was first conceived in the late 1990s with the industrial contract to produce it awarded in 2012.A key challenge has been to mature technologies that can protect a probe that flies to within 43 million km of our star.Temperatures at this proximity will get up to 600 degrees.SolO's plan to survive these conditions involves hiding behind a large titanium shield, and cooling itself with a complex series of radiators.Sophisticated fault-recovery systems will also ensure SolO stays out of trouble.""If we de-point, we very quickly run into difficulty thermally,"" explained Airbus project manager Ian Walters.""Our requirement is to make sure we recover under any failure scenario within 50 seconds and actually our spacecraft will go back to normal pointing in 22 seconds, all autonomously.""But the probe still needs to observe the star and to do that it must use peepholes in the shield.These will briefly open to allow the telescopes to grab their observations before closing shut again.The pictures and movies that come back will be unprecedented in their fine resolution.Features as small as 70km across will be visible.""It's amazing; every time we get better resolution we see more and more,"" said Holly Gilbert, the US space agency's deputy project scientist on the mission.""The interactions between the Sun's plasma (energetic gas) and its magnetic field are incredibly dynamic, not just on the large scales but on the very, very small scales.""When the magnetic fields interact in a very explosive process called reconnection - that's a very small region.""And to see how that leads to eruptions, we need to see the small stuff that's happening.""One of the major differences between this mission and all previous such ventures is that SolO will get to take the first close-up images of our star's polar regions.The high latitudes are known to be significant locations for magnetic behaviour and the generation of the fastest outflows of particles.""We've never seen the solar poles directly because from Earth we just have a very grazing view,"" said Frédéric Auchère, a mission principal investigator from the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, Orsay, France.""But these regions are very important because they are the source of the very fast solar wind and we also know that in the solar interior things are happening at the poles that may be the key to understanding solar activity and the solar cycle.""SolO will be following the American Parker Solar Probe, which launched to space last year.The pair share many of the same scientific goals and even the same kinds of instruments, although only SolO will look directly at the Sun.Parker can't do that because it's venturing even closer to the star, a mere 6 million km at closest approach.It uses just in-situ sensors, to sample for example the particles flowing over it. But scientists believe the duo when in the right position will make a powerful team in observing processes that initiate close in to the Sun but then propagate outwards.""There are so many ways we can combine these spacecraft to get incredible science.

science	Earliest evidence of life on Earth 'found'		"Scientists have discovered what they say could be fossils of some of the earliest living organisms on Earth.They are represented by tiny filaments, knobs and tubes in Canadian rocks dated to be up to 4.28 billion years old.That is a time not long after the planet's formation and hundreds of millions of years before what is currently accepted as evidence for the most ancient life yet found on Earth.The researchers report their investigation in the journal Nature.As with all such claims about ancient life, the study is contentious. But the team believes it can answer any doubts.The scientists' putative microbes from Quebec are one-tenth the width of a human hair and contain significant quantities of haematite - a form of iron oxide or ""rust"".Matthew Dodd, who analysed the structures at University College London, UK, claimed the discovery would shed new light on the origins of life.""This discovery answers the biggest questions mankind has asked itself - which are: where do we come from and why we are here?""It is very humbling to have the oldest known lifeforms in your hands and being able to look at them and analyse them,"" he told BBC News.The fossil structures were encased in quartz layers in the so-called Nuvvuagittuq Supracrustal Belt (NSB).The NSB is a chunk of ancient ocean floor. It contains some of the oldest volcanic and sedimentary rocks known to science.The team looked at sections of rock that were likely laid down in a system of hydrothermal vents - fissures on the seabed from which heated, mineral-rich waters spew up from below.Today, such vents are known to be important habitats for microbes. And Dr Dominic Papineau, also from UCL, who discovered the fossils in Quebec, thinks this kind of setting was very probably also the cradle for lifeforms between 3.77 and 4.28 billion years ago (the upper and lower age estimates for the NSB rocks).He described how he felt when he realised the significance of the material on which he was working: ""I thought to myself 'we've got it, we've got the oldest fossils on the planet'.""It relates to our origins. For intelligent life to evolve to a level of consciousness, to a point where it traces back its history to understand its own origin - that's inspirational.""Any claim for the earliest life on Earth attracts scepticism. That is understandable. It is often hard to prove that certain structures could not also have been produced by non-biological processes.In addition, analysis is complicated because the rocks in question have often undergone alteration.The NSB, for example, has been squeezed and heated through geological timeAt present, perhaps the oldest acknowledged evidence of life on the planet is found in 3.48-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.This material is said to show remnants of stromatolites - mounds of sediment formed of mineral grains glued together by ancient bacteria.An even older claim for stromatolite traces was made in August last year. The team behind that finding said their fossil evidence was 3.70 billion years old.Nonetheless, the UCL researchers and their colleagues say they have worked extremely hard to demonstrate the greater antiquity for their structures.Dr Papineau does concede though that the idea of metabolising micro-organisms using oxygen so soon after the Earth's formation will surprise many geologists.""They would not consider that there were organisms breathing oxygen at this time. It brings back the production of oxygen on the Earth's surface, albeit by tiny amounts, to the beginning of the sedimentary record,"" he said.Prof Nicola McLoughlin from Rhodes University, South Africa, was not connected with the research.She commended the scholarship but felt the data presented by the UCL-led team fell short.""The morphology of these argued iron-oxidising filaments from Northern Canada is not convincing,"" she told BBC News.""In recent deposits we see spectacular twisted stalks, often arranged in layers, but in the highly metamorphosed rocks of the Nuvvuagittuq belt the filaments are much simpler in shape.""The associated textural and geochemical evidence of graphite in carbonate rosettes and magnetite-haematite granules is careful work, but provides only suggestive evidence for microbial activity; it does not strengthen the case for the biogenicity of the filaments.""She also said the maximum age of the rocks had proven to be very controversial, and that the true age was more likely to be closer to the 3.77-billion-year age.Part of the interest in ancient life is in the implication it has for organisms elsewhere in the Solar System.""These (NTB) organisms come from a time when we believe Mars had liquid water on its surface and a similar atmosphere to Earth at that time,"" said Mr Dodd.""So, if we have lifeforms originating and evolving on Earth at this time then we may very well have had life beginning on Mars.""If that is the case then, according to Dr Papineau, recent Nasa rover missions to the Martian surface may have been looking for signs of life in the wrong places.He said that the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), Spirit and Opportunity, and the more recent Curiosity robot mission had overlooked areas that might have had rocks produced by hydrothermal vents.""On the surface of Mars there have been missed opportunities. The MER Opportunity in 2003 found promising formations but there was no analysis. And the Spirit rover went straight past another near the Comanche outcrop in Gusev crater.""The suggestion that life had already arisen ""just"" a few hundred million years after the Earth had formed is intriguing in light of debates about whether life on Earth was a rare accident or whether biology is a common outcome given the right conditions.Follow Pallab on Twitter."
science	Star's seven Earth-sized worlds set record	Analysis - David Shukman, BBC Science Editor	"Astronomers have detected a record seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a single star.The researchers say that all seven could potentially support liquid water on the surface, depending on the other properties of those planets.But only three are within the conventional ""habitable"" zone where life is considered a possibility.The compact system of exoplanets orbits Trappist-1, a low-mass, cool star located 40 light-years away from Earth.The planets, detected using Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope and several ground-based observatories, are described in the journal Nature.Where should we look for alien life?Lead author Michaël Gillon, from Belgium's University of Liège, said: ""The planets are all close to each other and very close to the star, which is very reminiscent of the moons around Jupiter.""""Still, the star is so small and cold that the seven planets are temperate, which means that they could have some liquid water - and maybe life, by extension - on the surface.""Co-author Amaury Triaud, from the University of Cambridge, UK, said the team had introduced the ""temperate"" definition to broaden perceptions about habitability.Are Earth-like planets actually like Earth?Three of the Trappist-1 planets fall within the traditional habitable zone definition, where surface temperatures could support the presence of liquid water - given sufficient atmospheric pressure.But Dr Triaud said that if the planet furthest from the parent star, Trappist-1h, had an atmosphere that efficiently trapped heat - a bit more like Venus's atmosphere than Earth's - it might be habitable.""It would be disappointing if Earth represents the only template for habitability in the Universe,"" he told the BBC News website.So many planets have been discovered in planetary systems beyond our own that it's easy to become inured to their potential significance. Nasa's latest tally is an impressive 3,449 and there's a danger of hype with each new announcement.But the excitement around this latest discovery is not only because of its unusual scale or the fact that so many of the planets are Earth-sized. It is also because the star Trappist-1 is conveniently small and dim. This means that telescopes studying the planets are not dazzled as they would be when aiming at far brighter stars.In turn that opens up a fascinating avenue of research into these distant worlds and, above all, their atmospheres.The next phase of research has already started to hunt for key gases like oxygen and methane which could provide evidence about whatever is happening on the surface.Coverage of exoplanets can far too easily leap to conclusions about alien life. But this remote planetary system does provide a good chance to look for clues about it.The six inner planets have orbital periods that are organised in a ""near-resonant chain"". This means that in the time that it takes for the innermost planet to make eight orbits, the second, third and fourth planets revolve five, three and two times around the star, respectively.This appears to be an outcome of interactions early in the evolution of the planetary system.The astronomers say it should be possible to study the planets' atmospheric properties with telescopes.""The James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble's successor, will have the possibility to detect the signature of ozone if this molecule is present in the atmosphere of one of these planets,"" said co-author Prof Brice-Olivier Demory, from the University of Bern in Switzerland.""This could be an indicator for biological activity on the planet.""But the astrophysicist also warns that we must remain extremely careful about inferring biological activity from afar.Some of the properties of cool, low mass stars could make life a more challenging prospect. For example, some are known to emit large amounts of radiation in the form of flares, which has the potential to sterilise the surfaces of nearby planets.In addition, the habitable zone is located closer to the star so that planets receive the heating necessary for liquid water to persist. But this causes a phenomenon called tidal locking, so that planets always show the same face to their star.This might have the effect of making one side of the planet hot, and the other cold.But Amaury Triaud said UV light might be vital for producing the chemical compounds that can later be assembled into biological systems. Similarly, if life emerges on the permanent night side of a tidally locked planet, it might be sheltered from any flares.But he said the Trappist-1 star was not particularly active, something it has in common with other ""ultra cool dwarfs"" the team has surveyed.""It is fair to say there is much we don't know. Where I am hopeful is that we will know if flares are important, we will know if tidal locking is relevant to habitability and maybe to the emergence of biology,"" he explained.""Many of the arguments in favour or disfavour of habitability can be flipped in that way. First and foremost we need observations.""In addition to the Spitzer observations, astronomers gathered data using Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Liverpool Telescope in La Palma, Spain, and others.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Sentinels map Earth's slow surface warping		"British researchers are now routinely mapping a great swathe of Earth's surface, looking for the subtle warping that ultimately leads to quakes.The team is processing satellite images to show how rocks in a belt that stretches from Europe's Alps to China are slowly accumulating strain.Movements on the scale of just millimetres per year are being sought.The new maps are being made available to help researchers produce more robust assessments of seismic hazard.The kind of change they are trying to chart is not noticeable in the everyday human sense, but over time will put faults under such pressure that they eventually rupture - often with catastrophic consequences.""We may well discover regions that have very small strain rates that we have not been able to detect before,"" said Dr Richard Walters.""And that may well tell us that earthquakes are more likely in some areas that traditionally have been thought of as being completely stable and not at risk of having earthquakes at all.""Dr Walters is affiliated to the UK Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET).He announced the start of the new service here in San Francisco, at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.Key to the UK scientists' work is the high performance of the EU's new Sentinel-1 radar satellites.This pair of spacecraft repeatedly and rapidly image the surface of the globe, throwing their data to the ground using a high-speed laser link. And by comparing whole stacks of their pictures in a technique known as interferometry, the COMET group can begin to see the very slow bending and buckling that occurs in the crust as a result of shifting tectonic plates.To initiate the service, the researchers are concentrating on the Alpine-Himalayan seismic belt.This is the sector where most of the deaths arising from big earthquakes occur.In time, however, the mapping exercise will be extended to cover all major seismic hazard zones, including the rim of the Pacific basin - the so-called ""ring of fire"", where large tremors are also a regular occurrence.To be really effective, the team's maps need to be sensitive to movements of about 1mm per year over 100km.The system is not quite there yet, but as the Sentinels gather more and more images, the desired standard should be realised.As a proof of principle - and to give an example of what the new system can do - the COMET group showed off its maps of Turkey at AGU.These capture the 20-25mm/year westwards march of the Anatolian plateau relative to Eurasia.The focus of interest is how tectonic strain is building up along the North and East Anatolian Faults - the trigger points for so many damaging quakes in the past.Prof Tim Wright, the director of COMET, said one of the breakthroughs that had made the new service possible was simply the prodigious volumes of data the Sentinel satellite system could now feed to the ground.""To give you an example, in just one year of Sentinel operation there are 156 terabytes of data; whereas the entire 10-year archive of Envisat (a previous European radar satellite) has just 24TB.""And we now process the data from the Sentinels automatically within a few hours of getting it.""Dr Walters added: ""This is a big data project. We've had funding from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council to build a big data-processing facility, to take these data from the European Space Agency, which they provide for free, and make useful geophysical measurements.""We then serve that to the community. We put the data out there not just for us to analyse and think about seismic hazards, but for scientists all over the world to use.""The ""Looking inside the Continents from Space"" project has just sent live a website where all the processed maps can be accessed.COMET is also working on a very similar system that would allow scientists to track the behaviour of volcanoes. The Sentinels will also see their slow developing bulges of magma that may precede eruptions.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: Widespread drying of European peatlands	What are peatlands?Why are peatlands important in climate change?What damages peatlands?	"Peatlands are a natural carbon sink, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and burying it in the soil.In Europe alone, they lock up about five times more carbon than forests.But according to a new study, the continent's peatlands are in such a dry and fragile state, they could go into reverse, releasing rather than absorbing carbon.Scientists say it is more important than ever that we restore and safeguard these boggy landscapes.Researchers examined 31 peatlands across England, Ireland, Scandinavia and continental Europe to assess changes during the last 2,000 years.The study, published in Nature Geoscience, found that most peatlands had become drier during the period 1800-2000 than they had been for the last 600 years.Dr Maarten Blaauw from Queen's University Belfast said peatlands ""have been a great help to our planet"" - they suck carbon out of the atmosphere and store it, which helps to mitigate climate change.This study, however, shows that ""the drying of our bogs appears to have changed this process and the peatlands could now actually be turning into carbon sources - instead of absorbing carbon actually starting to emit it - clearly this is not good news for our planet"".Dr Graeme Swindles from the University of Leeds, who led the study, said it is more important than ever that we safeguard peatlands with effective management and active restoration.""The combined pressure of climate change and human impacts may push these vitally important carbon storing ecosystems into becoming a global source of carbon emissions.""Peatlands are a type of wetland found in almost every country on Earth, from blanket bogs in the UK to swamp forests in Southeast Asia.The term ""peatlands"" refers to the peat soil and the wetland habitat around it.Peat forms over the course of millions of years as waterlogged conditions slow the process of plant decomposition.Natural peatlands across the world store more carbon dioxide (CO2) than all other vegetation types in the world combined.Large amounts of carbon, extracted from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, represent a global carbon store.Countries are encouraged to include peatland restoration in their commitments to global international agreements on climate change, as this can help reduce emissions.Climate change, peat extraction, drainage, burning and conversion to farmland have all exacted a toll on peatlands.About 15% of the world's peatlands - covering less than 0.4% of the global land surface - have been drained, releasing greenhouse gases into the air, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Atmosphere found around Earth-sized planet GJ 1132b		"Scientists say they have detected an atmosphere around an Earth-sized planet for the first time.They have studied a world known as GJ 1132b, which is 1.4-times the size of our planet and lies 39 light years away.Their observations suggest that the ""super-Earth"" is cloaked in a thick layer of gases that are either water or methane or a mixture of both.The study is published in the Astronomical Journal.Discovering an atmosphere, and characterising it, is an important step forward in the hunt for life beyond our Solar System.But it is highly unlikely that this world is habitable: it has a surface temperature of 370C.Dr John Southworth, the lead researcher from Keele University, said: ""To my knowledge the hottest temperature that life has been able to survive on Earth is 120C and that's far cooler than this planet.""Chemical signaturesThe discovery of planet GJ 1132b was first announced in 2015. It lies in the Vela constellation in the southern hemisphere.While it is a similar size to Earth, the star it orbits is much smaller, cooler and dimmer than our Sun.Using a telescope at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, the researchers were able to study the planet by watching how it blocked some of the light of its host star as it passed in front of it.""It makes the star look a little bit fainter - and it's actually a very good way of finding transiting planets - it's how this one was found,"" said Dr Southworth.But different molecules in a planet's atmosphere - if it has one - absorb light in different ways, allowing scientists to look for their chemical signatures when the world transits its star.The observations of planet GJ 1132b suggest that it has a thick atmosphere containing either steam and/or methane.""One possibility is that it is a 'water world' with an atmosphere of hot steam,"" said Dr Southworth.The researchers say while it is unlikely that any life-forms could survive on this world, the discovery of an atmosphere is encouraging in the hunt for extraterrestrial life.Dr Southworth said: ""What we have shown is that planets around low mass stars can have atmospheres and because there are so many of those in the Universe, it makes it that much more likely that one might have life.""Commenting on the research Marek Kukula, the public astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: ""This is a nice proof of concept.""If the technology can detect an atmosphere today, then it bodes well for being able to detect and study the atmospheres of even more Earth-like planets in the not-too-distant future.""Follow Rebecca on Twitter."
science	Stop abusing land, scientists warn	How years compare with the 20th Century average	Scientists are to deliver a stark condemnation of the damage being done to the land surface of the planet.Human activities have led to the degrading of soils, expanded deserts, felled forests, driven out wildlife, and drained peatlands, they will say.In the process, land has been turned from an asset that combats climate change into a major source of carbon.The scientists will say this land abuse must be stopped to avoid catastrophic climate heating.UK's 10 warmest years all occurred since 2002Climate change: Where we are in seven chartsWhat is climate change?How can the land protect us from climate change?Uncultivated land covered with vegetation protects us from overheating because the plants absorb the warming gas CO2 from the air and fix it in the soil.But the scientists meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, will say the way we farm and grow timber often actually increases emissions of carbon dioxide.Between a quarter and a third of all greenhouse gas emissions are now estimated to come from land use.The scientists will warn of a battle for land between multiple competing demands: biofuels, plant material for plastics and fibres, timber, wildlife, paper and pulp - and food for a growing population.Their report will say we need to make hard choices about how we use the world’s soil.And it will offer another warning that our hunger for red meat is putting huge stress on the land to produce animal feed, as well as contributing to half of the world’s emissions of methane - another greenhouse gas.What is the report?The document’s being finalised this week among scientists and government officials on the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).It will become the most authoritative report yet on the way we use and abuse the land. Scientists hope it will give the issue of land use greater prominence in negotiations on climate change.At its heart will be the paradox that the land can be a source of CO2 emissions, or a sink for CO2 emissions.The question is how we use it.2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAA(If you can't see this chart tap or click here)Why is that an issue?Take the fenlands in the east of England – a huge expanse of lowland peat.In its natural state, it’s saturated with water. But over centuries, 99% of it has been drained for farming. Food crops don’t grow in peat bogs.The remaining un-drained 1% is Wicken Fen, a plot owned by the charity the National Trust, where the soft black soil is still 4m deep.The surrounding drained farmland is noticeably lower, because as it’s been drained the peat has shrunk to just 50cm thick.Between 1-2% of the soil on the drained farmland is still being lost every year.That’s because when peat is exposed to the air, it oxidises and produces CO2.But here’s the problem: the peaty fields are also some of the most productive cropland in the UK – they’re known as Black Gold.Farmers want to grow food on them – not soak them to save carbon.One young farmer, Charles Shropshire, told me he was concerned about carbon loss from his fields.He’s already finding that existing climate change is disrupting growing patterns.So now he’s adopting so-called “regenerative farming” techniques - such as shallow ploughing, keeping the land covered in vegetation in the winter, and using drip-feed watering.He’s willing to experiment with National Trust ideas such as re-wetting the soil over the winter, or growing sphagnum moss for use in beauty treatments or hanging baskets.But many other farmers don’t want to change the way they run their business.And all round the world you’ll find similar stories as farmers strive to increase production of the food people want, which can negatively affect land in the long term.Part of the problem is that consumption of meat and vegetable oils has doubled since the 1960s.Can we solve the problem?Scientists say the problem is huge. They admit it will be hard to solve, especially as conservation-style farming would involve teaching half a billion farmers to work differently.They believe we need to:Are the solutions agreed?There’s still some debate. One option is to concentrate intensive farming into the smallest possible area of land, in order to leave as much natural land as possible to soak up CO2.Another option is to farm in a less intensive, more climate-friendly way – but that means taking up more natural land to compensate.Either way, the report will warn that the poorest farmers will be hardest hit by global warming, and they’ll be least able to afford new technologies to change the way they farm.Kelly Levin, from the US green think tank WRI, told BBC News the report should heap pressure on politicians to cut fossil fuel emissions.She said: “If we consider the climate problem hard now, just think about how much harder it will be without the land serving as a large sink for carbon dioxide emissions.”Will the report change policies?Prof John Boardman, from the Oxford Environmental Change Institute, told us climate change was already causing soil erosion in southern England through more intense rain.But he warned: “We should recognise that in most parts of the world, a little more or less rain or heat is an irrelevance compared to human pressures.“(In some areas) if we change the land use from winter wheat to maize, we triple the risk of erosion.”Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University, UK, told us: “Increased temperatures and heavier rainfall will aggravate soil erosion, compaction, loss of organic matter, loss of biodiversity, and landslides… many of which are irreversible.“I hope the final IPCC report will be robust enough to motivate politicians and land managers to implement policies and practices that will reverse, mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis”.Follow Roger on Twitter.

science	Alexei Leonov: The Russian who could have been first to the Moon	The First Spacewalk	"Pioneering cosmonaut Alexei Arkhipovich Leonov died on Friday in Moscow aged 85. With his passing, the world has lost another direct connection to the Cold War space race of the 1960s and 70s.Leonov was widely admired by other astronauts and cosmonauts, and his exploits in orbit were legendary.He was also regarded as a man of great compassion, who was deeply affected by the deaths of his colleagues and friends in the ground-breaking but perilous contest in space between the superpowers.Yet his passion for art made him somewhat atypical of the ""steely-eyed missile men"" who made up the astronaut and cosmonaut corps during the 1960s.His hobby was not always a good fit with the technocratic nature of the Soviet space effort. The head of the USSR's rocket programme in the 1970s, Vasily Mishin, became convinced that a problem with the world's first space station, Salyut-1, had been caused by one Leonov's drawing pencils floating into the ventilation system and getting stuck. A subsequent mission to inspect the station disproved the idea.Ultimately, Leonov will be remembered as the first person to walk in space. But if things had gone differently, the Russian might have become the first person to walk on the Moon.Read the story of the first spacewalk, and how the mission nearly didn't come back to Earth.Born in the Siberian village of Listvyanka in 1934, Leonov was a boy when his father was jailed in Stalin's purges. After being encouraged by the authorities, neighbours lined up to ransack the Leonovs' home - as the family looked on.Despite the artistic promise he showed growing up, Leonov graduated as a fighter pilot. A few years later, he was selected to be one of the USSR's first class of 20 cosmonauts, alongside Yuri Gagarin who, in 1961, became the first person in space. The two became the best of friends.In March 1965, Leonov got his first flight on Voskhod-2, the first spacewalking mission. Tethered to the spacecraft with a 4.8m-long (16ft) cable, he clambered out of an inflatable airlock, pushed himself away and floated above the Earth.The planet stretched out in all directions like a glorious panorama. In 2014, Leonov told the BBC it made him feel ""like a grain of sand"".But the first excursion outside of a spacecraft did not go as planned - Leonov soon noticed that his suit was inflating.""My hands had slipped out of the gloves, my feet came out of the boots. The suit felt loose around my body,"" Leonov said.He made it back inside the craft, but only after bleeding half the air out of his spacesuit which gave him the early symptoms of decompression sickness, also known as ""the bends"".The mission ran into other emergencies following the spacewalk, and the cosmonauts had to make the first return to Earth under manual, rather than automatic, control. It worked, but the spacecraft landed in the snow-covered Ural mountains, far away from the intended landing site. Leonov and fellow crew-member, Pavel Belyayev, had to endure freezing conditions until a rescue party located them.During Voskhod-2, Leonov proved he had the ""right stuff"" in spades - calmly troubleshooting a complex and life-threatening problem. Unsurprisingly, he was later selected to command the Soviet Union's first attempt to land on the Moon.While the successes and failures of America's Apollo programme took place under the harsh glare of publicity, the Soviet Union was working away on its own lunar effort in secrecy.The USSR's plan to land on the Moon shared many similarities with Apollo, but there were key differences, too.""Unlike Apollo, our lander carried only one cosmonaut. It was more difficult of course, but that's how the mission was designed,"" Leonov said in an interview for the Science Museum's website.""When approaching the Moon, I would have to spacewalk from the descent module into the lunar lander. At a set time, the spacecraft and the lunar descent module would separate. I would be the only person on the lunar lander.""The Russian trained for landing on the Moon in a modified Mi-4 helicopter. At 110m above the ground, he stopped the helicopter's engine and landed it in autorotation (where the rotor turns only by the action of air moving upwards through it). At this height, the chopper matched the vertical speed of a lander during its descent to the lunar surface.""It's a crazy idea, extremely dangerous. But I did nine of these landings,"" Leonov told the BBC's Cosmonauts documentary in 2014.However, the effort was dealt a blow in 1966 when Sergei Korolev, chief designer and driving force behind the Soviet space programme, died during what should have been a routine operation. The programme lost its momentum after his death.In addition, the Soviets couldn't get their huge Moon rocket to work. The N-1 stood 105m (345ft) tall and was the USSR's answer to Nasa's Saturn V launcher. The N-1 had a first stage powered by 30 engines arranged in two rings, while the Saturn V had just five engines.The design of the N-1, with many smaller engines clustered together, meant that if just one experienced a destructive failure, it could take out all the others. This meant the system reliability for the N-1 had to be much better than the Saturn V's.All four launches of the Soviet rocket ended in catastrophic failure. But Leonov remained convinced that, had Korolev lived, the problems with the N-1 would have been swiftly corrected.After Armstrong and Aldrin touched down in the Moon's Sea of Tranquility on 20 July 1969, the USSR cancelled its Moon shot.The cosmonaut was hit by numerous tragedies during his life. One was the death of his good friend Yuri Gagarin in a plane crash. On 27 March 1968, Gagarin took off in a Mig-15 plane from a military base outside Moscow on a routine flight to re-verify his pilot skills.However, the plane did not return. Leonov joined the search for Gagarin in the forest surrounding the base, and identified his friend from what was left of his body.In Two Sides of the Moon, the book he later co-authored with Nasa astronaut Dave Scott, Leonov said Gagarin had been like a brother to him: ""Death had never seemed closer, nor more terrible,"" he wrote.""In the years since, I have made many drawings and paintings of that awful crash site; the torn trees, smoke, wreckage.""The first spacewalker refused to believe rumours that Gagarin had been drinking, or the conclusion of the official investigation - that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.Instead, he spent years promoting his own theory that, in agreement with eyewitness reports, a supersonic jet was being tested in the same area on the day. He believed the jet's pilot had passed too close to Gagarin's plane while travelling at supersonic speeds. This had caused the MiG to overturn and crash.In 1969, Leonov narrowly escaped injury when a Soviet army deserter opened fire on a chauffeur-driven limousine he was in. The car was travelling through Moscow as part of a motorcade carrying Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev, who had been the assassin's intended target. The limo's driver was killed by one of the bullets.By the early 70s, the Russian had been assigned to command a mission to the world's first crewed space station, Salyut-1. However, the prime crew was replaced with a backup team when one of the cosmonauts, Valeri Kubasov, showed possible signs of tuberculosis during a medical exam (it turned out to be an allergy).The backup team had little time to train before the launch; Leonov protested the decision but was rebuffed by superiors.The Soyuz 11 mission launched in 1971, and all went well until it was time for the cosmonauts to return. The Soyuz capsule had air vents between two modules of the spacecraft. These were supposed to automatically close for re-entry and then open again once the capsule was at a safe altitude. But Leonov suspected they were a design weakness and warned the crew to shut them manually before returning to Earth.Unfortunately, the procedure was missed. The vents opened prematurely and all three cosmonauts died within seconds as the air was sucked from their cabin. Leonov later wrote: ""Even though it was not my fault, I blamed myself for what had happened.""After the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Cold War tensions had eased between the US and USSR. In a move that would once have been unthinkable, the two countries agreed to collaborate on a space mission, called the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. The two superpowers would separately launch spacecraft that would then dock in orbit.Leonov commanded the Soviet side of the mission, and was joined by Kubasov.The Americans' side of the mission was led by Thomas Stafford, a veteran of three spaceflights. He was joined by Vance Brand and Deke Slayton, both on their first spaceflight.After the two spacecraft linked up, Leonov moved into the joint docking module and waited for the Nasa astronauts to open their hatch. He was greeted by Stafford and, for the first time, a Soviet made direct contact with an American in orbit.During the two days the spacecraft remained docked, the three Americans and two Soviets exchanged flags and gifts, visited each other's spacecraft and ate together.The two crews were required to learn the other's language - and Leonov would later joke that the crews had spoken Russian, English and ""Oklahomski"", referring to Stafford's Oklahoma accent.The mission was a first baby step towards greater co-operation in space between the two nations. It paved the way for other collaborations on the Soviet space station Mir and, eventually, the International Space Station (ISS).After the Apollo-Soyuz mission, Leonov became chief cosmonaut and was deputy director of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center outside Moscow where he oversaw crew instruction.He died at Moscow's Burdenko Hospital after a long illness. He is survived by his wife Svetlana and daughter Oksana.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	New candidate for 'missing element' in Earth's core		"Japanese scientists believe they have established the identity of a ""missing element"" within the Earth's core.They have been searching for the element for decades, believing it makes up a significant proportion of our planet's centre, after iron and nickel.Now by recreating the high temperatures and pressures found in the deep interior, experiments suggest the most likely candidate is silicon.The discovery could help us to better understand how our world formed.Lead researcher Eiji Ohtani from Tohoku University told BBC News: ""We believe that silicon is a major element - about 5% [of the Earth's inner core] by weight could be silicon dissolved into the iron-nickel alloys.""Hard to reachThe innermost part of Earth is thought to be a solid ball with a radius of about 1,200km (745 miles).It is far too deep to investigate directly, so instead scientists study how seismic waves pass through this region to tell them something of its make-up.It is mainly composed of iron, which makes up an estimated 85% of its weight, and nickel, which accounts for about 10% of the core.To investigate the unaccounted for 5% of the core, Eiji Ohtani and his team created alloys of iron and nickel and mixed them with silicon.They then subjected them to the immense pressures and temperatures that exist in the inner core.They discovered that this mixture matched what was seen in the Earth's interior with seismic data.Prof Ohtani said more work was needed to confirm the presence of silicon and that it did not rule out the presence of other elements.Core formationCommenting on the research, Prof Simon Redfern from the University of Cambridge, UK, said: ""These difficult experiments are really exciting because they can provide a window into what Earth's interior was like soon after it first formed, 4.5 billion years ago, when the core first started to separate from the rocky parts of Earth.""But other workers have recently suggested that oxygen might also be important in the core.""He said that knowing what is there could help scientists to better understand the conditions that prevailed during the formation of the Earth.In particular whether the early interior was one where oxygen was greatly limited - known as reducing conditions. Or whether oxygen was in abundance, which is described as oxidising.If a larger amount of silicon had been incorporated in Earth's core more than four billion years ago, as suggested by Prof Ohtani's results, that would have left the rest of the planet relatively oxygen rich.But if, instead, oxygen was sucked into the core that would leave the rocky mantle surrounding the core depleted of the element.Prof Redfern said: ""In a way, these two options are real alternatives that depend a lot on the conditions prevailing when Earth's core first began to form.""The most recent results add to our understanding, but I suspect that they are by no means the last word on the story.""Prof Ohtani presented his research to the recent Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.Follow Rebecca on Twitter."
science	Surface water shifting around the Earth		"Scientists have used satellite images to study how the water on the Earth's surface has changed over 30 years.They found that 115,000 sq km (44,000 sq miles) of land is now covered in water and 173,000 sq km (67,000 sq miles) of water has now become land.The largest increase in water has been on the Tibetan Plateau, while the Aral Sea has been the biggest conversion of water to land.The team said many coastal areas have also changed significantly.The research, carried out by the Deltares Research Institute in the Netherlands, is published in the journal Nature Climate Change.The researchers analysed satellite images recorded by Nasa's Landsat satellites, which have observed the Earth for decades.They were able to monitor changes in the Earth's surface down to a resolution of 30m, which can be seen on the Deltares Aqua Monitor.The team found that vast areas that were once land are now submerged beneath water, with the largest change occurring in the Tibetan Plateau, where melting glaciers are creating huge new lakes.An increase in the number of dams was also boosting water cover, and using the satellite data, the team was able to detect previously unreported constructions.Dr Fedor Baart from Deltares said: ""We started to look at areas that had not been mapped before.""We knew in Myanmar that several dams were being built, but we were able to see how many. And we also looked at North Korea, and we found dams being built there just north of the border from South Korea.""Conversely, the researchers also found that even larger areas of water have now become land.The biggest transformation was seen in the Aral Sea in Central Asia. What was once one of the largest lakes in the world has now almost completely dried up after engineers diverted rivers to irrigate agriculture.The researchers said Lake Mead near Las Vegas, which is the largest reservoir in the United States, was also losing water, and 222 sq km (85 sq miles) of it was now land.Coastal areas were also analysed, and to the scientists surprise, coastlines had gained more land - 33,700 sq km (13,000 sq miles) - than they had been lost to water (20,100 sq km or 7,800 sq miles).""We expected that the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise, but the most surprising thing is that the coasts are growing all over the world,"" said Dr Baart.""We're were able to create more land than sea level rise was taking.""The researchers said Dubai's coast had been significantly extended, with the creation of new islands to house luxury resorts.""China has also reconstructed their whole coast from the Yellow Sea all the way down to Hong Kong,"" sid Dr Baart.Some areas, such as the Amazon, saw almost equal amounts of conversion of land to water and vice versa because of the natural movements of the river system.The team says more work now needs to be done to see what impact these global changes may have.The lead author Gennadii Donchyts from Deltares said: ""This analysis was done to understand the extent of these changes. The next step is to understand their impact on nature.""Follow Rebecca on Twitter: @BBCMorelle"
science	Earth's rarest minerals catalogued		"Scientists have categorised the Earth's rarest minerals.None of 2,500 species described is known from more than five locations, and for a few of them the total global supply could fit in a thimble.The researchers say it is important to hunt down these oddities because they contain fundamental information about the construction of our planet.Some will also undoubtedly have properties that are useful in technological applications.The list appears in a paper about to be published in the journal American Mineralogist.It is authored by Dr Robert Hazen, from the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, and Prof Jesse Ausubel of The Rockefeller University, in New York.""Scientists have so far tracked down 5,000 mineral species and it turns out that fewer than a 100 constitute almost all of Earth's crust. The rest of them are rare, but the rarest of the rare - that's about 2,500 minerals - are only found at five places on Earth or fewer,"" Dr Hazen told BBC News.""And you ask: why study them; they seem so insignificant? But they are the key to the diversity of the Earth's near-surface environments.""It's the rare minerals that tell us so much about how Earth differs from the Moon, from Mars, from Mercury, where the same common minerals exist, but it's the rare minerals that make Earth special.""Minerals are combinations of chemical elements arranged into crystalline structures. Earth's rocks are built from different aggregations. Think of feldspar, quartz and mica - these are the ubiquitous species that everyone knows.But cobaltominite, abelsonite, fingerite, edoylerite - these are examples that will not form unless the ""cooking conditions"" are absolutely perfect.The atomic ingredients must sum exactly, the temperature must be precise to the degree, and the pressure will have to be defined in the narrowest of margins.And then, some will immediately fall apart when they get wet or the sun shines on them.Edoylerite, metasideronatrite, and sideronatrite are examples of vampire-like minerals that decompose on exposure to light.Hazen and Ausubel have put their list of 2,500 species into four broad categories of rarity that speak to the conditions under which they form, how rare their ingredients are, how ephemeral they are, and the limitations on their sampling.""Fingerite is like a 'perfect storm of rarity',"" said Dr Hazen.""It occurs only on the flanks of the Izalco Volcano in El Salvador - an incredibly dangerous place with super-hot fumeroles.""It's made of rare elements - vanadium and copper have to exist together, and it forms under an extremely narrow range of conditions. If you just change the ratio of copper to vanadium slightly, you get a different mineral. And every time it rains, fingerite washes away.""The new catalogue allows scientists to begin to gauge just how large the reserves of a particular mineral ought to be, and where those reserves might be. And for the technologically useful ones, this will have enormous value (although it is often possible to synthesise these minerals industrially).But the exercise also provides important insights on Earth itself. Many of these minerals would be absent altogether if not for the presence of biology, which moderates the chemical environment in which minerals forms.In that context, the paper contributes to the Deep Carbon Observatory project, an international venture that seeks to understand carbon's role in the Earth system.It is thought there are just over 100 carbon-bearing minerals out there waiting to be found.Dr Hazen actually has an entry named after him in the catalogue.Hazenite is only known from Mono Lake, California. It forms when the phosphorus levels in the lake get too high, and the microbes in the water, in order to survive, have to start excreting it from their cells.The resulting tiny, colourless crystals are essentially microbial ""poop"".""Yes, it's true - hazenite happens,"" said Dr Hazen.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Survival secret of 'Earth's hardiest animal' revealed	Extreme geneticsAquatic space-bears	"Researchers have discovered a genetic survival secret of Earth's ""hardiest animal"".A gene that scientists identified in these strange, aquatic creatures - called tardigrades - helps them survive boiling, freezing and radiation.In future, it could be used to protect human cells, the researchers say.It was already known that tardigrades, also known as water bears, were able to survive by shrivelling up into desiccated balls.But the University of Tokyo-led team found a protein that protects its DNA - wrapping around it like a blanket.The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Nature Communications, went on to grow human cells that produced that same protein, and found that it protected those cells too.This, the scientists suggest, means that genes from these ""extremophiles"", might one day be used to protect living things from radiation - from X-rays, or as a treatment to prevent damage from the Sun's harmful rays.Tardigrades are more commonly - and cutely - known as water bears. Scientists had thought that they survived radiation exposure by repairing the damage done to their DNA. But Prof Takekazu Kunieda, of the University of Tokyo, and his colleagues, carried out an eight-year study of a tardigrade genome to pinpoint the source of its remarkable resilience.To identify their secret weapon, researchers scrutinised the genome of one tardigrade species, looking for proteins that were attached to the DNA, and that therefore might have a protective mechanism. They found one that they have called ""Dsup"" (short for ""damage suppressor"").The team then inserted the Dsup gene into human cells' DNA, and exposed those modified cells to X-rays; Dsup-treated cells suffered far less DNA damage.Prof Mark Blaxter of the University of Edinburgh told BBC News that the study was ""groundbreaking"".""This is the first time an individual protein from a tardigrade has been shown to be active in radiation protection.""[And] radiation is one of the things that's guaranteed to kill you.""By sequencing and examining the genome, this study also appears to resolve a strange genetic controversy about these creatures. Research published in 2015, involving a different tardigrade species, concluded that the creature had ""acquired"" a portion of its DNA from bacteria through a process called horizontal gene transfer.That study suggested that some of these beasts' notorious imperviousness had been snipped out of the bacterial genetic code.This study found no evidence of this gene transfer.The tardigrades themselves, though, were far more resistant to X-rays than the human cells that the researchers manipulated. ""[So] tardigrades have other tricks up their sleeves, which we have yet to identify,"" said Prof Matthew Cobb from the University of Manchester.With further research, scientists think that genes like Dsup could make it safer and easier to store and transport human cells - protecting, for example, delicate human skin grafts from damage. Prof Kunieda and his co-author on the study, Takuma Hashimoto, applied to patent the Dsup gene in 2015.Prof Cobb added that, in principle, ""these genes could even help us bioengineer organisms to survive in extremely hostile environments, such as on the surface of Mars - [perhaps] as part of a terra-forming project to make the planet hospitable for humans"".And scientists with a fascination for tardigrades think this discovery could be the tip of the iceberg.Prof Blaxter said that tardigrade research could even explain how exactly ""radiation damages DNA, and how we might prevent DNA damage from other sources"".Prof Takekazu Kunieda told BBC News that he hoped more researchers would join the ""tardigrade community"".""We believe there [are] a lot of treasures there,"" he added."
science	Bezos floats 'national team' to build Moon lander	To the Moon and Beyond	"Jeff Bezos has announced the formation of a ""national team"" that will aim to build the lander that will take astronauts back to the Moon in 2024.Bezos' space company Blue Origin has teamed up with aerospace giants Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper to bid for the landing system.The White House has set the ambitious goal of sending a man and a woman to the lunar South Pole within five years.Bezos outlined the plan at a meeting in Washington DC.The Amazon founder called the partnership ""a national team for a national priority"".Nasa had originally planned to mount the Moon return mission in 2028. But earlier this year, Vice President Mike Pence announced the administration's plan to accelerate that timeline by four years.""Ladies and gentlemen, that's just not good enough,"" Mr Pence said about the original schedule when announcing the 2024 target in March.The programme has been named Artemis, after the sister of Apollo.Blue Origin, a relatively new entrant in the human spaceflight sector, will lead the team, which is composed of companies with decades of experience building hardware for Nasa.""We recognise that this project and the time frame that the nation is calling for is ambitious, very ambitious,"" Brent Sherwood, Blue Origin's vice president of advanced development programs was reported as saying by the Washington Post.Under existing plans, the lander would undock from a small space station in lunar orbit called Gateway. Nasa has previously said it wants a lander that's split into three separate parts, or stages - although it has left the door open to other designs and modes of getting to the lunar surface.One stage is called the transfer vehicle or ""tug"". It carries the other two elements down from Gateway to a lower lunar orbit. Northrop Grumman would build this stage under the national team bid.The development of the original Apollo lunar lander was led by Grumman Aircraft, which merged with Northrop Corporation in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman.Can America get back to the lunar surface by 2024? Read the articleAnother stage, called the descent element, takes the crew from low lunar orbit to the surface. Blue Origin plans to build this part of the lander, which will incorporate the company's BE-7 engine that is currently being developed.Finally, an ascent element blasts the astronauts back into lunar orbit. Lockheed Martin would develop this vehicle.Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Draper will provide descent guidance and flight avionics (electronics systems). As the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, the not-for-profit research organisation designed the Apollo Guidance Computer that helped astronauts manoeuvre safely to the lunar surface in the 60s and 70s.""Humankind's future will be determined by our ability to live and thrive beyond the Earth's surface. Leveraging the commercial sector with new, privately-funded space technologies and capabilities are critical elements of that future,"" said Dr Ken Gabriel, president and chief executive of Draper.""Key among these capabilities is reuseable launch vehicles which lower the barrier of entry to the new space economy. The dawn of the Space Age was more than 50 years ago and driven only by government investments - today, industry is driving and daylight is here.""The national team bid will be in competition with other companies for the contracts to build the landing system. The winning bid could be announced in the coming months.Mr Bezos was speaking at the 70th International Astronautical Congress in Washington DC.Follow Paul on Twitter."
science	Earth warming to climate tipping point, warns study	Considerable losses	"A warmer world will release vast volumes of carbon into the atmosphere, potentially triggering dangerous climate change, scientists warn.Writing in journal Nature, they project that an increase of 1C (1.8F) will release an additional 55 billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere by 2050.This could trigger a ""positive feedback"" and push the planet's climate system past the point of no-return.Previous assessments have not taken carbon released by soil into account.In their Nature paper, an international team of scientists said that the majority of the Earth's terrestrial store of carbon was in the soil.They warned that as the world warmed, organisms living in the planet's soils would become more active, resulting in more carbon being released into the atmosphere - exacerbating warming.""There have been concerns about this positive feedback for a long, long time,"" said lead author Thomas Crowther, who conducted the research while based at Yale University, US, but now at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology.""For the past two or three decades there have been literally thousands of studies trying to address this topic and trying to identify whether there are going to be increases or decreases in carbon uptake of the soil in relation to warming or increases in carbon loss.""Dr Crowther said the uncertainty surrounding the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the planet's soils had led to ""sizeable differences in the projections of future climate conditions"".He told BBC News: ""We are the first study to take a global perspective and then map the variability and able to say that in these areas there are going to be huge losses and in these areas there are going to be some gains.""Using this approach we can get a robust idea of the whole picture. We show that, actually, the losses are going to be really considerable.""Using data stretching over 20 years from 49 sites across the globe, the team observed that global carbon stocks would fall by up to 55 petagrams (55 billion tonnes) under a business-as-usual scenario, which is roughly equivalent to adding the emissions from a nation the size of the US.Dr Crowther, whose team had produced a short video on the subject, added: ""I do not positive as in 'good' but positive as in it is reinforcing, so it is a process that once it has kicked off, it leads to the acceleration of itself.""Carbon comes out of the soil, which leads to more warming, which leads to more carbon out of the soil, it is a reinforcing cycle. The concerning thing is that our projection is that we are going to lose 55 petgrams, that's 55 trillion kilograms by 2050. This process is only going to accelerate and accelerate.In the global carbon cycle, soils act as a depository, a place where carbon is stored in a state that does not directly influence the global climate system.He observed: ""The carbon is trapped in the soil because it is taken from the atmosphere by plant material through photosynthesis. Particularly in cold places, it get stored in the soil for a very long time, and this minimises the atmospheric concentrations.""In the soil, there are microbes and soil animals, as well as plant roots, and they all use that soil carbon for their growth and activity.""Where it is really cold, the activity and growth is limited but when it warms, and warming is likely to be disproportionately happening in cold areas, then the more active they are set to become.""Dr Crowther said the increased activity by the organisms would mean that they would consume greater volumes of the carbon in the soil, and this would be released as carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.""It is very similar to the way we respire and produce carbon dioxide. Because there is such a huge biomass of microbes and soil animals, that respiration really can be massive,"" he said.One of the latest milestone in the global effort to curb climate change was the Paris Agreement, which was signed at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) summit, known as COP21, in the French capital city in December 2015.In it, nations agreed to keep the increase of the average global temperature to below 2C (3.6F) of pre-industrialisation levels.Dr Crowther said that the soil carbon study highlighted the importance of politicians and policymakers to heed the results of scientific studies on the issue of climate change.""I really do want to get the message across that the strength of feedbacks like this really do stress the need to meet the targets of COP21,"" he urged.""The feedback will exist and it will occur even if we do meet these targets but the magnitude of this feedback is going to be minimised hugely and it is really going to dampen the strength of it and it would prevent these enormous losses we expect by the end of the century if greenhouse gases are cut.""These findings really do reinforce the necessity to meet those targets.""Follow Mark on Twitter"
science	Planet smash-up 'brought carbon to Earth'		"Much of Earth's life-giving carbon could have been delivered in a planetary collision about 4.4 billion years ago, a theory suggests.Carbon is the key ingredient for all life on our planet.But how Earth acquired its ""volatile elements"" - which have low boiling points - such as carbon and sulphur remains a subject of some debate.A team now argues that a collision between Earth and an embryonic planet like Mercury could provide the answer.Details of the work appear in the journal Nature Geoscience.""The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet,"" said Rajdeep Dasgupta, a co-author of the study from Rice University in Houston, Texas.According to a widely accepted idea called the Late Veneer Hypothesis, Earth formed from material that was largely devoid of volatiles. These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming.""Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,"" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.""The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet.""The group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.But if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?The team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.The found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history.""Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,"" said Dr Dasgupta."
science	Climate change: Sea level rise to affect 'three times more people'		"Millions more people will be at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea-level rise later this century.That's the conclusion of new research conducted by Climate Central, a US-based non-profit news organisation.It finds that 190 million people will be living in areas that are projected to be below high-tide lines come 2100.Today, the group calculates roughly 110 million are presently occupying these lands, protected by walls, levees, and other coastal defences.The future at-risk total assumes only moderate global warming and therefore limited ocean encroachment.Climate Central's investigations, published in the journal Nature Communications, have sought to correct the biases in the elevation datasets previously used to work out how far inland coastlines will be inundated.The most famous of these datasets comes from a space shuttle mission.The Endeavour orbiter used a radar instrument in 2000 to map heights across the globe. This 3D model of the planet has become one of the most used Earth observation datasets in history.But the Climate Central team, of Scott Kulp and Benjamin Strauss, says it suffers from biases that in places make the land look higher than it really is.This problem occurs particularly in locations where there is thick vegetation, such as forests; the radar tends to see the tree canopy, not the ground.Kulp and Strauss used more modern, higher-resolution information from airborne lidar (laser) instruments to train a computer to make corrections to the shuttle's digital elevation model (DEM).When this new CoastalDEM is used in tandem with population statistics and the latest forecasts for sea level rise, it becomes apparent that many more people are entering a precarious future.The improved elevation data finds that even with moderate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, six Asian countries (China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand), where 237 million people live today, could face annual coastal flooding threats by 2050. That's roughly 183 million more than assessments based on prevailing elevation data.New estimate versus old estimateThe team has produced an interactive map that illustrates the difference between estimates based solely on the shuttle legacy data and the reworked elevations.And it's possible to see on this map how circumstances change depending on how well the world manages to constrain climate warming, which is pushing up ocean levels by heating the seas and melting ice stored in Antarctica and Greenland.Under a pessimistic future of continued high emissions, CoastalDEM suggests up to 630 million people live today on land that is projected to have annual flood events by 2100.For 2050, this number is 340 million, up from the estimated 250 million people who already live in this predicament.In general, the CoastalDEM-derived estimates of the global population at risk from coastal flooding are three times greater than the values produced using just the shuttle information.""We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10m above current high tide lines, including 250 million below 1m,"" the team tells Nature Communications.Sea levels have been rising globally by over 3mm per year in recent decades, with an acceleration in this trend now observable.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated last month in a special report on the oceans that global average sea levels could rise by up to 1.1m by 2100, in the worst warming scenario.Kulp and Strauss stress some limitations in their analysis.For example, it assumes a static population - future growth and migration are not considered. Nor are improvements in coastal defences.On a regional basis, the Climate Central analysis will be less surprising where coastal lidar surveys are already used to assess future flood risk. But its value is significant for those places which don't enjoy such good coverage.And in a number of locations, the future risks are only partly to do with sea-level rise. Some of the world's coastal megacities have the additional challenge of subsidence;In places, the ground is going down 10 times faster than the water is coming up.This has been true of places like Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and Bangkok where too much groundwater has been extracted from underlying soils."
science	Watching Tim Peake return to Earth	Dead calmBrutal but reliable	Witnessing Tim Peake's descent through the clouds towards the arid emptiness of the Kazakh steppe must rank as one of the highlights of any reporter's career.At first, we had no idea if we were in the right place but then the parachute appeared as a miniature white blob in the sky as our helicopter circled the landing zone - one of a fleet involved in recovering the spacecraft.Gradually its white and orange stripes became more distinct, and just visible beneath it was the dark shape of the tiny capsule carrying Tim and his two colleagues.A column of dust in the distance signalled the rush of the ground vehicles speeding over the bumpy terrain in a desperate hurry to provide help as soon as possible.By a happy coincidence of winds and flight paths, we had an airborne ringside seat as the near-black craft drifted closer and closer towards the ground.Although our window was dirty, and the helicopter lurched in the air, we watched spellbound as the Soyuz craft glided delicately towards the pale surface before a flash of explosives broke its fall.These were the miniature rockets designed to fire a second before impact - everything was working as it should, and it looked uncannily like a Russian space agency animation I'd seen the day before.A great brown cloud of dry earth surged into the air and, for a few moments, it engulfed the craft so we lost sight of it. But touchdown had been achieved. The giant chute lay draped over the parched grassland.Within minutes the first helicopters were on the scene, specialists running towards the capsule - the absolute priority was getting the three spacemen to safety.We landed shortly afterwards, and cameraman Anton Chicherov and I raced towards a small crowd clustered in front of the spacecraft's hatch. A medical tent was already inflated and plastic tape marked out where journalists were allowed to go.In this blank stretch on the map in the middle of nowhere, more than 100km (62 miles) from the nearest town, the order and procedures of a small community had suddenly sprung up with impressive speed.Commander Yuri Malenchenko, a veteran cosmonaut, was first to be lifted clear and placed in a small folding chair - tradition demands that returning spacefarers are seated for a few minutes after landing.Malenchenko's expression was dead calm - he'd seen it all before. This is a man who's so familiar with life off the planet that he even got married in space (while his bride was in Houston).Next to emerge was Tim Peake. Pale-faced from six months without sun, he was grinning and relaxed and apparently well.But the sudden exposure to the baking summer heat obviously left him uncomfortable, medics offering him sips of water and mopping his brow.Having met him a number of times over the past seven years, I felt moved to welcome him back to Earth. He smiled and said he'd been so well trained that the descent was fine and he was loving the fresh air.You would never have known he'd just spent a few hours crammed into an agonisingly small spaceship and endured the perils of descent with scorching temperatures and violent swings.Tim, a model of polite and cheerful efficiency, took every shouted question in his stride. He might easily have declined to respond to the excited curiosity of the British journalists there but, calmly and pleasantly, he maintained his usual courtesy, a very British version of the Right Stuff.Last out was US astronaut Tim Kopra who looked a little unwell, and he was so thronged by assistants that we could hardly see him, but he was obviously in good hands.The fact is that the Russians have evolved a brutal but highly reliable system for venturing into space and returning from it. The technology does not look space-age but it works - simple ladders access the capsule, and the spacecraft was rolled upright with a dozen strong pairs of hands.Once Yuri and the two Tims had been carried to the medical tent for check-up, the officials relaxed enough to let me walk right up to the spacecraft itself.Even an hour after landing, it was hot to the touch and there was an acrid smell in the air. When I ran my fingers over the charred surface they turned black - evidence of the intense heat of re-entry and the effectiveness of the design for handling it.It's not pretty, let alone glamorous, but the Soyuz is effective and has repeatedly done its job.First impressions can be deceptive. When I first boarded our very battered Russian Air Force helicopter at Karagandy airport in the morning, I was struck by the utter lack of comfort: two huge yellow fuel tanks dominated the cabin. The stench was overpowering but it meant we had massive range.I picked one of the few places left - there were no proper seats, just tough canvas benches. I unwrapped a cereal bar. Crumbs spilled everywhere.And then I learned that this very helicopter was assigned to carry Tim Peake from the landing zone to the airport and that the bench I was sitting on would serve as his bed for the two-hour flight. His first chance to lie down in six months - and I'd messed it up. Sorry, Tim.
science	Earth's underground water quantified	Finite resource	"The total amount of groundwater on the planet, held in rock and soil below our feet, is estimated to be 23 million cubic km.If this volume is hard to visualise, imagine the Earth's entire land surface covered in a layer some 180m deep.The new calculation comes from a Canadian-led team and is published in the journal Nature Geoscience.Significantly, little of this water - just 6% - is the kind of bankable resource that is most useful to people.That small fraction is referred to as ""modern"" groundwater: it is extractable because it is near the surface, and can be used to supplement above-ground resources in rivers and lakes.""It's the groundwater that is the most quickly renewed - on the scale of human lifetimes,"" explained study leader Tom Gleeson from the University of Victoria.""And yet this modern groundwater is also the most sensitive to climate change and to human contamination. So, it's a vital resource that we need to manage better.""To quantify just how much water is stored in the top 2km of the Earth's surface, Dr Gleeson's team had to combine large data sets with an element of modelling.They included information on the permeability of rocks and soil, on their porosity, and all that is known about water table gradients, which tell you about inputs from precipitation.Key to determining the age of all this stored water is a collection of thousands of tritium measurements.Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that spiked in the atmosphere 50 years ago as a result of thermonuclear bomb tests.It can therefore be used as a tracer for all the rain that has made its way underground ever since.The map above shows the distribution of this modern groundwater around the globe.Dark blue shows where it is very quickly renewed. Light blue shows the older groundwater, which is mostly stagnant and non-renewable.""Old water is highly variable,"" Dr Gleeson told BBC News.""Some places it is quite deep, in some places not. In many places, it can be poor quality.""It can be more saline even than ocean water and it can have lots of dissolved metals and other chemicals that would need to be treated before it could be used for drinking or agriculture.""This puts further emphasis on the modern reserves and the need to manage them in a sustainable way. The study underlines just how unevenly they are spread around the globe.The next step, Dr Gleeson said, was to try to work out just how fast some water stores were being depleted.Also writing in Nature Geoscience, Ying Fan, from Rutgers University, US, commented that ""this global view of groundwater will, hopefully, raise awareness that our youngest groundwater resources - those that are the most sensitive to anthropogenic and natural environmental changes - are finite"".Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Swarm tracks Earth's turbulent magnetic field		"Europe's Swarm mission is providing an unprecedented view of Earth's turbulent magnetic field, scientists say.The three-satellite constellation is now routinely mapping its convulsions, allowing researchers to probe the mechanisms that drive the ""invisible shield"" in remarkable new detail.Movies released this week by the Swarm team show how the field strengthens and weakens over time.They also illustrate the speed at which those changes occur.""I'm interested in using Swarm data to see what's happening down in the planet's molten outer core, where fluid motions are generating this field,"" said Chris Finlay from the Technical University of Denmark.""For me, this is real Earth exploration, because we know so very little about what is going on in that place,"" he told BBC News.The planet's magnetic field is a complex, multi-component problem.As well as that dominant signal generated 3,000km beneath our feet in the swirling convection of liquid iron, there are other contributions pulling on the needle of every compass.These include the magnetism retained in rocks, and even a very subtle effect derived from the movement of salt water ocean currents.The Swarm satellites' task is to try to tease apart these various factors, to get a clearer picture of the field's most significant behaviours.The magnetic ""bubble"" that protects us from space radiation is known to be in a long-term weakening phase, perhaps heralding one of the periodic flips where north becomes south and south becomes north.This hasn't happened for 780,000 years. Whether we're actually heading for another reversal now, scientists will only be able to gauge by studying the type of data coming from Swarm.In the movies showcased here at the Living Planet Symposium in Prague, the satellites' information is critical to the end of the animated sequences, which cover the past 15 years.One of the videos tracks changes in intensity in the magnetic field. Red is strong; blue is weak (top of page).The very dark blue region over the South Atlantic is the famous anomaly where the field's weakness allows radiation belts around the Earth to bite down into the atmosphere. It's over this zone where orbiting spacecraft suffer most of their electronic upsets.The movie reveals the anomaly to be widening, with its centre moving westwards, over Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina.""Look also at the patch over North America which is decreasing in intensity; whereas over Asia, it's been getting stronger. We haven't really noticed this much before. We see it happening really quite quickly in the last few years,"" explained Dr Finlay.""And it's that change in the topology which is also the reason the magnetic north pole is drifting away from the Americas as well. This is a decadal trend and Swarm is allowing us to track it in great detail.""The second movie describes the rate of change in Earth's magnetic field. Regions where changes are slowing are depicted in blue, while red highlights those locations where the changes are speeding up.An eye-catching feature is the oscillation west of Africa.""We can now make these maps down at the outer edge of the dynamo, on the core-mantle boundary, and there we see a lot more of the small-scale details of the field change,"" said Dr Finlay.""We can use those changes at the core surface to map the flow within the core. And, for example, this positive-negative-positive oscillation - we're seeing changes in the liquid motion within the core. There's an oscillation in the flow in the east-west direction, which is going back and forth on a timescale of about three years.""The European Space Agency's Swarm satellites were launched in 2013.The three identical spacecraft carry a variety of instruments but their key sensors are state-of-the-art magnetometers that measure the field's strength and the direction.Two of the satellites, known as Alpha and Charlie, fly in tandem at an altitude of about 450km, and will descend over time.The third platform, Bravo, is higher up, over 500km, and is drifting away from the other two in its orbital plane.This geometry enables Swarm to see the magnetic field in three dimensions, and to better gauge its variations in time and space.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: Warming signal links global floods and fires	What can we say about the role of climate change in floods like those seen in South Yorkshire?Will we see more such flooding in the near future?What about Venice?What about the Australian fires - where's the climate link?Are there common climate factors in all these events?Have climate models predicted these events?How does the insurance industry view all this?Can we say that single events are linked to climate change?What about cold weather - how is climate change impacting that?	"With homes under water in South Yorkshire, near record flooding in Venice, and burgeoning wildfires in Australia, many people are asking if and how climate change is connected to these extreme weather events.There are some basic physical factors that help explain the scale of the downpours that recently swamped the village of Fishlake and other locations in Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire.The very scientific sounding Clausius-Clapeyron equation is one key element.Clausius and Clapeyron are the surnames of the German and French meteorologists who discovered that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. For every 1 degree C increase in temperature, the air can hold about 7% extra water vapour.When you get the sorts of storms that generate rapid cooling, you get heavier rain falling rapidly out of the clouds, as happened in parts of England last week.""As temperatures are warmer we get more intense rain, which by itself brings more floods, even if the number of storms hitting our shores don't change,"" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds.""When coupled to warmer, wetter winters generally, as expected from climate change, the ground becomes more saturated so any rainfall will give a greater chance of flooding.""This is, in essence, the scenario that played out in Fishlake last week.UK scientists observe and predict a 10-20% increase in rainfall during the wettest days, so it is very possible that we will see other examples of this type of downpour across this winter.In coastal areas, the chances of flooding are made worse by the rise in sea level.However, the chances of an area flooding or not is also complicated by human factors such as farming practices, the building of houses on flood plains and the vagaries of the British weather.Venice has been hit by floods that have seen more than 80% of the city, a Unesco world heritage site, under water when the tides were at their highest.The Mayor of Venice was very quick to attribute the floods to climate change. Critics though have pointed to delays and corruption in relation to the installation of a major floodwater defence system that might have limited the damage.Climate scientists, however, see a clear relation between rising temperatures and the inundation.""Sea level rise is rising globally and it is also rising in the Adriatic,"" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh.""Venice is also subsiding a bit, so you have a bit of a double whammy.""The immediate flood has been caused by the Sirocco wind and the high tides but it wouldn't have been as high without the sea having risen as well.""The latest Lancet report on health and climate change ""found that human exposure to fires had doubled since 2000"".""Wildfires not only cause deaths and health damage but had significant economic and social impacts,"" it found.In Australia, the bushfires this year have come far earlier and on a larger scale than seen previously.While climate change doesn't directly cause fires like these - it is major factor in creating the right conditions for fires to take hold.""In areas like Australia where we have had prolonged dry periods, you can't definitely attribute this to climate change but the environmental conditions are increasingly ripe for these sorts of things,"" said Prof Nigel Arnell from the University of Reading.""The precursors are all going in the direction of increased fire risk in those fire-prone regions.""Other researchers also point to indirect links.""Most droughts are found to be in part caused by climate change,"" said Prof Piers Forster.""Stronger winds, again associated with more energy in the climate system, add to the fire risk and make them more intense and faster moving.""Very much so, say the scientists.""The overall climate signal is that if you have it warmer, it is easier to burn; if you have higher seas, it is easier to flood,"" said Prof Gabi Hegerl.""And if you have more moisture in the atmosphere, the same rainfall systems rain harder - that is something we see globally and that has a human greenhouse gas signal in it.""In extreme events, that's where climate change bites us.""""Our climate models that project the future are best at the mean, at looking at the averages,"" said Prof Arnell.""They are not necessarily designed to be good at extremes, so we haven't got a prediction of extremes to compare against.""Other researchers say that what we are now experiencing is very much in line with models but that the world hasn't been adequately prepared for the scale of what we are now seeing.""I think there is a case to be made that scientists under-predicted the societal and environmental impacts of such events,"" said Prof Piers Forster.""But the projection of global temperature change and associated climate impacts has been pretty well predicted since the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was published in 1990, or even before.""Those in the insurance industry say that where once it was earthquakes and hurricanes that caused them the biggest losses, wildfires and storms have now become the key loss drivers.While much of the thrust in dealing with climate change has focussed on cutting carbon, in the insurance business they are more keen on seeing help for people to adapt to our changing world.""Retrofitting buildings is not as sexy as reimagining an energy system - there is a mundane nature to what a lot of adaptation looks like,"" said Greg Lowe, global head of resilience and sustainability at Aon.""People love talking about a green new deal, but I don't really see any discussions around what needs to happen from an adaptation perspective.""Mr Lowe pointed to the example of Florida in the wake of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 which caused 65 deaths and $27bn worth of damage. There was a complete revision of building codes in the wake of the storm which has massively changed the profile of losses in that part of the US.For years, when faced with extreme weather events like the fires in Australia or the floods in South Yorkshire, scientists have trotted out the ""we can't attribute any single event to climate change"" mantra.But that view has changed.""You will not find that climate change is the only cause for an extreme event,"" said Dr Friederike Otto from the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.""But you can look at individual events and work out how much climate change has altered the likelihood of it to occur or its intensity.""This view is echoed by other experts in the field.""This was true in 2013 for the last major IPCC assessment report, but the science on event-attribution (assigning specific weather events to a particular cause) has really developed since then,"" said Prof Piers Forster.""Now, even with single weather-related extreme events, we can say with a good degree of certainty that climate change played a role.""Others believe that the link between climate change and extreme events is now as strong as the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer.""You can never make a direct connection and say my grandad died of lung cancer because of smoking because you can't figure out how the cancer exactly originated; there might be other factors,"" said Prof Gabi Hegerl.""But you can say for sure that if you smoke the probability of coming down with lung cancer is hugely increased.

science	Climate change: Hungry nations add the least to global CO2		"The impoverished African nation of Burundi comes top of a list of the world's most food-insecure countries says Christian Aid.The charity argues that Burundi and others are now keenly feeling the impacts of climate change on their food production systems.But Burundi's contribution to rising temperatures is marginal, say experts.In fact, the annual carbon emissions of one Briton is equal to the CO2 produced by over 200 Burundians.Scientists and government officials from all over the world are meeting in Geneva this week to consider how climate change impacts the land and how the lands and forests impact the climate.Their detailed report will be released on Thursday.However, researchers at development charity Christian Aid have put together a study showing how that climate change is now having a disproportionate impact on the food systems of the countries that have done least to produce the carbon emissions that are driving up temperatures.Their study says that the top 10 most food insecure countries all generate less than half a tonne of CO2 per person, and in total just 0.08% of global emissions.Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the worldAs well as Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, Yemen and Sierra Leone make up the top five countries.The rest of the top 10 includes Chad, Malawi, Haiti, Niger and Zambia.Burundians produce 0.027 tonnes of CO2 per person per year. Someone living in Saudi Arabia produces the same as 718 people in Burundi. The equivalent number for the US would be 581 and for Russia 454.The report's authors draw a clear link between rising global temperatures and increasing food security issues.""Our research shows that rising concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are reducing the nutritional quality of the food we eat and that the most vulnerable people to these impacts are those least responsible for rising global CO2 concentrations,"" said Dr Samuel Myers, principal research scientist at Harvard University's department of environmental health.""From this, and other research, what is quite clear is that climate change is not only a global health crisis, it is a moral crisis.""Other researchers say that the report on food insecurity is a warning for rich and poor alike, that climate change is having profound effects on our ability to feed the planet.""These are warning signals that all of us ignore at our peril, for agriculture ultimately is one of the most threatened of our economic sectors and most fundamental for the healthy functioning of our societies and our communities,"" said Dr Doreen Stabinsky, professor of global environmental politics at the College of the Atlantic in Maine, US, who was not involved with the study.""Both the Christian Aid report and the upcoming IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land begin to make clear how serious a threat this is, and how urgently we need to act.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	US top of the garbage pile in global waste crisis		"The world produces over two billion tonnes of municipal solid waste every year, enough to fill over 800,000 Olympic sized swimming pools.Per head of population the worst offenders are the US, as Americans produce three times the global average of waste, including plastic and food.When it comes to recycling, America again lags behind other countries, only re-using 35% of solid waste.Germany is the most efficient country, recycling 68% of material.The study has been compiled by Verisk Maplecroft, a research firm that specialises in global risk,They've developed two new indices, on waste generation and recycling.They've used publically-available data, plus academic research to develop a global picture of how countries are coping at a time when the world is facing a mounting crisis, primarily driven by plastic.The waste generation index shows per capita rates of municipal solid waste, plastic, food and hazardous materials.Municipal solid waste is rubbish that's collected by local authorities from residential, institutional and commercial sources.While the world produces 2.1bn tonnes of this rubbish every year, only 16% is recycled while 46% is disposed of unsustainably.In the analysis, China and India make up over 36% of the global population and account for 27% of the waste.US citizens produce 773kg per head of population, roughly 12% of the global total. Their output is three times that of their Chinese counterparts and seven times more than people living in Ethiopia.Other European countries, including the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and Germany, feature on the list. The UK ranks 14th in the waste index generating 482kg of household waste per person every year.The US is the only developed nation with waste generation that outstrips its ability to recycle.""Where the US is doing badly is the relationship between what it generates and its capacity to recycle,"" said Niall Smith, one of the authors of the report.""And relative to it's high income peers, that's where it is performing poorly.""When it comes to recycling in the US, the issue seems to be one of political will and infrastructure.""I think you see in survey after survey that infrastructure in the US just isn't there to provide the recycling option,"" said Will Nichols, head of environmental research at Verisk Mapelcroft.""A lot of US waste - now that it can't get shipped to China - is just getting burnt, there just isn't the investment in place in infrastructure to deal with this problem.""The banning of waste imports in China, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia is changing the global dynamic. There have been tensions between the government of the Philippines which sent back 69 shipping containers containing waste to Canada.""They (Asian countries) don't want to be the world's dumping ground anymore,"" said Will Nichols.""There's a growing middle class who are not happy with levels of pollution and China because of its political situation has the policy levers to address these issues more quickly than others.""The report suggests there may be a rocky road ahead, especially for businesses. Verisk Maplecroft expects governments to act on waste issues but with businesses footing the bill."
science	Satellite plane-tracking goes global	How does the new system work?How will traffic management change?What are the likely benefits?	"Tracking aeroplanes anywhere in the world just got a lot easier.The US firm Aireon says its new satellite surveillance network is now fully live and being trialled over the North Atlantic.The system employs a constellation of 66 spacecraft, which monitor the situational messages pumped out by aircraft transponders.These report a plane's position, altitude, direction and speed every eight seconds.The two big navigation management companies that marshal plane movements across the North Atlantic - UK Nats and Nav Canada - intend to use Aireon to transform their operations.The more detailed information they now have about the behaviour of aeroplanes means more efficient routing can be introduced.This ought to reduce costs for airlines. Passengers should also experience fewer delays.Neil Wilson, the president and CEO of Nav Canada, called the introduction of the satellite system ""momentous"".His counterpart at UK Nats, Martin Rolfe, called it ""historic"".""As we speak, our air traffic controllers based in Prestwick in Scotland, together with our friends at Nav Canada and the Irish Aviation Authority, are trialling the use of Aireon's realtime data to manage the safe passage of hundreds of flights across the ocean,"" he said.Increasing numbers of planes since the early 2000s have been fitted with Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) transponders. US and European regulators have mandated all aircraft carry this equipment as of next year.ADS-B pushes out a bundle of information about an aircraft - from its identity to a GPS-determined altitude and ground speed. ADS-B was introduced to enhance surveillance and safety over land, but the messages can also be picked up by satellites.Aireon has receivers riding piggyback on all 66 spacecraft of the Iridium sat-phone service provider. These sensors make it possible now to track planes even out over the ocean, beyond the visibility of radar - and ocean waters cover 70% of the globe.The rapid-fire nature of the messaging also means aircraft visibility is virtually continuous. Existing data links only report ocean-crossing aircraft positions every 14 minutes.The limited visibility that has existed up until now means planes moving between Europe and North America have had to use regimented tracks in the sky. The rigid structure maintains large areas of clear space around planes to remove the possibility of a collision.But with the near-realtime surveillance from satellites, it becomes possible to introduce greater flexibility into the management of the airspace.For example, in the North Atlantic, traditional in-line safe separation distances will eventually be reduced from 40 nautical miles (80km) down to as little as 14 nautical miles (25km). As a result, more aircraft will be able to use the most efficient tracks.Increased safety: Air traffic controllers will get earlier notice of planes that have deviated from an agreed flight path, allowing early intervention to prevent situations arising that are potentially dangerous.The big benefits from satellite ADS-B will come over the oceans, but there are also remote land regions that have limited ground infrastructure which the new system can now bolster. Nav Canada, for example, will be making particular use of Aireon in its Arctic sectors.Fuel and CO2 savings: Too many planes crossing the Atlantic are forced to fly at altitudes and speeds that burn unnecessary amounts of fuel.""Eight out of 10 flights will now be able to fly without any kind of speed restriction compared with the far less efficient fixed-speed environment we previously had to operate within,"" Mr Rolfe said. ""These changes, made possible by Aireon, will generate net savings of $300 in fuel and two tonnes of carbon dioxide per flight.""However, any carbon dividend is likely to be eaten into by the growth in traffic made possible by the introduction space-based ADS-B. Today, there are over 500,000 aircraft movements across the North Atlantic each year. This is projected to increase to 800,000 by 2030.Passengers' time: The new system should permit more direct routing, meaning more reliable schedules. Then there's the issue of plane-stacking at congested airports. The practice is a profligate waste of fuel and carbon. It's also a very frustrating experience for passengers. Controllers will aim to use the new system to craft flight profiles so that aircraft can neatly follow each other in to land.""We would like to adopt some of the advanced management techniques that stream the way the aircraft cross the Atlantic, so that they can come in to have a constant descent into Heathrow, etc,"" UK Nats safety director, Alastair Muir, told BBC News in January.""We want to do trials to investigate how we don't have to hold aircraft in domestic airspace.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: Global impacts 'accelerating' - WMO	2018 Climate impacts	"The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says that the physical and financial impacts of global warming are accelerating.Record greenhouse gas levels are driving temperatures to ""increasingly dangerous levels"", it says.Their report comes in the same week as the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported a surge in CO2 in 2018.However, new data from the UK suggests Britain is bucking the trend with emissions down by 3%.This year's State of the Climate report from the WMO is the 25th annual record of the climate.When it first came out in 1993, carbon dioxide levels were at 357 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere. These have now risen to 405.5ppm and are expected to increase further.This is having a significant impact on temperatures, with 2018 the fourth warmest year on record, almost 1C above what they were in the period between 1850-1900.The years between 2015 and 2018 were the four warmest on that record, the study says.""This report makes it very clear that the impacts of climate change are accelerating,"" said Prof Samantha Hepburn who is director of the Centre for Energy and Natural Resource Law at Deakin University in Australia.""We know that if the current trajectory for greenhouse gas concentrations continues, temperatures may increase by 3 - 5 degrees C compared to pre-industrial levels by the end of the century and we have already reached 1 degree.""While some of these figures were published in a preliminary release of the study from last November, the full version has data on many key climate indicators, that the WMO says break new ground.One example is ocean heat content. More than 90% of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases goes into the seas and according to the WMO, 2018 saw new records set for the amount of ocean heat content found in the upper 700 metres of the seas, and also for the upper 2,000 metres.Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook MessengerSea levels also continued to increase with global mean sea level rising 3.7mm higher in 2018 than the previous year.""This report highlights the increase in the rate of sea-level rise, and this is a real concern for those living in low-lying coastal areas, for both developed and developing countries,"" said Dr Sally Brown, a research fellow at the University of Southampton.""We know that sea-level rise is a global problem that will not go away, and efforts need to be made to help those who are really vulnerable to adapt to sea-level rise or move to safer areas.""The head of the WMO say that the signals of warming continue to be seen in events since the turn of the year.""Extreme weather has continued in the early 2019, most recently with Tropical Cyclone Idai, which caused devastating floods and tragic loss of life in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. It may turn out to be one of the deadliest weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere,"" said WMO Secretary General Petteri Taalas.""Idai made landfall over the city of Beira: a rapidly growing, low-lying city on a coastline vulnerable to storm surges and already facing the consequences of sea level rise. Idai's victims personify why we need the global agenda on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction,"" said Mr Taalas.The report has been launched at a news conference in New York attended by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.""There is no longer any time for delay,"" he wrote in a foreword to the new study.However earlier this week the International Energy Agency published worrying data, indicating that in 2018 carbon emissions were up 1.7%, as a result of the fastest growth in energy use in the last six years.The UK government has also released emissions data about greenhouse gas emissions over the past year. The figures show that emissions across the UK have fallen by 3% over the last year, the equivalent the government says, of taking 5 million cars off the road.Factors driving UK emissions down include the fact that coal was the source of just 5% of electricity in 2018.The government now says that carbon emissions are at their lowest level since before the turn of the 20th century, when Queen Victoria was on the throne.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Climate change: Global sea level rise could be bigger than expected	Judgement day	"Scientists believe that global sea levels could rise far more than predicted, due to accelerating melting in Greenland and Antarctica.The long-held view has been that the world's seas would rise by a maximum of just under a metre by 2100.This new study, based on expert opinions, projects that the real level may be around double that figure.This could lead to the displacement of hundreds of millions of people, the authors say.The question of sea-level rise was one of the most controversial issues raised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), when it published its fifth assessment report in 2013.It said the continued warming of the planet, without major reductions in emissions, would see global waters rising by between 52cm and 98cm by 2100.Many experts believe this was a very conservative estimate.Ice scientists are also concerned that the models currently used to predict the influence of huge ice sheets on sea levels don't capture all of the uncertainties about how these are now melting.To try to get a clearer picture, some of the leading researchers in the field carried out what is termed a structured expert judgement study, where the scientists make predictions based on their knowledge and understanding of what is happening in Greenland, West and East Antarctica.In the researchers' view, if emissions continue on the current trajectory then the world's seas would be very likely to rise by between 62cm and 238cm by 2100. This would be in a world that had warmed by around 5C - one of the worst-case scenarios for global warming.""For 2100, the ice sheet contribution is very likely in the range of 7-178cm but once you add in glaciers and ice caps outside the ice sheets and thermal expansion of the seas, you tip well over two metres,"" said lead author Prof Jonathan Bamber from the University of Bristol.The IPCC report in 2013 only considered what is ""likely"" to happen, which in scientific terms means they looked at 17-83% of the range of possibilities.This new study looks at a broader range of results, covering 5-95% of the estimates.For expected temperature rises up to 2C, Greenland's ice sheet remains the single biggest contributor to sea-level rise. However, as temperatures go beyond this, the much larger Antarctic ice sheets start to come into play.""When you start to look at these lower likelihood but still plausible values, then the experts believe that there is a small but statistically significant probability that West Antarctica will transition to a very unstable state and parts of East Antarctica will start contributing as well,"" said Prof Bamber.""But it's only at these higher probabilities for 5C that we see those type of behaviours kicking in.""According to the authors, this scenario would have huge implications for the planet.They calculate that the world would lose an area of land equal to 1.79 million square kilometres - equivalent to the size of Libya.Much of the land losses would be in important food growing areas such as the delta of the Nile. Large swathes of Bangladesh would be very difficult for people to continue to live in. Major global cities, including London, New York and Shanghai would be under threat.""To put this into perspective, the Syrian refugee crisis resulted in about a million refugees coming into Europe,"" said Prof Bamber.""That is about 200 times smaller than the number of people who would be displaced in a 2m sea-level rise.""The authors emphasise that there is still time to avoid these type of scenarios, if major cuts in emissions take place over the coming decades. They acknowledge that the chances of hitting the high end of this range are small, around 5%, but they should not be discounted, according to the lead author.""If I said to you that there was a one in 20 chance that if you crossed the road you would be squashed you wouldn't go near it,"" said Prof Bamber.""Even a 1% probability means that a one in a hundred year flood is something that could happen in your lifetime. I think that a 5% probability, crikey - I think that's a serious risk.""Other experts in the field said that the findings of the expert group were significant.""This kind of survey of experts is important, because computer models are not perfect at predicting the future,"" said Dr Tamsin Edwards from King's College London.""Here they took the eight most accurate of 22 experts on Antarctica and Greenland and combined their judgements about the future. The ice sheets are losing ice at increasing rates, and we can't rule out high values of sea level rise, though it's also important to note they're unlikely - especially as we are starting to put policies in place to avoid such a high level of warming.""The study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Sign up for a chat about climate change on Facebook MessengerFollow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Bigger hurricanes are now more damaging		"The biggest and most damaging hurricanes are now three times more frequent than they were 100 years ago, say researchers.Using a new method of calculating the destruction, the scientists say the increase in frequency is ""unequivocal"".Previous attempts to isolate the impact of climate change on hurricanes have often came up with conflicting results.But the new study says the increase in damage caused by these big cyclones is linked by global warming.Hurricanes or tropical cyclones are one of the most destructive natural disasters. The damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was estimated to be $125bn, roughly 1% of US GDP.One of the big questions that scientists have wrestled with is how to compare storm events from different eras. Is the increase in financial damages recorded over the last century simply down to the fact there are now more people living in the paths of hurricanes, who are generally wealthier?Previous research has concluded that the rise in damages was related to wealth, and not to any statistically significant change in frequency.However this new paper challenges that view.Instead of looking at economic damage, the authors looked at the amount of land that was totally destroyed by more than 240 storms between 1900 and 2018, based on insurance industry databases.As an example, the researchers examined Hurricane Irma that hit Florida in 2017.Around 1.1 million people were living inside the 10,000 sq km closest to the storm's landfall.With the wealth per capita estimated to be $194,000, the scientists concluded that the overall wealth in this 10,000 sq km region was $215bn.As the storm caused $50bn worth of damage, this was 23% of the wealth in the region. Taking 23% of the 10,000 sq km gave an area of total destruction of 2,300 sq km.By working out similar figures for events across the last century, the researchers were able to make what they say are more realistic comparisons in terms of damage over the decades.The authors found that the frequency of the most damaging hurricanes had increased by a rate of 330% per century.And they believe that is mainly due to rising temperatures.""Our data reveal an emergent positive trend in damage which we attribute to a detectable change in extreme storms due to global warming,"" they write.The scientists involved believe their new method is solid and gives a more accurate picture of what is happening with the worst storms.""The new method of looking at the frequencies is really robust,"" said Aslak Grinsted, from the University of Copenhagen, who carried out the study.""The increase in frequency is not only in my own dataset but is also present in other datasets, so it is extremely robust, and I think that will help it become more accepted.""The study has been published in the journal PNAS.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Spain offers to host COP25 in Madrid		"Just a day after the President of Chile said his country could no longer hold the world's annual climate conference, Spain has offered to host it in Madrid.The critical meeting, called COP25, was due to take place in Santiago for two weeks from 3 December.Chilean President Sebastián Piñera said his government needed ""to prioritise re-establishing public order"" after serious anti-government protests.Spain's offer will be considered by the UN's climate body next week.The Spanish government said it considered multilateral action on climate change to be a priority for the UN.The annual Conference of the Parties (COP) is usually an important moment for taking stock of where the world stands on climate change.For a quarter of a century, negotiators from almost 200 countries have gathered to try to advance a global strategy for tackling rising temperatures.However, COP25 has become a problem with country after country finding reasons not to host.COP25 was originally supposed to be held in Brazil. But in November last year, just two months after being announced as the summit's host nation, then President-elect Jair Bolsonaro pulled out.Chile cancels global climate summit amid unrestThe far-right leader said this was due to the change of government and budget restrictions, according to local media.However, he had recently chosen a foreign minister who claimed ""climate alarmism"" was just a plot by ""cultural Marxists"".A month later, Chile was selected to host the climate conference instead. Costa Rica, the other frontrunner, withdrew because of the costs involved in hosting.With tens of thousands of delegates making plans to travel to Chile for the meeting, the abrupt cancellation on Wednesday by President Piñera was a real shock.Citing the need for public safety, he withdrew his country's offer to host both the COP and the Apec meeting, where President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping were due to meet.Many involved in climate negotiations presumed that the meeting would take place in Bonn, Germany, home to the UNFCCC secretariat, at some point in the near future.Now, according to a statement from acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Spain has volunteered Madrid as an alternative location. The Chileans have accepted and are recommending it to the UN.It seems that Chile will still hold the presidency of the COP but it will simply be held in Spain, if the UNFCCC agrees.There is a precedent for this approach, with the 2017 COP23 held in Bonn, but it was presided over by Fiji.Around 25,000 people are expected to attend the summit.One of the most celebrated is Greta Thunberg who had crossed the ocean by yacht in order to travel to Chile in the most low-carbon manner.She is now in Los Angeles - it remains to be seen if she will be able to get to Madrid on time if the Spanish capital is accepted as the new home of COP25.Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's global climate lead, said: ""It's a shame that COP25 won't be held in Latin America to highlight some of the grave climate impacts that affect the region.""But hopefully a Madrid summit will be able to keep those in mind. Credit should be given to the Spanish government for offering to help at such short notice considering these often take more than a year to organise.""But it shows how important countries view the UN process for tackling climate change that they are prepared to do all they can to keep the talks on track.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Bird extinctions 'driven' by global food trade		"About 100 bird species are predicted to become extinct based on current farming and forestry practices, according to a new global analysis.This number has increased by 7% over the first ten years of this century alone, say scientists.They say the biggest factor is cattle farming, but the impact of oil seed crops like palm and soy is growing fast.By comparison, an estimated 140 birds have been lost over the past 400 years.International researchers used bird extinction as a measure of the loss of biodiversity - the variety of plant and animal life in the world or in a particular habitat - linked with international trade in food and timber.Five key things about the extinction crisisWhy we may soon have no bananas (again)Mass extinctions 'offer cautionary tale'The research, published in the journal, Nature Ecology & Evolution, shows that international trade can drive threats to animal species far from the countries where the goods are consumed.In 2011, about a third of biodiversity impacts in Central and South America, and a quarter in Africa were driven by the consumption of goods in other parts of the world, says the team.The issue of biodiversity loss cannot be addressed without adding remote responsibility, i.e. people taking responsibility for the goods they buy at the supermarket, said co-researcher, Prof Henrique Pereira of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) in Leipzig, Germany.""We have to provide more information for consumers on that - so that they know what they are buying,"" he told BBC News.Co-researcher Alexandra Marques added: ""We must address unsustainable patterns of consumption driven by economic growth. Our choices here will have consequences elsewhere.""The researchers estimated the number of bird species at risk of extinction due to the conversion of natural habitat to land for agriculture and forestry between 2000 and 2011.They came up with a figure of as many as 121 bird species predicted to go extinct in the future if there is no change to current land use.(By comparison, an estimated 140 bird species have been lost globally since the beginning of the 16th century).Ariel Brunner of conservation group, BirdLife Europe, said the study adds to a growing body of evidence showing that unsustainable food and farming system is ""at the very heart of the ecological crisis - both in terms of driving the collapse of biodiversity and contributing to climate change"".Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Global insect decline may see 'plague of pests'	Pests on the rise	"A scientific review of insect numbers suggests that 40% of species are undergoing ""dramatic rates of decline"" around the world.The study says that bees, ants and beetles are disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles.But researchers say that some species, such as houseflies and cockroaches, are likely to boom.The general insect decline is being caused by intensive agriculture, pesticides and climate change.Insects make up the majority of creatures that live on land, and provide key benefits to many other species, including humans.They provide food for birds, bats and small mammals; they pollinate around 75% of the crops in the world; they replenish soils and keep pest numbers in check.Many other studies in recent years have shown that individual species of insects, such as bees, have suffered huge declines, particularly in developed economies.But this new paper takes a broader look.Published in the journal Biological Conservation, it reviews 73 existing studies from around the world published over the past13 years.The researchers found that declines in almost all regions may lead to the extinction of 40% of insects over the next few decades. One-third of insect species are classed as Endangered.""The main factor is the loss of habitat, due to agricultural practices, urbanisation and deforestation,"" lead author Dr Francisco Sánchez-Bayo, from the University of Sydney, told BBC News.""Second is the increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture worldwide and contamination with chemical pollutants of all kinds. Thirdly, we have biological factors, such as invasive species and pathogens; and fourthly, we have climate change, particularly in tropical areas where it is known to have a big impact.""Some of the highlights of study include the recent, rapid decline of flying insects in Germany, and the massive drop in numbers in tropical forests in Puerto Rico, linked to rising global temperatures.Other experts say the findings are ""gravely sobering"".""It's not just about bees, or even about pollination and feeding ourselves - the declines also include dung beetles that recycle waste and insects like dragonflies that start life in rivers and ponds,"" said Matt Shardlow from UK campaigners Buglife.""It is becoming increasingly obvious our planet's ecology is breaking and there is a need for an intense and global effort to halt and reverse these dreadful trends. Allowing the slow eradication of insect life to continue is not a rational option.""The authors are concerned about the impact of insect decline up along the food chain. With many species of birds, reptiles and fish depending on insects as their main food source, it's likely that these species may also be wiped out as a result.While some of our most important insect species are in retreat, the review also finds that a small number of species are likely to be able to adapt to changing conditions and do well.""Fast-breeding pest insects will probably thrive because of the warmer conditions, because many of their natural enemies, which breed more slowly, will disappear, "" said Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex who was not involved in the review.""It's quite plausible that we might end up with plagues of small numbers of pest insects, but we will lose all the wonderful ones that we want, like bees and hoverflies and butterflies and dung beetles that do a great job of disposing of animal waste.""Prof Goulson said that some tough, adaptable, generalist species - like houseflies and cockroaches - seem to be able to live comfortably in a human-made environment and have evolved resistance to pesticides.He added that while the overall message was alarming, there were things that people could do, such as making their gardens more insect friendly, not using pesticides and buying organic food.More research is also badly needed as 99% of the evidence for insect decline comes from Europe and North America with almost nothing from Africa or South America.Ultimately, if huge numbers of insects disappear, they will be replaced but it will take a long, long time.""If you look at what happened in the major extinctions of the past, they spawned massive adaptive radiations where the few species that made it through adapted and occupied all the available niches and evolved into new species,"" Prof Goulson told BBC News.""So give it a million years and I've no doubt there will be a whole diversity of new creatures that will have popped up to replace the ones wiped out in the 20th and 21st centuries.""Not much consolation for our children, I'm afraid."""
science	'Reasons to be hopeful' on 1.5C global temperature target		Dutch scientist Dr Heleen de Coninck is one of the co-ordinating lead authors of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on 1.5C which will be released next Monday in South Korea. Speaking to the BBC before the start of the negotiations in Incheon, she explained what her role involves and why, despite the enormous climate challenge facing the world, she believes there are some hopeful signs.How did you become an IPCC scientist and what do you do?You become one when you are nominated by your own government. So in my case I was nominated by the Netherlands government and the European Commission. There is a selection process with the IPCC because they want a certain mix of nationalities and science backgrounds, and they want different disciplines represented.It's basically added responsibility to your normal job of teaching or doing research or work in an NGO or in a companyYou read all of the scientific literature. You discuss with your other authors how you like to represent the literature in a chapter and you write the chapter. The chapters are sent out to other experts for comments, and you have to answer all those.In the last round we had 4,400 comments on the chapter that I'm in, and we have to respond to every individual. That's a lot of work!And you do all this and you don't get paid for it?For most of us, our institutions think it's important that's why we do this work, so my university in the Netherlands helped with getting other people to do part of my teaching for instance. But yes it's a bit of challenge.Why does it take so long?We've actually put this report together at record speed! This report took a year and a half between when the authors first met to this meeting in Korea.What you will be doing in Korea and why is it important?We have produced a short overall summary of our report called the Summary for Policymakers - this 20 page document is a distillation of 6,000 research papers! The government representatives who we will meet with in Korea, will want to change some things and our role is to make sure that the changes they are making are consistent with the underlying report and that they do reflect really what the science is saying about behavioural change or innovation or everything related to 1.5CSo are the governments the boss when it comes to your report?Yes and no. The governments approve an outline, and we have to follow those bullet points. We, as authors however determine what we write in the report and they review it and we take their comments very seriously as they improve the quality of the final product.In Korea, we will go through the short Summary for Policymakers, line by line. The summary is negotiated by the governments, we write a draft but they actually determine the final outcome of that, unless it is not consistent with the underlying report, then we as authors should speak up.Many people think that perhaps we can tackle climate change with technology - do you think that's something that will be needed in the future?If we go on the way the way we are living at the moment with our high-energy usage, high consumption lifestyles, it is hard to stay consistent with the 1.5C temperature scenarios, that's very clear.So we will need all kinds of changes, and technological changes are part of that.One thing that is in the news is negative emissions technology, at some point we should not only prevent the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, we may have to remove these gases from the atmosphere. That's fairly new technology, so we are not there yet.Can we keep temperatures down if everyone goes vegan? Can we do it with lifestyle changes.It won't be enough by itself. Agriculture is a huge part of global emissions, not only through the farts and burps of cattle but also through the land use change to grow food for those cattle - lots of the soya produced in countries with high deforestation rates is for feeding animals for meat and dairy.If you go completely vegan you would still have a lot of emissions from energy use and transport and electricity production. We don't have that thought experiment in the report but my hunch would be that it would still be enough to go past 1.5C - but going vegan would help a lot!Some people might argue that keeping temperatures below 1.5C is all down to governments and has nothing to do with me?There's always an interaction between what individuals do and what governments do and private companies do - governments can make policies that influence individuals, you can see that very clearly if you compare emissions per person in the United States with Europe - countries with similar levels of income and development but very different lifestyles in terms of car ownership and even diet. Lifestyle matters!How will this report impact the lives of younger people? What do you think would be the potential impact on young people?A report of course does not change the world, but if, as a consequence of this governments agreed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C that would mean a completely different way of transporting ourselves in rich and poor countries, it would mean a completely different way of using energy in households, of generating electricity, how we make our products, how much plastic would be used, and how we feed ourselves.The decisions we make now about whether we let 1.5 or 2 degrees or more happen will change the world enormously. But our lives when keeping it below 1.5C with projected population rise and economic growth will also look differently.The lives of people will never be the same again either way, but we can influence which future we end up with.Are there reasons to be optimistic?Personally I am hopeful. We're seeing some countries making serious plans to be consistent with 1.5C, we are seeing costs of renewable energies drop. Many people are adopting low-emission lifestyles, and for instance don't fly anymore. Even the costs of some negative emission technologies are dropping so we are seeing some hopeful signs.The IPCC also tries to be more solution-oriented rather than only flagging and analysing problems.There's really good reasons to really start working now! I'm not sure about optimism, but I think that losing hope is never a good idea.
science	Climate change: Electrical industry's 'dirty secret' boosts warming	So why are we using more of this powerful warming gas?How do we know that SF6 is increasing?How does SF6 get into the atmosphere?How damaging to the climate is this gas?Why hasn't this been banned?What do regulator and electrical companies say about the gas?Are there alternatives - and are they very expensive?Some companies are feeling the winds of changeWhat happens next ?	"It's the most powerful greenhouse gas known to humanity, and emissions have risen rapidly in recent years, the BBC has learned.Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, is widely used in the electrical industry to prevent short circuits and accidents.But leaks of the little-known gas in the UK and the rest of the EU in 2017 were the equivalent of putting an extra 1.3 million cars on the road.Levels are rising as an unintended consequence of the green energy boom.Cheap and non-flammable, SF6 is a colourless, odourless, synthetic gas. It makes a hugely effective insulating material for medium and high-voltage electrical installations.It is widely used across the industry, from large power stations to wind turbines to electrical sub-stations in towns and cities. It prevents electrical accidents and fires.However, the significant downside to using the gas is that it has the highest global warming potential of any known substance. It is 23,500 times more warming than carbon dioxide (CO2).Just one kilogram of SF6 warms the Earth to the same extent as 24 people flying London to New York return.It also persists in the atmosphere for a long time, warming the Earth for at least 1,000 years.The way we make electricity around the world is changing rapidly.Where once large coal-fired power stations brought energy to millions, the drive to combat climate change means they are now being replaced by mixed sources of power including wind, solar and gas.This has resulted in many more connections to the electricity grid, and a rise in the number of electrical switches and circuit breakers that are needed to prevent serious accidents.Collectively, these safety devices are called switchgear. The vast majority use SF6 gas to quench arcs and stop short circuits.""As renewable projects are getting bigger and bigger, we have had to use it within wind turbines specifically,"" said Costa Pirgousis, an engineer with Scottish Power Renewables on its new East Anglia wind farm, which doesn't use SF6 in turbines.""As we are putting in more and more turbines, we need more and more switchgear and, as a result, more SF6 is being introduced into big turbines off shore.""It's been proven for years and we know how it works, and as a result it is very reliable and very low maintenance for us offshore.""Across the entire UK network of power lines and substations, there are around one million kilograms of SF6 installed.A study from the University of Cardiff found that across all transmission and distribution networks, the amount used was increasing by 30-40 tonnes per year.This rise was also reflected across Europe with total emissions from the 28 member states in 2017 equivalent to 6.73 million tonnes of CO2. That's the same as the emissions from 1.3 million extra cars on the road for a year.Researchers at the University of Bristol who monitor concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere say they have seen significant rises in the last 20 years.""We make measurements of SF6 in the background atmosphere,"" said Dr Matt Rigby, reader in atmospheric chemistry at Bristol.""What we've seen is that the levels have increased substantially, and we've seen almost a doubling of the atmospheric concentration in the last two decades.""The most important means by which SF6 gets into the atmosphere is from leaks in the electricity industry.Electrical company Eaton, which manufactures switchgear without SF6, says its research indicates that for the full life-cycle of the product, leaks could be as high as 15% - much higher than many other estimates.Louis Shaffer, electrical business manager at Eaton, said: ""The newer gear has very low leak rates but the key question is do you have newer gear?""We looked at all equipment and looked at the average of all those leak rates, and we didn't see people taking into account the filling of the gas. Plus, we looked at how you recycle it and return it and also included the catastrophic leaks.""Concentrations in the atmosphere are very small right now, just a fraction of the amount of CO2 in the air.However, the global installed base of SF6 is expected to grow by 75% by 2030.Another concern is that SF6 is a synthetic gas and isn't absorbed or destroyed naturally. It will all have to be replaced and destroyed to limit the impact on the climate.Developed countries are expected to report every year to the UN on how much SF6 they use, but developing countries do not face any restrictions on use.Right now, scientists are detecting concentrations in the atmosphere that are 10 times the amount declared by countries in their reports. Scientists say this is not all coming from countries like India, China and South Korea.One study found that the methods used to calculate emissions in richer countries ""severely under-reported"" emissions over the past two decades.SF6 comes under a group of human-produced substances known as F-gases. The European Commission tried to prohibit a number of these environmentally harmful substances, including gases in refrigeration and air conditioning, back in 2014.But they faced strong opposition from industries across Europe.""In the end, the electrical industry lobby was too strong and we had to give in to them,"" said Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout, who was responsible for the attempt to regulate F-gases.""The electric sector was very strong in arguing that if you want an energy transition, and you have to shift more to electricity, you will need more electric devices. And then you also will need more SF6.""They used the argument that otherwise the energy transition would be slowed down.""Everyone is trying to reduce their dependence on the gas, as it is universally recognised as harmful to the climate.In the UK, energy regulator Ofgem says it is working with utilities to try to limit leaks of the gas.""We are using a range of tools to make sure that companies limit their use of SF6, a potent greenhouse gas, where this is in the interest of energy consumers,"" an Ofgem spokesperson told BBC News.""This includes funding innovation trials and rewarding companies to research and find alternatives, setting emissions targets, rewarding companies that beat those targets, and penalising those that miss them.""The question of alternatives to SF6 has been contentious over recent years.For high-voltage applications, experts say there are very few solutions that have been rigorously tested.""There is no real alternative that is proven,"" said Prof Manu Haddad from the school of engineering at Cardiff University.""There are some that are being proposed now but to prove their operation over a long period of time is a risk that many companies don't want to take.""However, for medium voltage operations there are several tried-and-tested materials. Some in the industry say that the conservative nature of the electrical industry is the key reason that few want to change to a less harmful alternative.""I will tell you, everyone in this industry knows you can do this; there is not a technical reason not to do it,"" said Louis Shaffer from Eaton.""It's not really economic; it's more a question that change takes effort and if you don't have to, you won't do it.""Sitting in the North Sea some 43km from the Suffolk coast, Scottish Power Renewables has installed one of world's biggest wind farms where the turbines will be free of SF6 gas.East Anglia One will see 102 of these towering generators erected, with the capacity to produce up to 714MW (megawatts) of power by 2020, enough to supply half a million homes.Previously, an installation like this would have used switchgear supplied with SF6, to prevent the electrical accidents that can lead to fires.Each turbine would normally have contained around 5kg of SF6, which, if it leaked into the atmosphere, would add the equivalent of around 117 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is roughly the same as the annual emissions from 25 cars.""In this case we are using a combination of clean air and vacuum technology within the turbine. It allows us to still have a very efficient, reliable, high-voltage network but to also be environmentally friendly,"" said Costa Pirgousis from Scottish Power Renewables.""Once there are viable alternatives on the market, there is no reason not to use them. In this case, we've got a viable alternative and that's why we are using it.""But even for companies that are trying to limit the use of SF6, there are still limitations. At the heart of East Anglia One sits a giant offshore substation to which all 102 turbines will connect. It still uses significant quantities of the highly warming gas.The EU will review the use of SF6 next year and will examine whether alternatives are available. However, even the most optimistic experts don't think that any ban is likely to be put in place before 2025.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC."
science	Climate change: Scientists to report on ocean 'emergency' caused by warming	First things first, how are the oceans connected to the climate system?How is warming changing our relationship with the oceans and ice?Will this report be all about sea level rise?What other impacts on the seas will the report look at?What about glaciers and frozen regions?Surely there are some positives in this report?	"It will be the clearest declaration yet on how an overheating world is hammering our oceans and frozen regions.Scientists have been meeting in Monaco to finalise a report on the seas and the cryosphere.Released on Wednesday, it will show how the oceans have been a friend, helping us cope with rising temperatures.But it will warn that warming is turning the seas into a huge potential threat to humanity.Researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were encouraged by Prince Albert II and the Monaco government in 2015 to produce a special report on the oceans and cryosphere - the Earth's surface where water is frozen solid.For the past three years, the scientists have been reviewing hundreds of published papers on how climate change affects the seas, the poles and glaciers.Their report will track the flow of water from the frozen tops of mountains to the bottom of the seas, and how this is changing in a warmer world.Over the past few days, they have been trying to agree a short summary of their findings with government representatives that will be published on Wednesday.It will likely detail the growing threat from rising sea levels that could imperil hundreds of millions of people before the end of this century.It will also warn of the threat posed by the growing acidification of the seas, the threats to coral and fisheries and the possibility that warming might melt permafrost, releasing huge amounts of the CO2 gas that's the key to rising temperatures.""At current emissions rates, we are effectively dumping one million tonnes of CO2 into the oceans every hour,"" said Melissa Wang, a scientist with Greenpeace.""Unless we accelerate efforts to curb carbon emissions and take greater steps to protect our oceans, there will be devastating human, environmental and economic consequences.""The oceans are like the big sister that constantly has to bail out her careless younger sibling. Every year, the ocean waters soak up about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emissions that arise from human activities.Since 1970, the oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat that's come about through global warming. If they hadn't taken in that warming, the surface of the planet would have been devastated by excess heating.All this absorption has come at a price, though. Our seas are now warmer, less salty and more acidic as a result.""The reality is that we have been quietly reliant on the ocean to do these things, but there comes a point where the ocean changes because of the scale of what we are doing,"" Prof Dan Laffoley, from the International Union to Conserve Nature, told BBC News.The heating of the world is having a profound impact on all things frozen. So the IPCC report will look at the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as well as from glaciers on mountains around the planet.It will chart the rise of CO2 that is making the waters more acidic and more difficult for sea life. It will also link the warming to the rise of ""superstorms"".One of the big changes has been in the impact of warming on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which has grown substantially in recent decades.These frozen regions are critically important for global sea levels, which impact flooding around the world.As documented by my colleague David Shukman, this year has been one of record melting on the gigantic frozen island of Greenland.In one day alone it lost 12.5 billion tonnes of ice.Antarctica has also enormous capacity to raise the waters around the world.According to studies, the amount of ice lost from the vast frozen region increased six-fold per year between 1979-1990 and 2009-2017.It is likely that much of the report will focus on the growing threat posed by rising sea waters. There is an expectation that some of the existing predictions for sea level will be revised upwards, with the threat posed to small island states and large cities increasing substantially by the middle of this century.""By the end of this century, and if current adaptation efforts are not substantially scaled up, we must expect high levels of risk on low coasts such as atoll islands like the Maldives, and some Arctic communities even in a low-emission scenario,"" said Alexandre Magnan, a research fellow at the policy research institute IDDRI in Paris, and a co-author of the IPCC Ocean Report.""In a higher-emission scenario, even wealthy megacities such as New York or Shanghai and large tropical agricultural deltas such as the Mekong will face high or very high risks.""The estimations for the centuries beyond 2100 will be even more stark, with suggestions that sea level rise could be 100 times higher than today.""What happens with sea level rise is not disconnected with what happens with warming,"" said Jane Lubchenco, former administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a co-chair of the expert group of a High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.""Because the ocean is warming we are getting more intense storms. Because the ocean is rising the impact of storm surge from those storms has much more potential.""It will also look at the increase in marine heatwaves - these could increase by a factor of 50 by 2100. This will have big implications for ecosystems and will increase coral bleaching.""Extreme sea level events, such as surges from tropical cyclones, that are currently historically rare, for example today's 100-year event, will become common by 2100 under all emissions scenarios,"" said Jean-Pierre Gattuso, an IPCC author and a CNRS research scientist at Sorbonne University.""This will have major consequences for many low-lying megacities and small islands.""However, the report will also look at ocean acidification and will show how climate change is changing the balance.There will also be sections on coral reefs and there will also be a focus on fishing and fish stock, which are likely to suffer dramatic declines.For people living in the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush, a warmer future means that at first they will get too much water from glaciers as they melt. Then there will be too little.A report last year stated that two-thirds of these giant ice fields could disappear by the end of the century without rapid emissions cuts. This could have huge implications for the millions of people living in the region.The IPCC report will also document the threat posed by warming to permafrost.Some 30-99% of the Northern Hemisphere's permanently frozen soils could melt by the end of the century, freeing up billions of tonnes of CO2 which could in turn accelerate warming to a new, ever more dangerous level.Yes - the report will also show that the oceans could hold some important solutions to the threats posed by climate change.There is great scope for renewable energy systems based on the oceans, while cutting carbon from shipping would be a major step forward. Planting more mangroves and sea grass could remove huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.Even the potential to switch diets to get more of our protein from the oceans would likely help cut carbon.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Warming to drive 'robust increase' in UK flooding		"Coastal areas in the UK and Northern Europe will experience an increase in ""compound flooding"" in coming decades say researchers.These events, where storm surges and heavy rainfall combine, will become more common thanks to rising global temperatures.Devon, Cornwall and the Bristol channel may become ""hotspots"" with events seen more than once every six years.The study is published in the journal Science Advances.Researchers say that floods on the Avon in Bristol in 2014 and in Ravenna in Italy in 2015 are both good examples of compound events that have caused significant losses to people and property.These events are marked by a combination of storm surge and heavy rainfall, sometimes driven by the same low pressure system.Storm surges can be made worse with heavy precipitation but they can also cause trouble by blocking or slowing down the draining of a river into the sea following a period of sustained rainfall.Despite the fact that they often occur at the same time, risk assessment planners generally see the storm surge and rainfall as separate events.This new study uses computer models to asses the current climate, and shows that around 3% of coastal areas experience compound flooding events more than once every six years.At the moment, these are mainly in the Mediterranean, around the Gulf of Valencia in Spain, Algeria, the Gulf of Lyon in France and in southern Turkey.The continent wide analysis suggests that the difficulties posed by compound events will increase in a warmer world, and will move to threaten Northern Europe far more than they do at present.According to the modelling carried out by the team of researchers, ""compound flooding is projected to robustly increase along the west coast of Great Britain, Northern France, and along the east and south coast of the North Sea"".The report say that the fractions of coastlines expected to see return periods of lower than six years is projected to increase from the present 3% to 11% by the end of the century.""There will be a higher probability of experiencing concurring storm surges and heavy precipitation and these might lead to increased compound flooding especially in river mouths and low lying coastal areas,"" said lead author Dr Emanuele Bevacqua from the University of Reading, UK.""In northern European areas it is mainly drive by changes in precipitation,"" he told BBC News.While the research is broad brush, it does identify hotspots where the return period for compound flooding events will be below the projected six years. These include the Bristol Channel, parts of Devon and Cornwall as well as the Dutch and German North Sea coasts.The west Norwegian coast near Bergen will see a fivefold increase in potential compound flood frequency.While the well documented threat from rising seas driven by climate change will increase flood risk in many parts, the researchers involved with this study are at pains to point out that the compound flood threat is an additional threat.""It is not only changing because of sea level rise, but also because there will be changes in the storminess with higher precipitation intensities which will lead to higher compound flooding in northern Europe,"" said Dr Bevacqua.Other researchers in the field say the question of compound events have been ignored for a long time, mainly because of limitations in statistical tools and computational resources.""The results are relevant as they point to hotspots where compound flooding may already pose a risk and where it may increase in the future, requiring attention by decision-makers when planning adequate adaptation strategies,"" said Prof Thomas Wahl from the University of Central Florida in Orlando, who was not involved in this new study.""The modelling framework that was used in the study furthermore allows us to disentangle the role of the different compound flood drivers in modulating the future compound flood risk, whether it's changes in the sea level component, or precipitation, or both.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Current warming 'unparalleled' in 2,000 years		"The speed and extent of current global warming exceeds any similar event in the past 2,000 years, researchers say.They show that famous historic events like the ""Little Ice Age"" don't compare with the scale of warming seen over the last century.The research suggests that the current warming rate is higher than any observed previously.The scientists say it shows many of the arguments used by climate sceptics are no longer valid.When scientists have surveyed the climatic history of our world over the past centuries a number of key eras have stood out.These ranged from the ""Roman Warm Period"", which ran from AD 250 to AD 400, and saw unusually warm weather across Europe, to the famed Little Ice Age, which saw temperatures drop for centuries from the 1300s.The events were seen by some as evidence that the world has warmed and cooled many times over the centuries and that the warming seen in the world since the industrial revolution was part of that pattern and therefore nothing to be alarmed about.Three new research papers show that argument is on shaky ground.The science teams reconstructed the climate conditions that existed over the past 2,000 years using 700 proxy records of temperature changes, including tree rings, corals and lake sediments. They determined that none of these climate events occurred on a global scale.The researchers say that, for example, the Little Ice Age was at its strongest in the Pacific Ocean in the 15th Century, while in Europe it was the 17th Century.Generally, any longer-term peaks or troughs in temperature could be detected in no more than half the globe at any one time,The ""Medieval Warm Period"", which ran between AD 950 and AD 1250 only saw significant temperature rises across 40% of the Earth's surface.Today's warming, by contrast, impacts the vast majority of the world.""We find that the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the 20th Century for more than 98% of the globe,"" one of the papers states.""This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic (human induced) global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years.""What the researchers saw is that prior to the modern industrial era, the most significant influence on climate was volcanoes. They found no indication that variations in the Sun's radiation impacted mean global temperatures.The current period, say the authors, significantly exceeds natural variability.""We see from the instrumental data and also from our reconstruction that in the recent past the warming rate clearly exceeds the natural warming rates that we calculated - that's another view to look at the extraordinary nature of the present warming,"" said Dr Raphael Neukom, from the University of Bern, Switzerland.While the researchers did not set out to test whether humans were the chief influence on the current climate, their findings indicate clearly that this is the case.""We do not focus on looking at what's causing the most recent warming as this has been done many times and the evidence is always agreeing that it is the anthropogenic cause,"" said Dr Neukom.""We do not explicitly test this; we can only show that natural causes are not sufficient from our data to actually cause the spatial pattern and the warming rate that we are observing now.""Other scientists have been impressed with the quality of the new studies.""They have done this across the globe with more than 700 records over the past 2,000 years; they have corals and lakes and also instrumental data,"" said Prof Daniela Schmidt from the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved with the studies.""And they have been very careful in assessing the data and the inherent bias that any data has, so the quality of this data and the coverage of this data is the real major advance here; it is amazing.""Many experts say that this new work debunks many of the claims made by climate sceptics in recent decades.""This paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle,"" said Prof Mark Maslin, from University College London, UK, who wasn't part of the studies.""This paper shows the truly stark difference between regional and localised changes in climate of the past and the truly global effect of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions.""The three papers have been published in the journals Nature (1) and Nature Geoscience (2), (3)."
science	Climate change: Heatwave made up to 3C hotter by warming		"The searing July heatwave that hit Europe last week was made both more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change, scientists say.A rapid attribution study says that heating added up to 3C to the intensity of the event that scorched the UK, France and the Netherlands.In France, the heatwave was made at least 10 times and up to 100 times more likely by human activities.The shorter event in the UK was made at least twice as likely, experts say.The World Weather Attribution Group has carried out a number of similar studies in recent years to work out the impact of climate change on extreme events.This new report looks at the July heatwave that saw temperatures soar above 40C in many countries including Belgium, France and the Netherlands.In Paris, the mercury smashed through a historic high of 40.4C. It beat the record by more than 2 degrees, to the new mark of 42.6C.In the UK, the heat event only lasted 1-2 days but a new record was set at Cambridge University's botanic garden with 38.7C.Researchers combined information from both long term temperature observations and climate models to look at how the events would have unfolded with or without the human influence on the climate.Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the worldSo when they look at France they can say that the chances of having a heatwave like the one that struck last week were made more likely by at least a factor of 10, but could in fact have been up to 100 times.""We conclude that such an event would have had an extremely small probability to occur (less than about once every 1,000 years) without climate change in France,"" the study says.The picture across Europe was the same say researchers.""Every European heatwave we and others have analysed was found to be made much more likely and more intense due to human-induced climate change, so it was not surprising that climate change played a role,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.""But how much more likely the heatwave is depends very strongly on the event definition: location, season, intensity and duration. This July 2019 heatwave was so extreme over continental Western Europe that the observed magnitudes would have been extremely unlikely without climate change.""The researchers say the intensity of the heatwave was increased by between 1.5 and 3C.""When I bicycled home from work last week it was still 37.1 degrees,"" said co-author Dr Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, from KNMI in the Netherlands.""I would have felt a difference at 34C - you don't need a thermometer anymore to notice a difference.""While the event lasted little more than a day in the UK, the researchers estimate that climate change made it at least twice as likely. The impact on intensity was estimated to be between 1.5 and 2.5C.The researchers also talk about the likely return period of these events - meaning the chances of having another one of the same magnitude. For Cambridge they estimate it's 30 years.""A return period of 30 years like in Cambridge, means that every year in the current climate you have about 3% chance of having a heatwave like that,"" says Dr van Oldenborgh.""It was much smaller in the old climate and every year that we keep on emitting CO2 the probability of having a heatwave like that will just increase.""One problem that the researchers keep encountering when they carry out these rapid attribution studies is the fact that the climate models they are using underestimate the high temperature observations that are being made in the real world.""We know for 10 years or so that the models have problems with these relatively short, very intense events,"" says Geert Jan van Oldenborgh.""They have been designed to simulate global mean temperatures and large scale heat patterns, they have not been designed to get heatwaves right.""Everybody now agrees that this needs to be figured out, because the trend in heatwaves is just so much higher than the model trend.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Climate change: Trees 'most effective solution' for warming	What do the critics say?	"Researchers say an area the size of the US is available for planting trees around the world, and this could have a dramatic impact on climate change.The study shows that the space available for trees is far greater than previously thought, and would reduce CO2 in the atmosphere by 25%.The authors say that this is the most effective climate change solution available to the world right now.But other researchers say the new study is ""too good to be true"".The ability of trees to soak up carbon dioxide has long made them a valuable weapon in the fight against rising temperatures.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that if the world wanted to limit the rise to 1.5C by 2050, an extra 1bn hectares (2.4bn acres) of trees would be needed.The problem has been that accurate estimates of just how many trees the world can support have been hard to come by.This new report aims to show not just how many trees can be grown, but where they could be planted and how much of an impact they would have on carbon emissions.The scientists from ETH-Zurich in Switzerland used a method called photo-interpretation to examine a global dataset of observations covering 78,000 forests.Using the mapping software of the Google Earth engine they were able to develop a predictive model to map the global potential for tree cover.They found that excluding existing trees, farmland and urban areas, the world could support an extra 0.9bn hectares (2.22bn acres) of tree cover.Once these trees matured they could pull down around 200 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, some two-thirds of extra carbon from human activities put into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.This is a quarter of the overall amount of CO2 in the air.""Our study shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today and it provides hard evidence to justify investment,"" said Prof Tom Crowther, the senior author on the study.""If we act now, this could cut carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by up to 25%, to levels last seen almost a century ago.""The researchers identify six countries where the bulk of the forest restoration could occur: Russia (151m hectares), US (103m), Canada (78m), Australia (58m), Brazil (50m) and China (40m).But they say speed is of the essence because as the world continues to warm then the potential area for planting trees in the tropics would be reduced.""It will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential,"" said Prof Crowther.""It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions, and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies.""The new study has been welcomed by Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief, who was instrumental in delivering the Paris climate agreement in 2015.""Finally an authoritative assessment of how much land we can and should cover with trees without impinging on food production or living areas,"" she said in a statement.""A hugely important blueprint for governments and private sector.""However not everyone was as effusive about the new study.Several researchers expressed reservations, taking issue with the idea that planting trees was the best climate solution available to the world right now.""Restoration of trees may be 'among the most effective strategies', but it is very far indeed from 'the best climate change solution available,' and a long way behind reducing fossil fuel emissions to net zero,"" said Prof Myles Allen from the University of Oxford.Others are critical of the estimates of carbon that could be stored if these trees were planted.""The estimate that 900 million hectares restoration can store an addition 205 billion tonnes of carbon is too high and not supported by either previous studies or climate models,"" said Prof Simon Lewis from University College London.""Planting trees to soak up two-thirds of the entire anthropogenic carbon burden to date sounds too good to be true. Probably because it is,"" said Prof Martin Lukac from the University of Reading.""This far, humans have enhanced forest cover on a large scale only by shrinking their population size (Russia), increasing productivity of industrial agriculture (the West) or by direct order of an autocratic government (China). None of these activities look remotely feasible or sustainable at global scale.""The study has been published in the journal Science.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	The chart that defines our warming world		"Is this the simplest way to show what is meant by global warming? The chart below organises all the countries of the world by region, time and temperature. The trend is unmistakeable.Each line of coloured pixels is the temperature record of an individual nation within its region, stacked one atop the other. Blues are cooler years; the reds are warmer. The far left is 1900; the far right is the present day.The entire planet has got hotter, increasingly so in recent decades.This global ""Climate Stripes"" graphic is the work of Prof Ed Hawkins at Reading University who has sought clearer ways to communicate the issues around climate change - and to start conversations that might lead to solutions.He got the idea one January - the month the big meteorological agencies release their annual assessments of the state of the climate.Prof Hawkins experimented with different ways of rendering the agencies' global data and chanced upon the coloured stripes idea. When he tried out a banner on festival-goers at Hay, he knew he'd struck a chord.The Reading climate scientist now has a website, #ShowYourStripes, that allows anyone to download the stripes for their country and a few select cities (most stripes are built on global data collated by Berkeley Earth).People have been turning these patterns into wearable garments - ties, dresses, jumpers, and leggings. Someone in Minnesota in the US has even painted their Tesla electric car in the stripes.""What I've learnt from this is that you don't need the numbers to get the message across. The colours will do that,"" Prof Hawkins told BBC News.""It's all about finding different ways to communicate to people, to tap into different groups, because not everyone has got it. Maybe some of them switch off whenever science is mentioned. This is another way of getting through to them.""For those with a scientific bent, the graphic at the top of this page will, though, highlight some interesting features that might otherwise be missed in a different rendering of global data.Notice how the regions do not warm in unison. They appear as discrete blocks, Europe being the most obvious stand-out example. That's understandable. Each continent is an individual actor in the climate, influencing - and being influenced by - the system as a whole.Look at the beginning of the 1940s in particular. See how in Europe there is a strong band of blue compared with the rest of the world.This is quite a well-studied period that was probably linked to a large El Niño event - the climate cycle associated with shifting pressure patterns and a weakening of the trade winds in the Pacific.The world warmed, apart from Europe which had a deep cold spell. And it probably had an impact on the outcome of WWII. The harsh winters at the time frustrated Hitler's armies as they invaded the Soviet Union.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change: Heatwave made 'at least' five times more likely by warming		"Last week's record breaking heatwave across much of Europe was made ""at least five times"" more likely to happen by climate change, say scientists.Their rapid attribution study says that rising temperatures ""super-charged"" the event, making it more likely to happen than through natural variability alone.Heatwaves in June are now about 4C hotter than they used to be, the researchers said.Globally, the average temperature for June was the highest on record.Heatwaves naturally occur in summertime but last week's event in many European countries was unprecedented because it happened so early, and the recorded temperatures were so high.Records were broken at locations in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Spain.The new French record, established at Gallargues-le-Montueux last Friday, was more than 1.5C above the previous high mark.Much of the concern about the heat focused on France, with red alerts in several areas, many schools were closed, exams were postponed and health minister Agnès Buzyn warned that ""everyone is at risk"".The immediate cause of the heatwave was the weather, with hot air drawn in from northern Africa, caused by high pressure over central Europe and a storm stalling over the Atlantic.By lucky coincidence, the authors of this new study happened to be in Toulouse, France, at a conference on climate change and extreme events.The researchers, members of the World Weather Attribution Group decided to use the opportunity to analyse the link between human-induced climate change and the heatwave.They defined the heatwave as the highest three-day averaged daily mean temperature in June, arguing that this is a better indicator of health impacts than maximums or minimums.The researchers compared the observations of temperatures recorded during the month of June with climate models that can show how the world would be without the human influence on the climate.They found that, over France, the probability of having a heatwave had increased by at least a factor of five. However, the researchers say that this influence could be much higher still, by a factor of 100 or more.""We are very confident that this lower boundary of factor five is valid - but we are not confident we can say much more than that,"" said Dr Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.""The reason we are fairly careful is because we found fairly large discrepancies between the modelled properties of heatwaves and the observed properties of heatwaves. They all show stronger heatwaves but the trend in the observations is much larger than in the trends in the model.""The scientists say that the observations indicate a heatwave trend of around 4C in June, where the models show a much lower trend.According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, June generally was more than 2 degrees above the long term average. Globally the temperature was also the highest for June on record, being about 0.1C higher than 2016.Heatwaves in the 1970s and 1980s in Europe were limited somewhat because of what's termed aerosol cooling. This is essentially the impact of air pollution which for a number of years exerted a cooling influence. However, as the air has become clearer, heatwaves have come back with a vengeance.According to those involved with this study, this trend in heatwaves is likely to get worse.""We experienced a heatwave whose intensity could become the norm in the middle of the century,"" said Dr Robert Vautard, Senior Scientist, CNRS, France.""The new record of 45.9C set in France last Friday is one more step to confirmation that, without urgent climate mitigation actions, temperatures in France could potentially rise to about 50°C or more in France by the end of the century.""The researchers believe that if global warming continues to the 2C level envisioned in the Paris climate agreement, heatwaves like the one experienced last week will become the norm in June."
science	Climate change: Warming threatens Himalayan glaciers		"Climate change poses a growing threat to the glaciers found in the Hindu Kush and Himalayan mountain ranges, according to a new report.The study found that if CO2 emissions are not cut rapidly, two thirds of these giant ice fields could disappear.Even if the world limits the temperature rise to 1.5C this century, at least one third of the ice would go.The glaciers are a critical water source for 250 million people living across eight different countries.The towering peaks of K2 and Mount Everest are part of the frozen Hindu Kush and Himalayan ranges that contain more ice that anywhere else on Earth, apart from the polar regions.But these ice fields could turn to bare rocks in less than a century because of rising temperatures, say scientists.Over the next few decades, the melting could accelerate thanks to warming and increased air pollution from a growing population.The air pollutants come from the Indo-Gangetic Plain, one of the world's most polluted regions. The dirty air makes the glacier situation worse by depositing black carbon and dust on the ice, hastening the thaw.If global temperatures rise by 2 degrees C, then half the glaciers would be gone by 2100.Even if the world takes dramatic action and limits warming to 1.5C by the end of the century, 36% of the glaciers will have disappeared.""This is the climate crisis you haven't heard of,"" said Philippus Wester of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), who led the report.""Impacts on people in the region, already one of the world's most fragile and hazard-prone mountain regions, will range from worsened air pollution to an increase in extreme weather events. But it's the projected reductions in pre-monsoon river flows and changes in the monsoon that will hit hardest, throwing urban water systems and food and energy production off kilter.""The area in question covers some 3,500km across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.The glaciers feed ten of the world's most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and incomes.The impacts that the scientists are worried about will hit not just those living in the mountains, but also the 1.65 billion people living in the river valleys below - all are vulnerable to flooding and the destruction of crops.""Water is the theme that runs through many of the issues facing not just the mountain communities but the millions living downstream too. This report highlights how the retreat of snow and ice will change the way rivers behave, at first boosting their flow in spring and summer over the coming years, but only until the ice has melted away,"" said Dr Hamish Pritchard from the British Antarctic Survey.""For me, the interesting question then is what happens in these major river basins in the years when the rains fail? Without the ice reserve there in the mountains to top the rivers up through the melt season, droughts will be harsher on those living downstream.""This is a region where water is a hot topic politically, economically and in day to day life, and harsher droughts could be a severe shock to an already fragile system. I read this report as a warning to prepare for these shocks."""
science	Lakes 'skating on thin ice' as warming limits freeze	Disappearing ice - a case study	"Thousands of lakes across the Northern Hemisphere are set to lose their winter ice as global temperatures rise, say scientists.Their new study suggests that, within a generation, over 35,000 lakes will lose their winter cover.The researchers involved say the disappearance will have significant implications for millions of people living near these bodies of water.It could also pose a threat to supplies of drinking water and to fish species.Right now some 15,000 lakes in Canada, the US and northern parts of Europe experience intermittent ice cover during the winter months. This means that they freeze in the colder winters but remain ice free when winters are warmer.This is already posing problems for communities living in these regions who rely on ice roads that cross lakes for food supplies and social connection.Lake ice is also seen by scientists as an important long-term indicator of climate change and one of the world's resources most threatened by rising temperatures.Now, in what researchers believe is the most comprehensive analysis of lake ice loss, researchers say that many more lakes are set to go ice free in winter.If the world manages to keep the rise in global temperatures to 2C, the study suggests that the number of lakes experiencing intermittent ice will increase to over 35,000. This may have implications for 394 million people who live within an hour of their shores.""We're not taking about lakes getting a little warmer. We are talking about lake ice being gone in the winter,"" said Dr Catherine O'Reilly, a co-author on the study from Illinois State University.""Our children and grandchildren would not see something we have taken for granted.""In a worst case scenario, where the world warmed by 8C by the end of this century, the number of lakes impacted would be 230,400.The authors stress that rather than being some long term prediction of the future implications of warming, this melting is happening now.""It won't require that much warming for these impacts to be felt,"" said lead author Dr Sapna Sharma, from York University in Toronto, Canada.""It's happening right now - Lake Superior for example is no longer freezing every winter. The Great Lakes are experiencing it. We have examples from all around the world of lakes that are experiencing this big change and we predict its going to occur in a lot more lakes in the future.""As well as promising an end to cultural and recreational activities such as outdoor skating and ice fishing, the loss of lake ice is also threatening environmental impacts. Lakes that don't freeze over are more susceptible to losing more water through evaporation.From Alaska to Canada, from Germany to Japan, the report highlights similar trends in disappearing ice.At Lake Suwa in Japan, data on the onset of ice has been collected since the 1400s. Local legend has it that a ridge in the ice is formed by the feet of the Shinto gods as they cross the lake.Priests have recorded the date when this icy ridge appears since 1443. In the first 250 years of records, the lake didn't freeze just three times. Between 2005 and 2016, there were seven winters when the lake was freeze free.Lakes get warmer faster in the spring with the potential onset of harmful algal blooms, as well as reduced oxygen levels in the water.""Ecologically, not having ice on these lakes does not bode well for how the ecosystem will respond,"" said Dr Sharma.""Rapid warming of lakes has implications for the potential to have degraded water quality and development of algal blooms earlier on in the open-water season. In addition, dissolved oxygen concentrations could decline earlier in the summer season, leaving more fish at risk of dying due to a compromised habitat.""The key element at work in limiting the ice is air temperature. However, there were other factors at play including the shape of the lake, with more circular shorelines receiving greater wind shear across their surfaces, which can prevent the formation of ice.Water depth is also very important.""The deeper the lake is, the more heat storage it has and it takes more cold weather to get the lake down to a temp where it could freeze,"" said Prof John Magnuson, a co-author from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal'	Increasing ambitionUN climate conference 03 Dec- 14 Dec 2018	"The UN secretary-general has warned negotiators at a major meeting that failing to increase efforts on climate change would be ""not only immoral but suicidal"" for the planet.Antonio Guterres has flown back to Poland to try and push COP24 to a successful conclusion.At the UN talks, a group of countries have said they will enhance their climate plans before 2020.The EU and others say they are responding to the urgency of science.Some observers believe that the return of Mr Guterres to these talks is a sign that significant progress is not being made.In his remarks to the conference, he underlined that fact, imploring the delegates to speed up the pace of negotiations and to be open to compromise.He said that key political issues here in Poland remain unresolved.""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,"" Mr Guterres said. ""It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.""What's worrying many delegates and observers here is the complexity of the task of delivering a strong rulebook on the Paris pact.There is a fear among some delegates that ministers who are here to make the final political decisions on the outstanding issues may oversimplify the situation.There are still outstanding questions over how to have a single set of rules for every country that is flexible enough to not overwhelm poorer nations with huge amounts of red tape.As well as an effective rulebook, the negotiators here are also pushing for countries to increase the level of their ambition, their plans to cut carbon emissions.To that end the EU in an alliance with Canada, the UK, Norway, many small island states as well as the least developed countries group, is to push for greater efforts in their enhanced national plans to be submitted by 2020.The ""high ambition coalition"" says that this has to be done to ensure an adequate response to the risks and impacts of climate change that were highlighted in the IPCC special report on 1.5C issued in October.""For the EU it is unacceptable not to have any decision taken that acknowledges positively the special report on 1.5C,"" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete.""We represent both developed and developing countries from all the continents and the EU is committed to an ambitious outcome in Katowice but the texts in front of us are not bold enough,""While the atmosphere at the talks is generally positive, a lingering row over climate science also rumbles on.Over the weekend the US and Saudi Arabia, back by Russia and Kuwait, refused to welcome the IPCC report on how a temperature rise of 1.5C would impact the world.Saudi officials, perhaps stung by the widespread criticism of their stance, have spoken out to defend their position.""We have accepted a welcome for all other IPCC reports in the past because they are done right, within the rule and procedures of the IPCC,"" a member of the Saudi delegation told journalists.""We never had reservations on other reports, so we know that there are some things that are not as good as the other reports we have used. It does not, in our view, stand up to the same level as the others.""Other senior figures at these talks have defended the IPCC and said that by the end of the discussions here, the key role of the research needs to be recognised.""Let me make this perfectly clear,"" said Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who presided over last year's conference of the parties.""Fiji welcomes the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees. We must all accept the science, which is irrefutable. We accept science in virtually every single other form of human endeavour. So simple logic dictates that we must do it.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions.

science	Climate change: Huge costs of warming impacts in 2018	How years compare with the 20th Century average	"Extreme weather events linked to climate change cost thousands of lives and caused huge damage throughout the world in 2018, say Christian Aid.The charity's report identified ten events that cost more than $1bn each, with four costing more than $7bn each.Scientists have shown that the chances of heat waves in Europe were influenced directly by human-related warming.Other events, say the authors, are due to shifts in weather patterns, said to be a consequence of climate change.According to the report the most financially costly disasters linked to rising temperatures were Hurricanes Florence and Michael, with costs said to be around $17bn for the former, and $15bn for the latter.Research published at the time showed that the rains accompanying Hurricane Florence were made 50% worse than they would have been without human influenced warming.With Hurricane Michael, experts say that human activities drove the emissions that made the water warmer, adding fuel and speed to the storm.In Japan, 2018 was the summer of extremes with flooding and heatwaves causing huge impacts.The floods killed at least 230 people and caused $7bn worth of damage, which were then followed by Typhoon Jebi, the most powerful storm to hit the country for 25 years.Europe also saw record heatwaves - with researchers showing that climate change likely doubled the chances of the events happening.A separate study from the Met Office looking at the UK suggested that the extreme heat was made 30 times more likely because of rising temperatures.The Christian Aid study says even where scientists have not done attribution studies linking events to climate change, they believe that warming is driving shifts in weather patterns that make droughts and wildfires more likely.""Climate change is something still often talked about as a future problem, not least because we know the consequences of the warming climate are so devastating and don't want to face up to what is already happening,"" said Dr Kat Kramer from Christian Aid.""This report shows that for many people, climate change is having devastating impacts on their lives and livelihoods right now. The great injustice of climate breakdown is that the people that suffer first and worst, are the world's poor that have done the least to contribute to the crisis.""2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAAThe report says that while the headline events had immediate impacts on lives and economies throughout 2018, in many developing countries there are slow-moving disasters connected to climate change such as droughts and sea encroachment that are progressively hitting millions of people.Commenting on the Christian Aid report, Dr Michael Mann from Penn State University said the impacts of climate change were no longer subtle.""The unprecedented floods, droughts, heat waves, wildfires and super storms we've seen in recent years - they are the face of climate change. The world's weather is becoming more extreme before our eyes - the only thing that can stop this destructive trend from escalating is a rapid fall in carbon emissions.""According to the World Meteorological Organisation's initial observations, 2018 is likely to be the fourth warmest on record with the Earth's average temperature hovering close to 1C above the levels recorded in 1850-1900.Their State of the Climate report, published in November, said that 20 of the warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years.With a high likelihood of a new El Niño forming early in 2019, the coming 12 months is expected to push the current record close, with the UK Met Office predicting that the global average temperature for 2019 will likely be 1.10C, above the pre-industrial average period from 1850-1900.Since 1850, 2016 is the warmest year on record with a central estimate of 1.15 °C above the same baseline.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Warming seas linked to bluefin tuna surge in UK waters	What is the AMO?Will tuna fishing be allowed in the UK again?What about climate change?	"Growing numbers of bluefin tuna are being seen in the waters around the UK because of the warming impact of a long term ocean current say researchers.These large, speedy fish are a globally endangered species and almost disappeared from the UK around 40 years ago.Scientists say that their recent rise is connected to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).Now in a warm phase, the current makes UK waters more hospitable for the fish.Bluefin tuna are one of the largest and fastest fish on the planet - they can weigh up to 900kg and can travel at speeds of up to 70 kilometres per hour (43mph).In the 1930s, the species was a common sight in the seas off Scarborough and was highly prized by big-game fishers.However, from the 1940s, the species began to decline and by the early 1990s had all but disappeared.But over the past five years or so, sightings of the warm blooded fish have increased off the UK once again with many of these encounters captured on social media.This situation has been mirrored in the Nordic seas, in the waters between Greenland and Norway which witnessed a spectacular collapse in tuna numbers in the 1960s, when the fish declined dramatically in just two years.Researchers now believe that the warming and cooling impact of the long term current, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is key to the ebb and flow of the species.The scientists' new paper has been published in the journal Science Advances. The team looked at the changing abundance and distribution of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic over the past 200 years.They've concluded that the major factor influencing the movement of bluefin is the AMO.""The ecological effects of the AMO have long been overlooked and our results represent a breakthrough in understanding the history of bluefin tuna in the North Atlantic,"" said lead author Dr Robin Faillettaz from the University of Lille.He believes that while current numbers of sightings of the UK may indicate that the species is doing well, this may not be the case everywhere.""When water temperature increases during a positive AMO, bluefin tuna move further north. However, the most positive (warming) phases of the AMO also have a detrimental effect upon recruitment in the Mediterranean, which is currently the most important spawning ground, and that will affect adult abundance a few years later.""""If the AMO stays in a highly positive phase for several years, we may encounter more bluefin tuna in our waters but the overall population could actually be decreasing.""It's a measure of a naturally occurring climate cycle in the North Atlantic that see sea surface temperatures rise and fall over long time periods.Approximately every 60 to 120 years the AMO switches between positive and negative phases. During positive (warm) phases, Ireland and the UK experience warmer weather but it also brings more hurricanes and drives drought in the US midwest. A cooler AMO can lead to drought in many parts of Africa.Right now the fishing of bluefin tuna in British waters is prohibited. But the recent rise in bluefin numbers has encouraged campaigners to petition the government to allow amateur fishers to catch the endangered species.The Angling Trust want to establish a ""catch and release"" licensed fishery which they believe would have enormous economic benefits for areas such as Cornwall.But the scientists involved with the latest study are cautious about this approach.""Bluefin tuna have been extensively overfished during the 20th century and the stock was close to its lowest in 1990, a fact that further indicates the recent changes in distribution are most likely environmentally driven rather than due to fisheries management and stock recovery,"" said co-author Dr Richard Kirby from the Secchi Disk Foundation.""Before we further exploit bluefin tuna either commercially or recreationally for sport fishing, we should consider whether it would be better to protect them by making the UK's seas a safe space for one of the ocean's most endangered top fish.""According to experts, the impact of global warming on top of the AMO is likely to alter the familiar patterns seen in bluefin tuna over several hundred years.The authors believe that increasing global temperatures may see the species persist for longer in cooler waters around the UK and in the Nordic seas.It might also cause the fish to disappear from the Mediterranean sea, the world's most important bluefin fishery.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc"
science	Climate change: Warming gas concentrations at new record high	What are concentrations?How does the latest data compare to previous years?Why did CO2 concentrations not rise as fast in 2017?Does that lower rise mean that some progress is being made?What about this mysterious CFC-11 gas?What about methane and nitrous oxide?What are the implications of all these rises?Will this new study have any impact?	"Concentrations of key gases in the atmosphere that are driving up global temperatures reached a new high in 2017.In their annual greenhouse gas bulletin, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says there is no sign of reversal in this rising trend.Carbon dioxide levels reached 405 parts per million (ppm) in 2017, a level not seen in 3-5 million years.Researchers also note the resurgence of a banned gas called CFC-11.Concentrations differ from emissions in that they represent what remains in the atmosphere after some of the gases are absorbed by the seas, land and trees.Since 1990 the warming impact of these long lived gases on the climate has increased by 41%.2017 continues the rise in concentrations of CO2 which are now 46% greater than the levels in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution.The increase from 2016 to 2017 was smaller than the rise from 2015 to 2016, but is close to the average growth rate seen over the last decade.The scientists at the WMO believe that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere right now hasn't been seen in a long, long time.""The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.That's because of the impact of El Niño, the naturally occurring weather phenomenon which peaked in 2015 and 2016. This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere.Not so much. Scientists are very worried that when they measure the chemistry of the atmosphere they find that things are still going in the wrong direction.""I am very concerned that the three greenhouse gases most responsible for climate change (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) are all rising upwards unabated,"" said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia.""CO2 concentrations are now well above 400ppm - levels were 321ppm when I was born, that is a big rise in a human lifetime!""There have been a number of reports about CFC-11, a gas that's used in home insulation. Unfortunately, production is a real double whammy for the environment, damaging the ozone layer while also contributing to global warming.Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the global agreement to protect the ozone layer, CFC-11 was supposed to be phased out of production.Instead researchers have seen a marked slowdown in reductions in the level of this gas, indicating that someone, somewhere is making new batches.Earlier this year, the Environmental Investigation Agency traced CFC-11 production to a number of factories across China.Scientists in the field are worried that the detected levels of this mysterious chemical may be a harbinger of worse things to come.""It's possible that the new emissions are the tip of the iceberg,"" said Dr Matt Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Bristol.""If the signals we've seen are due to CFC-11 released during the manufacture of products such as foams, there could be much more that has been locked up in these new materials, which will ultimately be released to the atmosphere over the coming decades.""The news on these two gases is not good either. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction.Levels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade.Nitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels.Essentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success.The report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted.""CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer,"" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova.""There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.""Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases.""The scientists behind it certainly hope so. They believe that their analysis needs to be seen alongside the recent IPCC 1.5C report which warned that the world needed to be essentially carbon neutral by 2050.The WMO bulletin comes out just a week or so before climate negotiators begin at the COP24 meeting in Katowice, Poland, where countries will discuss putting the Paris climate agreement into practice and increasing their ambitions when it comes to cutting warming gases.""The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C shows that deep and rapid reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be needed in all sectors of society and the economy,"" said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee.""The WMO greenhouse gas bulletin, showing a continuing rising trend in concentrations of greenhouse gases, underlines just how urgent these emissions reductions are."""
science	Climate change: Warming made UK heatwave 30 times more likely	How years compare with the 20th Century average	"Climate change has significantly boosted the chances of having summer heatwaves in the UK.A Met Office study says that the record-breaking heat seen in 2018 was made about 30 times more likely because of emissions from human activity.Without warming the odds of a UK heatwave in any given year were less than half a percent.But a changing climate means this has risen to 12%, or about once every eight years.The blazing summer of 2018 was the joint warmest for the UK,It tied with 1976, 2003 and 2006 for being the highest since records began in 1910.The steep temperatures that sustained across most parts of the UK, peaked on July 27 when 35.6C was recorded at Felsham in Suffolk.Now researchers have analysed the observed data using climate models that can simulate the world with or without the impact of fossil fuel emissions.Announcing their findings at global climate talks in Katowice, Poland, UK Met Office researchers said that the impact of global warming on the hot summer were significant.""Climate change has made the heatwave we had this summer much more likely, about 30 times more likely than it would have been had we not changed our climate through our emissions of greenhouse gases,"" said Prof Peter Stott, from the Met Office who carried out the analysis.""If we look back over many centuries, we can see that the summer like 2018 was a very rare event before the industrial revolution when we started pumping out greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.""2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAAThe researchers say that in a world without warming the chances of having a heatwave are around 0.4% every year. Climate change has tipped the odds significantly to around 12% every year. The historical record, they argue, strengthens their case.""We have observational information in England going right back to 1659 and if you look at the period before we really started to affect our climate there was only one summer in 1826 that was warmer than 2018, in that whole 200 years of data there was only one year as warm as this, so that really bears out what we are saying.A previous analysis carried out earlier this year by the World Weather Attribution group estimated that climate change had made the chances of a scorching summer twice as likely. So why does the Met Office study say that the impact of rising temperatures on the chances of such a warm event happening are far higher?""Our study looked at the chances of having such high temperatures throughout the summer in the UK,"" said Prof Stott.""If you focus on a particular few days at the peak of the heatwave over a broader area, as the other study did, then the chances are lower.""""But whichever way you look at it, there's a very clear fingerprint of human activity on the atmosphere.""A number of recent studies have underlined the scale of the impacts that the burning of fossil fuels are having on the climate. Concentrations of carbon emissions reached a new record high this year according to a study from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).Just yesterday, the Global Carbon Project showed that CO2 emissions in 2018 were projected to rise almost 3%, much to the concern of researchers.While some people might argue that having very hot summers in the UK around once every eight years would be a good thing, Prof Stott said it was not a positive development.""For many elderly vulnerable people this summer was not good news"" he told BBC News.""It's the impacts on health, on agriculture, on transport, there are a lot of negative effects that we are just not used to."""
science	What does 1.5C mean in a warming world?	So why has the goal changed?What difference does half a degree actually make?How hard will it be to keep below the limit?What happens if we go beyond 1.5?Are there any hopeful signs?	"Over the past three years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the ""safe"" limit of climate change.For decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts.But scientists now argue that keeping below 1.5C is a far safer limit for the world.Everyone agrees that remaining below that target will not be easy.This week in South Korea, researchers will report on the feasibility and costs of achieving this lower limit.The scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are gathering in the city of Incheon to hammer out a plan in co-operation with government delegates, on the actions that would need to be taken to meet this new goal.In a word - politics.The idea of two degrees as the safe threshold for warming evolved over a number of years from the first recorded mention by economist William Nordhaus in 1975.By the mid 1990s, European ministers were signing up to the two-degree limit, and by 2010 it was official UN policy. Governments agreed in Cancun to ""hold the increase in global average temperatures below two degrees"".However, small island states and low-lying countries were very unhappy with this perspective, because they believed it meant their territories would be inundated with sea water as higher temperatures caused more ice to melt and the seas to expand.They commissioned research which showed that preventing temperatures from rising beyond 1.5C would give them a fighting chance.Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook MessengerAt the ill-fated Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, the climate-vulnerable nations pushed for the lower figure, but their efforts were lost in the blame-game that followed the collapse of the conference.But the idea didn't go away completely - and by the time of the Paris negotiations in 2015, it emerged centre-stage as French diplomats sought to build a broad coalition of rich and poor nations who would support a deal.It worked.More than you might think!Leaked drafts of the IPCC Summary for Policymakers that will be published after a week of haggling with government delegates in South Korea point to some major differences in terms of the impacts on the world of 1.5 and 2C. We've summarised the main ones here:""Two degrees is no longer the two degrees we thought it was,"" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace who is monitoring the progress of the IPCC 1.5C report.""It's increasingly becoming meaningless as a climate goal, when you look at the risks that would come with it and what we are already witnessing with one degree - why would you have a goal that doesn't protect anything that we care about?""Very - the world has already warmed by around one degree and according to leaked drafts of the 1.5 report, we will sail past that limit by around 2040.The new IPCC report won't tell governments what to do but will instead set out a range of approaches that will likely involve heavy cuts in carbon emissions, a rapid transition to renewable energy and lifestyle and dietary changes as well.The IPCC have spent a lot of time considering that question and have devised a cunning plan!In their draft reports they talk about ""overshoot"", meaning that in many scenarios they expect temperatures to go beyond 1.5 but they believe they can be clawed back below the limit by using a range of technologies that will remove carbon dioxide from the air - these range from planting trees to more complex, untested machines.Some experts, though, believe that there are considerable risks to this approach.""A species that goes extinct at two degrees will still be extinct if you come back down to 1.5C,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius from WWF, a former UK government IPCC negotiator.""Some things may come back but some things are irreversible, in terms of taking a risk you'd want to try and keep below 1.5, and clearly that means faster, deeper earlier emissions cuts, and it probably means carbon dioxide removal. But these technologies - some of them we know what to do, but some are early days and need to be assessed.""Surprisingly, yes!While the task of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C this century is massive, there are some indicators on the horizon that show that some governments are recognising the seriousness of the issue and are taking steps to deal with it.The UK government says ""it intends to legislate for a net zero emissions target at an appropriate point in the future,"" and has joined 18 other nations in the Carbon Neutrality Coalition.Some environmentalists believe that the pathway to keeping temperatures down to 1.5 can be done without resorting to mechanical devices or planting billions of trees.""If we have very rapid emissions reductions and couple that with massive scaling up of restoration of land and changes in our food system to reduce meat consumption, we can get to 1.5C in a way that creates lots of wellbeing for people,"" said Hannah Mowat from Fern.""It creates better air and reduces levels of obesity. It's a world we want to say yes to, rather than a further industrialisation of our landscapes."""
science	'Flexitarian' diets key to feeding people in a warming world		"If the world wants to limit climate change, water scarcity and pollution, then we all need to embrace ""flexitarian"" diets, say scientists.This means eating mainly plant-based foods, and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050, they say.Food waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve, according to the study.Without action, the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90%.Fast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet.The authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change, depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous.The study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050, these impacts could grow between 50-90%. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries, which the authors say represent a ""safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system"".However the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers, so a combined approach is needed.So when it comes to climate change, the authors looked at what they called a ""flexitarian diet"".""We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common, according to the latest scientific evidence, is that they are all relatively plant based,"" said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford.""You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products, some might call it a Mediterranean based diet, we call it a flexitarian diet, over to a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet - we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one, but even this has only one serving of red meat per week.""If the world moved to this type of diet, the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half.But as well as altering diets, the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland, improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use.""We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit, vegetables and legumes,"" said Dr Springmann.""In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn, but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use, and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser - lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans.""In addition, the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16%.""Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain, from storage, and transport, over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero-waste supply chains,"" said Fabrice de Clerck, director of science at EAT who funded the study.The key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together.""Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible - yet only if we change the way we eat, and the way we produce food,"" said Johan Rockström, director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who is one of the authors of the study.""All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people.""The study has been published in the journal Nature."
science	Caution urged over use of 'carbon unicorns' to limit warming	What are these technology solutions?What about forests?Why not simply suck CO2 from the air?	"Climate scientists meeting in Korea are being urged to avoid relying on untested technologies as a way of keeping global temperature rise under 1.5C.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will shortly publish a report on how the world might stay below this limit.Early drafts said it would require machines to suck carbon out of the air.The ideas are unrealistic, said one expert, calling them ""carbon unicorns"".The IPCC special report, to be released on Monday, is expected to point towards the use of technology as a critical part of efforts to keep below the guardrail figure.Earlier versions of the document stated that all the pathways to keeping below 1.5C required rapid reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions with net-zero reached by the middle of this century.If emissions continue at the present rate, the world would ""overshoot"" 1.5C by 2040.If this happens, researchers believe that carbon dioxide removal technologies, in some form, would be needed to help bring the Earth's temperature back down.The IPCC report is expected to mention a number of approaches that range from planting more trees, to direct air capture of CO2, to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).The latter involves growing large amounts of plants that capture CO2, and then burning them for energy while capturing and storing the gas that is emitted.This has long been a controversial approach - requiring huge amounts of land to grow crops for burning. Previous research calculated an area twice the size of India would be needed to help the world stay under 2C of warming this century.""It sounds crazy, and it is crazy,"" said Dr Glen Peters, a climate researcher at the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, Norway.""But this may be the only way to keep temperatures well below 2C.""I struggle to see how the world can remove billions of tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere for decades, but if we want 1.5C then we have to accept that this may be the only possible pathway.""Others agree that BECCS is possible but impractical, diverting huge amounts of land from food production at a time when the world population is expected to be touching 9 billion.A group of some 40 leading researchers on forests have signed a letter, saying that BECCS is not the ""primary solution"".""Achieving significant amounts of carbon dioxide removal through use of wood for energy and capturing the resulting carbon in geological reservoirs requires technology that is untested at large scale,"" the authors write.They believe that protecting, and sustainably managing the forests we already have, and restoring the ones we have lost, is the best use of trees in limiting climate change.""Our planet's future climate is inextricably tied to the future of its forests,"" they say.The IPCC report will also mention the use of machines that capture CO2 directly from the air. A number of companies around the world have developed this type of technology - with some success.Earlier this year, Canadian company Carbon Engineering published a peer-reviewed research paper showing that CO2 can be captured from the air for less than $100 per tonne. The company has now raised over $11m to expand its existing pilot and design its first commercial plant.But some environmentalists see great danger in all these ideas of negative emissions. They believe they are mythical solutions that allow people to keep on using coal, oil and gas.""There are some countries whose economies are based on fossil fuels who are not ready to face the reality yet, and they will want to continue digging and selling those fossil fuels for quite some time,"" one seasoned climate expert told BBC News.""I suppose they're presuming that in the future some unicorns will pop up and suck the extra carbon from the atmosphere!""Another factor that is likely to complicate the rapid reduction in fossil fuel usage is the continuing growth of coal as a power source.A new analysis by a group of environmental organisations says that 1,380 new coal plants or units are planned, or under development, in 59 countries. If built, these plants would add 672,124 megawatts of energy capacity to the global coal plant fleet - an increase of 33%."
science	King penguins face warming challenge		"King penguins are in deep trouble if nothing is done to constrain climate change, researchers say.The scientists have assessed the birds' fragmented population in the Southern Ocean and concluded that some island strongholds will become unsustainable.The problem is the continued movement away from key nesting sites of the penguins' favoured foraging grounds.And as the climate warms further, food will simply become too distant for many birds to fetch for their chicks.""Our work shows that almost 70% of king penguins - about 1.1 million breeding pairs - will have to relocate or disappear before the end of the century because of greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Dr Céline Le Bohec from the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the University of Strasbourg.Her team has just published its findings in the journal Nature Climate Change.The group has looked at the particular requirements of the king penguin and how shifts in the environment might affect the species' breeding success in the coming decades.It is a mixture of climate modelling but also uses genetics to understand population history, as well.The second largest of the 17 penguin species, Aptenodytes patagonicus are finicky about where they base themselves, preferring sub-antarctic islands that are free of sea-ice and that have smooth sandy or pebble beaches on which to rear chicks.But they also need a good supply of fish and squid, and in the Southern Ocean this is to be found along a feature known as the Antarctic Polar Front (APF).It is a nutrient-rich upwelling that supports abundant prey for the hungry predator.The issue is that the APF is heading poleward, and if global temperatures continue to rise as expected, the front is likely eventually to move out of the range of many foraging king penguins, the research suggests.Seven hundred kilometres is about the limit at which the birds can travel and not expose their chicks to starvation back at the nest.""Marion and Prince Edward islands, and Crozet island will have the biggest difficulty in the next 50 years, I would say. These are major population centres,"" Dr Le Bohec told BBC News. ""But if we continue with the addition of greenhouse gases then Kerguelen, Falkland and Tierra del Fuego islands will also have difficulty.""By analysing the genetics of the birds, the scientists can see that king penguins have suffered population crashes in the past, most notably about 20,000 years ago when colder conditions extended the sea-ice much further to the north than it is today.So there is evidence that the birds can bounce back, and the team's modelling indicates that they will very probably try to adapt to their changing circumstances by colonisation Bouvet Island, and by increasing their numbers on Heard and South Georgia islands, which should benefit from improved foraging conditions as the APF edges ever poleward.""The problem is the pace of change. It is really very fast, and that will make it hard for the penguins to adapt,"" said Dr Le Bohec.Commenting on the study, Dr Norman Ratcliffe from the British Antarctic Survey confirmed that shifts in the APF were a very important factor for king penguins.Independent tracking and breeding success data from Crozet and Kerguelen showed that the birds failed to breed in those years when the front temporarily moved too far south, he told BBC News.""Long-term projections of the type presented here are always crude caricatures but I like this study because it does take a more mechanistic approach based on the known habitat requirements of the species rather than using a more traditional and simplistic thermal envelope model,"" he said.""For the time-being we know king penguin populations are still increasing across their range, probably due to them recovering from hunting pressure during the sealing era.""So while it is possible that reduced accessibility of foraging habitat might cause loss of northern colonies in the future, there is no evidence that we have yet reached a tipping point at which this occurs.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Climate change 'making mountaineering riskier'	What do the scientists say?New conditions in New ZealandClimbers' confirmationTraining for guides	"Mountaineering in some parts of the world is becoming riskier because of climate change, climbing experts and scientists warn.They say warming in the Alps has thinned ice and snow cover, resulting into frequent rock-falls and landslides.Their concerns were voiced at a meeting of the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation this week.Melting glaciers have also added challenges for mountaineers.Climbing routes have either had to be abandoned or changed because of the increased risks.In some places, climbing seasons have had to be brought forward.A study of mountaineering plans for climbers in the Mont Blanc massif showed numerous changes. Almost all climbing ""itineraries"" for the region had been affected since the 1970s and a few routes no longer existed.In the journal Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research, Jacques Mourey from the University of Grenoble Alpes and colleagues wrote: ""Moreover, periods during which these itineraries can be climbed in good conditions in summer have tended to become less predictable and periods of optimal conditions have shifted toward spring and fall, because the itineraries have become more dangerous and technically more challenging.""A 2017 study of several summits in the Mont Blanc massif by a French team showed significant degradation of permafrost between 1850 and 2015.This led to the slopes becoming unstable, causing rockfalls.Findings from a study in the Austrian Alps have been similar.""Many of these routes have become extremely dangerous,"" Florian Ritter, from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, and colleagues wrote recently in the journal BioOne Complete.""Numerous classical ice climbs in the Eastern Alps have become heavily affected by rockfall and falling stones, as well due to rocks melting out at the ice margins... during late summer and autumn.""The Austrian research also pointed to other factors.""While the described processes related to global warming might increase the potential, events are generally triggered by other processes that are less linked to global warming, such as extreme rain events,"" it said.Analysis of guidebooks written for those climbing in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, confirms the changes.""In the climbing guides, multiple generations of climbers noted the climbing dangers for whole mountain ranges,"" said co-author Arnaud Tremme, a geographer with Wageningen University in the Netherlands.""The oldest guide out of the dozens of guides used in the research was written 146 years ago, this allowed us to record the changes for a longer period and link these with climate change.""For the past 10 years, a network of wireless sensors on Mount Matterhorn in the Alps has been streaming data on the condition of steep rock faces, permafrost and prevailing climate.""Based on the data we have received, we see that the rate of change is quite fast,"" said Jan Beutel, a Zurich-based researcher, who leads the monitoring project.""As a result, some of the places can't be visited anymore.""A study on Aoraki Mount Cook in New Zealand also highlighted difficulties for climbers.Climbers here have to navigate the Tasman Glacier, but this is now becoming more difficult because it's melting.""One of the interesting results of our study was the spatial variability associated with climate change - the impacts are greater at lower elevations, but much higher on the mountains. Because of the large seasonal snowfall, the effects are somewhat buffered,"" Heather Purdie, one of the authors of a study on the mountain told the BBC.Mountain guides say routes are now becoming more challenging and they have had to adapt.""Rockfalls are becoming the biggest challenge,"" says Christian Trommsdorff, president of the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations.""Although impacts of the changing climate differ; on some mountains they are massive, while on others they are not.""Professional mountaineers in the US say some peaks in the Pacific Northwest that still have glaciated terrain have become increasingly hazardous. In some cases, it is no longer possible for mountaineers to climb them.""The combination of crevasses becoming un-crossable, overhead icefall hazard increasing and rockfall events occurring regularly has made many classic routes more dangerous and less predictable,"" said Angela Hawse, president of the American Mountain Guides Association.Although few studies along these lines have been conducted in the Himalayas, mountain guides in the region say climbing is becoming riskier.They say wearing crampons on thin ice and exposed rocks is particularly dangerous.""It becomes like wearing (ladies') high heels on a marble surface,"" says Tshering Pande Bhote, vice president with the Nepal Mountain Guides Association.""When there is enough snow and ice, the crampons get their grip but now that is becoming less and less available.""Nepalese mountain guides say that widening crevasses are also becoming a threat.""We have noticed that the gaping of crevasses, mainly underneath the surface, are increasing and it appears that is happening because of accelerated melting,"" said Mr Bhote.A number of studies in the Himalayas, mainly in the Everest region, have shown that glaciers there are fast retreating.The Khumbu glacier, that Everest climbers must cross before their ascent, has seen several ponds forming on it and joining up because of its rapid melt.The annual meeting of the International Federation of Climbing and Mountaineering in Cyprus will also be discussing how to operate in the changing circumstances.Mr Trommsdorff agreed that the changing nature of different routes needed to be included in training mountain guides.""We are starting to do something in this regard but we need more of research and development support,"" he said.""But we also adapt very well to such changes."""
science	Slowing Gulf Stream current to boost warming for 20 years	What is the Gulf Stream?Why is it important?What's the evidence for this new Amoc theory?Will the slowdown in the Atlantic current continue?So what will this mean for the UK?	"The prospect of the Gulf Stream slowing down and even stopping altogether has worried many experts in recent years.Some believed that this would cause a rapid cooling around the world with resulting global chaos.But a new study finds the Gulf Stream go-slow will have a significant impact on planetary temperatures, but not in a chilled out way.The Gulf Stream is an ocean current that keeps the UK warmer than it would be given its latitude alone.Researchers say a slower current will carry less heat down to the deep oceans meaning more will enter the atmosphere.Worries over the fate of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), of which the Gulf Stream is part, were graphically illustrated in the 2004 film, The Day After Tomorrow.It focused on a sudden collapse of the Amoc caused by global warming leading to a disastrous freezing and the dawning of a new ice age.So much for Hollywood - the reality according to the corresponding author of this new study is very different.""The headlines have said that the Gulf Stream is collapsing and the Ice Age is coming sooner than scientists think,"" Prof Ka-Kit Tung from the University of Washington told BBC News.""The answer from our work is no to both of them.""Instead Prof Tung and his colleague, Xianyao Chen from the Ocean University of China, have reconstructed what's happened with the flow of the Amoc over the past 70 years. They found a natural pattern with declines, flat periods and increases over the decades.It's a powerful ocean current that is part of the Amoc and it flows from the Gulf of Mexico, around Florida and up along the east coast of the US, before crossing the Atlantic towards Ireland, the UK and Europe.For decades we've believed that the Gulf Stream and the Amoc were like a giant hot water bottle, keeping Europe and the Eastern US warm in the winter.It's believed that the impact was as much as 5C, keeping London and Western Europe far less cold than say parts of Canada which are at the same latitude.But this new study indicates that the Amoc plays a far more important role as a massive global heat distribution system than it does in keeping Europeans toasty.It works like this - The warm waters from tropical regions are carried up to the North Atlantic where the current sinks them deep into the oceans, with cooler waters then returning south in their stead.When the Amoc current moves faster, more of the heat that is trapped in our atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels is taken and stored up to 1,500m below the surface of the ocean. When it slows down, less heat is sequestered in the seas and so our land surface temperatures increase.When the Amoc was at a minimum between 1975 and 1998, more heat entered the atmosphere and global temperatures gradually went up. When the current started to accelerate from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, and sink more heat it coincided with a so-called slowdown in the pace of global warming.Now the authors say that the big decline is Amoc flow since 2004 means less heat going into the waters and more into the air, leading to higher global temperatures. And that is likely to continue.""It is difficult to predict changes,"" said Prof Tung.""But under the scenario that greenhouse gas forcing hasn't changed much, it would be comparable to the warming in that period of 1975-1998, if slightly lower, but it's comparable.""That's unlikely according to this study.""We think that the decline of Amoc is reaching the minimum and if history repeats, we will think this one will last about two decades.""""Where we have direct measurements, such as off the coast of Florida, the measurements there have flattened since 2011. In the northern Atlantic it is still declining.""While the waters of the North Atlantic will definitely cool as a result of changes in the flow, the experts says it's likely that the UK will see continued impacts of climate change over the next 20 years according to this study.""The air temperatures globally will be warming and there's no barrier for that so there won't be much cooling in the UK, you will probably still see the normal global warming,"" said Prof Tung.The study has been published in the journal Nature."
science	Plastic pollution: How one woman found a new source of warming gases hidden in waste	What's causing these emissions?Is this a big deal?What have the plastics industry said?How have other scientists reacted?	"It's your classic movie eureka moment.Young researcher Sarah-Jeanne Royer set out to measure methane gas coming from biological activity in sea water.Instead, in a ""happy accident"" she found that the plastic bottles holding the samples were a bigger source of this powerful warming molecule than the bugs in the water.Now she's published further details in a study into the potential warming impact of gases seeping from plastic waste.""It was a totally unexpected discovery,"" Dr Royer told BBC News.""Some members of the lab were experimenting with high density polyethylene bottles looking at methane biological production, but the concentrations were much higher than expected.""""So we realised that the emissions were not just coming from the biology but from the bottle that we were using for the experiment.""After graduating from university in Barcelona, Dr Royer found herself in Hawaii, leading teams of volunteers who were helping to remove plastic from beaches at weekends, while working on the chemistry of the substance during the week.Now she's published her report after spending a year and a half testing different types of plastic in and out of seawater to see if they emit methane and ethylene, which both contribute to the greenhouse effect.Dr Royer found that the most widely-used plastic, the stuff used to make shopping bags, is the one that produces the greatest amount of these warming gases.At the end of the study, after 212 days in the sun, this plastic emitted 176 times more methane than at the start of the experiment.Ironically, when plastics were exposed to air the amount of methane emitted was double the level from sea water.In short it's the Sun. Solar radiation acts on the surface of plastic waste. As it breaks down, becomes cracked and pitted, these defects increase the surface area of plastic available to sunlight which accelerates gas production. Even in the dark, the gas continues to seep out.""I'm in the field every week,"" said Dr Royer.""When I touch a piece of plastic, if there's a little impact on that plastic it's degrading into hundred of pieces pretty much as we look at it.""Up to now, the link between plastics and climate change was mainly focussed on the use of fossil fuels like oil and gas in the manufacture of plastic items.It's also known that when plastics degrade in the environment, they release CO2. Experts have welcomed this report as it is the first time that anyone has tried to quantify other warming gases emerging from plastic waste.""Low density polyethylene (LDPE) does emit ethylene, methane and propane, even at low temperatures that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions,"" Prof Ashwani Gupta from the University of Maryland, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News.""It is nice to see some quantified emissions on greenhouse gases for the selected polyethylene. The results clearly show variation in gas emission levels among the different polyethylene sources.""While the amounts of methane and ethylene being produced right now from plastics are very small, Dr Royer is concerned about the future and the fact that as plastic breaks down, more surface area is exposed, increasing the amount of the gases that drifts into the atmosphere.""If we look at all the plastic produced since 1950, it's pretty much all still on the planet, and it's just degrading into smaller and smaller pieces, so we know the industry is booming and in the next 30 years and more and more greenhouse gases will be produced - that's a big thing.""Nothing much at this point. According to Dr Royer, when she approached companies in the field, they weren't keen on talking about it.""I told them I was a scientist and I was trying to understand the chemistry of the plastic,"" she said.""I was trying to order some plastics of different densities and I was asking questions about the process and they all said we don't want to have contact with you anymore.""I think the plastic industry absolutely knows, and they don't want this to be shared with the world.""""Research on plastic waste is revealing it to be a disturbing pandora's box,"" said Dr Montserrat Filella, a chemist at the University of Geneva.""As research expands our knowledge, we are realising that plastics can be insidious in many other ways. For instance, as vectors of 'hidden pollutants', such as heavy metals present in them or, now, as a source of greenhouse gases. And, in all cases, throughout the entire lifetime of the plastic.""Others agreed that further research was urgently needed.""No one knows how much methane and ethylene are being released from these sources. We don't know if it is adding significant amounts of greenhouse gases to our atmosphere,"" said Dr Jennifer Lynch, a marine environment expert from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Nist).""It's another consequence of the use of plastics and it needs further examination."""
science	Decoding Antarctica's response to a warming world		"A tangle of tubes, cables, and actuators - Mebo looks as though it could morph at any moment into one of those Transformer robots from the movies.The 10-tonne machine is in fact a seabed drilling system, and a very sophisticated one at that.Deployed over the side of any large ship but driven remotely from onboard, it's opening up new opportunities to take sediment samples from the ocean floor.MeBo was developed at the MARUM research facility in Bremen, Germany, and has not long returned from a pathfinding expedition to the West Antarctic.In the iceberg-infested waters of the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE), it obtained the very first cores to be drilled from just in front of some of the mightiest glaciers on Earth.Chief among these are Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier, colossal streams of ice that drain the White Continent and which are now spilling mass into the ocean at an alarming rate.There's concern that deep, warm water is undercutting the glaciers, possibly tipping them into an unstoppable retreat. And that has global implications for significant sea-level rise.It was MeBo's job to help investigate whether this really could be happening.MeBo Drilling SystemThe goal was to retrieve seafloor sediments that would reveal the behaviour of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) in previous warm phases. To read the future in the past.""Has the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed before? Is that the scenario we should expect in the next couple of hundred years?"" pondered project leader Karsten Gohl from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI).""Perhaps in some of these warm periods it has only partially collapsed, just a few portions of it. Or maybe the WAIS was hardly affected in those times. We hope we can understand this better by collecting samples because basically the sediments are a climate archive.""As glaciers grind their way off the continent they crush and bulldoze rock and drop it offshore. This material - the range of particles and their shapes, the way they are sorted, etc - codes the activity of the glaciers in the region.Layers deposited during periods when the WAIS was extensive will contrast with those from times when glaciers were absent or significantly withdrawn.""If you find ice-rafted debris (stones dropped by icebergs), for example, you can be sure there was ice on land and that the ice had advanced to the coast,"" explained Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS).""But also new developments - especially what's known as geochemical provenance - have emerged in the last 10 years that mean it's even possible now to compare this material with rocks on land to pin down the actual sources in the hinterland.""Helpfully, nature also date-stamps the sediments by incorporating the remains of single-celled organisms (foraminifera and diatoms) from the ocean. The distinct species that lived through different epochs act as a fossil chronometer.MeBo's drill cores are now back in Bremen. A week ago, the cylindrical liners containing some 60m of ocean-floor material were being X-rayed at a local hospital to precisely determine their internal structure. And in the past few days, the task began of splitting the cores to allow their contents to be fully analysed.The scientists who travelled to the Amundsen Sea with MeBo, on Germany's Polarstern research ship, already have some clues to what the cores will contain. They got a sneak preview in the rock and mud that was visible at the ends of the drill pipe segments when they were brought back up from below.From the 11 locations MeBo sampled, it's very likely there are sediments that record the very deep past - from the Late Cretaceous, some 70 million years ago when dinosaurs still roamed the Earth and the landmass that is now Antarctica was green.Coming forward in time, it's probable also there are records from the Oligocene (34-23 million years ago) and the Miocene (23-5 million years ago) which should document some key events in Antarctica's history when a burgeoning ice sheet in the East of the continent was supplemented by one in the West.""We haven't got a continuous sequence; we have spot samples from these different times,"" explained Dr Gohl. ""But with these sediments we hope we can establish the onset of glaciation in Antarctica, and then get records from the time in the Miocene where in other areas of the Antarctic it's known there was the main glacial advance that has persisted to today.""With luck there are additional sediments distributed in the last few hundred thousand years, when WAIS glaciers would have advanced and retreated through the recent cycle of ""ice ages"".What many scientists would dearly love to see is a rich record from the Pliocene, from a time three million years ago when carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere were very similar to what they are today (400 molecules of CO2 in every million molecules of dry air). WAIS behaviour at this time could represent the best analogue for what is about to happen to the ice sheet in the near future.But this desire may have to wait to be satisfied by a second expedition with a dedicated drill ship, the Joides Resolution.

science	Climate change: UN panel signals red alert on 'Blue Planet'	So what have they found and how bad is it?Interactive Qaleraliq glacier, southern GreenlandWhat are the implications of all this melting ice?Analysis by David Shukman - Science Editor, HullWhat will these changes mean for you?Permafrost not so permanentSo what happens in the long term?Does the report offer some guarded hope?	"Climate change is devastating our seas and frozen regions as never before, a major new United Nations report warns.According to a UN panel of scientists, waters are rising, the ice is melting, and species are moving habitat due to human activities.And the loss of permanently frozen lands threatens to unleash even more carbon, hastening the decline.There is some guarded hope that the worst impacts can be avoided, with deep and immediate cuts to carbon emissions.This is the third in a series of special reports that have been produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) over the past 12 months.The scientists previously looked at how the world would cope if temperatures rose by 1.5C by the end of this century. They also reported on how the lands of the Earth would be affected by climate change.However, this new study, looking at the impact of rising temperatures on our oceans and frozen regions, is perhaps the most worrying and depressing of the three.In a nutshell, the waters are getting warmer, the world's ice is melting rapidly, and these have implications for almost every living thing on the planet.""The blue planet is in serious danger right now, suffering many insults from many different directions and it's our fault,"" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, a co-ordinating lead author of the report.The scientists are ""virtually certain"" that the global ocean has now warmed without pause since 1970.The waters have soaked up more than 90% of the extra heat generated by humans over the past decades, and the rate at which it has taken up this heat has doubled since 1993.The seas were once rising mainly due to thermal expansion - which refers to the way the volume of water expands when it is heated. The extra energy makes the water molecules move around more, causing them to take up more space. But the IPCC says rising water levels are now being driven principally by the melting of Greenland and Antarctica.Thanks to warming, the loss of mass (which refers to the amount of ice that melts and is lost as liquid water) from the Antarctic ice sheet in the years between 2007 and 2016 tripled compared to the 10 years previously.Greenland saw a doubling of mass loss over the same period. The report expects this to continue throughout the 21st Century and beyond.For glaciers in areas like the tropical Andes, Central Europe and North Asia, the projections are that they will lose 80% of their ice by 2100 under a high carbon emissions scenario. This will have huge consequences for millions of people.All this extra water gushing down to the seas is driving up average ocean water levels around the world. That will continue over the decades to come.This new report says that global average sea levels could increase by up to 1.1m by 2100, in the worst warming scenario. This is a rise of 10cm on previous IPCC projections because of the larger ice loss now happening in Antarctica.""What surprised me the most is the fact that the highest projected sea level rise has been revised upwards and it is now 1.1 metres,"" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso, from the CNRS, France's national science agency.""This will have widespread consequences for low lying coasts where almost 700 million people live and it is worrying.""On the east coast of England, most of the city of Hull lies below the level of a typical high tide. The sea here can be both a source of wealth and a threat to life.So the conclusions of the IPCC report have real meaning. A storm surge on a winter's night six years ago found a weak link in a sea wall and flooded businesses and homes.New defences were ordered and the construction teams are now at work along the shore. But the barriers cannot protect everyone. Computer simulations, developed by the University of Hull, show that if the level of the ocean is one metre higher than now the centre of the city ought to be fine but neighbouring areas will go under.This highlights a painful question, faced in low-lying places the world over: which should be saved and which should be abandoned as the waters rise?The report says clearly that some island states are likely to become uninhabitable beyond 2100.The scientists also say that relocating people away from threatened communities is worth considering ""if safe alternative localities are available"".One of the key messages is the way that the warming of the oceans and cryosphere (the icy bits on land) is part of a chain of poor outcomes that will affect millions of people well into the future.Under higher emissions scenarios, even wealthy megacities such as New York or Shanghai and large tropical agricultural deltas such as the Mekong will face high or very high risks from sea level rise.The report says that a world with severely increased levels of warm water will in turn give rise to big increases in nasty and dangerous weather events, such as surges from tropical cyclones.""Extreme sea level events that are historically rare (once per century in the recent past) are projected to occur frequently (at least once per year) at many locations by 2050,"" the study says, even if future emissions of carbon are cut significantly.""What we are seeing now is enduring and unprecedented change,"" said Prof Debra Roberts, a co-chair of an IPCC working group II.""Even if you live in an inland part of the world, the changes in the climate system, drawn in by the very large changes in the ocean and cryosphere are going to impact the way you live your life and the opportunities for sustainable development.""The ways in which you may be affected are vast - flood damage could increase by two or three orders of magnitude. The acidification of the oceans thanks to increased levels of CO2 is threatening corals, to such an extent that even at 1.5C of warming, some 90% will disappear.When CO2 is dissolved in water it forms carbonic acid. So, the more carbon dioxide that dissolves in our oceans, the more acidic the water gets.Species of fish will move as ocean temperatures rise. Seafood safety could even be compromised because humans could be exposed to increased levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutants in marine plants and animals. These pollutants are released from the same fossil fuel burning that release the climate warming gas CO2.Even our ability to generate electricity will be impaired as warming melts the glaciers, altering the availability of water for hydropower.Huge amounts of carbon are stored in the permanently frozen regions of the world such as in Siberia and Northern Canada.These are likely to change dramatically, with around 70% of the near surface permafrost set to thaw if emissions continue to rise.The big worry is that this could free up ""tens to hundreds of billions of tonnes"" of CO2 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100. This would be a significant limitation on our ability to limit global warming in the centuries to come.That's a key question and much depends on what we do in the near term to limit emissions.However, there are some warnings in the report that some changes may not be easily undone. Data from Antarctica suggests the onset of ""irreversible ice sheet instability"" which could see sea level rise by several metres within centuries.""We give this sea level rise information to 2300, and the reason for that is that there is a lot of change locked in, to the ice sheets and the contribution that will have to sea level rise,"" said Dr Nerilie Abram from the Australian National University in Canberra, who's a contributing lead author on the report.""So even in a scenario where we can reduce greenhouse gases, there are still future sea level rise that people will have to plan for.""There may also be significant and irreversible loses of cultural knowledge through the fact that the fish species that indigenous communities rely on may move to escape warming.Definitely. The report makes a strong play of the fact that the future of our oceans is still in our hands.The formula is well worn at this stage - deep, rapid cuts in carbon emissions in line with the IPCC report last year that required 45% reductions by 2030.""If we reduce emissions sharply, consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable,"" said Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC.Indeed, some of the scientists involved in the report believe that public pressure on politicians is a crucial part of increasing ambition.""After the demonstrations of young people last week, I think they are the best chance for us,,"" said Dr Jean-Pierre Gattuso.""They are dynamic, they are active I am hopeful they will continue their actions and they will make society change.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Plant-based diet can fight climate change - UN	How years compare with the 20th Century averageHow are climate change and food linked?Can food waste be reduced?Don't trees absorb the CO2 we release?How does soil fit in?Can the problems be solved?	"Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, UN experts have said.A major report on land use and climate change says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming.But scientists and officials stopped short of explicitly calling on everyone to become vegan or vegetarian.They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat.The document, prepared by 107 scientists for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says that if land is used more effectively, it can store more of the carbon emitted by humans.It was finalised following discussions held here in Geneva, Switzerland.2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAA""We're not telling people to stop eating meat. In some places people have no other choice. But it's obvious that in the West we're eating far too much,"" said Prof Pete Smith, an environmental scientist from Aberdeen University, UK.We're also wasting too much food. The panel estimates that greenhouse emissions associated with food loss and waste - from field to kitchen bin - is as high as 8-10% of ALL global emissions.The report calls for vigorous action to halt soil damage and desertification - both of which contribute to climate change.It also warns that plans by some governments to grow trees and burn them to generate electricity will compete with food production unless carried out on a limited scale.The Earth's land surface, and the way it is used, forms the basis for human society and the global economy.But we are re-shaping it in dramatic ways, including through the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. How the land responds to human-induced climate change is a vital concern for the future.Climate change poses a threat to the security of our food supply. Rising temperatures, increased rain and more extreme weather events will all have an impact on crops and livestock.But food production also contributes to global warming. Agriculture - together with forestry - accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock rearing contributes to global warming through the methane gas the animals produce, but also via deforestation to expand pastures, for example.The environmental impact of meat production is important to many vegetarians and vegans. A UK-based group called #NoBeef lobbies caterers to take beef and lamb off student menus.In the US, vegan burger patties are made from plant-based meat substitutes said to taste like the real thing thanks to an iron-rich compound called heme.Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint?Peter Stevenson, from Compassion in World Farming, said: ""A reduction in meat consumption is essential if we are to meet climate targets.""But in some parts of the world, such as China, beef consumption is growing. This is despite attempts by the Chinese central government to promote traditional diets.The authors of the report encourage action to stop wasting food - either before or after its sale to consumers.Waste food can sometimes be used as animal feed or, if suitable, redirected to charities to feed people in need.One organisation here in Switzerland called Partage takes in unsold food discarded by shops and distributes it to local families.It also collects stale bread and turns it into biscuits, dries fruit, and cans vegetables. All of this helps reduce the CO2 emissions involved in producing food.July was 'marginally' world's warmest month everHungry nations add the least to global CO2Stop abusing land, scientists warnRoad-testing the diet to save the worldThe extra carbon that humans have put into the atmosphere is nourishing the growth of forests - especially in the Northern Hemisphere.This can help to mitigate climate change, but it all comes down to a balance of factors. Experts say this effect on forests will be negated if the Earth heats up too much.In fact, the report says areas near the equator may already be losing vegetation through heat stress.Dr Katrin Fleischer, from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, warned that in some places a shortage of phosphorus in soil - a key ingredient for plant growth - would also hinder tree growth.She said: ""This would mean that the rainforest has already reached its limit and would be unable to absorb any more carbon dioxide emissions.""If this scenario turns out to be true, the Earth's climate would heat up significantly faster.""Soil is sometimes neglected as part of the climate system. But it's the second largest store of carbon after the oceans.Plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and lock the carbon away in the soil. But deforestation and poor farming practices can damage its ability to do this. When soil is degraded, carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, while further plant growth is compromised.Climate change is expected to speed this process up. Higher temperatures can help break down the organic matter in soil, boosting greenhouse emissions.The report says reducing and reversing soil damage provides immediate benefits to local communities. Better land management, including controlled grazing by animals and tree planting, can boost soil fertility, helping to reduce poverty and boost food security.""It's really clear that the land's being degraded through over-exploitation - and that's making climate change worse,"" said Prof Smith.""The land is part of the problem but if we wise up about the way we use it, it can part of the climate solution.""Changing the way humans use the land surface is a daunting challenge, especially as it will entail a major shift in farming methods.Nevertheless, scientists say people need to:But one practice touted as a climate change solution - bioenergy - has been treated with caution by IPCC experts.Bioenergy involves burning vegetation as a substitute for fossil fuels.To some countries, it appears to be an attractive option because CO2 emissions from the process can be captured.Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the worldThe International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts bioenergy will outpace solar, wind and hydropower in the next five years.But the authors of the IPCC report say converting land to bioenergy could deprive countries of soil to grow much-needed crops. They advise limits on the amount of land used for biofuels.Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	Warming to boost deadly humidity levels across South Asia	Wet bulb threatImpacts of Paris	"Millions of people living in South Asia face a deadly threat from heat and humidity driven by global warming according to a new study.Most of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh will experience temperatures close to the limits of survivability by 2100, without emissions reductions.The research says the fraction of the population exposed to dangerous, humid heat waves may reach 30%.South Asia is home to one-fifth of the world's inhabitants.Most official weather stations around the world measure temperature with two thermometers.The first, or ""dry bulb"" instrument, records the temperature of the air. The other, or ""wet bulb"" thermometer, measures relative humidity in the air and the results are normally lower than just the pure air temperature.For humans, this wet bulb reading is critically important.While the normal temperature inside our bodies is 37C, our skin is usually at 35C. This temperature difference allows us to dissipate our own metabolic heat by sweating.However, if wet bulb temperatures in our environment are at 35C or greater, our ability to lose heat declines rapidly and even the fittest of people would die in around six hours.While a wet bulb 35C is considered the upper limit of human survivability, even a humid temperature of 31C is considered an extremely dangerous level for most people.Recorded wet bulb temperatures on Earth have rarely exceeded 31C. However, in 2015 in Iran, meteorologists saw wet bulb temperatures very close to 35C. In the same summer, a deadly heat wave killed 3,500 people in India and Pakistan.This understanding of the potentially deadly impact on humans of wet bulb temperatures is key to this new study.The researchers involved came to their conclusions by using a high resolution climate model, that was tested against observations.They projected wet bulb temperatures to the end of this century using two different climate change scenarios.When the model examined a high emissions future, the wet bulb temperature would approach the 35C threshold ""over most of South Asia, including the Ganges river valley, north eastern India, Bangladesh, the eastern coast of China, northern Sri Lanka and the Indus valley of Pakistan"".According to the scientists, around 30% of the population is projected to live in a climate characterised by a median of the maximum annual wet bulb temperature of 31C or more. At present, the number of people facing this level of threat is essentially zero.""The valleys of the Indus and the Ganges rivers are where the water is, they're where the agriculture is and they're where the population has exploded,"" author Prof Elfatih Eltahir from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) told BBC News.""Our map that shows where the temperature extremes are, it's the same place that you have relatively poor people who predominantly have to work in agriculture and there are so many that they happen to coincide in a region where the hazard is maximised.""If the rise in global temperatures is contained to just over two degrees, roughly in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, the fraction of the population exposed to humid heat above 31C drops to 2%.Heat waves up to and beyond 31C are projected to become much more frequent if little action is taken on cutting carbon. In most locations, the once-every-25-year heat wave in the present climate is projected to become an approximately once-a-year occurrence. If the limitations agreed in Paris are met, these heat waves are likely to happen every two years.""Climate change doesn't look like an abstract concept if you look at India,"" said Prof Eltahir.""This is something that is going to impact your most vulnerable population in ways that are potentially pretty lethal. But it is avoidable, it is preventable.""Other researchers say the ""damaging and downright deadly"" conditions described in this study are likely to occur if the world doesn't embrace rapid and substantial cuts in carbon emissions.""This study provides a crucial glimpse of the future,"" said Prof Matthew Huber from Purdue University, US, who wasn't part of the research team.""Either we - the whole world - decide to reduce carbon emissions substantially or we face a highly dangerous scenario in one of the most populous regions in the world, with a deep history and culture, and also a history of political instability.""According to Prof Christoph Schaer from the Institute of Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich, the work is ""alarming"".""The study is credible as extremely hot and humid heat waves already occur under current climatic conditions in some of the areas considered,"" he said.""As conditions are close to a critical health threshold already today, a warming of a few degrees could strongly increase the risk of deadly heat waves.""The study has been published in the journal Science Advances.Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook."
science	Warming world harming insects' reproduction, says study	Lasting damage	"A warming world harms insects' ability to reproduce, which could have long-term consequences, scientists warn.UK researchers also found that insects in northern latitudes were more vulnerable than their southern-dwelling cousins.The team added that many insects were unable to move great distances while they are juveniles. Therefore, they are at risk from a warming climate.The findings have been published in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology.""You get an extreme heat weather event that [the insect] cannot escape from because they are juveniles, so they can't move as much,"" explained co-author Rhonda Snook from the University of Sheffield, UK.""They live through it because it does not kill them, but then they have the subsequent problem of reproducing.""Dr Snook said the insects in the team's experiments were exposed to a temperature increase of 5.5C (9.9F) for 10 days, which was enough to cause permanent damage to the insects' ability to reproduce.She said the team was interested in studying the effect of temperature rises in organisms that were unable to move away from their immediate environment.""Lots of insects in their juvenile stage can't move very far because they are larvae or because they are small nymphs - they are smaller and they do not have wings so they are not as mobile so they're stuck where they are.""Dr Snook told BBC News that the team carried out the experiments on fruit flies but she expected the results to be replicated in many other insects.""I think that this is going to be a very common effect, a very common phenomenon across insects.""The team examined the effect of increased ambient temperature rise on two populations of fruit flies: one from Spain and another from Sweden.""We showed that the one that evolved in a colder temperature (Swedish fruit flies) was less resistant to these extreme weather events than the southern (Spanish) population. That wasn't known before.Dr Snook explained that the Spanish flies had evolved where the predominant selection pressure was likely to have been heat.""If your predominant selection pressure in the north is cold then you're going to be selected to be able to respond really well to that,"" she added.""And the idea here is that you can't do both very well.""While global average temperatures are not projected to increase by 5.0C or more, climate modellers have suggested that extreme weather events, such as heat-waves and droughts, are set to become more frequent. In these events, localised temperatures are set to meet the conditions in which insects' ability to reproduce will be harmed.Dr Snook suggested that any change in insect populations could result in changes in ecosystems, but to what extent would require further research.Follow Mark on Twitter"
science	New UN climate chief: 'Action on warming unstoppable'	'World will carry on'Embracing green action	"The UN’s new climate chief says she’s worried about President Donald Trump - but confident that action to curb climate change is unstoppable.President Trump said he’d withdraw from the UN climate deal and stop funding the UN’s clean energy programme.But former Mexican diplomat Patricia Espinosa told BBC News that the delay in any firm announcement suggests the issue is still unresolved.She travels to US this weekend to try and meet the new US secretary of state.Ms Espinosa said it would be more damaging for the US to leave the on-going climate talks process altogether than to stop funding the clean energy programme.The US pays approximately $4m (£3.2m) towards this programme every year - and often an extra $2m in voluntary funding.But she said the rest of the world would carry on tackling climate change without the US, if necessary.She said China’s stated willingness to lead the world in curbing emissions might cause American diplomats to ponder the implications of allowing China a role of global moral leadership.“We are of course worried about rumours that the possibility of the US pulling out of the Paris agreement and the convention on climate change,” she said.“It would be very bad if there were a change of position in the US. That’s why I’m looking forwards to engaging with the US as a partner.”She did not explain how the US would be able to remain within the Paris framework whilst scrapping action on its own emissions strategy that helps underpin that process.But she drew hope from the vast number of firms and cities looking towards a low-carbon future - in the US and around the world: ""A lot of US businesses are really going into the agenda of sustainability and some are making their own commitments in emissions reductions in their own operations.""“An incredible amount of cities have embarked on ambitious goals; some states like California have been for many years in the forefront of this agenda.“In International Petroleum Week, I was very encouraged to hear how much some of the oil and gas companies are realising that the future of their industries is in a transformation into clean energy companies - and they have embraced this in their own interest.“The transformation has started. I think it’s unstoppable.”Ms Espinosa smiled at the irony of dealing with Mr Trump as a Mexican, a woman, and someone who works in climate change.She said her trip to the US would include meeting businesses and civil society groups and - hopefully - a senior member of the administration. She is anticipating a meeting with the new secretary of state Rex Tillerson.The former CEO of the oil giant Exxon Mobil warned recently that climate change is a genuine risk, and said the US should stay at the table of UN talks.Other nations have responded differently to the new situation presented by Mr Trump. China has offered to lead and India has surprised many with its new level of ambition.Saudi Arabia has expressed support for a slower rate of decarbonisation and Russia - the fifth largest emitter - has not yet ratified the climate deal from Paris.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin."
science	Climate change: Fresh doubt over global warming 'pause'		"A controversial study that found there has been no slowdown in global warming has been supported by new research.Many researchers had accepted that the rate of global warming had slowed in the first 15 years of this century.But new analysis in the journal Science Advances replicates findings that scientists have underestimated ocean temperatures over the past two decades.With the revised data the apparent pause in temperature rises between 1998 and 2014 disappears.The idea of a pause had gained support in recent years with even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reporting in 2013 that the global surface temperature ""has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past 15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years"".But that consensus was brought into question by a number of studies, of which a report by the the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) published in Science last year was the most significant.Researchers from Noaa suggested that the temperatures of the oceans were being consistently underestimated by the main global climate models.The authors showed that the ocean buoys used to measure sea temperatures tend to report slightly cooler temperatures than the older ship-based systems.Back in the 1990s, ship measurements made up the vast majority of the data, whereas now the more accurate and consistent buoys account for 85% of measurements.When the researchers corrected the data to take this ""cold bias"" into account, they concluded that the oceans had warmed 0.12C per decade since 2000, nearly twice as fast as previous estimates of 0.07 degrees.As a result, the authors said that the warming experienced in the first 15 years of the 21st Century was ""virtually indistinguishable"" from the rate of warming between 1950-99, a time generally acknowledged to have seen significant rates of warming from human emissions of CO2.The study did not go down well with climate sceptics. Members of the US House of Representatives subpoenaed the author's emails which Noaa refused to hand over.However, this new analysis supports the findings of the Noaa report. The scientists involved believe the problems in the original temperature estimates for the oceans came from attempting to mesh together data from ships and buoys.""Only a small fraction of the ocean measurement data is being used by climate monitoring groups, and they are trying to smush together data from different instruments, which leads to a lot of judgement calls about how you weight one versus the other, and how you adjust for the transition from one to another,"" said Zeke Hausfather, the new paper's lead author.Hausfather and colleagues decided to put together three independent data sets from satellites, buoys and robotic floats to find the true scale of ocean warming, so there was no mixing or matching of data.""Our approach was to create three separate ocean temperature records from the three different instruments, and it turns out that all three agree really well with the new Noaa record,"" he said.""The conclusion is that Noaa got it right, the scientists at Noaa were not cooking the books or manipulating the data in any way and that three independent sets of data back up their results.""The controversy that surrounded the original paper proved a strong motivation for attempting to replicate the findings says another author, Dr Kevin Cowtan from the University of York.""We were initially sceptical of the Noaa result, because it showed faster warming than a previous updated record from the UK Met Office. So we set out to test it for ourselves, using different methods and different data. We now think Noaa got it right, and a new dataset from the Japan Meteorological Agency also agrees.""The new study is unlikely to quieten sceptics but the authors say their new work shows that the rate of warming in the last two decades is no different from the rate of warming since 1970 or from 1950.As for attempts by politicians to subpoena emails in an attempt to suggest that scientists are committing fraud, the idea gets short shrift from the new paper's authors.""If people disagree with things they should ask other scientists to look into it rather than demanding access to scientists' emails,"" said Zeke Hausfather.Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook"
science	Climate talks: 'Save us' from global warming, US urged	UK joins the club	"The next head of the UN global climate talks has appealed for the US to ""save"" Pacific islands from the impacts of global warming.Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said that the islands needed the US now as much as they did during World War Two.He was speaking as global climate talks in Marrakech came to an end.Mr Bainimarama said that climate change was not a hoax, as US President-elect Donald Trump has claimed.Mr Trump has promised to pull the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement and scrap all payments for UN global warming projects.But as he accepted the role of president of the Conference of the Parties for the year ahead, the Fijian leader took the opportunity to call on to the next US president to step away from his scepticism.""I again appeal to the President-elect of the US Donald Trump to show leadership on this issue by abandoning his position that man-made climate change is a hoax,"" said Mr Bainimarama.""On the contrary, the global scientific consensus is that it is very real and we must act more decisively to avoid catastrophe.""He also made a direct call to the American people to come to their aid in the face of rising seas, driven by global warming.""We in the Pacific, in common with the whole world, look to America for the leadership and engagement and assistance on climate change just as we looked to America in the dark days of World War Two.""I say to the American people, you came to save us then, and it is time for you to help save us now.""After two weeks of talks here in Marrakech, participants arrived at a consensus on the next steps forward for the landmark climate treaty.This gathering saw the opening of CMA1, the Conference of the Parties meeting as the signatories of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rises.CMA1 will be the formal UN body that will run, manage and set the rules for the operation of the Paris treaty.The number of countries who have ratified the agreement jumped above 100 with the UK joining during the last few days of the conference.""Delegates in Marrakech made crucial progress in building the foundation to support the Paris agreement, which went into force just days before COP22,"" said Paula Caballero from the World Resources Institute.""Most importantly, negotiators agreed to finalise the rules of the Paris Agreement by 2018 and developed a clear roadmap to meet that deadline.""The participants also agreed the Marrakech Proclamation, a statement re-affirming the intentions of all 197 signatories to the Paris deal.Seen as show of unity on the issue in the light a possible US withdrawal, countries stated they would live up to their promises to reduce emissions. The proclamation also called on all states to increase their carbon cutting ambitions, urgently.Some of the poorest nations in the world announced that they were moving towards 100% green energy at this meeting.The Climate Vulnerable Forum said that the 47 member countries, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Yemen, would achieve this goal between 2030 and 2050. And they challenged richer countries to do the same.Despite these steps forward there were still some areas of significant difference between the parties, especially over money. The talks will continue in 2017 with a new US delegation picked by the Trump administration.Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook"
science	July confirmed as hottest month on record		July this year was the warmest month ever recorded worldwide, satellite data has confirmed.The assessment was carried out by researchers at the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).Scientists say it's the latest sign that Earth is experiencing unprecedented warming.Scorching heatwaves saw records tumble across Europe last month, with unusually high temperatures within the Arctic Circle as well.Globally, July 2019 was marginally warmer - by 0.04 degrees Celsius (0.072 Fahrenheit) - than the previous hottest month on record, July 2016.July was 'marginally' world's warmest month everInteractive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the worldHowever, it's notable that the 2016 record followed a strong El Niño weather event, which boosts average global temperatures beyond the impact of global warming alone.The new July mark follows on from a global record for June, which was confirmed by data from several different agencies.According to Copernicus, every month this year ranks among the four warmest on record for the month in question.While researchers can't directly link these new high marks to climate change, there is a wide sense among scientists that emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities are altering background temperatures and making new records more likely.
science	Our warming world and El Nino	What does this mean for the UK?What's causing this?More than one playerPushing up temperatures	"2015 was the warmest year on record, with global temperatures 0.75C above the long-term average, according to scientists at the UK's Met Office.December's devastating floods in northern England seem a world away from the Pacific Ocean but anyone embarking on a meteorological whodunit will inevitably have to stop off in the world's largest ocean and investigate further.As well as being exceptionally wet, December 2015 was the UK's warmest December on record. Basic atmospheric physics tells us that warmer air can contain more water vapour and in December this translated into persistent rainfall that drenched the hills of northern England and caused the severe floods that swept downstream.Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution at the Met Office said ""2015 was a record-breaking year for our climate. Global mean temperatures reached 1°C above pre-industrial levels for the first time and the year's average global temperature was the highest ever recorded.""In the search for the source of this warmth why are meteorologists pointing their fingers towards the Pacific? El Nino. It's the name given to a natural phenomenon, the occasional warming of waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. In 2015 we witnessed this latest El Nino event becoming one of the strongest on record.During El Nino a large expanse of Pacific water becomes warmer than average altering the usual heat exchange pattern with the air above it which goes on to influence weather patterns in a chain reaction around the world.Analysing the reasons for the December floods, the UK Met Office says El Nino contributed to a persistent weather pattern stretching from the Pacific across North America and the Atlantic that resulted in unusually warm, moist air reaching the UK.As eye-catching as the effects of El Nino have been in the UK and elsewhere, the warming of the Pacific only reached its peak in the second half of 2015 and scientists say attributing all or even the majority of the year's global temperature increase to it would be like giving star billing to an actor who only appears in one scene of a movie.More likely is that natural weather cycles such as El Nino are becoming aligned with man-made heating to boost global temperatures to new heights.The star of the heating show remains emissions from industry and agriculture adding to the greenhouse effect and trapping more of the sun's energy and heat within our atmosphere. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in the last 800,000 years and reached a record high in May 2015.El Nino's warming influence will be felt well into 2016 so the potential is very much there for this partnership with man-made heating to produce further global temperature headlines this time next year.Follow the conversation on Twitter @bbcweather"
science	Global warming and the race for the White House		"Two starkly different visions of global warming are offered by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in their race for the White House.The Democratic Party contender says she believes in the science of climate change and plans to see America become a ""clean energy superpower"" - installing half-a-billion solar panels by the end of her first term.By contrast, the Republican candidate talks down the threat of rising temperatures and says his priority is to cut the costs of energy for manufacturers and to revive the coal industry.Hillary Clinton is a strong supporter of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Donald Trump wants to renegotiate it or pull America out of it.Because the US has the world's largest economy, and is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, the outcome of this struggle will reverberate internationally. If the US leaves the Paris Agreement, the painfully-negotiated deal could unravel.With such sharply opposing perspectives, this is the first presidential contest in which the candidates are highlighting their stances on global warming and energy, and using them to attack each other.So how is this playing out in a swing state like Ohio, which hosts some of America's oldest coalfields and one of the most innovative solar panel makers?Through the east of the state, the mighty Ohio River flows like an artery for the coal industry, with the heavy machinery of mines, loading stations and power plants lining the steep green banks.For more than a century, this has been a crucible of power production for the US economy, with vast quantities of coal burned to generate electricity. And because the jobs paid well, and there were lots of them, the communities thrived.But in recent years, fortunes have changed. The pollution belching from the smokestacks has been gradually limited by wave after wave of legislation - first on emissions of sulphur dioxide, then of nitrogen dioxide, and now of carbon dioxide.It's no surprise, but along this valley the Environmental Protection Agency is held in contempt. This is the body responsible for cleaning up the air and reducing greenhouse gases under President Obama's Clean Power Plan. A key Trump promise is to dismantle both the agency and the plan.The reality is that environmental regulation is not the only challenge to coal. Another has come from fracking, the revolution that's opened up deep layers of shale rock to release new supplies of plentiful gas that's cheaper and cleaner than coal.In any event, the result is that demand for coal is falling and the mines have long been in trouble. As many as 50 mining companies have filed for bankruptcy.At one pit head, a dozen blackened faces emerged from a lift - this was the day shift, about half the size it would normally have been. Cuts are taking their toll. The mine will close by the end of the year.Here, Hillary Clinton is a hate figure. A newspaper cutting, pinned to a wall, highlights her saying ""We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.""She later clarified that comment. What she meant to say was that the switch to cleaner energy would inevitably mean coal closures and that she wants to support communities making the transition. But the damage was done.I talked to the mine's owner, one of the leading figures in the coal industry, Robert Murray of the Murray Energy Corporation.An outspoken defender of US coal, and prominent in launching legal challenges against the Clean Power Plan, he followed his father into the mines and keeps a polished lump of coal in his board-room.While many coal mining companies declined our requests for interviews, Mr Murray jumped at the chance, and there was no holding him back.""What happens is when two coal miners get laid off, if they own anything it's their homes and, when they get laid off, they have no one to sell their homes to.""So those people who just want to work in honour and dignity are denied that, and it's not the America that I cherish… That's why I speak out like I do, that's why I say, Obama is a greater scourge than America has ever had in its history.""Donald Trump would agree with all that. He sees coal as abundant and homegrown, and responsible for thousands of jobs. And he talks of revitalising the industry, which goes down very well in mining country.The fact that it is the dirtiest fossil fuel is irrelevant in the Trump view because global warming is a ""hoax"" as he once called it, though he later said that was a joke.So what about the alternative vision?Only a hundred miles to the west, there's a very different Ohio. The zoo in the city of Toledo has solar panels covering its walkways. The huge roof of the city's famous Museum of Art is shining with them too.With many major companies like Wal-Mart investing in renewable power, the sight of solar installations in this notoriously gas-guzzling nation is no longer so unusual.On the edge of Toledo, in a landscaped business park, stand the sleek buildings of First Solar. A gigantic manufacturing hall is busy with robots and people working side-by-side. Together with a larger sister plant in southeast Asia, this company can boast of a remarkable statistic: it churns out a new solar panel every single second.The executives do not want to be drawn into talking politics but they argue that we are witnessing a fundamental transformation: not only have solar panels increased in efficiency but they have also tumbled in price.No longer is solar just a fad for the eco-conscious rich. The largest solar installations - ""utility-scale"" in the jargon - in the sunniest parts of the US can generate electricity that is comparable in cost to that of coal.Though solar power is still intermittent, as with wind, the fall in cost does mean that during the hot days of high summer, when air-conditioning is running at full blast, the electricity supply can be carbon-free.The implication is that solar power may be starting to make sense purely on financial grounds, regardless of any other motivation such as aiming to reduce carbon emissions.At the state's largest solar array, covering a long rolling field, Bill Spratley of Green Energy Ohio, a renewables advocacy group, told me that the new reality of cheaper renewable energy would change the debate.""We have some politicians that are fighting the last war, they're fighting over something, they still believe solar is in the future but it's here now.""We've probably passed the tipping point or the turning point and they just don't know it yet.""If solar costs keep falling, and coal continues to be undermined by shale gas, then it may be that a Trump victory would not do much to alter what could be an historic trend away from coal into cleaner sources of energy. Even outside the Paris Agreement, US energy companies and big corporations may still see logic in making the switch.As we leave the solar farm, an engineer managing the installation joined the conversation. ""Solar makes sense to me,"" he said, ""and I'm a Republican""."
science	Decline of fishing in Lake Tanganyika 'due to warming'	Diversity hotspot	"New research blames rising temperatures over the last century as the key cause of decline in one of the world's most important fisheries.Lake Tanganyika is Africa's oldest lake and its fish are a critical part of the diet of neighbouring countries.But catches have declined markedly in recent decades as commercial fleets have expanded.However this new study says that climate warming and not overfishing is the real cause of the problem.Estimated to be the world's second-largest freshwater lake, Tanganyika is an important resource for the countries that border it: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zambia.As well fish from the lake providing up to 60% of the animal protein consumed in the region, it is also an important biodiversity hotspot.But there have been growing concerns about the impact of overfishing, land use change and changes in climate on this key ecosystem.In an attempt to understand what's happening, researchers have examined samples of sediment from the bottom of the lake.The chemical analysis of the cores and the fossils found there indicate that fish numbers have been dropping in parallel with a rise in global temperatures.The scientists say that in tropical lakes a warming of the waters reduce the mixing between the oxygenated top layer and the nutrient-rich layer at the bottom.This increasing stratification of the waters means fewer nutrients get to top, meaning less algae which means less food for fish.The authors conclude that sustained warming is associated with reduction in mixing in the lake, stagnation of algal production, and significant shrinking of the habitat of the lake's key bottom dwellers, such as molluscs and crustaceans.""Our idea was to look at the fish fossil record and to see when that decline actually started,"" said Prof Andrew Cohen from the University of Arizona,""If it happened before the start of the industrial fishing in the 1950s, you'd have strong evidence that the decline is not simply driven by this fishing activity and that's exactly what we found.""The scientists don't discount the impact of fishing over the past six decades. They recognise that there has been a significant increase in the 1990s as refugees from numerous regional conflicts poured into the areas around the lake.""Fishing in the lake is a Wild West activity, there are nominal controls but no teeth,"" said Prof Cohen.""Given the current trends of warming, the lake stratification will get stronger and the productivity will continue to be affected by that. The people in charge of these decisions need to be thinking about alternative livelihoods for people in the region.""Other researchers are alarmed about the future of the lake. One said: ""We are sleepwalking into a disaster.""Others point to the fact that the in Europe and North America, a warming climate is increasing production in lakes. But the tropics are very different.""In tropical regions, the increased stratification is doing the reverse, at least in some lakes,"" said Prof John Smol from Queen's University in Kingston, Canada.""Decreasing algal production means that the base of the food chain is being affected - and this can cascade though the food chain up to fish and organisms - like humans - who depend on these resources.""Besides the threat to food supplies and jobs, the impact of warming on the biodiversity of Lake Tanganyika is of great scientific concern as well. Prof Cohen argues that we should think of the lake as being as significant as some of the world's key hotspots.""Think about the Galapagos, and how iconic they are, Lake Tanganyika has many times more endemic species and nobody knows about it,"" he said.""It's coming to bite us in terms of really impacting livelihoods for people around the lake, and the fact they have so many unsettled people in the region.""These social and environmental trends are converging and I would say it's a really urgent issue to be aware of and start doing something about.""The research has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook."
science	Warming speeds 'world's slowest moving landslides'		"Rising global temperatures are helping to speed up slow moving landslides across Alaska.Researchers told BBC News that the geological features, known as frozen debris lobes, are now threatening a major highway.The warming climate is said to have hastened some of the rocky fingers to a heady speed of five metres a year.Engineers believe that either moving the roadway or freezing the ground may be effective solutions.These teardrop shaped, slow moving bodies of material are made up of soil, rock, water, ice and trees.Researchers for many years believed these features to be rock glaciers - but scientists in Alaska believe that the masses they've observed are different and distinct. They call them frozen debris lobes.The lobes are often covered in trees and vegetation and according to those who have studied them, they don't have an icy core. They say that thanks to a combination of pressure and temperature, the water at the centre stays liquid.The lobes are gathering speed, according to those who have studied them. In size they can be 100m wide, 20m high and up to 1km in length.""They are coming downhill, the closest is only 40 metres away from the toe of the embankment of the highway,"" said Dr Margaret Darrow from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.""You can figure out that moving at 5m a year, how many years it's going to take!""According to a research paper published in 2012 by Dr Darrow, the rate of movement of the lobe closest to the highway was just over 1cm a day between 1955 and 2008. However measurements in 2012 showed a speed of 2.5cm per day.The scientists say there are over 23 such lobes within 2km uphill of the Dalton Highway, one of the most important roads in Alaska.It links Fairbanks in the centre of the state to the Arctic shore on the north coast. The critically important Trans-Alaskan oil pipeline sits right beside it.Dr Darrow says that she believes rising temperatures in the region are responsible for the increase in speed. She says that there is an internal flow within the lobe that she attributes to unfrozen water within the soil, that allows it to slide along at increasing speed.""When the temperatures are warmer, it moves faster,"" she told BBC News.""I would project that if temperatures warm it will move faster, and there's a relationship between temperatures and precipitation. I would assume that with rising temperatures we will see more rainfall and if that is the case they will move faster.""Climate researchers say that Alaska has warmed by double the rate of the rest of the United States over the past 50 years.Plans have now been drawn up to move a section of the Dalton highway in 2017 in order to avoid a collision with the ever encroaching lobe.Some have proposed blowing up the part nearest the road, but the scientists think this would make matters worse. A better solution, they believe, is to freeze the ground around the lobe.""There's one feature that is really threatening the road within 10 years, but cooling if done right should work - if theoretical physics works as we think it does,"" said Dr Ronald Daanen, with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, who was the first researcher to identify the features back in 2007.""It needs to happen from underneath so you'd need to do some directional drilling.""There are still some sceptics within the scientific community who question the true nature of these geological features - and show some reluctance to classify the lobes as distinct phenomena.""Some people really still want to to call these features rock glaciers,"" said Dr Daanen.""Europeans like to hang on to terms that they know.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Shrinking bird pays the bill for Arctic warming	Paying the bill	"A migratory bird has shrunk in stature as temperatures warm at its Arctic breeding ground, according to research.As a consequence of climate change, the red knot may have a lower survival chance on a different continent, say scientists.The shore bird breeds in the Arctic in the summer and flies to tropical habitats in winter.Scientists believe shrinkage in body size is a response to climate change in different animals.The latest research, published in the journal, Science, looked at the red knot (Calidris canutus).The wading bird is one of the record-breakers for long distance flight, being able to cover about 5,000 km without stopping.An international team studied the bird over 30 years at its stop-off point in Russia.""We see a change in body size and also a change in body shape,"" said lead researcher Dr Jan van Gils of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and Utrecht University.He told the BBC's Science in Action programme: ""What is peculiar about this is that we have strong evidence that this is an effect of climate change and people have seen in other species changes in body size in response to climate change.""The study was the first to show that shrinking in response to climate change was a disadvantage to an animal, because the smaller birds had a lower survival rate, he added.The scientists found that over the course of 30 years, the date of the snow melt in the Arctic had advanced by more than two weeks.Meanwhile, the birds produced smaller and smaller offspring - probably because the chicks missed the main food supply at the time of the thaw.The birds pay the price when they arrive in Africa after their long flight.Analysis of the diet of the red knot in its winter home found that individuals with a longer bill could delve into the mud for molluscs.However, those with a shorter bill could not reach the shellfish, and were forced to eat less nutritious food.""There are only a few birds nowadays that make it to adulthood - those are the ones that are small and have a relatively long bill,"" Dr van Gils explained.The study shows that long-term changes in the body architecture of Arctic wading birds can affect their survival in their tropical wintering range, said Martin Wikelski of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany.""Thus, changes in one habitat may have important ecological consequences in habitats halfway around the world,"" he said in an editorial in Science.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Warming set to breach 1C threshold	Difficult to measureUN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015New normalA brief history of two degrees	"Global temperatures are set to rise more than one degree above pre-industrial levels according to the UK's Met Office.Figures from January to September this year are already 1.02C above the average between 1850 and 1900.If temperatures remain as predicted, 2015 will be the first year to breach this key threshold.The world would then be half way towards 2C, the gateway to dangerous warming.The new data is certain to add urgency to political negotiations in Paris later this month aimed at securing a new global climate treaty.For researchers, confusion about the true level of temperatures in the 1750s, when the industrial revolution began and fossil fuels became widely used, means that an accurate assessment of the amount the world has warmed since then is very difficult.To get over this problem, the Met Office use an average of the temperatures recorded between 1850 and 1900, which they argue makes their analysis more accurate.Their latest temperature information comes from a dataset jointly run by the Met Office and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.The HadCRUT database showed that in the first nine months of this year, the global mean temperature had just gone above 1C, hitting 1.02 with a error factor of plus or minus 0.11C.Scientists say that the one degree mark will be broken in 2015 because of a combination of carbon emissions and the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon.""We have seen a strong El Nino develop in the Tropical Pacific this year and that will have had some impact on this year's global temperature,"" said Stephen Belcher, director of the Met Office Hadley Centre.""We've had similar natural events in the past, yet this is the first time we're set to reach the 1C marker and it's clear that it is human influence driving our modern climate into uncharted territory.""COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.Explained: What is climate change?In video: Why does the Paris conference matter?Analysis: Latest from BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrathMore: BBC News climate change special reportIn 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that the combined land and ocean temperature showed warming of 0.85C between 1880 and 2012.They also noted that the difference in the average temperatures from the 1850 to 1900 period was 0.78C when compared to the average between 2003 and 2012.In other climate-related developments:Since 2013, warming of the oceans and land surfaces has reached new heights. The year 2014 went down as the warmest year since records began, but it is likely that 2015 will go beyond that level. Scientists believe that 2016 is also shaping up as a very warm year and they expect that the one degree margin will become more firmly established in the coming years.""This year marks an important first but that doesn't necessarily mean every year from now on will be a degree or more above pre-industrial levels, as natural variability will still play a role in determining the temperature in any given year,"" said Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring and attribution, at the Met Office.""As the world continues to warm in the coming decades, however, we will see more and more years passing the one degree marker - eventually it will become the norm.""Other researchers in the field say that while the 1C threshold is significant, the overall direction of travel is far more important.""What matters is this background warming that continues up,"" said Prof Miles Allen from the University of Oxford.""And whether we have a wobble that takes us to 1.02 or 0.99, ok it matters in a sporting event, but it doesn't really matter in terms of global mean temperature.""The development is likely to increase pressure on politicians to reach a decisive agreement at the UN climate conference in Paris later this month.After the failure of the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, political leaders agreed the following year in Cancun that two degrees of warming would be the agreed mark beyond which temperatures should not rise.Many island states disagree with the two degree goal and want the UN to adopt a lower threshold of 1.5C.A UN analysis of the carbon cutting plans put forward by nations ahead of the Paris meeting concluded that, taken together, they would lead to warming of 2.7C above pre-industrial levels.UK Energy and Climate Secretary Amber Rudd says the latest findings from the Met Office underline the need for a deal in Paris.""Pledges to reduce emissions made by countries so far represent a significant commitment but that's just the beginning,"" she said in a statement.""We need to ensure that as the costs of clean energy fall, countries can be more ambitious with their climate targets.""The idea of a dangerous warming threshold was first mentioned by Yale economist William Nordhaus in the 1970s. In 1990, the Stockholm Environmental Institute came forward with a more definitive statement that 2C should be taken as the level at which dangerous warming would occur.However politicians meeting at the Rio summit in 1992 refused to explicitly adopt the target. The first political body to declare that 2C was the goal, was the 1996 European Council of environment ministers, which included a young Angela Merkel as the German representative.The main UN bodies though were wary of including the target despite the urging of scientists, and it took climate negotiators until 2010 in Cancun to commit their governments to ""hold the increase in global average temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Warming unlikely to limit chances of UK soggy summers	Key factorsPublic perception	"The UK is likely to continue to have soggy summers regardless of global warming according to a new study.Scientists say that greenhouse gases will cause a general rise in summer temperatures, over the course of this century.But they argue, it is random shifts in Atlantic storm tracks that determine whether our summers are hot and sunny or cool and wet.The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.One of the big challenges for climate scientists is to work out how warming at a global level translates down to regional or local impacts.Researchers are also trying to understand the relative impacts on climate systems of internal and external factors.Greenhouse gases, volcanic eruptions and solar irradiance are all external factors that can impact the climate - but there is also internal variability which is caused by natural processes within the climate system, such as El Niño.In this study, researchers attempted to tease out some of these questions in relation to the summer climate over Europe for the past 1,000 years.Using measurements from instruments, information from tree ring records and lake sediments, the team was able to build up a detailed picture of temperatures rising and falling across the continent as a whole, linked to changes in the bigger pictures such as volcanoes, rising emissions of warming gases and energy from the Sun.But when they looked at the temperature differences between northern and southern Europe, they found that these were influenced far more by the position of the summer storm track across the Atlantic.When it veered north, the UK was wet and soggy while southern Europe was hot and dry. When it turned south, the north was sunny and warm.""The position of the storm track coming in over the Atlantic and hitting Europe is not related to the climate forcing factors such as greenhouse gas emissions and solar variability,"" said lead author Dr Mary Gagen from Swansea University.""The history of past 1,000 years is of that storm track position wandering around.""The authors argue that while global warming will continue and is linked to emissions of greenhouse gases, the effect of variable factors like the storm track can act for or against this underlying rise.""We may have rising temperatures in a predictable way, but every now and again the climate systems in this part of the world can roll the sixes on a dice, of very cold wet summers or very warm dry summers,"" said Dr Gagen.""There is no predictable element to that at all.""The researchers say that these factors are important because they can influence the general public's perceptions of global warming.Newspaper reports on climate change in the UK have often painted a positive picture, suggesting that farming will benefit and vineyards will commonplace. However this study suggests that the long, hot summers of a warmer future are unlikely.""If you look at the energy balance of the whole Earth, if you increase CO2 it has to get warmer,"" said co-author Prof Danny McCarroll also from Swansea University.""But what people really experience is what happens where they live and there is much more of a random component. One part is forced and one part is random and the smaller the spatial scale the more important the random side is.""""This really impacts on people's perceptions of climate change - if you get 3 or 4 hot summers in a row, people will say global warming is real, but if you get 3 or 4 wet summers, people perceive it as not warming, when the average temperature is still going up.""Much of the data for this study was produced by the Millennium Paleoclimate project, involving almost 40 institutions across the European Union.But one key question that has not yet been answered is how the current period of warming could impact the future movement of the Atlantic storm track.""They couldn't find any signal of the forcing to explain these changes to date,"" said Dr Pablo Ortega from the University of Reading, who wasn't involved with the study.""But it doesn't mean that this shift in the storm track won't be responding in the future to the greenhouse gas increase.""Dr Ortega is hoping that this type of research will evolve so that the random changes of the storm track could also be incorporated into forecasts, something he admits is still a significant challenge.""In Europe, if we can see in the models there is going to be a consistent change then we would know how to adapt.""""But that could be too optimistic.""Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook."
science	New crop varieties 'can't keep up with global warming'	Out of date	"Crops yields around the world could fall within a decade unless action is taken to speed up the introduction of new varieties.A study says temperatures are rising faster than the development of crop varieties that can cope with a warmer world.In Africa, researchers found that it can take 10-30 years before farmers can grow a new breed of maize.By the time these new crops are planted, they face a warmer environment than they were developed in.The scientists behind the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looked closely at the impact of temperature rises on crop duration - that's the length of time between planting and harvesting.They found that in a warmer world durations will be shorter meaning these varieties will have less time to accumulate biomass and yields could be affected.In their paper, the researchers write that crop duration will become significantly shorter as early as 2018 in some regions but by 2031, the majority of maize-growing areas of Africa will be affected.""The actual changes in yield may be different but this effect is there, the impact of this change in duration will occur unless breeding changes,"" said lead author Prof Andy Challinor from the University of Leeds.""The durations will be shorter than what they were bred for - by the time they are in the field they are, in terms of temperature, out of date.""New varieties of maize need between 10-30 years of development before they are ready to be grown by farmers.The scientists say the lag is down to a combination of factors including the limited number of crops you can grow in a season, the need for government approved testing and there are also a number of problems of access to markets that can increase the time it takes before the farmers have the new seeds to plant.Increasing the speed of development is important but according to Prof Challinor, so is making smarter assumptions about future conditions.""We can use the climate models to tell us what the temperatures are going to be,"" he told BBC News,""We can then put those temperature elevations into the greenhouses and then we can breed the crops at those temperatures. People are beginning to do this, but this paper provides the hard evidence of the necessity of it.""Researchers are also working on the impact of heat stress on crops at sites in Zimbabwe, Kenya and Ethiopia. Data from these trials is being used to identify species that could cope with warmer conditions.But would the use of genetic modification (GM) help speed up this type of work?""GM does some things faster, so you would get a new variety of crop faster,"" said Prof Challinor.""But it doesn't get you out of the testing requirement in fact the testing may in fact be greater and it doesn't help it all with farmers accessing seeds and markets - the problem will remain even for a magic GM crop.""Better techniques and more money for research are the keys according to others in this field, familiar with the study.""Investment in agricultural research to develop and disseminate new seed technologies is one of the best investments we can make for climate adaptation,"" said Dr Andy Jarvis, from the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture,""Climate funds could be used to help the world's farmers stay several steps ahead of climate change, with major benefits for global food security.""The researchers believe that the study also has implications beyond Africa, especially in the maize growing regions of the tropics.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook."
science	Global warming increases 'food shocks' threat		"Climate change is increasing the risk of severe 'food shocks' where crops fail and prices of staples rise rapidly around the world.Researchers say extreme weather events that impact food production could be happening in seven years out of ten by the end of this century.The authors argue that an over reliance on global trade may make these production shocks worse.The impacts are most likely to be felt across Africa and the Middle East.Poor harvests and low stocks of grains in 2008 combined with a host of other factors to produce a spectacular price rise in cereals, with a UN index of prices peaking at 2.8 times higher than it was at the turn of the millennium.In 2010-11, a heat wave in Russia led to the country's worst drought in 40 years, decimating the grain harvest and leading indirectly, to food riots in North African countries as prices of bread rose rapidly.Now researchers from the US and the UK have analysed the chances of extreme weather events causing these types of food shocks as the world warms over the coming century.Looking at the production of rice, wheat, maize and soybeans, the scientists found that the the chances of a one in 100-year production disruption is likely to increase to a one in 30-year event by 2040.From 2070 onward, they estimate that severe shocks, which could see global production drop by 10%, could be happening in seven out of ten years.""It is very difficult to characterise these extreme events and their frequency, but what we do see quite clearly is that events that are very rare in the present day are becoming more frequent in the future,"" said Kirsty Lewis, one of the authors, from the UK's Met Office.""The most extreme events of the future are likely to become more intense, so potentially larger shocks and more frequent shocks.""The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation says that increasing population will drive demand for food up by 60% by 2050 in any case, so there is going to be significant pressure on food production.The fight against global malnutritionCould science improve the nutrition of millions?Climate change could be the extra element that rapidly changes the global picture.""We've got these pressures on the food system, part of which is climate change,"" said Prof Tim Benton, from the UK Global Food Security Programme.""But we're highlighting the fact that with weather variability and increases of extremes we are adding a layer of difficulty - Because it happens suddenly within a year, it is more difficult to adjust slowly like we'd cope with demand increases.""""If we are coping with demand increase by sustainable intensification, but then we suddenly have a catastrophic year, and we lose a big chunk of the world's calories, everybody will feel it.""The biggest impact of these production shocks were likely to be felt across Africa and the Middle East, said the authors.Countries like the UK and the US would be able to cope because more processed food is consumed in the wealthier regions so the changing price of basic commodities was less of a factor in the price.""The most vulnerable countries that are going to be worst affected are low income food-deficit countries, predominantly those in sub-Saharan Africa,"" said author Rob Bailey from Chatham House.""You can imagine that the poorest households in these sorts of countries spending upwards of 50% of their income on food. So if you are in a situation where food prices are increased by 50-100% that leaves them in an almost untenable position,"" he said.The researchers say that international trade worked well when food was in plentiful supply but when demand increased, countries often imposed export controls which usually made the situation worse.Another factor was biofuel, where land was taken out of food production, tipping the balance towards scarcity.The researchers say that governments must try to understand the risks, rather than simply stockpiling food and grains.There should be efforts to reform world trade so that countries don't retreat behind barriers when crops fail.

"It's been a bit of a dream week for the ""warmist"" brigade!Clambering out of his tiny Fiat 500 car, the Pope came to Washington to tell the world that dealing with climate change can no longer be left to future generations.He emphasised ""that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet"".Even though the soon to be ex-House Speaker John Boehner was moved to tears by the mere presence of Pontifex, Republicans generally were not so wowed.Perhaps inspired by the man in the snazzy white cassock, the leaders of the US and China issued a joint statement on climate change that has been headlined on the announcement of a national cap and trade scheme for China to start in 2017.The statement from the White House shows that China has gone even further, signing up to a ""common vision"" with the US on the Paris climate agreement that sets out their ""shared understandings"" with talk of a long-term low-carbon transformation of the global economy and ramping up ambition over the years.And at a time when trust on the reality of how much emissions can be curbed has wavered (I'm looking at you folks!), the US-China statement said both countries ""agreed on the need for an enhanced transparency system to build mutual trust and confidence, and promote effective implementation, including through reporting and review of action,"" in the 2020 period of any new climate deal.This will hearten the US who have been hankering after a robust verification system for years.Many commentators believe that overall the statement has strengthened Mr Obama's position.""It has strengthened the President's hand, in saying that he is getting the world's largest emitter to move and that China is starting to walk the talk,"" said Alden Meyer, a long-time participant in international climate talks, who represents the Union of Concerned Scientists.""Those who say that China is doing nothing are just blowing smoke. I think it will definitely strengthen the President's domestic political position, but I don't think it will change too many of those opponents' minds.""Undoubtedly, the statement helps clear away some of the lingering obstructions on the highway to a Paris deal.But all this White House rose-garden cosiness doesn't necessarily mean that everything is suddenly smelling sweet.In the UN negotiations, China is a founder and key member of the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group, which includes Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, India, Saudi Arabia and others.Many of these countries are keenly opposed to any change in the long-held, simplistic UN division between rich and poor, based on where the world was in 1992.According to reports, at a meeting earlier this month in India, the LMDCs ""expressed concern regarding shifting the financial burden to developing countries and the attempt to expand the list of countries with obligations under the Convention (UNFCCC) to provide climate finance and at the same time shrink the list of countries eligible for receiving climate finance"".China, it seems, wants to keep a foot in both camps.The LMDC statement on climate finance contrasts strongly with China's new commitment at the White House that developing countries should also put their hands in their pockets to help the really poor states.In the United Nations climate negotiations, complex formations of countries have evolved over the past 20 years. One of the most recently formed is the Like Minded Developing Countries group (LMDCs), made up of 13 nations - Argentina, Bolivia, China, Cuba, El Salvador, Ecuador, India, Iran, Malaysia, Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Vietnam.But this being the UN, it's not as straightforward as that. China and all the others are members of the G77 group which, confusingly, has 133 members. India and China are also in a type of BRIC formation called the BASIC group, while others are part of geographic formations such as the African group and the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS). Then there are two central and South American groupings, ALBA and AILAC.Confused? There's a grouping for that too!To get the ball rolling, China chipped in a commitment of $3bn to help developing countries. That may not go down well with Bolivia's Evo Morales and co.""The like-minded dynamics are interesting because China has been a creator and key player in that grouping but the position of that group is increasingly at odds with what China is saying in Washington,"" said Alden Meyer.Perhaps it's ideological, perhaps it's just negotiating, but sometime between now and the middle of December, China is going to have to square this circle.Perhaps it will take the presence of the Pope in Paris to allow all parties to make the necessary final compromises?Keep an eye out for Fiat 500s on the roads around Le Bourget!Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	'Perfect storm' of El Niño and warming boosted Alberta fires	Dry winterNot local but global	"El Niño and ongoing climate change have both contributed to the devastating Alberta wildfires according to experts.The weather phenomenon has caused much drier conditions than normal, leading to a massive increase in the number of fires in the province.Alberta has had 330 wildfires already this year, more than double the recent annual average.Global warming has also seen wildfire seasons lengthen considerably since 1979, according to studies.Alberta and much of western Canada experienced a serious drought last year. So great was the impact on farmers, the province declared an agricultural emergency.The dry conditions continued through the winter with the western part of Canada then feeling the impact of El Niño.Scientists say the current El Niño event is one of the strongest on record, with the effects felt all over the world including a reduced monsoon in India and droughts in parts of Africa.""We've had an incredibly dry winter, we didn't have enough snow pack,"" said Prof Judith Kulig from the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, who believes a ""perfect storm"" of factors, including El Niño, has come together to cause the huge fire.""This year the fire season officially began March 1st, last year it was March 15th. These are significant changes when the fire season used to begin in May and now begins in March.""That fingerprint of El Niño saw Fort McMurray record a temperature of 32.6C earlier this week, which is significantly above the normal high temperature for early May of around 14C.Many researchers believe that El Niño was not the only factor increasing the likelihood of a major fire in Alberta.They point to the bigger global picture of rising temperatures, which in the first four months of this year are running more than 1C above the long-term average.In January a Canadian study suggested that warming would lead to a ""higher frequency of extreme fire weather days"" across the country.The author of that paper, Dr Mike Flannigan from the University of Alberta, seems in little doubt that climate change was at least partly responsible for the outbreak around Fort McMurray.""This is consistent with what we expect from human-caused climate change affecting our fire regime,"" he told reporters.A number of research papers have highlighted the fact that warming is leading to an increase in wildfire risk. Studies have also shown that northern latitudes are feeling those impacts more strongly.""Some of the changes can be ascribed to improvements in reporting but there are datasets which show the fire season has lengthened,"" said Prof Martin Wooster, from King's College London and NERC National Centre for Earth Observation.""There have been papers that have shown that not only in theory the conditions are there for longer, but also the actual area of burn has increased over the past half century.""""That sort of thing is more likely to be able to be said in Canada than in other places.""One factor that is often overlooked in the race to discover the causes of natural disasters is demography.Just before the last major El Niño in 1997, the population of Fort McMurray was just over 30,000. The last census indicated it was over 60,000.More people means not just a greater impact when fires occur, it also suggests the chances of one starting are increased.""There is this thing called the wild land urban interface, which is where people's homes get increasingly close to environments still undeveloped - and fire is able to come out of these 'natural' areas,"" Prof Wooster said.""And if you get more people you are more likely to get ignitions.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook"
science	'Wrong type of trees' in Europe increased global warming	Management issues	"The assumption that planting new forests helps limit climate change has been challenged by a new study.Researchers found that in Europe, trees grown since 1750 have actually increased global warming.The scientists believe that replacing broadleaved species with conifers is a key reason for the negative climate impact.Conifers like pines and spruce are generally darker and absorb more heat than species such as oak and birch.The authors believe the work has implications for current efforts to limit rising temperatures through mass tree planting.Europe's green canopy was dramatically thinned between 1750 and 1850, when the forested area diminished by 190,000 sq km.Ironically the greater use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, slowed the timber rush, and from 1850 to the present day, Europe's forests grew by some 386,000 sq km and now cover 10% more land than before the industrial revolution.However, the form and content of these new woods differed considerably from what went before.In the distant past, these forests ran wild - but in the modern world, some 85% of Europe's trees are managed by humans. And over the past 150 years, foresters have adopted a scientific approach to woodlands - planting faster growing, more commercially valuable trees such as a Scots pine and Norway spruce.The rapid re-forestation of great swathes of Europe has generally been seen as a good thing due to the trees' ability to soak up carbon, something that has become particularly relevant in recent decades.But the new study questions the positive impact of all these new trees on the climate.The research team reconstructed 250 years of forest management history in Europe - and found that the way forests are controlled by humans can lead to far less carbon being stored than would have been the case when nature was in charge.Removing trees in an organised fashion tends to release carbon that would otherwise remain stored in forest litter, dead wood and soil.Choosing conifers over broadleaved varieties also had significant impacts on the albedo - the amount of solar radiation reflected back into space.""Even well managed forests today store less carbon than their natural counterparts in 1750,"" said Dr Kim Naudts who carried out the study while at the Laboratory of Climate Science and Environment in Gif-sur-Yvette, France.Speaking to Science in Action on the BBC World Service, she said: ""Due to the shift to conifer species, there was a warming over Europe of almost 0.12 degrees and that is caused because the conifers are darker and absorb more solar radiation.""The researchers say that the increase in temperature equates to 6% of the global warming attributed to the burning of fossil fuels. They say that is a significant amount and believe that similar impacts are likely in regions where the same type of afforestation has taken place.Many governments have made planting trees a key part of their plans for dealing with climate change; China is building a ""great green wall"" of trees, set to cover around 400 million hectares when complete.The authors suggest the world should look carefully at both the types trees that we are planting and the ways in which they are managed.""We shouldn't put our hopes on forests to mitigate what is an emission problem,"" said Dr Naudts.""Our results indicate that in large parts of Europe, a tree planting programme would offset the emissions but it would not cool the planet, especially not if the afforestation is done with conifers.""The researchers believe that consideration should be given to a programme of replacement. As the conifers are harvested, more broadleaved species could replace them.The study has been published in the journal Science.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook."
science	Global warming threatens extinction for UK butterflies		"Global warming could drive drought sensitive butterfly species to extinction in the UK by 2050, according to new research.Scientists found that even the lowest expected levels of warming could decimate populations.However the researchers found that restoring connections between butterfly habitats could help modify the worst impacts.The research has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Although many people believe that butterflies are creatures that love the warmth, periods of extremely hot and dry weather can significantly reduce populations.In this study, British researchers looked at the impact of an extreme drought event in 1995 on butterfly species. This was the most arid summer since records began in 1776.They identified six species, including the Cabbage White and the Speckled Wood butterflies, that were particularly sensitive to heat.They then looked at what might happen to these creatures under different levels of warming up to 2100.If emissions of carbon dioxide continue on a ""business as usual"" model, and warming is more extreme, then extinctions of some of these species could begin in England as early as 2050.""We looked at the extent to which populations crashed from the drought and how long it takes them to recover,"" said lead author Dr Tom Oliver from Nerc Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.""What we're asking is, as droughts become more frequent whether the return time of the drought was more frequent than the recovery of the butterflies.""""And when that was the case you'd get this gradual population erosion and in those places you'd get local extinctions.""The researchers say that areas of the south east of England would be worst affected.However they argue that under less extreme warming conditions, changes to butterfly habitats could ameliorate the worst impacts.The team found that restoring connections between habitats that have been fragmented by human activities such as agriculture, was capable of making a big difference.Under a low emissions scenario, bridging these connections could improve the probability of butterfly survival by 50%.""If our habitats are very fragmented, the impacts will be much more severe. In places where it isn't those populations might persist,"" said Dr Oliver.""It allows us to buy time until we get those global emission cuts in place.""The researchers believe their study is a conservative estimation of how warming might impact these fragile species.They are concerned that, because of landscape changes in the UK throughout the 20th century, populations of some of the threatened species might be too low for them to recover from frequent droughts.The authors say that even people who are not impressed by the aesthetic appeal of butterflies should still be concerned about their demise.""Butterflies are important culturally as part of our natural heritage, but there are other functions that could be impacted by their extinction including pollution, pest control and decomposition of waste,"" said Dr Oliver.""Those un-swayed by the beauty and importance of having butterflies in the countryside ought to be concerned about the disruption to these functions provided by these species.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Permafrost warming in parts of Alaska 'is accelerating'	Melting fast'Convincing' caseIndirect impacts	"One of the world's leading experts on permafrost has told BBC News that the recent rate of warming of this frozen layer of earth is ""unbelievable"".Prof Vladimir Romanovsky said that he expected permafrost in parts of Alaska would start to thaw by 2070.Researchers worry that methane frozen within the permafrost will be released, exacerbating climate changeThe professor said a rise in permafrost temperatures in the past four years convinced him warming was real.Permafrost is perennially frozen soil that has been below zero degrees C for at least two years.It's found underneath about 25% of the northern hemisphere, mainly around the Arctic - but also in the Antarctic and Alpine regions.It can range in depth from one metre under the ground all the way down to 1,500m.Scientists are concerned that in a warming world, some of this permanently frozen layer will thaw out and release methane gas contained in the icy, organic material.Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and researchers estimate that the amount in permafrost equates to more than double the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere.Worries over the current state of permafrost have been reinforced by Prof Romanovsky.A professor at the University of Alaska, he is also the head of the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost, the primary international monitoring programme.He says that in the northern region of Alaska, the permafrost has been warming at about one-tenth of a degree Celsius per year since the mid 2000s.""When we started measurements it was -8C, but now it's coming to almost -2.5 on the Arctic coast. It is unbelievable - that's the temperature we should have here in central Alaska around Fairbanks but not there,"" he told BBC News.In Alaska, the warming of the permafrost has been linked to trees toppling, roads buckling and the development of sinkholes.Prof Romanovsky says that the current evidence indicates that in parts of Alaska, around Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope, the permafrost will not just warm up but will thaw by about 2070-80.""It was assumed it would be stable for this century but it seems that's not true any more,"" he told BBC News.He says the current permafrost evidence has convinced him that global warming is real and not just a product of natural variation.""Ten years ago, if you asked permafrost scientists around the globe I would say 98% would say: 'The thawing at Prudhoe Bay won't happen by the end of this century',"" Prof Romanovsky explained.""But now I think it is very possible, and I changed my opinion right during the last four years. I was in the 98%, but now I say it's possible.""About 10 years ago when I looked at our records, I said that they all show that permafrost temperatures should cool down a bit on multi-decadal timescales.""I told myself that if it would not cool down I would 100% believe in global warming, and now I believe 100% that we have this very serious trend of warming,"" he said.While engineering can prevent the thawing of permafrost underneath important structures, there is little that can be done to prevent the general melting of the layer.Scientists believe that the thawing will be gradual, with no major tipping point. There are many unknown factors about the rate of thawing and whether the impacts will be the same across all Arctic regions.There are also concerns about the bubbling of methane from undersea permafrost in the shallow waters off the Russian Arctic, but researchers say they do not know yet how significant this might be.There is also a worry about giant sinkholes, some of which appeared in Siberia last year. Experts say that melting permafrost may have unleashed enough methane to cause the ejection of material that formed the holes.Another expert in the field acknowledged that while the problems in Alaska were serious, scientists were getting a better handle on the amounts of carbon that were likely to be released.However, Prof Ted Schuur from Northern Arizona University recognised that, despite the scientific progress, the fact was that thawing would occur and methane would leach into the atmosphere.""Even if we stopped all emissions today, the Arctic has momentum where there is going to be more warming, more permafrost degradation and some carbon coming out already - we have started the ball rolling in some senses.""""It is probably not triggering a runaway climate effect but it adds to our problem. It accelerates the problem, of climate change. To me that is worrisome because it makes the problem harder.""Prof Schuur added that indirect impacts of warming were also speeding the thaw. In Alaska in 2015, there were near-record wildfires, which he said heightens the exposure of permafrost to warmer air.He believes that political negotiations on a new global climate deal, currently underway in Germany and set to conclude in Paris in December, are essential to the long term preservation of permafrost.""The climate negotiators meeting in Bonn, and in Paris, won't immediately be able to change what happens with the fire season in Alaska next year, but we can slow the process down by focussing on human emissions and in my mind that's the best bet to have the most control.""It's very hard to control these landscape global processes that are occurring in the Arctic.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	COP21: Coal plans would derail 2 degree warming target	Halfway houseUN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015	"Attempts to keep global warming to 2 degrees will be wildly off course if all planned coal fire plants are built.That's the conclusion of a new analysis presented here at the UN climate conference near Paris.Researchers said construction would see emissions four times higher than the 2 degree target by 2030.They say the building plans are in conflict with the carbon cutting agendas of countries like India and China.The Climate Action Tracker analysis says that 2,440 coal fired power stations are planned around the world before 2030.Emissions from the world's existing plants will be 150% higher than what is consistent with a 2 degree target, says their report.COP21 Live: read the latest from ParisBut if all those in the planning stage are actually built, the outlook would be far more pessimistic.""If all of them were to be built, they would emit 6.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2030,"" said Dr Niklas Hohne, one of the research team.""If you add all of the power plants that are existing today and will still be operating in 2030, you come to 12 gigatonnes from coal fired power in 2030 and that's actually 400% higher than is necessary for 2 degrees.""Scientists say the 2 degrees target is the threshold of dangerous warming. Temperatures have already gone up around one degree from pre-industrial times, according to the latest research.The coal study looks at eight countries including India, China, Indonesia and the European Union. All of them have submitted national carbon cutting plans, termed INDCs, promising to reduce or cap their emissions.But many of these countries are pushing ahead with plans for coal fired power as a way of getting as many of their people on the electricity grid as rapidly as possible.""For seven of the nine countries, the planned coal plants threaten their INDCs,"" said Markus Hagemann of the NewClimate Institute, who took part in the study.""This would lead to higher emissions from coal plants and it would undermine the country's efforts and it could also lead in a worst case to a displacement of renewable energy.""The researchers believe that in many nations the apparent contradiction is caused by politics.Different government departments have different plans, they say, and these power battles are leading to many countries offering to cut their carbon while increasing their reliance on coal.According to some participants these contradictory signals are having a negative impact on the chances of setting a long term goal to get rid of fossil fuels.One participant said the idea of including the term in the text being negotiated here had become ""toxic"" at COP21.""Decarbonisation is emerging as a toxic word; many countries appear as quite opposed to decarbonisation,"" said Bill Hare, of Climate Analytics.""Many of those countries, though not all, whose coal plans would breach their INDCs are among those opposed to the word decarbonisation.""You can begin to draw a line between the coal stations being planned and the negotiating dynamics here of the long term goals.""India and China are said to oppose the idea of including the term or the idea as the long term goal in the text.But the Indian environment minister gave a robust defence of his country's plans to continue using coal while increasing the amount of renewables.""My energy consumption is one twelfth that of US and one tenth that of Europe, so don't you think that my people also have a right to grow and use energy?,"" said Prakash Javadekar.""Should they remain in the dark? Is that humanity? That is why I will need power from all sources. We are increasing our renewable targets tenfold in the next 15 years but we will require coal because it is the need of the hour for my people to grow.""COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.Explained: What is climate change?In video: Why does the Paris conference matter?Analysis: Latest from BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrathMore: BBC News climate change special report"
science	Climate change: Polarstern icebreaker begins year-long Arctic drift		"German Research Vessel Polarstern has found a location to begin its year-long drift in Arctic sea-ice.The ship, which will head the North Pole's biggest scientific expedition, will settle next to a thick ice floe on the Siberian side of the ocean basin.The precise location is 85 degrees north and 137 degrees east.Hundreds of investigators will use it as a base from which to probe the impacts of climate change at the top of the world.""After a brief but intensive search, we've found our home for the months to come,"" said expedition leader Prof Markus Rex, from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI).""It may not be the perfect floe but it's the best one in this part of the Arctic and offers better working conditions than we could have expected after a warm Arctic summer.""RV Polarstern set out on its MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) mission two weeks ago.It travelled from the Norwegian port of Tromsø, supported by other icebreakers in search of a suitable piece of ice where it could set up a camp.Sixteen possible locations were scouted with the aid of satellite imagery and helicopters. A metres-thick floe measuring roughly 2.5km by 3.5km was eventually chosen.The international expedition considers itself lucky to have identified its home so soon after departing Tromsø. This summer's warmth has produced the second smallest Arctic sea-ice extent in the satellite era. As a consequence, the ice capping the ocean surface is very thin.The floes, though, are now succumbing to the winter freeze-up. The Sun no longer rises above the horizon at the ship's location and it won't be long before the 24-hour darkness of ""polar night"" descends on the MOSAiC expedition.RV Polarstern will soon be locked solid in the ice.The vessel won't break free again until September or October next year, by which time it will have drifted past the North Pole and be in waters somewhere in the Fram Strait. This is the passage that runs between northeast Greenland and the Svalbard archipelago.MOSAiC's objective is to study all aspects of the climate system in the Arctic. Instrument stations will be set up on the ice all around the ship, including some up to 50km away.The ice, the ocean, the atmosphere, even the wildlife will all be sampled. The year-long investigations are designed to give more certainty to the projections of future change.Prof Rex told the BBC before departure that the Arctic was currently warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet but that the climate models were highly uncertain as to how this temperature trend would develop in the coming decades.""We don't have any robust climate predictions for the Arctic and the reason is we don't understand the processes there very well,"" he explained.""That's because we were never able to observe them year-round, and certainly not in winter when the ice is at its thickest and we can't break it with our research vessels.""Something similar to the €130m (£120m/$150m) MOSAiC mission has been tried before, but nothing comparable in scale.About 600 scientists are expected to spend months at a time with the Polarstern.They'll be brought in by the support icebreakers.When that's not possible at the height of winter, when the sea-ice is at its thickest, aircraft and long-range helicopters will have to deliver the necessary supplies and relief teams."
science	Warming 'worst case' must be considered say experts	Systemic risks	"Climate change risks should be assessed in the same way as threats to national security or public health according to a new report.For too long the world has seen rising temperatures as a problem of predicting long range weather forecasts.The authors says that that leaders must focus on the 'worst case scenarios' and how likely they are to occur.The report has been compiled by an international group of scientists and experts in risk.In a foreword to the new study, UK foreign minister Baroness Anelay says that previous responses to the threat of climate change have been far too narrow.""When we think about keeping our country safe, we always consider the worst case scenarios. That is what guides our policies on nuclear non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, and conflict prevention. We have to think about climate change the same way,"" she said.The report underlines, once again, the direct risks that warming poses. It says that at current rates of carbon emissions, a temperature rise of 4 degrees C is ""as likely as not"" by 2150.This would lead to significant impacts with lethal levels of heat stress, drought and crop failures among a host of other negatives.But the report goes on to stress that the biggest threats of climate change may come from what are termed ""systemic risks"".The study says that these come from the interactions of people, markets and governments.For instance, climate change may significantly increase the risk of extreme events impacting food production in the second half of this century.""If policy and market responses amplify rather than mitigate the shock,"" the report says, ""a plausible worst-case scenario in the present day could produce unprecedented price spikes on the global market, with a trebling of the prices of the worst affected grains.""The report also warns that the security implications of high levels of warming are considerable. Growing populations competing for resources could threaten the stability of countries that are currently considered developed.Migration, the authors warn, could become ""more of a necessity than a choice"".Politicians needed to consider the bigger picture, said Fiona Morrison, from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, a co-sponsor of the report.""One of the most important goals of climate change policy should be to recognise the possibility of very bad outcomes and a full risk assessment of all possibilities is the best way to achieve this. As actuaries, we see good decisions as being based on exploring difficult scenarios and using this information to mitigate risk.""Commissioned by the UK Foreign Office the authors include Sir David King, the UK Foreign Secretary's Special Representative for Climate Change and leading members of US and Chinese scientific committees along with experts in risk in energy, finance and military issues.Campaigners and environmentalists welcomed the report as a useful contribution, saying they believed it would help put pressure on politicians to deliver a new global deal by the end of this year, that would limit warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.""All countries need to better understand the potential consequences for their national security and prosperity of failing to meet the 2 degree C goal,"" said Nick Mabey from environmental think tank E3G.""This will require robust national climate risk management regimes to be built in the years after Paris if we are to see the additional action needed to maintain a climate that can deliver global security and prosperity.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Warming threat to emperor penguins		"Climate change is likely to cut Antarctica's 600,000-strong emperor penguin population by at least a fifth by 2100, a study suggests.The main threat to the penguins comes from changes to sea-ice cover in the Antarctic, which will affect their breeding and feeding.Dynamics will differ between penguin colonies, but all are expected to be in decline by the end of the century.Details are published in Nature Climate Change journal.The US, British and Dutch researchers urge governments to list the birds as endangered. Such a listing could impose restrictions on tourism and fishing.The team, led by Stephanie Jenouvrier of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said the global population of emperor penguins would probably decline by between 19 and 33% from current levels.Dr Jenouvrier said the penguins ""face possible extinction throughout a significant portion of their range in the foreseeable future"".She added that emperor colonies in Antarctica's Ross Sea may experience population declines later than others because sea ice conditions are still suitable for them.""Implementing a marine protected area in the Ross Sea could help buy time to avoid extinction and to put in place needed conservation and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies,"" she said.To feed their young, emperor penguins leave the colony for months at a time and travel long distances across Antarctic ice to reach open water to find nourishment, such as krill.They are dependent upon an optimal amount of sea ice cover for a variety of reasons, including refuge from predators while foraging.Changes to the sea-ice cover can also significantly affect the abundance of krill, the emperor's primary food source and a critical species in the Antarctic food web.More sea-ice is good for krill, but means that parents might have to waddle further to the sea.""There is a goldilocks point for ice and emperor penguins,"" Phil Trathan, an expert at the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), told Reuters.Mr Trathan said it was unclear if the ungainly birds could adapt by climbing on to land or higher ice. Four emperor penguin colonies had recently been found on ice shelves, above sea level where glaciers spill off the land.Satellite measurements of Antarctic sea-ice extent show winter coverage to be at record levels. However, climate computer modelling expects this trend to be reversed in the future, as conditions in the Antarctic warm."
science	US scientists: Global warming pause 'no longer valid'	'Hiatus'IPCC	"US researchers say new evidence casts doubt on the idea that global warming has ""slowed"" in recent years.A US government laboratory says the much talked about ""pause"" is an illusion caused by inaccurate data.Updated observations show temperatures did not plateau, say National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) scientists.The warming rate over the past 15 years is ""virtually identical"" to the last century, they report in Science.Dr Thomas Karl, of Noaa, who led the new analysis, said: ""We would hope that it would inform the general public that the temperature today really is continuing to warm.""Commenting on the study, Dr Ed Hawkins, climate scientist at the University of Reading, said: ""This suggests that the much-discussed recent slowdown in global temperatures is far less pronounced than previously thought.""The idea of a global warming ""hiatus"" arose from questions over why the trend of warming temperatures appeared to be stalling recently compared to the later part of the 20th Century.Various explanations have been put forward, including changes in volcanic and solar activity, and ocean currents.The new analysis corrects for ocean observations made using different methods as well as including new data on surface temperatures.Dr Peter Stott of the Met Office Hadley Centre said the results ""still show the warming trend over the past 15 years has been slower than previous 15 year periods"" and ""global temperatures have not increased smoothly"".""This means natural variability in the climate system or other external factors has still had an influence and it's important we continue research to fully understand all the processes at work,"" he said.Prof Piers Forster at the University of Leeds, said the study would not be the ""last word on this complex subject"".""This work doesn't detract from the fact that human activity is causing climate change but we need better understanding of short-term fluctuations in climate.""According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global average temperatures have increased by around 0.05C per decade in the period between 1998 and 2012.This compares with an average of 0.12 per decade between 1951 and 2012.The new analysis suggests a figure of 0.116 per decade for 2000-2014, compared with 0.113 for 1950-1999.""The IPCC's statement of two years ago - that the global surface temperature 'has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past 15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years' - is no longer valid,"" said Dr Karl, the director of Noaa's National Climatic Data Center.Follow Helen on Twitter."
science	Different depths reveal ocean warming trends	UnderestimationObscure depthsSea level change, 2005-2013	"The deeper half of the ocean did not get measurably warmer in the last decade, but surface layers have been warming faster than we thought since the 1970s, two new studies suggest.Because the sea absorbs 90% of the heat caused by human activity, its warmth is a central concern in climate science.The new work suggests that shallow layers bear the brunt of ocean warming.Scientists compared temperature data, satellite measurements of sea level, and results from climate models.Both the papers appear in the journal Nature Climate Change.Specifically in the Southern Hemisphere where fewer measurements have been made, a team of researchers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California investigated long-term warming in the top 700m of the ocean.They wanted to compare published warming rates, based on the sparse temperature data recorded directly from southern waters, with what could be predicted based on more detailed observations in the north, together with climate models and precise sea-level measurements.Sea levels across the planet are accurately assessed by satellites, which bounce radio waves off the ocean surface. And sea level changes are closely related to ocean temperature, because the water expands as it warms up.By combining these calculations, the scientists found that the rate of upper-ocean warming between 1970 and 2004 had been seriously underestimated. That inaccuracy is specific to the Southern Hemisphere, but is big enough, the scientists suggest, that global upper-ocean warming rates are also ""biased low"" - to the tune of 24% to 55%.The researchers say the underestimation probably arose simply from the scarcity of measurements in the south.""It's likely that due to the poor observational coverage, we just haven't been able to say definitively what the long-term rate of Southern Hemisphere ocean warming has been,"" said lead author Dr Paul Durack.""It's a really pressing problem - we're trying as hard as we can, as scientists, to provide the best information from the limited observations we have.""Dr Jan Zika, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton, agreed that Dr Durack's work highlighted the need for more data.""It could be that the heat uptake by the ocean is a stronger contribution than we previously thought,"" he told BBC News.Storage of heat in the oceans is the best explanation scientists have for the recent ""'slowdown'"" in the rise of global surface temperatures.Dr Zika added that the heat content of shallow layers is a particular concern, as that warmth is more likely to return to the atmosphere. ""If it were getting really deep down, then we might think that it's basically stuck there,"" he said.Meanwhile, at depths greater than 2km, temperatures appear relatively stable - at least as far as changes can be detected.That was the outcome of the second study, in which a team from the California Institute of Technology made thorough use of the vastly improved data coverage that has been delivered by the Argo programme of remote, floating probes.Source: Nature Climate ChangeThese devices started to be deployed in 1999 and there are now more than 3,600 of them adrift in our planet's oceans.Argo ""floats"" only record temperatures down to about 2km beneath the surface, so the Caltech researchers used that information to calculate the overall amount of heat absorbed by the upper 2km of the oceans (approximately the top half).Then, by subtracting that quantity of heat from the total ocean warming indicated by satellite observations of sea level, they estimated how much the deeper half of the ocean (below 2km) had warmed up.The result: once the high level of uncertainty associated with the calculations was taken into account, there was no change detected in the deep.""Combining those different observations, we ended up with a large uncertainty in our estimate,"" explained Dr William Llovel, the study's lead author.""But on the other hand, it is a global estimate. We're not using just a few observations from the deep ocean itself.""In a commentary for Nature Climate Change, Dr Gregory Johnson and Dr John Lyman, both from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle, US, said the results pointed to a crucial gap in ocean measurements.They suggested that clearer conclusions would come from the next generation of floating probes, known as Deep Argo. The first such device was launched in 2013 and plunged 6km beneath the waves off Puerto Rico; two other prototypes were deployed off the New Zealand coast in June 2014.""It is time to close the deep-ocean measurement gap and reduce the uncertainties in global planetary energy and sea-level budgets,"" wrote Dr Johnson and Dr Lyman.Dr Zika agrees. ""There are very clear, very plausible explanations for how the ocean could be taking up heat and offsetting global warming,"" he told the BBC.""But to attribute exactly where that heat's going, and whether it'll pop back out or not, is going to take more observations. We need to get those in place.""Follow Jonathan on Twitter"
science	UN: Climate plans must go further to prevent dangerous warming	UN climate conference 30 Nov - 11 Dec 2015	"The UN has released its assessment of national plans to limit climate change, submitted by 146 countries.Officials say the submissions, in their current form, won't keep global temperatures from rising by more than the 2C danger threshold.The global total of carbon emissions will continue to grow, although more slowly than over the past two decades.However the UN report says the plans are a major step forward and the 2C goal is still ""within reach"".The UN believes that these national climate plans, called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) will form the cornerstone of a binding, global treaty on climate change that will be agreed at a conference in Paris in December.According to the UN, the submissions now cover around 86% of global emissions: about four times the amount covered by the Kyoto Protocol, the world's first carbon cutting treaty.Their assessment is decidedly upbeat about the plans, despite acknowledging that taken together they point to rises in global temperatures of 2.7C above the pre-industrial level.Scientists have determined that if temperature rises exceed 2C, this will lead to significant and dangerous climate impacts, which will especially hit the world's poor.UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said the plans were an excellent first step: ""The INDCs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7C by 2100, by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four, five, or more degrees of warming projected by many prior to the INDCs.""Observers say the 2.7C figure is a substantial improvement on 3.1C, which was the estimate when the plans were assessed last December.COP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.Explained: What is climate change?In video: Why does the Paris conference matter?Analysis: Latest from BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrathMore: BBC News climate change special reportA key finding of the UN reports is that the INDCs will bring down per capita emissions by 9% by 2030.But while the rate of growth in CO2 may be declining, the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere will continue to grow significantly over the next 15 years.Compared to 2010 levels, the UN says that overall emissions could be up to 22% higher in 2030. The assessment says that, as they stand, the plans won't achieve the goal of peaking global emissions and then reducing them rapidly.Another concern is that 25% of the total range of emissions reductions are conditional upon financial support from richer countries.Despite these issues, the fact that so many countries, rich and poor, have submitted plans to cut carbon is giving environmental campaigners great hope that a new deal is imminent.""The vast majority of the INDCs this time around, 105 of them, contain concrete greenhouse gas mitigation targets. That's in contrast to 27 for Copenhagen,"" said Taryn Fransen from the World Resources Institute, referring to the failed conference in the Danish capital in 2009.""You have quite a few more countries that are now specifying absolute decreases in emissions levels. You have countries like China, South Africa and Singapore talking about peaking emissions through a hard cap.""Even much smaller countries like Ethiopia, Bhutan and Costa Rica are identifying absolute limits on the quantity of emissions. I think that signals a real evolution.""The challenge for the UN is now to take these intentions and turn them into a coherent and legally binding deal when heads of government and negotiators meet in Paris in a month.Analysis: David Shukman - BBC Science EditorAn ""unprecedented engagement"", says Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN's climate change negotiations. And if one thinks back to the irritable, dysfunctional days of the Copenhagen summit in 2009, the last big push for an international response to global warming, there has been a remarkable turnaround.In the aftermath of that failed gathering, it seemed almost inconceivable that within a matter of years new momentum would be returned to what has generally been a faltering process.It's worth bearing in mind that the national pledges to take action are of course entirely voluntary.When the idea of individual submissions was first agreed, it was perfectly possible that many, if not most, of the world's 196 countries would choose to turn a blind eye, or plead some other pressing distraction, or argue that cutting greenhouse gases is a task to be faced by others.Instead, an impressive 86% of global emissions are covered if you add up the total of all the different pledges.Will it ultimately make any difference?The numbers don't add up to what the scientists say is needed to avoid the worst of global warming. Emissions will still keep rising, albeit at a slower pace.And the promises are just that - promises. Who knows how many governments will turn them into law and take them seriously? How many will refuse to act until the right finance is offered?The outcome of all this is uncertain and much depends on the exact deal thrashed out at the approaching summit in Paris.Copenhagen may well haunt the talks. But compared to where this process stood six years ago, there's a world of difference.Even though the plans don't add up to enough of a cut to avoid a 2C rise, campaigners believe that a strong review mechanism can - and must - be put in place by the Paris agreement.""Paris will not be the end of the world's efforts to tackle climate change, but it might be the end of the beginning,"" said Mohammed Adow from Christian Aid.""Going forward we will need a five-year review mechanism that will track how countries are doing and push them to do more as technology advances and more finance becomes available.""Getting all that into a Paris deal won't be easy. In fact the emissions pledges are the most straightforward aspect.In fact, the negotiators now have a draft document that runs to 50 dense pages.In the words of one delegate at a recent negotiating session, even the world's best paid lawyer would be hard pressed to understand it.Follow Matt on Twitter: @mattmcgrathbbc"
science	Buddhists call for strong Paris climate deal to limit warming		"Senior Buddhists have called on world leaders to agree a new climate change agreement at a conference in Paris next month.The 15 signatories, including the Dalai Lama, are urging politicians to completely phase out fossil fuels.They argue that the rise in global temperatures must be limited to 1.5C in the future.Observers say it is the first time that so many leading Buddhists have joined together on a global issue.The statement from the leaders of over a billion Buddhists worldwide says that the causes of this ""environmental crisis"" are the use of fossil fuels, unsustainable consumption patterns, lack of awareness and lack of concern about the consequences of our actions.The leaders urge negotiators to use ""wisdom and compassion"" to find an agreement at the Conference of the Parties in the French capital at the end of November.""We are at a crucial crossroads where our survival and that of other species is at stake as a result of our actions,"" the statement says, arguing that the world must move to 100% renewable and clean energy.The leaders call for a deal in Paris that will limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.This will encourage the many small island states who are pressing for 1.5 degree target with the view that anything beyond that may make their homes uninhabitable as seas rise in response to warming.""Everyday life can easily lead us to forget that we are inextricably linked to the natural world through every breath we take, the water we drink and the food we eat,"" said Lama Lobzang, secretary of the International Buddhist Confederation.""Humanity must act on the root causes of this crisis, which is driven by greed, thoughtlessness and a lack of concern about the consequences of our actions.""The Buddhist intervention comes in the wake of similar statements of concern about climate change from Catholic and Muslim leaders.In their call, the Buddhists leaders say the welcome and support these declarations."
science	Faster pace of climate change is 'scary', former chief scientist says	Will emotive language leave young people depressed?Do scientists agree climate change is scary?Changes 'anticipated for decades'What is the science behind extreme weather events?'We can’t wait for scientific certainty'Should the UK bring climate targets earlier?	"Extreme events linked to climate change, such as the heatwave in Europe this year, are occurring sooner than expected, an ex-chief scientist says.Prof Sir David King says he's been scared by the number of extreme events, and he called for the UK to advance its climate targets by 10 years.But the UN's weather chief said using words like “scared” could make young people depressed and anxious.Campaigners argue that people won't act unless they feel fearful.Speaking to the BBC, Prof King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government, said: “It’s appropriate to be scared. We predicted temperatures would rise, but we didn’t foresee these sorts of extreme events we’re getting so soon.”He said the world had changed faster than generally predicted in the fifth assessment report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2014.He referred especially to the loss of land ice and sea ice, and to the weather extremes in which he said warming probably played a role.Several other scientists contacted by the BBC supported his emotive language.The physicist Prof Jo Haigh from Imperial College London said: “David King is right to be scared – I’m scared too.""“We do the analysis, we think what’s going to happen, then publish in a very scientific way.""Then we have a human response to that… and it is scary.”Petteri Taalas, the secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised UN agency, said he fully supported United Nations climate goals, but he criticised radical green campaigners for forecasting the end of the world.It’s the latest chapter in the long debate over how to communicate climate science to the public.Dr Taalas agrees polar ice is melting faster than expected, but he’s concerned that public fear could lead to paralysis – and also to mental health problems amongst the young.“We are fully behind climate science and fully behind the (upcoming) New York climate summit"", he said.“But I want to stick to the facts, which are quite convincing and dramatic enough. We should avoid interpreting them too much.“When I was young we were afraid of nuclear war. We seriously thought it’s better not to have children.“I’m feeling the same sentiment among young people at the moment. So we have to be a bit careful with our communication style.”He said most of the changes were within the IPCC forecast range - although some - like polar ice - were at the top end of the range.The polar scientist Andrew Shepherd, from Leeds University, agreed with that assessment.He also said scientists should normally avoid emotional terms: ""I would not use the term (scary) in general, but it is certainly surprising to see record (or near record) losses of ice. 2019 has been a bad year for Earth's ice.""It seems though, that some scientists believe their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act.The Telegraph reports that psychologists working with the University of Bath are counselling growing numbers of young people suffering from eco-anxiety.However, some scientists appear to believe that their communications in the past have been failing to provoke an emotional response that would convince the public to act.We tested Prof King's views with the main authors of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014.The consensus among those who replied was that climate models had accurately forecast the rise in global mean temperature.But the models hadn’t been sufficiently sophisticated to foresee events like this year’s extreme European heatwave or the slow-moving Hurricane Dorian – described by Nasa as “extraordinary” and “a nightmare scenario”.Others mentioned severe ice melting at the poles; Tasmania suffering record droughts and floods in consecutive years; record wildfires in the Arctic and an unprecedented two large cyclones in Mozambique in one year.Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, told us he’d been anticipating changes like these for four decades, although he hadn't been certain when they would arrive.“I have a sense of the numbing inevitability of it all,” he said.Few of the scientists we contacted had faith that governments would do what was needed to rescue the climate in time.They’re alarmed that global warming of just over 1C so far has already created a new normal in which historic temperature records will inevitably be broken more often. This is the predictable side of climate change.Prof King argues that some changes were not well forecast.The loss of land ice in Antarctica, for instance, is at the upper range of predictions in the IPCC AR5. And there are record ice losses in GreenlandThen there’s this year’s French heatwave.Dr Friederike Otto from Oxford University is an expert in the attribution of extreme events to climate change.She told us that in a pre-climate change world, a heatwave like this might strike once in 1,000 years.In a post-warming world, the heatwave was a one-in-a-100 year phenomenon.In other words, natural variability is amplifying human-induced climate heating.“With European heatwaves, we have realised that climate change is a total game-changer,” she said. ""It has increased the likelihood (of events) by orders of magnitude.""Researchers had not yet had time to investigate the links between all of the major extreme weather events and climate change, she said.With some phenomena such as droughts and floods there was no clear evidence yet of any involvement from climate change.And it was impossible to be sure that the slow progress of Dorian was caused by climate change.Prof King said the world could not wait for scientific certainty on events like Hurricane Dorian. “Scientists like to be certain,” he said.“But these events are all about probabilities. What is the likelihood that (Dorian) is a climate change event? I’m going to say ‘very high’.“I can’t say that with 100% certainty, but what I can say is that the energy from the hurricane comes from the warm ocean and if that ocean gets warmer we must expect more energy in hurricanes.”He continued: “If you got in a plane with a one in 100 chance of crashing you would be appropriately scared.“But we are experimenting with the climate in a way that throws up probabilities of very severe consequences of much more than that.”Pierre Friedlingstein from Exeter University said he'd been surprised by the onslaught of extreme weather. He said he expected extremes to happen as forecast by the IPCC - but had not expected them so quickly.Prof King said the situation was so grave that the UK should bring forward its date for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to almost zero from 2050 to 2040.Some of the IPCC scientists we contacted didn’t share his urge to engage with the public on an emotional level.Others agreed with him.Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia told us: ""Some things appear to be happening faster than projected. This may be partially related to the interaction of climate change and natural variability as well as the uncertainty in our understanding and projections.“In my own area of sea level change, things are happening near the upper end of the projections.“What is scary is our lack of appropriate response. Our continued lack of action is committing the world to major and essentially irreversible change.”Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Antarctic Peninsula 'can still avoid irreversible change'		"Even if global warming can be kept to a 1.5-degree Celsius rise from pre-industrial times, the Antarctic Peninsula is set for some big changes.This is the assessment of an expert panel of scientists.The group says reaching the threshold will likely result in a 50-150% increase in the number of days a year the frozen peninsula spends above zero.But although this means more melting, the team also stresses the ""benefits"" that come from not breaching 1.5C.Keeping below this figure should allow the peninsula to hang on to its remaining ice shelves, they argue.That's important because these floating platforms of ice that fringe the long spine of mountainous land work to hold back glaciers, preventing them from dumping more ice into the ocean and raising sea-levels.Recent decades have seen a dozen or so shelves either disintegrate or lose significant volume, as the peninsula has warmed more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet.""A 1.5-degree world"" increases the likelihood of thinning and iceberg production, according to the panel. However, it's possible the largest ice shelves can still retain sufficient integrity to avoid further catastrophic failures.""Under 1.5, we don't expect ice shelves to be lost - but under more warming they look far more vulnerable with consequences for sea-level and other impacts,"" explained Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, UK.""The 'benefits' of 1.5 need to be explained - and we're trying to explain that while the peninsula is locked into change. It's still possible to avoid severe problems that would change the peninsula beyond recognition and without historic precedence,"" he told BBC News.Prof Siegert and colleagues from UK and US institutions have written a briefing note that is being presented to an Antarctic Treaty meeting on Tuesday by the British Foreign Office.It sets out the consequences for the peninsula of a further half-degree rise in global temperature (the world has already warmed by about 1C since 1850). 1.5C is the preferred target to limit warming set out in the Paris climate agreement.The scientists stress that any rise will almost certainly be amplified in the polar regions.The extra half a degree globally is likely to translate in the Antarctic Peninsula to an increase of 1-2C in winter and 0.5-1.0C in summer.According to the panel's assessment, this is expected to:Co-author Prof David Vaughan, the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey, commented: ""Local warming in the Antarctic Peninsula over the last few decades has been higher than almost anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere.""If similar high levels of local warming occur in the future, magnifying rates of change on the Antarctic Peninsula, then summer melt will move south and ice shelves that have not yet shown any progressive retreat or collapse could be threatened.""Larsen-C is probably the most vulnerable on the east coast and, if we're unlucky, could be impacted in the next couple of decades,"" he told BBC News.One mechanism that may mitigate the impact on ice shelves is if ponding meltwater can form efficient rivers that drain across and away from the platforms, rather than filtering down through crevasses.It's the downward movement of meltwater that can open up fissures, driving them through to the base of a shelf.This process, known as hydrofracturing, will weaken the structure. But there are examples where the meltwater finds an easier route to the sea via a network of channels cut in the top of a shelf.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Warming boosts UK flooding risk		"A citizen science project suggests climate change really has increased the risk of flooding in the UK.The issue has been highlighted by the recent floods, amid a January that saw double the normal monthly rainfall in parts of England.Prof Myles Allen presented evidence of a link between floods and climate change at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) meeting in Vienna.It indicates climate change is increasing the risk of extreme weather.It also suggests that insurance costs are likely to grow.UK Met Office data showed that the prolonged and heavy rain was an extreme outlier in the context of their records of 20th Century rainfall. But scientists can go back further to judge just how extreme this wet winter was.It turns out that it was the wettest January and wettest winter in the world's longest daily rainfall record, collected in Oxford from 1767 to the present day.At the time, many people suspected a link to climate change, but any such claim has been treated with caution.Plenty of studies assessed in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report suggest that extreme weather events should be expected in a warming world, but even there, the assessment was that the link could only be made modestly, with ""medium"" certainty.In just two months following the flooding, perhaps spurred on by the local impacts on the Thames Valley, the team at the University of Oxford has carried out an ""attribution experiment"" to attempt to test what, if any, links can be made between the world's changing climate and local events like the UK winter floods.517.6mmfor the UK, wettest since 1910435mmfor England and Wales,

They reveal that the probability of extremely wet English winters has increased with global warming.Climate change means that the chance of extreme weather like the January 2014 floods has increased by a small, but measurable, amount.The group's results imply that any weather fluctuation that would previously have been thought of as a ""one in 100-year event"" has now risen in probability to one in 80 years, due to climate change.Speaking about the results at the EGU General Assembly, a gathering of 12,000 researchers here in Vienna, Prof Allen, from the University of Oxford, pointed out that this was the first quantitative study of the role of climate change on the 2014 floods.Commenting on the results, Prof Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern, Switzerland (and Co-Chair of Working Group 1 of the IPCC), said: ""The risk [of extreme weather] has increased. It has shown movement in one direction only - to greater risk.""Quoted in a press release, Dr Otto stated: ""Past greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution have 'loaded the weather dice', so the probability of the south of England experiencing extremely wet winters again has slightly increased.""We are working with collaborators, such as at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, to explore the implications of our results for river flows, flooding, and ultimately property damage.""Insurance companies are very interested to understand how weather is changing compared with historic records, which is exactly the type of information that Prof Allen's team has obtained.Dr Schaller notes that the results must be understood in context, and are specific to the UK in winter. ""It all depends on the region and season considered. Climate change might increase, decrease or have no effect at all on flood events,"" she told the BBC.""Hirabayashi and co-workers, for example, showed that floods are expected to decrease with climate change in Central Europe. So our results are only valid for the southern UK and for winter months.""Follow me on Twitter: @sim0nredfern"
science	Climate change: Emperor penguin 'needs greater protection'		"Antarctica's Emperor penguins could be in real difficulty come 2100 if the climate warms as expected.Experts say the birds raise their young on sea-ice and if this platform is greatly curtailed, as the models project, then it's likely to put the animals' numbers into steep decline.One forecast is for the population to be halved by the end of the century.Researchers are calling for the conservation status of Emperors to be upgraded.At the moment, they are classified as ""Near Threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the organisation that keeps the lists of Earth's endangered animals.A proposal will be submitted shortly to lift Emperors into the more urgent ""Vulnerable"" category.""These are very resilient birds; they experience really tough winters and keep coming back year after year to their breeding sites to raise their chicks,"" explained Dr Michelle LaRue, who's co-authored a new report on the penguins' situation in the journal Biological Conservation.""Emperors are fighters, but our concern is how long their resilience will continue into the future,"" the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, researcher told BBC News.The penguins' breeding success is critically dependent upon so-called ""fast ice"". This is the sea-ice that sticks to the edge of the continent or to icebergs.It's low and flat, and an ideal surface on which to lay an egg, incubate it and then raise the subsequent chick in its first year of life.But this seasonal ice needs to be long-lived, to stay intact for at least eight or nine months.If it forms too late or breaks up too early, the young birds will be forced into the sea before they're ready, before they've lost their down and grown water-proof feathers.Likewise the adults. They undergo a dramatic moult in the summer months of January and February. They too risk drowning if the fast ice melts away and they don't have the right plumage to resume swimming.Antarctic sea-ice trends in recent decades have been pretty stable, albeit with some big regional shifts. But the climate models foresee significant losses this century even if global warming can be kept within the Paris Agreement ""guardrail"" of no more than 2C above pre-industrial times.Such a temperature rise (and it would be amplified at the poles) would put more northerly Emperor breeding sites out of action, pushing the birds poleward.The assessment is that Emperor numbers - currently at 250,000 breeding pairs - could be cut by 50% or more under such a scenario.Dr Phil Trathan, who is the lead author on the new paper, says only sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are likely to alter this future. But he calls for efforts to limit the pressure on the birds in other ways in the meantime.""There are a number of different tools that we can use. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) would enable us to regulate fishing and other human activities in the areas that Emperors use, whether close to their breeding sites or to their foraging sites,"" the head of conservation biology at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) said.""We could also designate the Emperor penguin as an Antarctic Specially Protected Species. That would allow us to bring in an action plan to help manage impacts that might threaten them even outside MPAs.""UK and American scientists are currently engaged in a 10-year analysis of Emperor numbers. The project, funded by green campaign group WWF, will provide the updated population baseline that the IUCN can then use in its review of the penguins' status next year.Dr Peter Fretwell is a remote sensing specialist at BAS and has helped pioneer the satellite techniques for counting penguins from space.He told BBC News: ""Everything we know - all the experts, all the models - tells us that Emperors are going to be in real trouble. We need to pull out all the stops to help them. That's going to be hard because we know the one thing that's really going to save them is stabilisation of the global climate.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Study: Global warming 'doubles risk' of extreme weather	Cold phase	"Extreme weather arising from a climate phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean will get much worse as the world warms, according to climate modelling.Parts of the world will have weather patterns that switch between extremes of wet and dry, say scientists.The US will see more droughts while flooding will become more common in the western Pacific, research suggests.The study, in Nature Climate Change, adds to a growing body of evidence over climate change and extreme weather.The latest data - based on detailed climate modelling work - suggests extreme La Nina events in the Pacific Ocean will almost double with global warming, from one in 23 years to one in 13 years.Most will follow extreme El Nino events, meaning frequent swings between opposite extremes from one year to the next.Lead researcher Dr Wenju Cai from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia, said this would mean an increase in the occurrence of ""devastating weather events with profound socio-economic consequences"".""El Nino and La Nina can be a major driver of extreme weather,"" he said. ""We are going to see these extreme weather [events] become more frequent.""El Nino and La Nina are complex weather patterns arising from variations in ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. They can have large-scale impacts on global weather and climate.La Niña is sometimes referred to as the cold phase and El Niño as the warm phase of this natural climate phenomenon.Prof Mat Collins, Joint Met Office Chair in Climate Change at Exeter University, UK, is a co-researcher on the study, which involved teams in Australia, China, the US, UK and Peru.He said scientists were getting a better idea of how El Nino and La Nina are affected by global warming.""Our previous research showed a doubling in frequency of extreme El Nino events, and this new study shows a similar fate for the cold phase of the cycle,"" he said.""It shows again how we are just beginning to understand the consequences of global warming.""It is not possible to attribute individual weather events to climate change.However, a review of research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that the world has witnessed more hot days and heat waves since the 1950s and will see more changes to weather extremes by the end of the 21st century."
science	Warming 'increasingly disruptive' across US - report	Impacts from sea to shining sea	"Climate change is having significant financial, ecological and human health impacts across the US, according to a new report.The third National Climate Assessment, released by the White House, says the number and strength of extreme weather events have increased over the past 50 years.Infrastructure is being damaged by sea level rise, downpours and extreme heat.The report says these impacts are likely to worsen in the coming decades.Coming hot on the heels of the trio of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the assessment re-iterates the finding that climate change is real, and ""driven primarily by human activity"".A key element driving this conclusion is the observed evidence on extreme weather events such as heavy downpours of rain.Between 1958 and 2012, the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events increased by 71% in New England and the north east, while in the drier West it went up by just 5%.""There is no equivocation,"" said lead author Prof Gary Yohe from Wesleyan University.""It is fundamentally the pace of observations of extreme weather that makes it clear it is not natural variability.""The report suggests that it is not just wet events that are becoming more common. The human influence on climate has ""roughly doubled the probability of extreme heat events"", it says.The authors point to the record-breaking summer temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011, where even during the night the mercury continued to soar.""There have been episodes of temperatures in urban areas that are amplified by the heat island effect, where it just never recovers over the night and that dramatically affects humans,"" said Prof Yohe.""It's impossible for the night to cool the earth.""The report also highlights the well-documented threats from wildfires in the West and how warming could, ultimately, cut agricultural productivity.As well as food security, the report warns that millions of people and properties are at risk from rising seas. Five million people live in areas that are 1.2 metres above the local high-tide level.The increasing acidification of the oceans, blamed on global warming, is having financial impacts right now, said another lead author, Dr Drew Harvell from Cornell University.She said that shellfish hatcheries were being particularly affected in the Pacific north west.""They are being very heavily hit,"" she said.""Everything they do now requires them to monitor pH, to have sensors in their hatcheries. Some of the hatcheries have moved out of the north west because of the corrosiveness of the waters, this is a very now impact with economic consequences.""The assessment warns that current efforts to implement emissions cuts and to adapt to changes are ""insufficient to avoid increasingly negative social, environmental, and economic consequences"".The report's authors believe that it provides crucial ammunition for President Obama as he looks to regulate US emissions.Last year, the President unveiled his Climate Action Plan that sets new rules on carbon emissions from power plants. However, the scientists are pessimistic that the assessment will have much of an impact in Congress.""One of the few places in the US where it looks like climate change is a 50-50 proposition is in the Congressional record,"" said Prof Yohe.""That is problematic.""Other scientists involved in the report believed that the deadlock in Washington didn't reflect the breadth of US attitudes towards climate change.Businesses, traders and people from all walks of life were seeing the impacts and wanted more information.""It is frustrating - but I am reasonably optimistic,"" said Dr David Wolfe, another lead author.""When I move out of the Beltway, I am seeing different things, even among the farmer audience. They are all about making a profit, so they are interested in protecting what they've got.""Campaigners have endorsed the report and are calling for swift action.""Our leading scientists send a stark message: Climate change is already seriously disrupting our lives, hurting our health and damaging our economy,"" said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.""If we don't slam the brakes on the carbon pollution driving climate change, we're dooming ourselves and our children to more intense heat waves, destructive floods and storms, and surging sea levels.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate policies 'will transform UK landscape'	Sheep exportsDifferent approachesWhat's the farmers' viewpoint?So who is right?Is British farming economic anyway?So what's the future for livestock farming in the UK?What's the vision for the future?	"Britain's countryside will be transformed by policies to combat climate change, the government's former chief environment scientist says.Professor Sir Ian Boyd said climate policies after Brexit will alter the landscape more than most people expect.There will be many more trees and hedges but far fewer grazing animals as people eat less red meat, he said.The farmers' union, the NFU, rejected his analysis and forecast that there may be more grazing animals, not fewer.It said the UK's well-watered pastures are ideal for producing low-carbon livestock and exporting it to places where growing conditions are less favourable.This is the first public eruption of a long-running conflict between Professor Boyd, the former adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the body that represents Britain's farmers.Sir Ian thinks the NFU has wielded far too much influence over departmental policy. The NFU believes he is out of touch with the reality of farming.The antipathy reflects deeper technical, ethical and political debates over the future of the production and consumption of animals for food.Sir Ian says the UK needs to reduce the amount of red meat it produces and eats if it is to meet the Net Zero emissions target by 2050.He told BBC News: ""What I see is a farming system that's very inefficient and in need of very significant transformation.""I see a significant part of that coming from the way we farm and consume livestock.""If we want to move towards Net Zero in the UK, changing our approach to red meat consumption is an essential part of that.""He points out that under international agreements, greenhouse gas emissions are measured in the country where they are created.That means China gets blamed for the CO2 it generates whilst making goods exported to the UK.By the same token, the UK's responsible for emissions from its belching sheep - whether they're eaten in Britain or Brazil.Sir Ian says this system of carbon accounting is most unlikely to change.Sir Ian says it's actually more carbon-efficient to raise sheep and cattle on intensive high-tech farms than on traditional extensive pastures.That's because although intensive farming with animals fed on grains and soya creates more CO2 emissions, it creates fewer methane emissions.Research proves, he says, that because intensively-raised animals grow and mature quicker, they are slaughtered younger - so they belch less methane in their shorter lives.As methane is a far more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 in the medium term, that means intensively-farmed livestock are less bad for the climate.Sir Ian said: ""All the evidence tells us that intensive farming done well is much more environmentally friendly than extensive farming.""Intensive farming is able to apply much more modern technology. And changes (to farming) will lead to significant reduction in the amount of land farmed directly for food.""The NFU takes exactly the opposite stance.Its president Minette Batters says the carbon accounting system that measures CO2 and methane is too narrowly focused.She maintains that intensive farming doesn't take full responsibility for its other environmental impacts.These include huge water consumption in drought-prone areas like California, or Brazilian rainforests being felled to grow soya to feed cows.Ms Batters says the world should be queuing up to buy red meat produced on the soggy fields of Britain, Ireland and New Zealand.She told BBC News: ""If anything, I think the number of sheep and cows will go up in the UK - to make us less reliant on chemical fertiliser (which produces greenhouse gases).""She also forecast that British sheep and cows would be bred and reared to reach slaughter much more quickly in order to reduce methane burps.""The argument about methane is badly flawed. We can 'finish' an animal just as quickly (as intensive farming)… under 15 months using right genetics and using the right breed.""And as the representative of a cross-section of the UK's farmers - including those who raise livestock - she can't accept it's inevitable that people in Britain will eat less meat, either.Her union is now producing its own ambitious plan for Net Zero emissions agriculture by 2040, and that will put pasture-raised meat centre stage.It will make the point that grasslands can't be used for any economically useful purpose other than grazing.Well, a succession of expert reports warn that rich nations are consuming too much red meat for the health of people and the planet - that's whether farmers like the message or not.But Sir Ian's analysis of the environmental impact of livestock is questioned by Professor Pete Smith from Aberdeen University, a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.He told BBC News the livestock industry should be judged in the round - not just on its climate change emissions.He said: ""If you just look at the issue through climate blinkers you'd do the opposite of what many might want to see.""By halving the time it takes to get an animal to slaughter weight (through intensive farming) you can halve its belching and halve its methane emissions.""But that system is arguably much worse for animal welfare, landscape, water usage, and food imports.""He concludes: ""It's better for many reasons to produce cattle in a pasture grazing system in the UK than in an area needing water and causing land degradation (like Brazil or the USA).""Prof Smith bears unwelcome news for UK farmers, though.He warns: ""Current ruminant (sheep and cattle) land in the UK is not economic. Many farmers can't survive without subsidies.""What's more, the emissions from those animals occur within our national boundaries. So we won't hit UK emissions targets without reducing the size of the livestock herd.""The current EU system pays farmers grants according to the amount of land they own.The government plans to shift farm subsidies towards what it calls ""public money for public goods"".That includes things that benefit the public but don't get accounted for by the market.So public goods includes improving the landscape, helping drainage, and storing carbon in the soil, in trees and also in pasture land, but not producing food because that's paid by the market.Ms Batters says dung from grazing animals can often increase the amount of carbon captured in soils depleted by over-intensive farming.One system, known a mob grazing, involves sheep or cattle being shifted around from field to field munching grass for a short period of time.Pioneer farmers who've adopted the practice say it's improving the carbon content of their soils.But experts warn that pastures can become saturated with carbon so they're not able to take any more.Prof Smith said: ""There are some good schemes for grazing - but there are others which seem to be based on wishful thinking.""Under Ms Batters' vision, when the NFU achieves its Net Zero target by 2040 it will supply the UK market and also export low-carbon meat to countries where livestock farming conditions are less favourable.By then, she believes, the true value of animals in the extensive farm system will be recognised.Prof Smith from the IPCC and Sir Ian have a very different vision.They suggest UK climate policies could lead to the re-wilding of most unproductive hill land, leaving a scattering of animals to adorn the landscape for tourists. One could ask the question: how many sheep is enough?Meanwhile cattle and sheep production would be largely restricted to more profitable lowland farms where the soil isn't rich enough to grow wheat, but is good for grass.And here's a thought to end on.At the press conference of the latest inter-governmental climate report I asked if scientists could be sure whether intensive or extensive systems were better for the environment. The answer: We don't know.I then asked if it would be better to graze the hills or leave trees to take over. The answer: We don't know.According to Dr Michelle Cain, an Oxford academic who specialises in greenhouse gas calculations, the real answer isn't really ""we don't know"", but ""it depends"".So if the government fears the climate may reach a tipping point shortly, that points to cutting methane - a short-lived greenhouse gas - as soon as possible.Which means restricting extensive British-type farming.If the fears focus on planetary heating in the longer term, then it may make more sense to target CO2. That would mean restricting intensive farming.This suggests that any incoming government will base its countryside and farming policy partly on science but partly on politics and culture.Follow Roger on Twitter."
science	Global warming slowdown 'could last another decade'	Ice age fearsRising staircase of warming	"The hiatus in the rise in global temperatures could last for another 10 years, according to new research.Scientists have struggled to explain the so-called pause that began in 1999, despite ever increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.The latest theory says that a naturally occurring 30-year cycle in the Atlantic Ocean is behind the slowdown.The researchers says this slow-moving current could continue to divert heat into the deep seas for another decade.However, they caution that global temperatures are likely to increase rapidly when the cycle flips to a warmer phase.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global average temperatures have increased by around 0.05C per decade in the period between 1998 and 2012.This compares with a decadal average of 0.12 between 1951 and 2012.More than a dozen theories have been put forward on the cause of this pause in temperature growth that occurred while emissions of carbon dioxide were at record highs.These ideas include the impact of pollution such as soot particles that have reflected back some of the Sun's heat into space.Increased volcanic activity since 2000 has also been blamed, as have variations in solar activity.The most recent perspectives have looked to the oceans as the locations of the missing heat.Last year a study suggested that a periodic upwelling of cooler waters in the Pacific was limiting the rise.However this latest work, published in the journal Science, shifts the focus from the Pacific to the Atlantic and Southern oceans.The team, lead by Prof Ka-Kit Tung from the University of Washington, US, says there is now evidence that a 30-year current alternately warms and cools the world by sinking large amounts of heat beneath these deep waters.They've used observations from a network of devices called Argo floats that sample the oceans down to 2,000 metres.The researchers say that there was another hiatus between 1945 and 1975 due to this current taking down the heat, that led to fears of a new ice age.From 1976 though, the cycle flipped and contributed to the warming of the world, as more heat stayed on the surface.But since the year 2000, the heat has been going deeper, and the world's overall temperatures haven't risen beyond the record set in 1998.""The floats have been very revealing to us,"" said Prof Tung.""I think the consensus at this point is that below 700 metres in the Atlantic and Southern oceans [they are] storing heat and not the Pacific.""A key element in this new understanding is the saltiness of the water. The waters in the Atlantic current coming up from the tropics are saltier because of evaporation. This sinks more quickly and takes the heat down with it.Eventually though, the salty water melts enough ice in Arctic waters to lower the saline level, slowing down the current and keeping the heat near the surface.""Before 2006 the saltiness was increasing, this indicated that the current was speeding up,"" said Prof Tung.""After 2006, this saltiness is diminishing but it's still above the long-term average. Now it is slowly slowing down.""Once it gets below the long-term average, then it is the next period of rapid warming.""As well as the data from the Argo floats, Prof Tung has also examined the Central England Temperature record, that dates back over 350 years. He believes that this confirms the regular 70-year cycles of warm and cold spells.This historic pattern, he says, could extend the current period of pause.""We probably may have another 10 years, maybe shorter as global warming itself is melting more ice and ice could flood the North Atlantic, but historically we are in the middle of the cycle.""Several other researchers in this field acknowledge the Tung analysis is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests the Atlantic has a role in the pause.Prof Reto Knutti from the ETH Zurich has recently published a review of all the current theories on the hiatus.""I see the studies as complementary, and they both highlight that natural variability in ocean and atmosphere is important in modifying long term anthropogenic trends,"" he said.""A better understanding of those modes of variability is critical to understand past changes (including differences between models and observations during the hiatus period) as well as predicting the future, in particular in the near term and regionally, where variability dominates the forced changes from greenhouses gases.""Other scientists say that the Atlantic hypothesis is interesting but a much longer range of observations is needed.""We really don't have a lot of data,"" said Dr Jonathan Robson from the University of Reading, UK.""So if there is this 60-year oscillation in the ocean, we haven't observed it all, basically we've observed the impact of it. We may have to wait 15-20 years to know what's going on.""Prof Tung believes that whatever the cause and the length of the pause, we are on a ""rising staircase"" when it comes to global temperatures that will become apparent when the Atlantic current switches again.""At the end we will be on the rising part of the staircase, and the rate of warming there will be very fast, just as fast as the last three decades of the 20th Century, plus we are starting off at a higher plateau. The temperatures and the effects will be more severe.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	'Ozone hole vigilance still required'		"The recovery of the ozone layer over Antarctica cannot be taken for granted and requires constant vigilance.That's the message from Dr Jonathan Shanklin, one of the scientists who first documented the annual thinning of the protective gas in the 1980s.This year's ""hole"" in the stratosphere high above the White Continent is the smallest in three decades.It's welcome, says Dr Shanklin, but we should really only view it as an anomaly.The better than expected levels of ozone have been attributed to a sudden warming at high altitudes, which can occasionally happen.This has worked to stymie the chemical reactions that usually destroy ozone 15-30km above the planet.""To see whether international treaties are working or not, you need to look at the long term,"" Dr Shanklin told BBC News.""A quick glance this year might lead you to think we've fixed the ozone hole. We haven't. And although things are improving, there are still some countries out there who are manufacturing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals that have been responsible for the problem. We cannot be complacent.""Dr Shanklin, along with Joe Farman and Brian Gardiner, first alerted the world in 1985 that a deep thinning was occurring in the ozone layer above Antarctica each spring.Ozone filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.The team's discovery, confirming the theoretical predictions of others, led to the Montreal Protocol.This international treaty phased out most of the chlorine- and bromine-containing chemicals involved in ozone depletion.At the time, these substances were being used widely as refrigerants, cleaning agents, and as the propellants in aerosol cans.Dr Shanklin and his colleagues at the British Antarctic Survey made their seminal observations at the Halley research station on the Brunt Ice Shelf.They used a Dobson photospectrometer - an instrument that is traditionally operated manually.This became a major issue three years ago when BAS was forced to pull all winter staff out of Halley because of the uncertainty over the stability of nearby ice. It meant ozone measurements couldn't take place in those critical weeks when the hole begins to open.With summer-only staffing set to continue for the foreseeable future, the situation has forced BAS to introduce an automated solution.The survey is now running a mini-jet engine non-stop at Halley, which is providing the electricity for a host of computer-controlled experiments, including the Dobson photospectrometer.It's delivering ozone measurements direct to Dr Shanklin's computer back in the UK via satellite.""It's very clear that the ozone data coming back from Halley is different to previous years; we haven't seen that rapid decline. As time progresses, probably later in October, we'll see the final demise of this year's ozone hole as warm air sweeps across the continent.""Dr Thomas Barningham, who's implemented the novel Halley set-up, added: ""Resuming springtime stratospheric ozone observations with the automated Dobson, for the first time since the winter closure of the station, is what the project is all about - maintaining long-term monitoring datasets that are of global significance.""We're very pleased to have reached this milestone. The next will be in 40 days' time, when the first personnel arrive back on station to begin our summer season.""Dr Shanklin is now an emeritus fellow at BAS. He goes into its Cambridge HQ twice a week to advise and help interpret the Dobson data. And, of course, he's still very plugged in to the politics of ozone and other atmospheric issues.One topic that's caught his eye recently is sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6.This substance is used in the electrical industry to prevent short circuits and accidents. It's an extremely potent greenhouse gas, and although emissions to the atmosphere are relatively small at the moment, they are increasing.Dr Shanklin worries that SF6 is being treated in the same way that CFCs were treated when they were first introduced in the 1930s. There was an assumption they would do no harm.He told BBC News: ""I think we're treating SF6 in the same way. We think it possibly won't have a problem, although we know it's a greenhouse gas. And therefore we're using it perhaps not as wisely as we might do. And that's why we need the various monitoring sensors around the globe so we can... say to the scientific community that something's increasing, so they can do the modelling and find out what the likely consequences are.""Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Could the smell of the sea help cool a warming planet?	GobsmackedBrightening the clouds	"Ah, the summertime sizzle of a shell-strewn beach, the bracing odour of the briny sea. There's nothing quite like it really.If you happen to be on a beautiful beach, do take a good, deep, invigorating sniff!What does it remind you of?Amid the saltiness, a hint of sulphur perhaps?A slight edge of boiled cabbage? Or something even more unpleasant?Well, maybe that's just me...Seaside odours are generally composed of dimethyl sulfide, a pongy gas produced by bacteria feasting on phytoplankton.In the atmosphere, it is changed chemically to sulphate, which in turn becomes the seeds of clouds.Solid organic matter from large collections of phytoplankton blooms can also help with cloud formation.This blooming ocean can give rise to a specky scum, from which tiny bubbles get lofted into the air by the churn of the sea.Water vapour condenses around them, tiny droplets form and the fluffy billows of the sky emerge.So what does this ocean-coloured scene have to do with a warming planet?Well, researchers say that the type of clouds produced from sea gas and plankton particles, especially in the Southern Ocean, are not your common or garden cumulus.Clouds reflect sunlight back into space depending on the size of the droplets and the amount of liquid suspended in them.The more liquid that is suspended in the cloud, the brighter and more reflective they are - swotty philosophers of the skies!The experts have long understood that in winter, when seas are stormy and the spray is flying, there will be more of these types of droplets and thus more sun bounced back into space.In the balmy, calm of summer at sea they expected the clouds to be far less reflective.They were astonished to discover that, in the Southern Ocean, this was not the case at all.In fact they concluded that the plankton particle effect was strongest in the warmer months - on average they found that ocean life doubled the number of droplets in summer.""The amount of sunlight that's reflected by those clouds in this region is about 125 watts per metre squared,"" said co-author Dr Susannah Burrows, from the US Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.""What we're finding is evidence for a change in that reflectivity of 10 watts per metre squared, that would be attributed to the phytoplankton - so about 8% of the reflection of sunlight on those clouds.""""It is quite a bit!"" she said.So can this new understanding of the role of sea smells and clouds make a difference to global warming?Well, yes, say the researchers but not necessarily in the ways you might think.The scientists are excited about the findings because for the first time it gives them a clue about the total number of aerosols that are up in the air over the Southern Ocean.But could this new understanding give a boost to ideas about geo-engineering our way out of warming hell?In recent years a number of researchers have suggested that brightening the clouds could be a low-impact way of cooling the planet.Does this Southern Ocean research make this a more feasible prospect?""In principle it is possible to strongly modify and brighten marine clouds by injecting particles into the marine atmosphere,"" says Dr Burrows.""But I think whether or not that's a good idea is really a political question that needs to be discussed within society.""Something to mull over while lying on the beach with the sea air in your nostrils.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Strictly come warming: Swing time at the UN	Gaining weightOld divisions	"Where would you rather be on a Saturday night?Watching those familiar faces, admiring the nimble footwork, laughing at the catty comments?Yes, it's Strictly Come Warming with the IPCC.Almost literally.Once the gavel came down and agreement had been reached on the synthesis report in Copenhagen last Saturday, the grey faced climate scientists and government officials were treated to a rousing, amateur dance display.The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers act, from volunteers working with the organisation, went down well with the assembled negotiators.But the long nights revising the text had taken their toll - the wages of synth were widespread swivel-eyed tiredness.One eminent researcher even slept through the spin doctor's media briefing and as a result had many more interesting things to say to journalists.In the end, the published report was quite a chunky document - growing by a whopping 25% in just seven days of discussions.""More words, less meaning,"" said one of those involved.While the main elements of cause, impact and solution remain unchanged from the underlying reports published over the last year, some of the inclusions and exclusions reflect the rise of the political process.Countries are jockeying for position ahead of negotiations on a new global climate treaty in Paris next year.Some are better in the saddle than others.A strange, old school alliance between Saudi Arabia and Bolivia delivered significant changes in some parts of the document.In a chapter about the characteristics and risks of mitigation pathways, the draft document spoke only of the chances of temperature rises of 2C, and made a cursory mention of temperatures of 1.5 degrees.But under pressure from the curious Latin American-Saudi coalition, the finished document speaks of 1.5, 2 and even 3 degrees in some detail.Even more bizarre is a completely new paragraph that begins:""Mitigation policies could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters...""Then there's the ubiquitous references to carbon, capture and storage (CCS) as being a critical technology if the world wants to keep using fossil fuels.The current pace of development of CCS in the world has been glacial.This year saw the first deployment of commercial scale carbon capture in Saskatchewan.""We now have the first power plant in Canada which captures emissions,"" said Kaisa Kosonen of Greenpeace, speaking in Copenhagen.""It dumps it into depleted oil fields in order to get more oil out of the ground - clearly it is not really the kind of thing we need to see.""Insiders told me that the Saudi delegation were extremely well prepared for the IPCC meeting.They had done their homework on the opposition and allies alike.They were able to convince many smaller countries, without big delegations, that Saudi Arabia would fight for their interests.This led to the slightly bizarre scenario where a country that by some definitions is as wealthy as the US, Germany and the UK, was speaking on behalf of developing nations!Many of those present ultimately went along with the changes as they believed they didn't water down the overall message and weren't in conflict with the underlying science.But the Saudis and their allies were playing Danish long ball.The synthesis report may be the runt of the IPCC litter in terms of size, but it is expected to be a political heavyweight.The document will be the go-to summary for the UN political negotiators as they move towards Paris.By having the references to losses expected for fossil fuel producers enshrined in the text, by putting huge emphasis on CCS, the Saudis and others will be able to say at crucial moments that the science backs their position.And, in a very real sense, it is true.What was going on behind the scenes in Copenhagen is a reflection of the key difficulty facing those who want to secure a new global climate treaty - what is the ultimate priority for nations?, cutting emissions of carbon or lifting people out of poverty by whatever means necessary?""I think that is exactly what it is,"" said Prof Arthur Petersen from UCL and member of the Dutch government's team in Copenhagen.""It is being played out in the UN convention itself, and also in negotiating what's the relevant scientific information, because the framing counts.""Others believed that the rising influence of developing nations is good for the scientific process, putting some real world experience of climate change in among the models and chart.Some scientists feel quite strongly that the flexing of developing country muscles is a good thing for the IPCC and ultimately good for the world.""Politics is everywhere around us and it would be crazy to think we live in a world where science and politics are divorced,"" said Dr Yacob Mulugetta from Ethiopia, who was one of the IPCC core writing team in Copenhagen.""What I find quite energising is the fact that sustainable development, the right to develop and equity and justice issue are weaved into this report and with careful reading, those elements will come through.""The circle it seems can be squared.We'll find out in Lima next month when the UN negotiators start the serious work on a deal.As Fred, Ginger and the IPCC might say:""Let's face the music and dance.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."

science	Why has global warming stalled?	No smoking gunPauses expectedBad maths	"With Britain's heatwave reaching a peak, there could be no better moment to talk about why global warming has slowed to a standstill.It reminds me of reporting on a drought a few years ago: while filming interviews with people about the impact, the heavens opened and rainwater was soon flowing down my neck.So as journalists were invited to the Science Media Centre in London to hear how the worldwide rise in temperatures has stalled, the mercury shot up as if on cue to record the hottest day of the year so far.In many ways, this event was long overdue: climate sceptics have for years pointed out that the world is not warming as rapidly as once forecast.A lot depends on how you do the measurements, of course.Each of the last few decades has been warmer than the last. But start your graph in 1998 - which happened to be an exceptionally warm year - and there hasn't been much global warming at all.Gradually the words 'pause' and 'hiatus' which first featured in the blogs have crossed to the media and then to the scientists professionally engaged in researching the global climate.The headline - which the scientists will not thank me for - is that no one is really sure why the rate of warming has stumbled.There are plenty of possible explanations but none of them adds up to a definitive smoking gun.Professor Piers Forster of Leeds University has tried to quantify the different factors involved - what's known as their ""radiative forcing"".Between 1998-2012, he reckons, manmade greenhouse gases were still the biggest influence, causing warming of 0.48 of a Watt per square metre (a key measure of energy flows to and from the planet).At the same, he estimates, two other natural influences might have led to some cooling: a relatively quiet Sun might have been responsible for a reduction of 0.16 of a Watt/sq m and volcanic eruptions another 0.06 Watt/sq m.A big unknown is the effect of aerosols - tiny particles released by industrial pollution which could cause a further cooling effect.It is thought that the world's massive industrialisation after World War Two contributed to a slight drop in global temperatures in the late 1940s.But the key factor - according to all the speakers at the briefing - is that whatever solar energy is making it through to the surface, much is being absorbed by the hidden depths of the oceans.The Argo network of automated monitors has been deployed since 2005 to measure the waters as deep as 1,800m. This isn't a very long period but the data are apparently showing some warming - even in this short time frame.And readings from satellites since 2000 show how much energy is arriving at the planet, and how much is leaving, so if the energy left behind is not manifesting itself in rising surface temperatures, then it must be going somewhere - and the deep ocean is the most plausible explanation.On top of that, the scientists say, pauses in warming were always to be expected. This is new - at least to me.It is common sense that climate change would not happen in a neat, linear away but instead in fits and starts.But I've never heard leading researchers mention the possibility before.Professor Rowan Sutton, of Reading University, said computer simulations or models of possible future climate scenarios often show periods of ten years with no warming trend - some even show pauses of 20-25 years.And Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said observations and models showed that on average there were - or would be - two pauses in warming every century.I asked why this had not come up in earlier presentations. No one really had an answer, except to say that this ""message"" about pauses had not been communicated widely.So where does this leave us, as greenhouse gases emissions keep rising but the temperature does not?Dr Peter Stott, of the Met Office, pointed out that 12 of the 14 warmest years have occurred since the year 2000 and says that other indicators - like the decline in Arctic sea ice of 12.9% per decade and losses of snow cover and glaciers - still point to a process of manmade warming.But what about another possibility - that the calculations are wrong?What if the climate models - which are the very basis for all discussions of what to do about global warming - exaggerate the sensitivity of the climate to rising carbon dioxide?Dr Stott conceded that the projections showing the most rapid warming now look less likely, given recent observations, but that others remain largely unchanged.A Met Office briefing document, released at the briefing, says that, even allowing for the temperatures of the last decade, the most likely warming scenario is only reduced by 10% - so ""the warming that we might have expected by 2050 would be delayed by only a few years"".Overall, it concludes, the pause ""does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century.""In other words, global warming is still on.But until the pause can be properly explained, many people will take a lot of convincing - especially if the pause lasts longer than expected."
science	Warning over vulnerability of soil carbon to warming	Model muddle	"The huge stores of carbon locked in the world's soils are more vulnerable to rising temperatures than previously thought.Researchers found that microbes in the soil were more likely to enhance the release of CO2 in a warming world.Soils from colder regions and those with greater amounts of carbon were seen to emit more as temperatures went up.The research has been published in the journal Nature.The world's soils hold about twice the amount of carbon as the atmosphere.Every year the activities of microbes in the soil on organic matter release around 60bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air.Some studies have shown that these microbes can swing both ways when it comes to warming, with some able to reduce or even eliminate the potential carbon losses.This new work set out to test 22 different soil samples from the Arctic to the Amazon.In their experiments the researchers cooked and cooled the material to ascertain how it responded to increased temperatures, over the mid to long term, in this case defined as 90 days.""There were some suggestions that microbes could get accustomed to higher temperatures with climate warming and then the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration would decline,"" lead author Dr Kristiina Karhu from the University of Helsinki told BBC News.""We show that for these 22 soils, this type of acclimation of microbial respiration doesn't really happen. Sometimes the opposite happens, in response to long term temperature change, the microbes enhance the short term effect of temperatures so that the sensitivity of respiration gets actually higher.""The research team found that soils from boreal regions and the Arctic were impacted the most, while arable or managed lands were the only ones where microbes reduced the effects of a temperature change on the amount of carbon dioxide released.The scientists aren't sure about the mechanism of action involved in this process.""The soils that had this enhancing response were also soils that had a high carbon to nitrogen ratio,"" said Dr Karhu.""So it could be something in this interaction between carbon and nitrogen cycles, and there are some studies that suggest that maybe the enzymes related to nitrogen may be more temperature sensitive than the carbon related enzymes.""Whatever about the mechanism, the research implies that current soil carbon and Earth system models may be underestimating the impact of warming on the huge reserves that sit in the ground.After 90 days according to the study, ""microbial community response increased the temperature sensitivity of respiration in high latitude soils by a factor of 1.4 compared to the instantaneous temperature response"".According to Dr Karhu, this level of increase in colder regions raises concerns as more than half of the carbon that's stored in soils in the world is found in these locations.""It means that more carbon can be released from the northern soils than is projected by the models at the moment. This is worrying because these soils have a lot of carbon.""There are many more questions about the impact of microbes that remain unanswered, especially the exact cause of the enhanced release of carbon.There is also interest in discovering which microbes are involved, and why arable or managed lands managed to reverse the effect.More research needed say the experts.""Big advances have been made in recent years, and there are now models that simulate key microbial processes,"" said Dr Iain Hartley, from the University of Exeter, another author on the paper.""We have a great opportunity to really advance this subject, and improve predictions of rates of carbon dioxide release from soils under global warming, but there is still a huge amount that we need to understand better.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Taking the war out of global warming	Sensitive questions	"I once had a dream (or was it a dram?) in which the things we thought we knew for certain about the world were suddenly turned upside down.In this strange universe, the cold war seemed to suddenly return, Ireland began to perform consistently at rugby, and arch-climate sceptics began to believe in dangerous levels of global warming.Imagine my surprise then, on reading this new report from the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF).Here was one of the world's foremost bastions of contrariness when it comes to man-made climate change, admitting that temperatures were actually rising in response to human emissions of greenhouse gases.And according to the study, the 2C threshold of dangerous warming would be crossed later on this century.""On the highest emission scenario, our projection is 2.9C over pre-industrial,"" said Nic Lewis, one of the authors, pointing out that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects a considerably higher figure.Huh? What about all that stuff we've heard in the past from those who refused to accept the science? That the whole thing was a warmist conspiracy, driven by out-of-work ex-communists?Strangely, the GWPF are not highlighting this acknowledgement that man-made emissions are driving rapid changes in our climate, compared to the historical experience.The report, written by independent researcher Lewis and Dutch science writer Marcel Crok, is focussed on the question of climate sensitivity - how will temperatures respond to a given increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?Lewis and Crok challenge two very critical numbers that are included in the recent IPCC report, known as AR5, that found that global warming was ""unequivocal"" and humans are the dominant cause.These figures both relate to the temperature rises we are likely to see if levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere double.The first is called the Transient Climate Response (TCR) and is said to be the temperature we'll see at the moment when CO2 crosses that line, expected to be sometime in the latter part of this century.The second is called Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and this is the temperature we expect after the world has adjusted to the doubling of CO2, allowing for feedbacks such as the melting of polar ice and greater water vapour in the atmosphere.Last September, the IPCC said that ""the transient climate response is likely in the range of 1.0C to 2.5C (high confidence) and extremely unlikely greater than 3C"".Lewis and Crok disagree. The say that the models relied on by the IPCC do not give sufficient weight to real world recordings of temperatures. When they did the calculation they found a TCR of 1-2C with a best estimate of 1.35C.When it comes to ECS, again Lewis and Crok reach a different conclusion than the collective wise beards of the IPCC, who gave a range of 1.5 to 4.5C with no best estimate for climate sensitivity.The gentlemen from the GWPF suggest a range of 1.25-3.0 with a best estimate of 1.75C.They base their argument for a lower range on the fact that previous research has overestimated the cooling impact of aerosols in the atmosphere.Since observed temperatures have not increased over the past 17 years, while CO2 has, they say it changes all the calculations.""It has to be the case,"" said Nic Lewis.""The best forcing estimate in AR5 was 43% higher than in AR4, but temperatures have gone nowhere over the past 15 years and that necessarily implies that the climate is less sensitive than we thought.""""The (existing) models were built at a time when it was thought that this aerosol cooling was higher so the models needed to have a higher climate sensitivity or they would have been chucked out as not matching historical warming.""So how has mainstream science reacted to a research paper that has not been peer reviewed, written by people who are not employed at mainstream scientific institutions, casting doubt on a central tenet of their work?While the contribution has not been embraced, it has had a welcome, albeit lukewarm.""Their prediction of 1.35C is, even if correct, only 25% lower than the average of the general circulation models used in the IPCC AR5,"" said Prof Myles Allen from Oxford University.""A 25% reduction in TCR means the warming we might have expected by 2050 might take until the early 2060s instead.""Other researchers argue that Lewis and Crok are cherry picking the data and that they are basing their conclusions on relatively few strands of evidence compared to the more broad-based IPCC report.Lewis counters that something has gone seriously wrong with the statistics of the IPCC.His analysis is all about the science, but he acknowledges that even his more optimistic conclusions will require changes to the way the world uses fossil fuels.""I am not denying that it's a considerable policy challenge, I am not saying let's bury our heads in the sand, this is trying to present the science,"" he said.Lewis also says that many of the mainstream scientists are ""quite competent and sensible people"".It may not be a ""peace in our time"" moment but perhaps it might signal that the time is right for a new, more inclusive debate about climate change.Dr Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, took encouragement from the fact that both the GWPF and the IPCC accepted that significant amounts of further warming were likely this century.""If we broadly agree on this, the debate can crucially move on to what action is needed to deal with a warming planet,"" he said.Some light perhaps, amid all the heat.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train?	What are aviation emissions?How do emissions vary?How does travelling by train compare?Can driving be better than flying?What about travelling by boat?	"The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg chose to sail to a UN climate conference in New York in a zero-emissions yacht rather than fly - to highlight the impact of aviation on the environment. The 16-year-old Swede has previously travelled to London and other European cities by train.Meanwhile the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have faced criticism over opting to fly to Sir Elton John's villa in Nice in a private jet.So what is the environmental impact of flying and how do trips by train, car or boat compare?Flights produce greenhouse gases - mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) - from burning fuel. These contribute to global warming when released into the atmosphere.An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger, according to the calculator from the UN's civil aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).That's equivalent to 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK or about the same as those caused by someone living in Ghana over a year.Aviation contributes about 2% of the world's global carbon emissions, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). It predicts passenger numbers will double to 8.2 billion in 2037..And as other sectors of the economy become greener - with more wind turbines, for example - aviation's proportion of total emissions is set to rise.It depends where passengers sit and whether they are taking a long-haul flight or a shorter one.The flight figures in the table are for economy class. For long haul flights, carbon emissions per passenger per kilometre travelled are about three times higher for business class and four times higher for first class, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).This is because there's more space per seat, so each person accounts for a larger amount of the whole plane's pollution.Taking off uses more fuel than cruising. For shorter flights, this accounts for a larger proportion of the journey. And it means lower emissions for direct flights than multi-leg trips.Also, newer planes can be more efficient and some airlines and routes are better at filling seats than others. One analysis found wide variation between per passenger emissions for different airlines.For private jets, although the planes are smaller, the emissions are split between a much smaller number of people.For example, Prince Harry and Meghan's recent return flight to Nice would have emitted about four times as much CO2 per person as an equivalent economy flight.The increased warming effect other, non-CO2, emissions, such as nitrogen oxides, have when they are released at high altitudes can also make a significant difference to emissions calculations.""The climate effect of non-CO2 emissions from aviation is much greater than the equivalent from other modes of transport, as these non-CO2 greenhouse gases formed at higher altitudes persist for longer than at the surface and also have a stronger warming potential,"" Eloise Marais, from the Atmospheric Composition Group, at the University of Leicester, told BBC News.But there is scientific uncertainty about how this effect should be represented in calculators.The ICAO excludes it, while the BEIS includes it as an option - using a 90% increase to reflect it.The EcoPassenger calculator - launched by the International Railways Union in cooperation with the European Environment Agency - says it depends on the height the plane reaches.Longer flights are at higher altitude, so the calculator multiplies by numbers ranging from 1.27 for flights of 500km (300 miles) to 2.5 for those of more than 1,000km.In the chart above, the high-altitude, non-CO2 emissions are in a different colour.Train virtually always comes out better than plane, often by a lot. A journey from London to Madrid would emit 43kg (95lb) of CO2 per passenger by train, but 118kg by plane (or 265kg if the non-CO2 emissions are included), according to EcoPassenger.However, the margin between train and plane emissions varies, depending on several factors, including the type of train. For electric trains, the way the electricity they use is generated is used to calculate carbon emissions.Diesel trains' carbon emissions can be twice those of electric ones. Figures from the UK Rail Safety and Standards board show some diesel locomotives emit more than 90g of C02 per passenger per kilometre, compared with about 45g for an electric Intercity 225, for example.The source of the electricity can make a big difference if you compare a country such as France, where about 75% of electricity comes from nuclear power, with Poland, where about 80% of grid power is generated from coal.According to EcoPassenger, for example, a train trip from Paris to Bordeaux (about 500km) emits just 4.4kg of carbon dioxide per passenger, while a journey between the Polish cities of Gdansk and Katowice (about 465km) emits 61.8kg.As with plane journeys, another factor is how full the train is - a peak-time commuter train will have much lower emissions per person than a late-night rural one, for example.Yes, if the car's electric - but diesel and petrol cars are also in many cases better options than flying, though it depends on various factors, particularly how many people they're carrying.According to EcoPassenger, a journey from London to Madrid can be done with lower emissions per passenger by plane, even accounting for the effect of high altitude non-CO2 emissions, if the car is carrying just one person and the plane is full. If you add just one more person into the vehicle, the car wins out.Coaches also score well. BEIS says travelling by coach emits 27g of CO2 per person per kilometre, compared with 41g on UK rail (but only 6g on Eurostar) - though again this will vary depending on how full they are and the engine type.The BEIS has also put a figure on ferry transport - 18g of CO2 per passenger kilometre for a foot passenger, which is less than a coach, or 128g for a driver and car, which is more like a long-haul flight.But ferries' ages and efficiency will vary around the world - and a ferry won't get you to America, although a cruise ship or ocean liner would.The cruise industry has long been under pressure to reduce environmental impacts ranging from waste disposal to air pollution, as well as high emissions - not only from travel but also from powering all the on-board facilities.Carnival Corporation and plc, which owns nine cruise lines, says its 104 ships emit an average of 251g of carbon dioxide equivalent per ""available lower berth"" per kilometre.And, while the figures are not directly comparable, they suggest cruising falls in similar territory to flying in terms of emissions.What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

science	Climate change: Where we are in seven charts and what you can do to help	1. The world has been getting hotterHow years compare with the 20th Century average2. The year 2018 set all sorts of records3. We are not on track to meet climate change targets4. The biggest emitters are China and the US5. Urban areas are particularly under threat6. Arctic sea ice is also in danger7. We can all do more to help	"The UN has warned that the goal of limiting global warming to ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels"" is in danger because major economies, including the US and the EU, are falling short of their pledges.But scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body on global warming - argue the 2C pledge in the 2015 Paris accord didn't go far enough. The global average temperature rise actually needs to be kept below 1.5C, they say.So how warm has the world got and what can we do about it?The world is now nearly one degree warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).The global average temperature for the first 10 months of 2018 was 0.98C above the levels of 1850-1900, according to five independently maintained global data sets.2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAA(If you can't see this chart tap or click here)The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with 2015-2018 making up the top four, the WMO says.If this trend continues, temperatures may rise by 3-5C by 2100.One degree may not sound like much, but, according to the IPCC, if countries fail to act, the world will face catastrophic change - sea levels will rise, ocean temperatures and acidity will increase and our ability to grow crops, such as rice, maize and wheat, would be in danger.Last year saw record high temperatures in many places across the world amid an unusually prolonged period of hot weather.Large parts of the northern hemisphere saw a succession of heatwaves take hold in Europe, Asia, North America and northern Africa - a result of strong high pressure systems that created a ""heat dome"".Over the period shown on the map below (May to July 2018), the yellow dots show where a heat record was broken on a given date, pink indicates places that were the hottest they had ever been in the month shown, and dark red represents a place that was the hottest since records began.Sorry, your browser cannot display this mapThe concern is that such hot and cold weather fronts are being blocked - stuck over regions for long periods - more frequently because of climate change, leading to more extreme weather events.If we add up all the promises to cut emissions made by countries that have signed the Paris climate agreement, the world would still warm by more than 3C by the end of this century.Over the past three years, climate scientists have shifted the definition of what they believe is the ""safe"" limit of climate change.For decades, researchers argued the global temperature rise must be kept below 2C by the end of this century to avoid the worst impacts.Countries signing up to the Paris agreement pledged to keep temperatures ""well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C"".But scientists now agree that we actually need to keep temperature rises to below 1.5C.The countries emitting the most greenhouse gases by quite a long way are China and the US. Together they account for more than 40% of the global total, according to 2017 data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.US environmental policy has shifted under the Trump administration, which has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda.After taking office, President Donald Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement.At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.Almost all (95%) of cities facing extreme climate risks are in Africa or Asia, a report by risk analysts Verisk Maplecroft has found.And it's the faster-growing cities that are most at risk, including megacities like Lagos in Nigeria and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Some 84 of the world's 100 fastest-growing cities face ""extreme"" risks from rising temperatures and extreme weather brought on by climate change.The extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped in recent years. It reached its lowest point on record in 2012.Sea ice has been reducing for decades, with melting accelerating since the early 2000s, according to the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee.The Arctic Ocean may be ice free in the summer as soon as the 2050s, unless emissions are reduced, the committee has said.The WMO found the extent of Arctic sea ice in 2018 was much lower than normal, with the maximum in March the third lowest on record and the September minimum the sixth lowest.While governments need to make big changes - individuals can play a role too.Scientists say we all have to make ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes"" to our lifestyles, in order to avoid severely damaging climate change.The IPCC says we need to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter; eat more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away; drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances; take trains and buses instead of planes; use videoconferencing instead of business travel; use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer; insulate homes; demand low carbon in every consumer product.The single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet is to modify your diet to include less meat - according to recent studies.Scientists say we ought to eat less meat because of the carbon emissions the meat industry produces, as well as other negative environmental impacts.A recent study published in the journal Science highlighted a massive variation in the environmental impact of producing the same food.For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land produces 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than those reared on natural pastures.Crucially, the analysis shows that meat with the lowest environmental impact still creates more greenhouse gas emissions than growing vegetables and cereal crops in the least environmentally-friendly way.But as well as altering our diets, research suggests that farming practices need to change significantly to benefit the environment.By Nassos Stylianou, Clara Guibourg, Daniel Dunford and Lucy RodgersSign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger"
science	Climate change dictionary: What do all the terms mean?	Climate change translator	"Climate change is seen as the biggest challenge to the future of human life on Earth, and understanding the scientific language used to describe it can sometimes feel just as difficult.But help is at hand. Use our translator tool to find out what some of the words and phrases relating to climate change mean.1.5 degreesKeeping the rise in global average temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists say. That’s compared with ‘pre-industrial’ times. The world has already warmed about 1C since then.2 degreesThe original target for limiting the rise in global average temperature. Recent research points to 1.5 degrees being a far safer limit.3 degreesThe current likely rise in average global temperature by the year 2100 if countries keep their promises to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which are driving climate change.4 degreesA prediction of the likely rise in average temperature by 2100 if no further action is taken. This would see major sea-level rise, with many coastal areas becoming uninhabitable, as well as regular severe heatwaves and massive disruption to agriculture.AdaptationAn action that helps cope with the effects of climate change - for example building houses on stilts to protect from flooding, constructing barriers to hold back rising sea levels or growing crops which can survive high temperatures and drought.AGWStands for 'Anthropogenic Global Warming', which means the rise in temperatures caused by human activity like the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This produces carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to become warmer. This is in addition to changes in the climate which happen because of natural processes.Arctic iceThe Arctic Ocean freezes in winter and much of it then thaws in summer, and the area thawing has increased by 40% over the past few decades. The Arctic region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.AttributionAttribution is the process by which scientists try to explain whether climate change has made a particular weather event - like a heatwave - more likely.Average temperatureThe average temperature of the world is calculated with the help of temperature readings taken from weather stations, satellites and ships and buoys at sea. Currently it stands at 14.9C.BECCSStands for 'Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage'. It's the name for a system in which crops are grown (which draws in carbon dioxide from the air) and when they are burned to make electricity, carbon emissions are captured and then stored. Scientists see this is a key way to keep the lights on while not adding to global warming, but the technology is in its infancy.BiofuelA fuel derived from renewable, biological sources, including crops such as maize, palm oil and sugar cane, and some forms of agricultural waste.BiomassBiomass is plant or animal material used to produce energy or as raw materials for other products. The simplest example is cow dung; another is compressed wood pellets, which are now used in some power stations.CarbonCarbon is a chemical element which is sometimes described as a building block for all life on Earth because it is found in most plant and animal life. It is also found in fuels like petrol, coal and natural gas, and when burned, is emitted as a gas called carbon dioxide.Carbon captureThe trapping and removal of carbon dioxide gas from the air. The gas can then be reused, or injected into deep underground reservoirs. Carbon capture is sometimes referred to as geological sequestration. The technology is currently in its infancy.Carbon dioxideCarbon dioxide is a gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It occurs naturally and is also a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels. It is the principal greenhouse gas produced by human activity.Carbon footprintThe amount of carbon emitted by an individual or organisation in a given period of time, or the amount of carbon emitted during the manufacture of a product.Carbon neutralA process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be carbon neutral if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve carbon neutrality by means of carbon offsetting. The phrase 'net zero' has the same meaning.Carbon offsettingCarbon offsetting is most commonly used in relation to air travel. It allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight. The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour.Carbon sinkAnything which absorbs more carbon dioxide than it emits. In nature, the main carbon sinks are rainforests, oceans and soil.CCUStands for ‘Carbon Capture and Utilisation’. This consists of using technology to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into products like biofuels and plastics.Climate changeA pattern of change affecting global or regional climate, as measured by average temperature and rainfall, and how often extreme weather events like heatwaves or heavy rains happen. This variation may be caused by both natural processes and by humans. Global warming is an informal term used to describe climate change caused by humans.Climate modelClimate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of greenhouse gases. This helps scientists come up with projections for what Earth will be like as global warming continues. The models do not produce exact predictions, but instead suggest ranges of possible outcomes.Climate negotiationsClimate negotiations take place every year as the United Nations brings governments together to discuss action to stop climate change. The goal is usually a collective agreement to reduce carbon emissions by certain dates. The latest of these is the Paris Agreement of 2015 which set the targets of limiting warming to 2C or 1.5C if possible. Negotiations are always difficult because many countries are heavily dependent on fossil fuels and worry about the effects of any change on their economies.CO2Means carbon dioxide, a naturally occurring gas which is also a major product of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means more heat is retained, causing the planet to warm up.COPStands for 'Conference of the Parties'. It is the name for the annual UN negotiations on climate change under what is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see UNFCCC). The aim is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate.CopenhagenA UN climate summit was held in Copenhagen in 2009 which descended into acrimony and ended with countries only agreeing a non-binding accord that climate change was ""one of the greatest challenges of the present day"". The event is widely regarded as one of the least productive since climate negotiations began.Coral bleachingCoral bleaching refers the change in colour of coral reefs when the ocean temperature rises above a certain level, forcing the corals to eject the algae they normally co-exist with - this turns them white. Coral can recover if the water cools, but lasting damage can be done if it remains too hot.DeforestationThe clearing of forests to make way for farming such as soy crops to feed livestock or palm oil for consumer products. This releases significant levels of carbon dioxide as trees are burned.DeniersClimate deniers believe that climate change is only taking place because of natural processes and that human activity has no role. They dispute the work of many thousands of experts around the world, whose research has been peer-reviewed and published and is based on research stretching back more than a century.EmissionsEmissions are any release of gases such as carbon dioxide which cause global warming, a major cause of climate change. They can be small scale in the form of exhaust from a car or methane from a cow, or larger-scale such as those from coal-burning power stations and heavy industries.Extreme weatherExtreme weather is any type of unusual, severe or unseasonal weather. Examples could be major heat waves, with temperature records broken, extended droughts as well as cold spells and heavier than usual rainfall. Scientists predict that extreme weather will become more common as the world becomes warmer.Feedback loopIn a feedback loop, rising temperatures change the environment in ways that affect the rate of warming. Feedback loops can add to the rate of warming or reduce it. As the Arctic sea-ice melts, the surface changes from being a bright reflective white to a darker blue or green, which allows more of the Sun’s rays to be absorbed. So less ice means more warming and more melting.Fossil fuelsFuels such as coal, oil and natural gas were formed when tiny plants and animals flourished in the ancient past, absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, before dying and being crushed over millions of years. When burned, they release carbon dioxide.Geo-engineeringGeo-engineering is any technology which could be used to halt or even reverse climate change. Examples range from extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground, to more far-fetched ideas such as deploying vast mirrors in space to deflect the Sun's rays. Some scientists say geo-engineering may prove essential because not enough is being done to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Others warn that the technologies are unproven and could have unforeseen consequences.Global temperatureUsually a reference to temperature averaged across the entire planet.Global warmingThe steady rise in global average temperature in recent decades, which experts say is mostly caused by human-produced greenhouse gas emissions. The long-term trend continues upwards with 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 being the warmest years on record.Green energyGreen energy, sometimes called renewable energy, is generated from natural, replenishable sources. Examples are wind and solar power as well as biomass, made from compressed wood pellets.Greenhouse gasesNatural and human-produced gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the surface. The Kyoto Protocol restricts emissions of six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride.Gulf StreamThe Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current which originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the east coast of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists believe Europe would be significantly cooler without it. There is a fear that the stream could be disrupted if rising temperatures melt more polar ice, bringing an influx of freshwater.HydrocarbonA hydrocarbon is a substance consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. The major fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - are hydrocarbons and as such, are the main source of emissions linked to climate change.IPCCThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a scientific body established by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. Its role is to examine and assess the latest scientific research into climate change. Its report in 2018 warned that the rise in global temperatures should be limited to 1.5C to avoid dangerous impacts.JetstreamA jetstream is a narrow band of fast-flowing air at high altitude which acts as major influence on the weather. Jetstreams could be disrupted by warming in polar regions, and this may make extreme weather like Europe’s hot summer of 2018 more common.Kyoto ProtocolA set of rules agreed at Kyoto in Japan in 1997, in which 84 developed countries agreed to reduce their combined emissions by 5.2% of their level in 1990.LukewarmersA term used to describe people who believe that climate change is real, and being driven by human activity, but that its effects will not be as bad as predicted by scientists.MethaneMethane is a gas which traps about 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide. It is produced by human activity from agriculture – cows emit large amounts – as well as waste dumps and leaks from coal mining. Methane is also emitted naturally from wetlands, termites and wildfires. One big concern is that carbon held in frozen ground in arctic regions will be released as methane as temperatures rise and the ground thaws. This could cause extra, unpredictable global warming.MitigationAction that will reduce human-driven climate change. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable power, or capturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by planting forests.Net zeroA term used to describe any process where there is no net release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, growing biomass takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, while burning it releases the gas again. The process would be net zero if the amount taken out and the amount released were identical. A company or country can also achieve net zero by means of carbon offsetting. Net zero processes or manufactured items are sometimes also describbed as being 'carbon neutral'.Ocean acidificationThe ocean absorbs approximately a quarter of human produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. However, when the CO2 dissolves in seawater, carbonic acid is formed. Carbon emissions from industry in the last 200 years have already begun to alter the chemistry of the world’s oceans. If this trend continues, marine creatures will find it harder to build their shells and skeletal structures, and coral reefs will be killed off. This would have serious consequences for people who rely on them as fishing grounds.Ozone layerThe ozone layer is part of Earth's high atmosphere which contains a large concentration of gas molecules comprising three oxygen atoms called ozone. Ozone helps filter out harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun, which can increase the risk of skin cancer. In the 1980s and 1990s, industrial gases called chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were banned because they damaged the ozone layer. These gases are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming.PPM / ppmAn abbreviation for 'parts per million', used to describe the concentration of a gas such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested in 2007 that the world should aim to stabilise greenhouse gas levels at 450 ppm CO2 equivalent in order to avert dangerous climate change. Some scientists, and many of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, argue that the safe upper limit is 350ppm. Modern levels of CO2 broke through 400ppm (at the Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii) in 2013, and continue to climb at about 2-3ppm per year.Pre-industrialScientists use a baseline with which to compare the modern rise in temperatures on Earth. The baseline often quoted is 1850-1900, and global temperatures have risen by about 1C since then. The reality, of course, is that industry actually got going much earlier, but there is nonetheless a perceptible uptick in the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 1850-1900 and the period is deemed therefore to be a useful marker.Renewable energyNormally refers to energy sources such as biomass (such as wood and biogas), the flow of water, geothermal (heat from within the earth), wind, and solar.Runaway climate changeDescribes how the climate change may suddenly change after passing a 'tipping point', making it even harder to stop or reverse. In 2018, the IPCC said that global emissions must be reduced by 45% by 2030, and to net zero by 2050 to have 50% chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C this century.Sea iceSea-ice is found in polar regions. It grows in extent and thickness in autumn and winter, and melts in spring and summer. The amount of sea-ice in the Arctic is seen as a key indicator of climate trends because the region is warming faster than most other locations on Earth. The smallest ever extent (in the satellite era) of Arctic sea-ice was recorded in September 2012. The 3.41 million square kilometers was 44% below the 1981-2010 average.Sea level risesRising sea levels are predicted to be one of the most drastic impacts of climate change. In this context, there are two main causes for sea-level rise: (1) the expansion of seawater as the oceans warm; and (2) the run-off into the ocean of water from melting ice sheet and glaciers. Current sea levels are about 20cm higher on average than they were in 1900. Year on year, sea levels are presently going up by just over 3mm.SustainabilitySustainability means consuming the planet's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished. It's sometimes known as 'sustainable development'. Types of renewable energy such as solar or wind power are described as sustainable, while using wood from managed forests where trees are replanted according to how many are cut down is another example.Tipping pointDescribes how the climate may suddenly change after passing a ‘tipping point’, making it even harder to stop or reverse. Scientists say it is urgent that policy-makers halve global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or risk triggering changes that could be irreversible.UNFCCCStands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This is an international treaty, signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which stated that countries should work to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid dangerous climate change."
science	Climate change: July 'marginally' warmest month on record	World wide warmingPrevious high	"A preliminary analysis of global temperature data for July suggests it may have ""marginally"" become the warmest month on record.Figures from the first 29 days of a month in which many countries had heatwaves are ""on a par"" or slightly higher than a record set in July 2016.The assessment was carried out by researchers at the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).Confirmation of a new record must await a full analysis is released on Monday.Scientists say it's the latest sign that Earth is experiencing unprecedented warming.The new data compiled by C3S incorporates observations from satellites and ground based stations.Interactive tool: How much warmer is your city? Select from 1,000 major cities around the worldThe July figures are likely to be the highest recorded in the organisation's 40-year dataset.They follow on from a global record for June, which was confirmed by data from several different agencies.According to Copernicus, every month this year ranks among the four warmest on record for the month in question.While researchers can't directly link these new high marks to climate change, there is a wide sense among scientists that emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities are altering background temperatures and making new records more likely.""This particular month has been very warm but to me this is not really the main point. The main point is that not only has this month been very warm, but last month was very warm. All months during 2019 have been very warm in terms of comparison with other years,"" Dr Freja Vamborg from Copernicus told BBC News.""And that trend is not likely to stop unless we do something about curbing greenhouse gas emissions.""While July is traditionally the warmest month, this year has seen exceptional heatwaves strike Europe, the US and the Arctic.New temperature records were set in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany as the mercury went above 40C in many places. A new UK heat record was set with 38.7C at Cambridge University's Botanic Garden.In the US, millions of people were affected as temperatures soared along the East Coast and in the Midwest. Alaska saw a dramatic surge, with the heat smashing previous records in several cities. In Anchorage, the mercury stayed above 26C for six days in a row, doubling the previous record.Wildfires have raged across the Arctic with millions of hectares burning in northern parts of Russia. India has suffered heatwaves and severe water shortages. Japan saw more than 5,000 people seek hospital treatment due to a heatwave last week.""This is yet more evidence that we're heading for a much hotter world if we allow carbon emissions to continue to rise,"" said Dr Katherine Kramer from Christian Aid.""For many people in the developing world this has been a reality for some time but now heat records are tumbling across high-emitting, developed countries like the UK.""If the new prime minister needed a reminder that he can't ignore climate change, this July has shown that the UK won't escape a heating planet. We need to move fast and put policies in place that act on Parliament's recognition that we are in a climate emergency.""According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), July 2016 was the highest in a record that dates back to 1880.Noaa says that nine of the 10 warmest Julys on record have occurred during the 21st Century, with only one year from the 20th century, that being 1998.The US space agency (Nasa) takes a slightly different perspective. Their data shows July 2016 and July 2017 in a statistical tie for warmest month.Figures for July 2019 from these agencies will be released in the next couple of weeks.Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc."
science	Ozone chemicals ban linked to global warming 'pause'	Competing arguments	"A new study suggests that the ban on ozone depleting chemicals may have also impacted the rise in global temperatures.CFC gases were responsible for a massive hole in the ozone layer but they also had a powerful greenhouse effect.The authors link a ban on their use to a ""pause"" or slowdown in temperature increases since the mid 1990s.The research is published in the journal Nature Geoscience.The subject of a hiatus or standstill in global temperatures rises since 1998 has been the subject of intense debate among scientists, and it has been used as a key argument by some to show that the impacts of global warming have been exaggerated.There have been a number of theories as to why the rise in emissions from CO2 and other gases has not been mirrored in temperatures since the late 1990s.These include increases in China's use of coal, changes in solar output, and the impact of the El Nino weather cycle.One report earlier this year suggested that it was caused by long-term changes in the warming of waters in the eastern Pacific.Now this latest piece of research says that it has been caused by attempts to protect the ozone layer.A team of researchers carried out a statistical analysis on the connection between rising temperatures and rates of increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere between 1880 and 2010.They concluded that changes in the warming rate can be attributed to specific human actions that affected greenhouse gas concentrations.They were able to show that when emissions were reduced during both world wars and the Great Depression, temperature rises also stalled.They also argue that the introduction of the Montreal Protocol, originally signed in 1987 by 46 countries, had an impact on global temperatures as well.The treaty phased out the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These chemicals, used as spray can propellants and in refrigeration, had helped thin the ozone layer over Antarctica.But CFCs were not just damaging the ozone layer, they were also having a warming impact, as they are 10,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide and can last up to 100 years in the atmosphere.Their removal, say the authors, was a critical factor in the slowdown.""Our analysis suggests that the reduction in the emissions of ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, as well as a reduction in methane emissions, contributed to the lower rate of warming since the 1990s,"" the authors write.In a commentary on the research, Felix Pretis and Prof Myles Allen from Oxford University suggest that the CFC ban is ""unlikely to be the whole story"", but they acknowledge it did make a difference.""The impact of this change is small but not negligible: without the reduction in CFC emissions, temperatures today could have been almost 0.1C warmer than they actually are.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	IPCC climate report: humans 'dominant cause' of warming	DocumentWhat is the IPCC?	"A landmark report says scientists are 95% certain that humans are the ""dominant cause"" of global warming since the 1950s.The report by the UN's climate panel details the physical evidence behind climate change.On the ground, in the air, in the oceans, global warming is ""unequivocal"", it explained.It adds that a pause in warming over the past 15 years is too short to reflect long-term trends.The panel warns that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all aspects of the climate system.To contain these changes will require ""substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions"".After a week of intense negotiations in the Swedish capital, the summary for policymakers on the physical science of global warming has finally been released.The first part of an IPCC trilogy, due over the next 12 months, this dense, 36-page document is considered the most comprehensive statement on our understanding of the mechanics of a warming planet.It states baldly that, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes in the climate system are ""unprecedented over decades to millennia"".Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe ReaderDownload the reader hereEach of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface, and warmer than any period since 1850, and probably warmer than any time in the past 1,400 years.""Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and that concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,"" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of IPCC working group one, who produced the report.Speaking at a news conference in the Swedish capital, Prof Thomas Stocker, another co-chair, said that climate change ""challenges the two primary resources of humans and ecosystems, land and water. In short, it threatens our planet, our only home"".Since 1950, the report's authors say, humanity is clearly responsible for more than half of the observed increase in temperatures.But a so-called pause in the increase in temperatures in the period since 1998 is downplayed in the report. The scientists point out that this period began with a very hot El Nino year.""Trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends,"" the report says.Prof Stocker, added: ""I'm afraid there is not a lot of public literature that allows us to delve deeper at the required depth of this emerging scientific question.""For example, there are not sufficient observations of the uptake of heat, particularly into the deep ocean, that would be one of the possible mechanisms to explain this warming hiatus.""""Likewise we have insufficient data to adequately assess the forcing over the last 10-15 years to establish a relationship between the causes of the warming.""However, the report does alter a key figure from the 2007 study. The temperature range given for a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, called equilibrium climate sensitivity, was 2.0C to 4.5C in that report.In the latest document, the range has been changed to 1.5C to 4.5C. The scientists say this reflects improved understanding, better temperature records and new estimates for the factors driving up temperatures.In its own words, the IPCC is there ""to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts"".The offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.These are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.The IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.In the summary for policymakers, the scientists say the rise in ocean waters will proceed at a faster rate than we have experienced over the past 40 years. Global mean sea level rise for 2081−2100, the document says, is projected to be between 26cm (at the low end) and 82cm (at the high end), depending on the greenhouse emissions path this century.The scientists say ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for 90% of energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010.For the future, the report states that warming is projected to continue under all scenarios. Model simulations indicate that global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to 1850.Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, from Imperial College London, told BBC News: ""We are performing a very dangerous experiment with our planet, and I don't want my grandchildren to suffer the consequences of that experiment.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Global warming pause 'central' to IPCC climate report	Levels of certaintyToo sensitive	"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is meeting in Sweden to thresh out a critical report on global warming.Scientists will underline, with greater certainty than ever, the role of human activities in rising temperatures.But many governments are demanding a clearer explanation of the slowdown in temperature increases since 1998.One participant told BBC News that this pause will be a ""central piece"" of the summary.Researchers from all over the world work with the IPCC to pore over thousands of peer-reviewed studies and produce a summary representing the current state of climate science.Its previous report in 2007 was instrumental in helping the panel share the Nobel Peace Prize that year.A new Summary for Policymakers on the physical sciences, the first of three parts that make up a report to be released over the next 12 months, will be published in Stockholm on Friday.It will focus on the science underlying changes in temperature in the atmosphere, the oceans and at the poles.New estimates will be given for the scale of global warming and its impact on sea levels, glaciers and ice sheets.In its last report in 2007, the IPCC stated that ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal"" and that ""most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th Century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations"" - in other words, humans burning fossil fuels.In the latest draft summary, seen by the BBC, the level of scientific certainty has increased.The panel states that it is 95% certain that the ""human influence on climate caused more than half the observed increase in global average surface temperatures from 1951-2010.""But since 2007, there has been a growing focus on the fact that global average temperatures haven't gone above the level recorded in 1998.This slowdown, or hiatus as the IPCC refers to it, has been leapt upon by climate sceptics to argue that the scientific belief that emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere increases the temperature of the planet, is wrong.Scientists have attempted to explain the pause in a number of ways, with many arguing that the Earth has continued to warm but that the heat has gone into oceans.The most recent report suggested that a periodic cooling of the Pacific ocean was counteracting the impact of the extra carbon in the atmosphere.But there is no certainty and little agreement among scientists on the mechanisms involved.And this week, when the scientists will go through their summary line by line with officials from 195 governments, the pause is likely to be the focus of heated debate.Prof Arthur Petersen is the chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and part of the Dutch delegation that will review the IPCC report.""Governments are demanding a clear explanation of what are the possible causes of this factor,"" he told BBC News.""I expect that this will be a central piece of the summary.""There are likely to be tough negotiations between the parties throughout the week, with governments having already submitted around 1,800 comments on the draft.Any changes to the text will need to be approved by the scientists, who will want to make sure that they are consistent with the underlying reports. This could lead to some tense moments.""I wouldn't say there is a reluctance of the authors to take up such an issue as the pause, but they want to do it in a proper way,"" said Prof Petersen.""There will remain a tension between how much you can deliver based on the peer-reviewed science and what the governments would like to have.""In the draft report, the panel agrees that ""the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998-2012) is smaller than the trend since 1951"".The effect of this slowdown means that the future temperature range predicted by the IPCC will be wider than in 2007, and with a lower starting point.Many sceptical voices believe this is a recognition that the IPCC modelling process has been too sensitive to carbon dioxide, a claim given some credence by the text of the draft which states that some models have ""too strong a response to increasing greenhouse gas forcing"".But Prof Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is a vice-chair of the IPCC, rejects this idea.""To take that out of context, if that change is confirmed this week, and to present it as a big change in the opinion the IPCC has on climate sensitivity, is ridiculous,"" he said.""Most climate scientists wouldn't say that the 15-year period is a good reason to question the overall quality of models.""There is a feeling among many scientists involved with the process that this report will be more complicated and cautious than in 2007.In the wake of that year's report, a small number of embarrassing errors were detected in the underlying material. The organisation's reputation was also questioned in the Climategate rumpus.""Overall, the message is, in that sense more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones,"" said Prof Petersen.""The language has become more complicated to understand, but it is more precise.""It is a major feat that we have been able to produce such a document which is such an adequate assessment of the science. That being said, it is virtually unreadable!""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate sceptics claim warming pause backs their view	Who are the climate sceptics?Sensitive debateThe Dutch approach to sceptics	"In the run up to a key global warming report, those sceptical of mainstream opinion on climate change claim they are ""winning"" the argument.They say a slowing of temperature rises in the past 15 years means the threat from climate change is exaggerated.But a leading member of the UN's panel on climate change said the views of sceptics were ""wishful thinking"".The pause in warming was a distraction, he said, from the growing scientific certainty about long-term impacts.Prof Jean Pascal van Ypersele spoke to BBC News ahead of the release of a six-yearly status report into global warming by the UN panel known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.Scientists and government representatives are currently meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, going through the dense, 31-page summary of the state of the physical science behind climate change.When it is released on Friday, the report is likely to state with even greater certainty than before that the present-day, rapid warming of the planet is man-made.But climate sceptics have focused their attention on the references to a pause or hiatus in the increase in global temperatures since 1998.The sceptics believe that this slowdown is the most solid evidence yet that mainstream computer simulations of the Earth's climate - climate models - are wrong.These computer simulations are used to study the dynamics of the Earth's climate and make projections about future temperature change.""The sceptics now have a feeling of being on the winning side of the debate thanks to the pause,"" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who accepts the idea that human activities warm the planet, but is sceptical about the scale of the effect.Although there are only a small number of mainstream scientists who reject the established view on global warming, they are supported by a larger group of well resourced bloggers and citizen scientists who pore through climate literature and data looking for evidence of flaws in the hypothesis.There are many different shades of opinion in the sceptical orbit. Some such as the group Principia Scientific reject the ""myth"" of greenhouse gas warming.There are also political sceptics, such as some members of the Republican party in the US, who argue that climate science is a hoax or a conspiracy.But there are also sceptical bloggers such as Anthony Watts and Andrew Montford who accept the basic science that adding carbon to the atmosphere can affect the temperature. They contest mainstream findings on the sensitivity of the climate to carbon and the future impacts on temperature.""You are now starting to see a normalisation of climate science. Suddenly mainstream researchers, who all agree that greenhouse gases play a huge role, start to disagree about the cause of the pause.""For me this is a relief, it is finally opening up again and this is good.""The view that the sceptics have positively impacted the IPCC is supported by Prof Arthur Petersen, who is a member of the Dutch government team currently examining the report.""The sceptics are good for the IPCC and the whole process is really flourishing because of this interaction over the past decades,"" he told BBC News.""Our best climate researchers are typically very close to really solid, sceptical scientists. In this sense scepticism is not necessarily a negative term.""Others disagree.Bart Verheggen is an atmospheric scientist and blogger who supports the mainstream view of global warming. He said that sceptics have discouraged an open scientific debate.""When scientists start to notice that their science is being distorted in public by these people who say they are the champions of the scientific method, that could make mainstream researchers more defensive.""Scientists probably think twice now about writing things down. They probably think twice about how this could be twisted by contrarians.""In 2007, the IPCC defined the range for what's termed ""equilibrium climate sensitivity"". This term refers to the likely span of temperatures that would occur following a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.The panel's last report said temperatures were likely to rise within the range of 2C to 4.5C with a best estimate of 3C.The new report is believed to indicate a range of 1.5C to 4.5C with no best estimate indicated.With around 20% of the country under sea level, the Dutch have a keen interest in anything that might affect their environment, such as climate change.But scepticism about the human influence on global warming has been growing in the Netherlands, according to research from the OECD.In a country where consensus is a key word, the government has taken a more inclusive approach to climate dissenters. To that end, they have funded Marcel Crok to carry out a sceptical analysis of the IPCC report.In an effort to build bridges between sceptics and the mainstream they are also funding an initiative called climatedialogue.org which serves as a platform for debate on the science of global warming.Although that might not appear like much of a change, many sceptics believe it exposes a critical flaw.""In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,"" said Marcel Crok.""And these studies indicate that our real climate shows a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2C, but the climate models on which these future doom scenarios are based warm up three degrees under a doubling of CO2.""But other researchers who are familiar with the text believe that the sceptics are reading too much into a single figure.""Some of what the sceptics are saying is either wishful thinking or totally dishonest,"" Prof van Ypersele, who is vice-chair of the IPCC, told BBC News.""It is just a change in a lower border [of the range of temperature rise]. Even if this turns out to be the real sensitivity, instead of making the challenge extremely, extremely, extremely difficult to meet, it is only making it extremely, extremely difficult.""Is that such a big change?""Prof van Ypersele points out that many other aspects of the forthcoming report are likely to give greater certainty to the scale of impacts of a warming world. The predictions for sea level rise are likely to be considerably strengthened from 2007. There is also likely to be a clearer understanding of the state of sea ice."
science	Global warming slowdown linked to cooler Pacific waters	Cooling the carbonSwing continues	"Scientists say the slow down in global warming since 1998 can be explained by a natural cooling in part of the Pacific ocean.Although they cover just 8% of the Earth, these colder waters counteracted some of the effect of increased carbon dioxide say the researchers.But temperatures will rise again when the Pacific swings back to a warmer state, they argue.The research is published in the journal Nature.Climate sceptics and some scientists have argued that since 1998, there has been no significant global warming despite ever increasing amounts of carbon dioxide being emitted.For supporters of the idea that man made emissions are driving up temperatures, the pause has become increasingly difficult to ignore.Scientists have tried to explain it using a number of different theories but so far there is no general agreement on the cause.""For people on the street it is very confusing as to which story is closer to the truth,"" lead author, Prof Shang-Ping Xie from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography told BBC News.""We felt a similar contradiction and that's why we started doing these modelling studies.""Prof Xie said there were two possible reasons why the continuing flow of CO2 has not driven the mercury higher.The first is that water vapour, soot and other aerosols in the atmosphere have reflected sunlight back into space and thereby had a cooling effect on the Earth.The second is natural variability in the climate, especially the impact of cooling waters in the tropical Pacific ocean.Although it only covers 8.2% of the planet, the region is sometimes called the engine room of the world's climate system and atmospheric circulation.Researchers already know that a naturally occurring cycle in this area, called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, has a major impact on global climate.But Prof Xie and colleagues were interested in a different cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that lasts for a much longer period of time.To test his theory, Prof Xie and his colleagues developed a dynamic climate model that measured the greenhouse effect on temperatures but also included records of sea surface temperatures in this region of the eastern Pacific.""Previous efforts using climate models take radiative forcing as the only input, externally, and they produce a temperature record close to observations except for the past 15 years,"" said Prof Xie.""Only when we input equatorial Pacific ocean temperatures into our model, were we able to reproduce the flattening of the temperature record.""This model also explains some of the other contradictions seen since temperatures flat lined.There have been major heat waves in Europe in 2003, Russia in 2010 and in the US in 2012.Arctic sea ice also dropped to its lowest recorded level in 2012. All these are indications that the climate is continuing to warm, but the global average temperature has remained below the figure for 1998.""The solution to this contradiction is that temperature has behaved differently between winter and summer seasons,"" said Prof Xie.""The influence of the equatorial Pacific ocean is strongest in winter but weakest during the summer, so CO2 can keep working on the temperature and sea ice in the Arctic over the summer.""The last time the Pacific was in a relatively cold state was in the 30 year period from the 1940s to 1970s said Prof Xie and that coincides with the last hiatus in climate warming.But the researchers warn that the impact of this multi-decadal cool trend will come to an end and will be replaced by a warming one. Global temperatures will rise once again.""We're pretty confident that the swing up will come some time in the future, but the current science can't predict when that will be,"" said Prof Xie.Other scientists have welcomed the study saying it offers a coherent explanation of the slowdown.""The new simulation accurately reproduces the timing and pattern of changes that have occurred over the last four decades with remarkable skill, "" said Dr Alex Sen Gupta from the University of New South Wales.""This clearly shows that the recent slowdown is a consequence of a natural oscillation.""Other researchers believe the new work supports the idea that the heat in the atmosphere has gone into the oceans.""This new study adds further evidence that the recent slowdown in the rate of global warming at the Earth's surface is explained by natural fluctuations in the ocean and is therefore likely to be a temporary respite from warming in response to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases,"" said Dr Richard Allan from the University of Reading.Dr Will Hobbs from Australia's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies agrees.He said: ""Over the period that the authors analysed, observations showed a continued trapping of heat in the Earth's climate system, despite the temporary slowdown in surface warming, and an important question that the paper does not address is where this energy has gone.""Almost certainly it is in the deep ocean.""Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Openness: A Heartland-warming tale		"It's been a while, but at last another climate-related ""gate"" has opened... and this time, it's in the edifice constructed by those who would have you think climate ""scepticism"" was rooted purely in science, with never a hint of politics involved.While Europe was asleep, someone mailed a bunch of internal Heartland Institute documents to a number of bloggers including desmogblog and ThinkProgress - these two and others have since posted the documents online.""Denier-gate"" is the label being applied in the blogosphere, in case you're interested.For anyone who doesn't spend every week up to their waists in the ordure of climate politics, the Heartland Institute is a US-based organisation with an overtly libertarian bent to its work.To itself, it's a think-tank; to critics, it's a lobby group, paid to oppose regulation on a number of fronts - including climate change.It's probably most notable (or notorious) for holding an annual ""climate-sceptic"" conference in Washington DC.(UPDATE 2145GMT - Heartland has posted a release on its website saying one of the documents is a fake. Elements of the remainder of this post have been re-worked accordingly.)One thing that's clear from the documents is that the Heartland Institute is largely behind the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), a project that purports to mirror the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by producing reports downplaying the extent of global warming as well as the involvement of greenhouse gas emissions in producing it.An annual sum of $300,000 is the Heartland Institute's contribution for making that happen.The institute says it retains the services of several ""high-profile individuals who regularly and publicly counter the alarmist AGW message"".These include the US-based Craig Idso ($11,600 per month) and Fred Singer ($5,000 per month plus expenses), and Australian Bob Carter ($1,667 per month).The next target appears to be schools. The plan is to fund a consultant, David Wojick, to develop modules for use in classrooms.Among the statements it might promulgate, according to the ""2012 Fundraising Plan"" document, are that ""whether humans are changing the climate is a major scientific controversy"" and ""natural [CO2] emissions are 20 times higher than human emissions"".Chris Rapley, a climate change scientist at University College London, described the project as ""brain-washing"".""This strikes at the very roots of truth and freedom in a democratic society, something I would have felt the American people would find abhorrent,"" he said.Further funding will go to climate blogger and former meteorologist Anthony Watts for a web-based project aiming to demonstrate problems in the US network of temperature monitoring stations - an issue whose irrelevance to the big questions of climate change was emphatically demonstrated last year by the Berkeley Earth Project, which found station quality was not a factor in modern measurements of global warming.Elsewhere, the documents reveal that a huge number of companies, foundations and individuals give money to the Heartland Institute - some as core funding, others to pay for specific programmes.But their contributions of a few tens of thousands of dollars per year are dwarfed by a single source who is so important as to acquire his own set of capitals - the Anonymous Donor.This man - the gender is specified - gave just under $1m last year, a little less than a quarter of the institute's income.But that's small beer compared with his 2008 contribution of $4,610,000 - amounting to 58% of the organisation's entire budget for the year!The Anonymous Donor appears to be particularly interested in global warming, paying for more than half of the NIPCC project and agreeing to stump up the first $100,000 of David Wojick's curriculum work.As his funding has fallen in the last couple of years, the institute has accordingly spent less on climate: ""We are extinguishing primarily global warming projects in pace with declines in his giving"", one of the documents notes.This appears to add a new ingredient to the debate over what to call organisations like the Heartland Institute. Neither think-tank nor lobby group appears to work when the organisation is changing its output on the basis of what its funders want it to do: perhaps ""public relations"" would work best?This has one very practical dimension in that under US law, the amount and type of campaigning that non-profit organisations can do without endangering their tax-free status is constrained; and a number of commentators, including desmogblog itself, are arguing that the Heartland Institute is going beyond what it's permitted to do.Whatever the rights and wrongs of that, the big issue is surely this: when the Heartland Institute speaks on climate change, it is speaking with the money, fundamentally, of one major donor.And we have no idea who he is.Heartland is not unique. We still have no idea, two years after its formation, of who funds the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) in the UK, nor what the funders' motives are.Who's raising a flag now for openness in the lobbies of climate change debate?"
science	Human role in warming 'more certain' - UN climate chief	Unprecedented changeTightening procedures	"Scientists are more certain than ever that greenhouse gases from human activities are heating the planet, the head of the UN's climate panel says.Rajendra Pachauri made the comments in an interview with BBC News.The panel is due to deliver its latest report on the state of the climate later this week in Stockholm, Sweden.Its last report was criticised after an error on glaciers unveiled other flaws, but Prof Pachauri said procedures had been reformed and strengthened.He also dismissed suggestions of a slowdown in global warming.""There’s definitely an increase in our belief that climate change is taking place and that human beings are responsible,” he told me.""I don't think there is a slowdown (in the rate of temperature increase). I would like to draw your attention to the World Meteorological Organization which clearly stated on the basis of observations that the first decade of this century has been the warmest in recorded history.""And I think the rest will be brought out by the report itself when it’s released.""Prof Pachauri’s insistence that warming has not slowed hints at a focus of debate this week in Stockholm: Global temperatures have not been increasing as fast as scientists predicted, and several governments insist that this puzzle is properly addressed in the final summary.Have computer climate models overestimated the sensitivity of the planet to increasing CO2? Or has excess heat been stored up in oceans whence it will emerge to super-heat the planet in decades to come? Or both?Or just perhaps it could be something else.The draft says a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere above pre-industrial levels (expected by mid-century) is likely to result in a temperature rise globally of between 1.5 and 4.5C.Any rise above 2C could risk major changes on Earth, according to projections, but the results of recent modelling involves a downward tweak at the bottom of the range, offering the tantalising prospect to politicians that if humans are very lucky, they could get away with rising CO2 emissions for a bit longer than previously expected.The panel is struggling to offer a definitive answer as to why warming is not happening at the rate previously projected. But it will be anxious to ensure that the likelihood of a fortunate escape for humanity should not be overplayed.It is expected to say that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have already warmed the ocean, melted snow and ice, raised sea levels and increased climatic extremes.It will also warn that unless emissions are cut soon, we are likely to suffer severe changes in the climate unprecedented for hundreds of thousands of years.Prof Pachauri’s leadership of the panel has been strongly supported by developing countries, although he has faced criticism in the West. He told me he had no plans to retire after the forthcoming report.He said the panel enjoyed massive support, with 3,000 people volunteering to act as authors, 831 of whom were selected.In the detailed text of its last report, the UN panel made a controversial mistake on glaciers.Prof Pachauri said: ""We made one mistake about the glaciers melting by 2035 - for which we have apologised. That was totally out of character because we always give a range for these things and it somehow slipped through.""But it wasn’t included in the technical summary or the summary for policymakers, it just somehow escaped attention.“What we did say about the glaciers was in substance not all that wrong – the glaciers are melting across the globe so that is something we stand by.“This time we have been doubly careful... [that] we don’t have any mistake of that type. And I hope that [the report] will reassure everyone that human influence is having a major impact on the Earth's climate.”Prof Pachauri said he anticipated attempts to discredit the panel. But he claimed evidence of extreme events was persuading more and more people, especially in the US, that humans were taking a risk with the climate.Indeed, the report is expected to say it is very likely that manmade climate change has produced higher precipitation in America.""Hopefully,” he said, “there are enough sane and sensible people in the public who will ultimately prevail.""The broader question is whether science itself will prevail over politics. Whatever the pronouncements of the UN panel, emissions are expected to continue to increase into the foreseeable future as politicians weigh risks to energy bills and competitiveness against risks to the planet.The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has re-confirmed that he will invite world leaders to a climate summit next year in an attempt to galvanise action.Follow Roger on Twitter"
science	Bananas could replace potatoes in warming world	Blooming bananasProtein under pressureAbout bananas	"Climate change could lead to crops from the banana family becoming a critical food source for millions of people, a new report says.Researchers from the CGIAR agricultural partnership say the fruit might replace potatoes in some developing countries.Cassava and the little-known cowpea plant could be much more important food crops as temperatures rise.People will have to adapt to new and varied menus as traditional crops struggle, say the authors.Responding to a request from the United Nations' committee on world food security, a group of experts in the field looked at the projected effects of climate change on 22 of the world's most important agricultural commodities.They predict that the world's three biggest crops in terms of calories provided - maize, rice and wheat - will decrease in many developing countries.They suggest that the potato, which grows best in cooler climates, could also suffer as temperatures increase and weather becomes more volatile.The authors argue that these changes ""could provide an opening for cultivating certain varieties of bananas"" at higher altitudes, even in those places that currently grow potatoes.Dr Philip Thornton is one of those behind the report. He told BBC News that while bananas and plantains also have limiting factors, they may be a good substitute for potatoes in certain locations.""It's not necessarily a silver bullet, but there may be places where as temperatures increase, bananas might be one option that small-holders could start to look at.""The report describes wheat as the world's most important plant-derived protein and calorie source.But according to this research, wheat will face a difficult future in the developing world, where higher prices for cotton, maize and soybeans have pushed wheat to marginal land, making it more vulnerable to stresses induced by climate change.One substitute, especially in South Asia, could be cassava - which is known to be tolerant to a range of climate stresses.But how easy will it be to get people to adjust to new crops and new diets?Bruce Campbell is programme director of the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security research group (CCAFS) which co-ordinates work among leading institutions around the world. He told BBC News that the types of changes that will happen in the future have already happened in the past.""Two decades ago there was almost no rice consumption in certain areas of Africa, now there is. People have changed because of the pricing: it's easier to get, it's easier to cook. I think those sort of shifts do occur and I think they will in future.""Source: DoleBBC Food: Try out banana recipesBBC Food: How to cook a plantainOne of the big concerns among researchers is how to tackle the need for protein in the diet. Soybeans are one of the most common sources but are very susceptible to temperature changes.The scientists say that the cowpea, which is known in sub-Saharan Africa as the ""poor man's meat"" is drought-tolerant and prefers warmer weather and could be a reasonable alternative to soya. The vines of the cowpea can also be used as a feed for livestock.In some countries, including Nigeria and Niger, farmers have already moved away from cotton production to growing cowpeas.There are also likely to be developments in animal protein sources says the report, including a shift to smaller livestock.""This is an example of something that's happening already,"" said Dr Campbell. ""There's been quite a shift from cattle keeping to goat keeping in southern Africa in face of droughts - when the farmers see the problems they are having with production, they really are willing to shift.""Change is really possible. It's not just a crazy notion."""
science	Greenland map captures changing Arctic in fine detail		"The Arctic is changing rapidly. It's warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.The seasonal sea-ice is in long-term decline and the ice sheet that sits atop Greenland is losing mass at a rate of about 280 billion tonnes a year.So, if you choose to make a map of the region, you start from the recognition that what you're producing can only be a snapshot that will need to be updated in the relatively near future.Laura Gerrish, a geographical information systems and mapping specialist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), knows this. Polar science and polar cartography are all about tracing change.Laura has just finished making a exquisite new printed sheet map (1:4,000,000) of Greenland.The detail is a delight - from the winding path of all the fjords and inlets, to the precise positioning of current ice margins, and the use of all those tongue-twisting Greenlandic names.The Arctic is changing rapidly. It's warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.""The map is a little unusual because the area has not been shown on one sheet like this before,"" explains Laura.""We have good maps, obviously, of Europe, of Iceland, of Svalbard - but there is nothing that puts them all together on one sheet and shows their relationship like this.""The map is aimed at scientists, clearly; BAS is a scientific organisation. But we hope tourists on cruise ships and any visitors to Greenland will find it useful, as well as schools or anyone with an interest in the Arctic.""Greenland And The European Arctic, to give the map its full title, has taken nearly two years to put together.Laura has had to call on more than a dozen data-sets to get the shape of Greenland exactly right. These have been checked against the latest satellite imagery to ensure physical features are where they're supposed to be.One or two features, such as islands in the Qimusseriarsuaq (Melville Bay) region, are new because they've only recently been revealed by contracting ice fronts.Care has been taken in particular to plot the present extents of all the glaciers, including the big ice streams that sometimes hit the science headlines, such as Jakobshavn, Petermann, Zachariae Isstrom, and Helheim.These glaciers have demonstrated some remarkable retreat behaviour. Although just to prove what a thankless task this business can be, they've also shown recently that they can slow and lengthen as well (the net area of 47 regularly surveyed glaciers essentially stood still last year).You might wonder what the British Antarctic Survey is doing making maps of the polar north. Henry Burgess, the head of the NERC Arctic Office which is hosted at the survey's HQ in Cambridge, has a simple answer.""BAS is the national capability and logistics provider for the polar regions,"" he told me. ""It provides the ships and the planes and the expertise, and the BAS mapping department therefore has a responsibility in both the north and the south.""Henry is especially pleased with the flip side of the sheet map. This has a series of panels that attempt to put the cartography in a wider context.Different organisations from the UK Met Office to WWF have provided small summaries on various issues that range from the effects that a warming arctic are having on frozen ground and on weather at mid latitudes, to the challenges climate change presents to indigenous peoples and endemic wildlife.Hopefully, the new fold-out sheet map of Greenland And The European Arctic should be good for at least a few years, but says Henry: ""We're seeing dramatic changes in Svalbard for example where we have our Arctic station; the glaciers are pulling back by 10s of metres per year. So, yes, mapping is a constant process.""The Greenland and the European Arctic map is available for sale as either a flat wall map or a folded map at several outlets, including the Scott Polar Research Institute and Stanfords map store in London.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
science	Attenborough: Climate risks Africa turmoil		"The naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough says that climate change will make parts of Africa uninhabitable.Speaking to the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee, Sir David said we can't be radical enough when tackling the problem.Tough, unpopular actions from the government would be needed, he said.These included putting up the price of airline tickets.Painting a vivid picture for MPs of coral reefs turned ""stark white"" by warming waters, Sir David warned that the world faced a ""serious collapse"" caused by climate change over the next 20-30 years.This could make parts of Africa uninhabitable, he said, causing mass migration.""Large parts of Africa will become even less inhabitable than they are now,"" he told the committee.He criticised those governments where voices sceptical about climate science were still clearly heard. And he hoped the electorate in the US and Australia particularly would remember this come election time.Sir David told MPs that everyone would have to play their part in the battle against climate change, and this would involve some tough decisions. He criticised airfares as too cheap, and said that these should rise to discourage flying.The public mood was changing, he said. The young, he said, gave him hope that the world would change before irreversible climate change destroyed our world.Despite the stark nature of his message, Sir David's passion and status seemed to charm the MPs on the committee. The chair described it as the ""most inspiring session"" that they've held."
science	Scientists say UK wet summers down to Atlantic warming	Basket cases	"The UK's recent run of damp summers could be down to a cyclical warming of the Atlantic Ocean.That was the view of scientists and meteorologists who gathered at the Met Office to discuss the unusual weather patterns of recent years.They said that this 10 to 20 year pattern of Atlantic warming was shifting the jet stream, leading to washouts in six of the last seven summers.But they suggested that the pattern would change at some point in the next decade.The researchers said the location of the fast moving winds of the jet stream was critical to the UK's weather.When it becomes fixed in position south of the British Isles, low pressure systems can get stuck in the peaks and troughs that form along the edge of the stream, leading to the seemingly endless rainy days that have characterised our summers in recent years.Even the buzz of the London Olympics could not disguise the washout that was last summer, the second wettest for the UK since records began.What the scientists meeting in Exeter were hoping to understand were the underlying factors that move the jet stream south of the UK .Prof Stephen Belcher from the Met Office Hadley Centre, who lead the discussions said that changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), as the ocean current is called, was one of the prime factors.""It's the pattern of warm and cold water, it's the contrast of the warm and the cold, when that sits in the right place beneath the jet stream, it can kind of steer the jet stream and influence where it goes,"" he said.""I'm excited about this work, it's a new thing that we didn't really know about.""The scientists said that the AMO phenomenon had occurred in the 1880s, the 1950s and in the early 1960s. The most recent research was published last year by a team at Reading University.Explaining the cold winters of 2010/11 and this past spring were more of a challenge, said the scientists. Dr James Screen from the University of Exeter said that a more complicated basket of factors was involved.""The cycle we've been talking about in the north Atlantic seems to be more important for controlling summer weather in the UK, our current understanding of the role of Arctic sea ice is that it is more important in controlling winter weather.""The researchers say that the glimmer of good news is that the AMO might change in five to 10 years, and warmer summers might return. However the winter was more difficult to predict said Prof Belcher.""There are hints we are coming to the end of the cycle. With the cold winter weather, the loadings of the dice don't seem to follow cycles,"" he said.As to the current summer season, according to Dr Adam Scaife from the Hadley Centre, you'd be wise to keep an umbrella handy.""In 2012, like the previous few summers, we've had conditions in the northernmost Atlantic that were much warmer than normal.""So that pre-conditioning was there this year and that shifts the odds slightly in favour of this summer being wetter than the historical average."""
science	West Antarctic Ice Sheet warming twice earlier estimate	Top to bottomGlacial pace	"A new analysis of temperature records indicates that the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet is warming nearly twice as fast as previously thought.US researchers say they found the first evidence of warming during the southern hemisphere's summer months.They are worried that the increased melting of ice as a result of warmer temperatures could contribute to sea-level rise.The study has been published in the journal Nature Geoscience.The scientists compiled data from records kept at Byrd station, established by the US in the mid-1950s and located towards the centre of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS).Previously scientists were unable to draw any conclusions from the Byrd data as the records were incomplete.The new work used a computer model of the atmosphere and a numerical analysis method to fill in the missing observations.The results indicate an increase of 2.4C in average annual temperature between 1958 and 2010.""What we're seeing is one of the strongest warming signals on Earth,"" says Andrew Monaghan, a co-author and scientist at the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research.""This is the first time we've been able to determine that there's warming going on during the summer season."" he added.It might be natural to expect that summers even in Antarctica would be warmer than other times of the year. But the region is so cold, it is extremely rare for temperatures to get above freezing.According to co-author Prof David Bromwich from Ohio State University, this is a critical threshold.""The fact that temperatures are rising in the summer means there's a prospect of WAIS not only being melted from the bottom as we know it is today, but in future it looks probable that it will be melting from the top as well,"" he said.Previous research published in Nature indicated that the WAIS is being warmed by the ocean, but this new work suggests that the atmosphere is playing a role as well.The scientists say that the rise in temperatures has been caused by changes in winds and weather patterns coming from the Pacific Ocean.""We're seeing a more dynamic impact that's due to climate change that's occurring elsewhere on the globe translating down and increasing the heat transportation to the WAIS."" said Dr Monaghan.But he was unable to say with certainty that the greater warming his team found was due to human activities.""The jury is still out on that. That piece of research has not been done. My opinion is that it probably is, but I can't say that definitively.""This view was echoed by Prof Bromwich, who suggested that further study would be needed.""The tasks now are to look at the relative contributions of natural variability,"" he said.""This place has very variable weather - some of it is influenced by human acts and some of it isn't. I think its premature to answer that question right now.""Whatever the source, the researchers are concerned that this warming can lead to more melting and have direct and indirect effects on global sea levels. The direct impacts are the run-off of melting waters into the sea.But the scientists say this is unlikely to happen for several decades because much of the water is likely to percolate down the ice sheet and refreeze.The indirect effect is that it can ""pre-condition"" the ice shelves that float at the edges of the ice sheet. The scientists say that this is what happened in 2002 on the Antarctic peninsula when the Larsen B shelf collapsed spectacularly in just a month.""The melt water went down into the crevasses and filled them up,"" Dr Monaghan said.""Just like a pothole in the road in wintertime, the water will freeze and expand and break it apart.""He is concerned that a similar situation could now occur on the WAIS.""What we saw after the breakup of Larsen was that the glaciers that were buttressed by the ice shelves sped up tremendously, by a factor of eight. That's a potential concern of the enhanced melt in west Antarctica if the warming trend we find in summer continues.""The authors say they are confident that the data from Byrd Station is representative of the region because the scientific outpost sits on a plateau and conditions are essentially uniform for a considerable distance.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: British Airways reviews 'fuel-tankering' over climate concerns	Make a profit'Questionable'	"British Airways has launched a review into a money-saving practice which increases its greenhouse gas emissions.It follows a BBC investigation exposing ""fuel tankering"" by airlines - in which planes are filled with extra fuel, usually to avoid paying higher prices for refuelling at destination airports.The industry-wide practice could mean extra annual emissions equivalent to those of a large European town.BA now says that using tankering to cut costs ""may be the wrong thing to do"".However, the airline added that it also uses the practice for safety and operational reasons, including helping planes to turn around quickly.BBC Panorama has discovered the airline's planes generated an extra 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year through fuel tankering.Cost savings made on a single flight can be as small as just over £10 - though savings can run to hundreds of pounds.Researchers have estimated that one in five of all European airlines' flights involves some element of fuel tankering.The practice on European routes could result in additional annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that produced by a town of 100,000 people.Critics say the widespread use of the practice undermines the aviation industry's claims that it is committed to reducing its carbon emissions.John Sauven, Greenpeace UK's executive director, told the BBC that fuel tankering was a ""classic example of a company putting profit before planet"".Responding to BA's decision to carry out a review, Mr Sauven, said it showed how the airline industry had been treating climate change ""like a PR problem"".""This is why we need government-enforced reduction targets to ensure airlines take responsibility for the damage their emissions are causing,"" he said.International Airlines Group (IAG), the company that owns BA, says it wants to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability.BA boasts it even prints its in-flight magazine on lighter paper to save weight.Yet BBC Panorama has seen dozens of internal BA documents that show up to six tonnes of extra fuel have been loaded onto planes in this way. It has also seen evidence that Easyjet carries extra fuel in this way.Airlines can save money from the fact that the price of aviation fuel differs between European destinations.BA insiders say the company - like many airlines running short haul routes in Europe - has computer software that calculates whether costs can be saved by fuel tankering.The software will calculate whether there is a cost saving to be made. If there is, crews load up the extra fuel.An example of documents seen by Panorama show that a recent BA flight to Italy carried nearly three tonnes of extra fuel.The extra weight meant the plane emitted more than 600kg of additional carbon dioxide - the same emissions one person is responsible for on a return flight to New York.The cost saving on that trip was less than £40, but the documents Panorama has seen show that it can be even lower than that.IAG made an annual profit of €2.9bn (£2.6bn) in 2018, about 80% of which came from BA.A BA insider described the practice as ""hypocritical"".""For such a big company to be trying to save such small amounts while emitting so much extra CO2 seems unjustifiable in the current climate,"" he said.In response to the claims, the chief executive of BA's parent company, IAG, announced the airline would carry out a review of the practice.On Friday, Willie Walsh told investors that the airline wanted to ensure it was not ""incentivising the wrong behaviour"" from managers.""Because clearly the financial saving would have incentivised us to do fuel tankering,"" he said.""But maybe... this the wrong thing to do and the wrong thing to incentive. So we want to make sure we have our incentives aligned to the right activities so ensure financial sustainability but also environmental sustainability.""BA said it was common practice for the airline industry to carry additional fuel on some flights.The airline said for BA this applies mainly to short-haul destinations ""where there are considerable price differences between European airports"".It said the additional emissions from the airline represented approximately 2% of the total extra emissions generated by all airlines tankering fuel in Europe, based on research by Eurocontrol.BA pointed out that since 2012 all flights within Europe had been covered by the EU Emissions Trading System.It added that from 2020 the company would offset all CO2 emissions from its UK domestic flights.Easyjet said it had reduced the level of tankering in recent years and that it only took place on a tiny proportion of flights for operational and commercial reasons.Eurocontrol, the body which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, has calculated that tankering in Europe resulted in 286,000 tonnes of extra fuel being burnt every year, and the emission of an additional 901,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide.It calculates that the practice saved airlines a total of €265m (£228m) a year.Eurocontrol described the practice as ""questionable"" at a time when aviation is being challenged for its contribution to climate change.Panorama: Can Flying Go Green? is on BBC1 at 20:30 GMT on 11 November."
science	Climate change: Sea ice loss linked to spread of deadly virus		"The decline in sea ice seen in the Arctic in recent decades has been linked by scientists to the spread of a deadly virus in marine mammals.Researchers found that Phocine distemper virus (PDV) had spread from animals in the North Atlantic to populations in the North Pacific.The scientists say the spread of pathogens could become more common as ice declines further.The 15-year study tracked seals, sea lions and otters via satellite.The loss of sea ice in the Arctic has been one of the most visible signs of climate change on the planet over the past four decades. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the ice has been retreating by around 12% per decade between 1979 and 2018.""These sea ice changes in September are likely unprecedented for at least 1,000 years. Arctic sea ice has thinned, concurrent with a transition to younger ice. Between 1979 and 2018, the real proportion of multi-year ice that is at least five years old has declined by approximately 90%,"" the IPCC said in their report on the oceans and the cryosphere published in September.Against this changing background, researchers have investigated the likely spread of the PDV infection, which caused a large number of deaths among harbour seals in the North Atlantic in 2002.But outbreaks of the virus had not been seen in marine creatures in the North Pacific until 2004 when PDV was found in northern sea otters in Alaska.Samples were collected from 2,500 marine mammals in a variety of locations over the course of the study. Satellite data from tagged animals recorded locations. This was correlated with data on sea ice loss.The scientists say that the record melt in August 2002 was followed by widespread exposure and infection with PDV in Steller sea lions in the North Pacific in 2003 and 2004 with over 30% of animals testing positive. PDV prevalence then declined until it peaked again in 2009, following on from the presence of open water routes in 2008.""The loss of sea ice is leading marine wildlife to seek and forage in new habitats and removing that physical barrier, allowing for new pathways for them to move,"" said author Dr Tracey Goldstein, from the University of California, Davis.""As animals move and come in contact with other species, they carry opportunities to introduce and transmit new infectious disease, with potentially devastating impacts.""The authors warn that this trend could continue as they believe climate driven changes in the Arctic ocean will increase. The opportunities for the spread of pathogens will likely grow, with uncertain health outcomes for many species.The study has been published in the journal, Scientific Reports."
science	Climate: 100% organic farming would boost emissions		"A new study suggests that a switch to 100% organic food production in England and Wales would see an overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions.While going fully organic would produce fewer direct emissions than conventional farming, researchers say it would limit food production.As a result more imports would be needed, resulting in up to five times more land being used overseas.Overall emissions could rise by 21% compared to the conventional approach.Farming is generally estimated to be responsible for around 9% of overall UK greenhouse gas emissions, due to the use of artificial fertilisers, but also through emissions of methane from animals and from changes in soil conditions.This new study aims to assess what the impact would be on greenhouse gases if all food production in England and Wales switched to organic.Such a move, the researchers say would see a drop in emissions of about 20% for crops and around 4% for livestock.However, the study predicts significant drops in food production, by around 40% compared to conventional farming.The scientists involved say that decrease is due to smaller crop yields and the introduction of nitrogen-fixing legumes into crop rotations, reducing the amount of land available for production.So crops like wheat and barley would see significant falls in production. For livestock, the numbers of sheep and beef cattle in the scenario would increase but the volume of meat would go down, due to lower carcase weights and longer finishing times under organic management.To meet the demand for food, the study says the shortfall would have to be made up from imports. The researchers assume that a proportion of these imports would have to come from changing land use overseas.Due to significantly lower productivity in other countries, this would require five times the amount of land that is currently used for food in England and Wales.Converting grassland overseas to arable uses also reduces the amount of carbon stored in the soil. In the best case scenario, with the least amount of land change, then overall emissions are comparable to those under conventional agriculture. However, if half the land is changed from grassland, then overall emissions from UK food production would go up by 21%.""We estimate that, were organic farming to be adopted wholesale without any change in diet, we would need nearly six million more hectares of land,"" said one of the authors, Philip Jones, from the University of Reading.""Much of which would need to come from Europe. This has an associated impact on the environment, adding potentially unnecessary food miles and greenhouse gas emissions to our food systems.""The authors acknowledge that there would be significant benefits for cleaner air and water and improved biodiversity under a fully organic farming future. But critics of the study have focused on the fact that it presumes that there will be no change in people's diets.""The assumptions behind the study's conclusion that there will be a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions under organic are fundamentally flawed,"" said Rob Percival of the Soil Association.""The study assumes no change in diet, which is clearly untenable given the global dietary health crisis, and that we would keep diverting most of our cropland to over-production of the wrong things - livestock feed, commodity crops for processed food and biofuels.""The researchers involved in the study responded to these criticisms by underlining the fact that that wasn't the goal of this piece of research.""The assumption about diets is crucial: today's organic consumers are a self-selecting group and not typical of the nation,"" said co-author Dr Adrian Williams from Cranfield University.""Whether a different national diet could be provided by the same land area under all organic production is a different study. This was aimed at understanding limits to production. The study was based on rigorous modelling that had its foundations in establishing the biophysical limits of crop production without manufactured nitrogen.""The research has been published in the journal Nature Communications."
science	Climate change: Big lifestyle changes are the only answer	DietHome heatingTransportAviation	"The UK government must tell the public small, easy changes will not be enough to tackle climate change, warn experts.Researchers from Imperial College London say we must eat less meat and dairy, swap cars for bikes, take fewer flights, and ditch gas boilers at home.The report, seen by BBC Panorama, has been prepared for the Committee on Climate Change, which advises ministers how to cut the UK's carbon footprint.It says an upheaval in our lifestyles is the only way to meet targets.The government has passed a law obliging the country to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.It is ""going further and faster than any other developed nation to protect the planet for future generations"", a government spokesperson told BBC Panorama. ""If we can go faster, we will.""But the new report warns major shifts in policy across huge areas of government activity are needed to keep the public onside.Chris Stark, the Chief Executive of the Committee on Climate Change, tells Panorama the government's plan for cutting emissions is ""not nearly at the level of ambition required"".""Every bit of policy now needs to be refreshed,"" he warned in an interview with BBC Panorama.The new report, called Behaviour Change, Public Engagement and Net Zero, amounts to an extensive ""to-do"" list for government.It says subsidies for fossil fuels have to go and taxes on low-carbon technologies must be cut.At the same time, consumers need to be given far more information on the environmental consequences of their actions.It also urges the government to consider introducing a carbon tax, increasing the prices of carbon-intensive products and activities.It is an ambitious agenda but necessary, the report says, if Britain is to achieve its Net Zero ambitions.""These changes need not be expensive or reduce well-being,"" the report concludes, ""but they will not happen at the pace required unless policy first removes obstacles to change in markets and consumer choice.""Food currently accounts for 30% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK.The report says we need to make a significant shift towards lower-carbon foods, particularly towards more plant-based diets.Producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Some animals, like cows and sheep, also produce and burp up methane - a powerful greenhouse gas.The Committee on Climate Change's official recommendation to government is that a 20% cut in red meat and dairy is needed - the emissions from the other 80% will have to be matched by CO2 that has been captured and stored permanently in order to meet the net zero ambition.The report implies a bigger shift in diets could be needed, and says one way to get people to change will be to emphasise the health benefits this could bring.Another will be to give people much more information on the environmental impact of different foods. It calls for mandatory carbon impact labelling on products, on till receipts, and via shopping websites and apps.Once consumers understand the environmental impact of different food choices, the report argues, government should begin to increase the price of foods that involve high emissions. It suggests this could be done by cutting farm subsidies - more than 70% of which go to livestock - and by raising VAT on these products.Home heating is the single biggest challenge in terms of reducing UK emissions, according to Chris Stark of the Committee on Climate Change. It accounts for 21% of a household's carbon footprint and it will be costly to bring it down.With 30 million homes and 30 years to decarbonise, he argues, ""simple arithmetic"" suggests we need to ""decarbonise"" one million homes every year, starting now.The Behaviour Change report has a whole catalogue of policy recommendations here. As with electric vehicles, decarbonisation of UK electricity creates opportunities for low-carbon heating systems, in particular air-source heat pumps, which extract heat from air outside the home and remove cold air from inside.The report recommends a ""rebalancing"" of the tax and regulatory costs on energy, which currently fall more heavily on electricity than gas.VAT on installation of insulation and low-carbon heating systems should be removed.At the same time, consumers need to be offered a range of incentives to encourage the use of low-carbon technology.According to Chris Stark: ""We haven't even started nibbling away at that heat challenge in any real sense. We need a real plan, and the sooner we do, the cheaper it will be overall.""Transport currently accounts for 34% of a household's carbon footprint.The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling.It says what's needed is a ""modal shift"" to public transport, walking and cycling and believes the public can be encouraged to do this, in part, because of the health benefits it would bring.However, it recognises the UK's progress in decarbonising electricity creates an opportunity for consumers to reduce emissions by switching to electric vehicles and urges greater subsidies for new electric car purchases.Electricity companies need to be encouraged to introduce smart EV charging systems so customers can charge their vehicles when electricity is cheap or when renewable power is plentiful and there needs to be a massive rollout of charging infrastructure along motorways, in towns and in cities.Here, the report says policy-makers need to focus on the 15% of the population that are estimated to take 70% of flights.It calls for an ""Air Miles Levy"" to discourage what it calls ""excessive flying"", something the Committee on Climate Change has already proposed.The idea is to penalise frequent flyers, while not raising prices for people taking an annual holiday.It says air miles and frequent flier reward schemes have to go and passengers need to be given much more information about the emissions generated by flights.The BBC Panorama programme Climate Change: What Can We Do? is on BBC One on Monday 14 October (except BBC Scotland)"
science	Greta Thunberg: What climate summit achieved after outburst	How did world leaders react to Greta?	"The UN’s climate summit has closed amidst cautious praise for its achievements, and bitter condemnation for its failures.On the plus side, more than 60 nations announced they were working on or exploring plans to reduce greenhouse gas to virtually zero.And a similar number said they would definitely boost their climate change ambitions by next year.On the minus side, the campaigner Greta Thunberg blasted leaders for what she called inadequate ambition that risked the future of the young.Germany’s pledge, for instance, was described by critics as totally unfit to meet carbon-cutting targets it’s already promised.And scientists will warn on Tuesday of alarming changes in the natural world, including melting ice and sea level rise beyond previous projections.So it’s possible to describe the UN summit as a cup half full, or a cup three-quarters empty.That said, there were very clear signs that around the world people are waking up to the threat of an over-heating climate.India, China and the EU say they will deliver tougher carbon-curbing plans in 2020.Major ports, banks and shipping lines are committing to ""a moon shot"" of net zero carbon shipping by 2030.Finland aims to become the first industrialised nation to absorb more carbon than it emits.Pakistan, which has planted a billion trees in the last five years, pledged to add 10 billion in the next five.And Greece said it would ban single-use plastics by 2021 and phase out its use of the dirtiest coal by 2028.Critics applauded the efforts but said commitments from major nations were nowhere near what was needed to stabilise the climate.The USA, for instance, was represented by Donald Trump.He wandered in mid-session, briefly took a seat in the audience, checked his watch and sauntered out to attend a rival meeting on religious freedom nearby – all under the furious gaze of Ms Thunberg.She and her colleagues announced they would take law suits against five nations on the grounds that, by jeopardising the climate, they were breaching the rights of children.US President Donald Trump appeared to mock the 16-year-old, tweeting a video of her address, where she warned about impact of climate change, with the comment: ""She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!""French President Emmanuel Macron had measured criticism for Ms Thunberg's ""very radical"" approach, suggesting that anger at his government was misplaced.France, along with Germany, were among the five countries included in the complaint filed to the UN on Monday by Ms Thunberg.""Everything that our young people are doing to fight this is useful - and the not so young too,"" he told Europe 1.""But now they have to focus on those who have most to do, those trying to get in the way of change. I don't feel the French or German government are the ones getting in the way today.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel posted a photo of her speaking with the young activist.Begegnung am Rande des Klimagipfels der Vereinten Nationen: Kanzlerin Merkel trifft die junge Klimaschutzaktivistin @GretaThunberg. --- Encounter on the sidelines of the @UnitedNations Climate Change Summit: Chancellor #Merkel meets young climate protection activist Greta Thunberg. . . . #Klima #Klimaschutz #UN #Klimawandel #Weltklimagipfel #Kanzlerin #Bundeskanzlerin #climatechange #climate #summitA post shared by Angela Merkel (@bundeskanzlerin) on Sep 23, 2019 at 8:45am PDTEnd of Instagram post by bundeskanzlerinHowever, Ms Merkel received criticism from some complaining that Germany is not phasing out coal fast enough.Harjeet Singh, from the charity ActionAid, said: ""This summit was supposed to be a turning point. But we have seen an exceptional lack of commitment from the biggest and richest polluting countries that continue to take trivial measures toward solving a life-or-death crisis.""Kate Hampton, from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, asked: ""If we can’t massively accelerate the many solutions available to us now... then what are we doing, really?""Jennifer Morgan, the head of Greenpeace International, said that ""for the most part, world leaders did not deliver what was needed in New York today.""Attention will now shift to Monaco where the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will warn that global heating is causing an ocean emergency.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
science	Climate change: Rugby World Cup highlights injustice		"Ahead of the Rugby World Cup in Japan, a report from Christian Aid highlights what they term the ""climate injustice"" endured by Pacific island participants.Fiji, Samoa and Tonga face an uncertain future in a warmer world, with rising seas and increased storms.But rich rugby nations like Japan and Australia are blocking aggressive climate action, the study says.Christian Aid says this mirrors the exploitation of the Pacific islands for their best rugby players.The charity says that the Pacific nations are among the countries that have done the least to cause the climate crisis.Carbon emissions per person in Samoa are just 0.7 tonnes every year but the average Australian produces 24 times more, at 16.5 tonnes.According to figures produced by the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors the climate plans of different countries, the three Pacific island nations emit less than 1.8 million tonnes from fossil fuel use between them.For a country like New Zealand the same figure runs to nearly 37 million tonnes.But the islands are now experiencing some of the worst impacts of a changing climate with rising sea levels threatening land and people.The region is likely to see more Category Three and Category Five storms in the coming decades.There are concerns that the movement of people connected to climate change could leave these countries unable to field competitive rugby teams.""As a Pacific island rugby player, tackling the climate crisis is close to my heart,"" said former Samoan international flanker Jonny Fa'amatuainu, who played for Bath as well as clubs in Wales and Japan.""My grandparents and other families who lived in a village on the coast in Samoa moved inland two years ago because of climate change.""""The Pacific islands are the soul of our sport, and we have produced some of the most dynamic and exciting players on the planet. Yet as this report underlines, Samoa, Tonga and Fiji are all facing increased risks from rising sea levels and extreme weather.""Christian Aid says that the way that Pacific islands are treated on climate change reflects the way that world rugby has treated these countries when it comes to their best rugby players.Current stars like England's Manu Tuilagi or Ireland's Bundee Aki both have Samoan connections but have moved to play with richer nations.This is a pathway littered with greats including former internationals Jonah Lomu and Lote Tuquiri, who played for New Zealand and Australia respectively.Rugby's governing body World Rugby had even developed plans for a new global championship which would have excluded teams from Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. In the face of serious opposition the plans were ultimately dropped.The report says that the disdain with which larger countries hold the Pacific islands is also shown when it comes to climate change.At a regional political gathering in August this year, several of the participating countries had pushed Australia to go further on limiting coal to prevent dangerous climate change.However, the Australian deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, brusquely dismissed the concerns.""I also get a little bit annoyed when we have people in those sorts of countries pointing the finger at Australia and say we should be shutting down all our resources sector so that, you know, they will continue to survive,"" he said.""They'll continue to survive because many of their workers come here and pick our fruit.""The World Cup kicks off a couple of days before the UN secretary general António Guterres convenes a special summit in New York to see if countries will commit to greater action on climate change.Japan and Australia won't be allowed to speak at the meeting, according to news reports, as their continued support for coal clashes with Mr Guterres view that no new coal fired power plants should be built.""The main culprits for causing the climate crisis are European nations as well as major coal burners like Australia, the USA and Japan,"" said report author Dr Katherine Kramer.""Not only have they caused the current dire situation, but they are dragging their feet on making the needed transition to a zero-carbon economy.""Former Samoan international Jonny Fa'amatuainu urged players who had connections to the island nations to draw attention to the issue of climate change during the World Cup.""Pacific islanders representing other countries at the Rugby World Cup, I urge you to use that platform to help with the climate challenge,"" he said.Follow Matt on Twitter."
science	Climate change: Polarstern leaves for 'biggest ever' Arctic expedition		"The largest Arctic science expedition ever conceived is under way.The German Research Vessel Polarstern left port late on Friday for the far north where it intends to lock itself in the sea-ice and drift for an entire year.Hundreds of scientists will visit the ship in that time to use it as a base from which to study the climate.A large crowd gathered at the quayside in Tromsø, Norway, to see the vessel off.It is being accompanied on the first stage of its mission by the Russian icebreaker, the Akademik Federov.The pair will head to the Siberian sector of the Arctic ocean to find the most suitable place in the floes for the Polarstern to begin its drift.The MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) project is expected to cost about €130m (£120m/$150m).Its scale means it must be an international effort. RV Polarstern will also be supported by icebreakers from Sweden and China.In deep winter, when these vessels can't pierce the ice to reach the German ship, aeroplanes and long-range helicopters will deliver the supplies and relief teams.MOSAiC's objective is to study all aspects of the climate system in the Arctic. Instrument stations will be set up on the ice around the Polarstern, some of them up to 50km away.The ice, the ocean, the atmosphere, even the wildlife - all will be sampled. The year-long investigations are designed to give more certainty to the projections of future change.Prof Markus Rex from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute in Potsdam is the expedition leader. He said the Arctic was currently warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet but that the climate models were highly uncertain as to how the temperature trends would develop in the coming decades.""We don't have any robust climate predictions for the Arctic and the reason is we don't understand the processes there very well,"" he explained.""That's because we were never able to observe them year round and certainly not in winter when the ice is at its thickest and we can't break it with our research vessels,"" he told BBC News.Embedding in the sea-ice will be done close to 85 degrees North and 130 degrees East.Precise positioning will be important. Modelling of the winds and currents suggests the ship should drift across the top of the planet, getting to within a couple of hundred km from the North Pole, before then being ejected from the frozen floes between northeast Greenland and Svalbard - the Fram Strait.But there is a critical point in this 2,500km journey where, if the ship meanders too far to the west, it could get pulled into the Beaufort Gyre - the great clockwise movement of water and ice in the Arctic. Once caught in this gyre, it would need a huge effort to escape.Something similar to MOSAiC has been tried before.The expedition has definite echoes of the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen's attempt in the 1890s to be the first person to reach the North Pole by drifting in a ship locked in ice.The Canadian Coast Guard vessel Des Groseilliers mounted a drift mission in the late 1990s which became known as Ice Station SHEBA.The Norwegian Polar Institute's Lance vessel undertook a drift expedition in 2015; as did the scientific schooner Tara, which traversed the frozen ocean - again, from Siberian waters to the Fram Strait - in 2006/7.But none of these previous ventures can be compared to the German mission for size and international input.The conditions faced by the scientists over the coming months will be harsh.For half the year the Sun will not rise above the horizon and temperatures will dip down to minus 45C.And the teams working on the ice will have to be on constant alert for predatory bears.""Various scientists have been trained on using night-vision goggles to stand guard for polar bears,"" said Prof Julienne Stroeve from University College London (UCL).""You can't ever go out on the ice without someone being there with a rifle. [The bears] could eventually smell the ship and if they get curious enough they'll come and check us out.""Prof Stroeve is in the seven participating teams from the UK.She will join the Polarstern in mid-winter. Her experiments will assess the accuracy of the radar satellites that are used to map the thickness of the sea-ice from orbit.These spacecraft work by bouncing a microwave pulse off the floes, but there is some uncertainty over where exactly this reflection occurs in a column of snow and ice.If the UCL scientist's suspicions are confirmed during the MOSAiC cruise, it would have implications for our current assessment of the status of Arctic sea-ice.""It would be thinner than what we've been estimating so far,"" she told the BBC's Inside Science programme."
science	Climate change: 'Invest $1.8 trillion to adapt'		"Investing $1.8 trillion over the next decade - in measures to adapt to climate change - could produce net benefits worth more than $7 trillion.This is according to a global cost-benefit analysis setting out five adaptation strategies.The analysis was carried out by the Global Commission on Adaptation - a group of 34 leaders in politics, business and science.They say the world urgently needs to be made more ""climate change resilient"".The commission, led by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, World Bank chief executive Kristalina Georgieva and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, argues that it is an urgent moral obligation of richer countries to invest in adaptation measures that will benefit the world.The report says those most affected by climate change ""did least to cause the problem - making adaptation a human imperative"".Its primary aim is to put climate change adaptation on to the political agenda around the world. And to do this, it sets out ""concrete solutions"" and an economic plan.There are, it says, five things the world should invest in over the next decade:Each of these investments, the commission says, would contribute to what they call a ""triple dividend""- avoiding future losses, generating positive economic gains through innovation, and delivering social and environmental benefits. It is that dividend that the report has valued at $7.1tn (£5.7tn).Commenting on the report's findings, Mr Ban said climate change ""doesn't respect borders"".""It's an international problem that can only be solved with co-operation and collaboration, across borders and worldwide. It is becoming increasingly clear that in many parts of the world, our climate has already changed and we need to adapt with it.""The report calls for ""revolutions"" in understanding, planning and finance - to ""ensure that climate impacts, risks and solutions are factored into decision-making at all levels"". Turning its recommendations into action will be the next endeavour; there will be a further announcement about adaptation plans at the UN Climate Summit in September.Follow Victoria on Twitter"
science	Wild wheat genetics offer climate hope for food crops	'Really exciting'Game changer	"Wild relatives of food crops, such as wheat, host an abundant array of genetic material to help the plants cope with a changing climate.In a study over 28 years showed that populations of wild wheat accumulated ""beneficial mutations"" such as a tolerance to temperature increases.Researchers say the results improve our understanding of how plants are responding to a warming world.The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.""We get some very exciting results,"" explained lead author Yong-Bi Fu, a research scientist from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.""One of which is that we can demonstrate that over 28 years, and 28 generations, you can see the wild relative of the plant accumulate more genetic mutations, and we found that most of the population is still adaptable.""Although the team did find that there were individual specimens in the study that did not survive the conditions associated with a warmer environment, there were others that were able to adapt in such a way that meant they could cope with a warmer world.The study involved 10 populations of emmer wheat in Israel. Dr Fu say that the temperature increase over the three decades amounted to up to two degrees Celsius, which is similar to the increase that the Paris Climate Agreement hopes to limit global average temperatures from rising above pre-industrial levels.""That is really exciting because it means that the population is able to get beneficial mutations,"" Dr Fu told BBC News.""This mutation is crucial, and we can see that we need a lot of effort to protect and conserve the crop's diversity in the wild, natural population.""The team suggested that this insight helped to improve our knowledge of how plants could adapt to future climate change.Dr Fu also highlighted the work of UK scientists who, reporting in Nature Biotechnology, who were developing ways to clone disease-resistance (R) genes from wild relatives in order to engineer broad-spectrum resistance in domesticated crops.He said that a similar approach could be used to clone or use climate-resistant genes from the plants' wild relatives to cross-breed into existing crops in order to make our food crops more climate resilient.Last year, scientists identified the location of 100,000 wheat genes. This was considered to be a ""game changer"" in the race to develop climate change-resistant varieties of the vital primary food crop.The UN has estimated that wheat production needs to be increased by 60% by 2050 in order to feed the population, which by then will have grown to an estimated 9.6 billion.Science is also developing mathematical models to identify genetic material that could help improve food crops' resilience to climate change.Scientists hope the models will speed up the process of identifying traits, such as drought resistance, allowing breeders to grow climate-tolerant crops.Globally, there are 1,700 major agricultural gene banks that house in excess of seven million samples - a vast resource that researchers said made the task of locating the sought-after traits a bit like finding a needle in a haystack.A study in 2016, published in the Royal Society Biology Letters journal, highlighted the risk posed by projected climate change on the world's ability to grow enough food.A US team of researchers found that forecasted shifts in climate by 2070 would occur too quickly for species of grass crops to adapt to the new conditions.The species facing an uncertain future included wheat, corn, rice and sorghum, which provided almost half of the calories consumed by humans."
science	Climate change: Greenland's ice faces melting 'death sentence'	Interactive Qaleraliq glacier, southern GreenlandWhy does Greenland matter?How much is Greenland melting?How rapidly is the ice sheet changing?What's happening to the ice itself?Who's trying to work out what's going on?What do the people of Greenland make of all this?Can anything be done?	"Greenland's massive ice sheet may have melted by a record amount this year, scientists have warned.During this year alone, it lost enough ice to raise the average global sea level by more than a millimetre.Researchers say they're ""astounded"" by the acceleration in melting and fear for the future of cities on coasts around the world.One glacier in southern Greenland has thinned by as much as 100 metres since I last filmed on it back in 2004.Essentially because its ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK and up to 2-3km thick in places. It stores so much frozen water that if the whole thing melted, it would raise sea levels worldwide by up to 7m.No one is suggesting that could happen for hundreds or even thousands of years but even a small increase in the rate of melting in coming decades could threaten millions of people living in low-lying areas.Bangladesh, Florida, and eastern England are among many areas known to be particularly vulnerable to rises in sea level over the course of the century.And although the island of Greenland is remote, stretching from the north of the Atlantic high into the Arctic, its fate could have major implications for the severity of future flooding and may even alter coastlines and force communities to move inland.One of the scientists studying the ice sheet, Dr Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), says he's unnerved by the potential dangers and that coastal planners need to ""brace themselves"".""Now that I'm starting to understand more of the consequences, it's actually keeping me awake at night because I realise the significance of this place around the world and the livelihoods that are already affected by sea level rise,"" he told me.Until recently, the ice sheet was generally in a state of balance - the amount of snow falling in winter was roughly equal to the amount of ice melting in summer.Last year, there was actually a gain in ice but that was relatively unusual. Over the last 30 years, decade-by-decade, Greenland has tended to shed more ice.Either the ice melts at the surface which sends torrents of water down to the surrounding seas or huge chunks of ice break off from the margins and float away as icebergs, gradually to melt.Recent years have seen hundreds of billions of tonnes of ice lost - and a rough guide to the effect on sea level is that 362 billion tonnes of melt raises the average ocean level by a millimetre.That doesn't sound a lot but in 2012 Greenland's loss totalled about 450 billion tonnes, and this year's melt is on course to produce about the same, or even slightly more, with some researchers suggesting it could raise sea levels by up to 2mm.And on top of that you have to factor in the ice melting in Antarctica plus the effect of water expanding as it warms. It all raises the level of the oceans.According to Dr Box, it's the recent increase in the average temperature that's being felt in Greenland's ice: ""Already effectively that's a death sentence for the Greenland ice sheet because also going forward in time we're expecting temperatures only to climb,"" he said.""So, we're losing Greenland - it's really a question of how fast.""I've seen for myself what's happened to one corner of it. Sermilik glacier at the southern end is not one of Greenland's largest but it does rank as one of the fastest-shrinking streams of ice anywhere in the world.To reach it back in 2004, we flew past towering cliffs of ice, the front of the glacier an immense wall of pale grey and blue standing high above the sea.At that time, we accompanied a scientist who checked instruments positioned on the ice and he was stunned to see how the surface of the glacier was dropping by as much as a metre every month.And over the past 15 years, that rate of shrinking has continued so aggressively that now, on a return visit to the same glacier, the ice looks diminished, almost battered, and far less dominating in the landscape.Jason Box is with me and he gathers the latest readings which show that over this summer alone the glacier has shrunk by an estimated 9m. ""That's an astounding rate of loss,"" he said.Since my last visit, the surface of this margin of the ice sheet has lowered by an extraordinary 100m, more than halving in thickness, exposing the remaining ice to the relatively warmer temperatures of lower altitudes.While you might think of the Arctic as a pristine white landscape, the startling feature of the surface is how dirty it looks. Walking on it feels like arriving on the Moon.There are big areas of pale grey and smaller patches that are much darker, covered with what appears to be mud or silt - it's a grim and rather depressing sight.It used to be thought that this darkness was mainly caused by a mix of dust and pollution particles carried on the winds from distant power stations and industrial centres.But since my last visit to Sermilik glacier, scientists have made an important breakthrough in understanding that a major cause of the darkening is in fact biological - algae, microscopically small plants that are flourishing in the melting ice.By turning the surface grey, or black, from its usual bright white, the algae make it less reflective, so it absorbs more of the Sun's rays. This accelerates the warming and in turn leads to even more melting.With the stakes so high for so many millions of people around the world, Greenland is the target of a major international research effort involving satellites, monitoring flights and expeditions on the ice itself.The US space agency Nasa has for years run projects investigating exactly what's causing the ice to melt and what could happen to it in future.Back in 2005, I reported on a Nasa-funded team that made an important discovery about the movement of the ice sheet.Although the great mass of ice looks immobile, it's actually always inching down towards the coast and the team found that this movement doubles in speed in summer - as meltwater from the surface works its way to the bottom of the ice and helps it to slide along.Another revelation is that the ice is not only being melted by the air, as the atmosphere heats up, but also by warmer water reaching underneath the fronts of the glaciers. One Nasa scientist describes the ice as being under a hair-dryer and at the same time also on a cooker.And Jason Box and his colleagues at GEUS run a network of sensors on the ice to record details of the height of the surface and its reflectivity, and how they're changing.The hardest challenge for the scientific community is understanding enough of the mechanisms of the ice sheet to be able to offer reliable forecasts of sea level rise.Dr Masashi Niwano, a researcher with the Japan Meteorological Agency, is just back from a field trip to gather data to try to validate his computer simulations of the ice.""The ice sheet mass is decreasing - that is very certain. And these results affect global sea-level rise - that is also very certain,"" he said.""But maybe there are several physical processes that we don't understand, so developing future projections is very difficult.""There are only 56,000 Greenlanders, and they live in communities perched on the narrow band of land at the edge of the ice sheet which, though close, is usually out of sight.In the village of Narsaq, Christian Mortensen tells me a glacier that was visible when he was younger has since retreated and that icebergs seem to ""break more and more"" into the waters.Warmer conditions would allow more farming and, as we talk, cattle are grazing around us on pasture that's beside bright white chunks of ice bobbing in the sea.But for some young Greenlanders, climate change is becoming a big concern, partly because of the impact of ""their"" ice on other areas of the planet.Naja-Theresia Høegh, who's just finished school, was inspired by the Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg to lead a climate strike in her town of Qaqortoq, a pretty port of brightly painted houses.She describes a boat trip to the edge of the ice sheet where she found it ""astonishing and scary"" that so much water could flow out.""All of that is ending up in our waters, into the sea, and to the rest of the world and, if this continues, it will someday just cover a whole country,"" Ms Høegh explained.Her friend Caroline Hartmann Hansen also talked about her fears over the uncontrolled nature of the melting. ""It's not our fault; it's everyone's,"" she said.If the calculations of Jason Box and his colleagues are right, the ice sheet is already crossing a threshold into an era in which there may still be years with net gains of ice - like last year - but the new normal will see more big losses.Even with a rapid move to cut emissions of warming gases - as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement - Greenland could still see a growing rate of melting, though that could possibly be slowed.So, as with the young Greenland climate campaigners, the scientists feel the need to take action of their own.They have started a scheme to try to absorb some of the carbon dioxide emitted by the flights they take to conduct their research; Jason said he has been criticised for his high carbon footprint and ""feels guilty about it"".Close to the airport at Narsarsuaq, which connects them to the glaciers of southern Greenland, the researchers are planting 6,000 saplings of Siberian larch, a type of tree known to do well in conditions here.They admit that 10 of the trees would need to grow for 60 years to absorb the carbon produced by a return flight from London to San Francisco, but they say it's a start and that if the project later leads to a much larger forest, it might ""make a dent"" in climate change.Meanwhile, as memories of last month's polar heatwave fade, the scientists are leaving ahead of the winter nights, to try to hone their predictions for what the scarred and darkened ice sheet is likely do next.Follow David on Twitter.Produced by David Brown, Robert Magee, Kate Stephens and Nassos Stylianou.

science	Amazon fires: Forest loss challenges Paris climate ambition	Nasa, Brazilian agency on same pageFelled trees the 'real problem'Fire frontiers	"The kind of flaring fires seen in the Amazon forest this year would make the Paris climate target more difficult to achieve, scientists have warned.The treaty aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C above pre-industrial times to avoid dangerous impacts.Tree cover loss from tropical forests is estimated to account for nearly 10% of global carbon emissions.While trees are also said to provide more than 20% of climate solutions.They not only absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, they then lock that carbon away.The world is currently on track for a temperature rise this century of 3C or more, posing a significant challenge to the Paris ambition, according to the World Meteorological Organization.A study last year by Global Forest Watch showed if tropical tree cover loss continued at the rate it was then it would be nearly impossible to keep warming below the pledged 2C.""The fires in the Brazilian Amazon this year certainly pose a challenge for the climate target we have set for ourselves,"" said Doug Boucher, Tropical Forests & Climate Initiative scientific advisor with Union of Concerned Scientists.""The concern is also because Brazil's basic policy of forestry has been turned on its head by the new administration and it might undo the significant progress the country saw in recent years.""The US space agency (Nasa) satellites have confirmed an uptick in fires in the Brazilian Amazon, making 2019 the most active fire year in that region since 2010.Brazil's space agency calculates an 85% rise in fires this year.Initially, the two space agencies appeared to have their own respective takes on the situation, but now they seem very much to be speaking with one voice on the topic.""INPE (the Brazilian agency) also uses active fire data from Nasa's Modis (satellite) sensors to monitor fire activity in the Brazilian Amazon,"" said Douglas Morton, chief of the Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center.""As a result, Nasa and INPE have the same estimates of changes in recent fire activity.""Modis detections are higher in 2019 than at this time last year in all seven states that comprise the Brazilian Amazon.The Brazilian government has sent in the army to fight the fires while it has rejected international aid assistance for the job.But the fire season has just begun and there are fears that the situation could get worse.""Even if the fires are contained now, the real worry is the cut down forests in the region,"" said Mr Boucher.He explained that as soon as trees are felled, they begin to release the carbon dioxide stored in them, whether or not they are set alight.Experts say trees are first felled to clear the forests for agriculture, cattle-ranching or mining in the tropical region.Fires are then set to create the space and to pass the nutrients from burnt vegetation into the soil.Annual gross carbon dioxide emissions from tree cover loss in tropical countries averaged 4.8 gigatonnes per year between 2015 and 2017, according to Global Forest Watch.""If tropical deforestation were a country, it would rank third in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, only behind China and the US.""The Amazon is the world's biggest rainforest and the Brazilian share of the forest is nearly two-thirds.The fires in the Brazilian Amazon basin this year had emitted 228 megatonnes of CO2-equivalent by last week, according to the EU's Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.""The question is how far the frontiers of fire will move and how much of the remaining forests will be degraded by the smoke of these fires,"" said Rod Taylor, global director of the forest programme at the World Resources Institute.""And are they going to break the record of deforestation of the early 2000s?""This is all very worrying in regards to the global climate target.""Across the Brazilian border, rainforest in Bolivia is also burning.The size of the fires is estimated to have doubled since Thursday. About one million hectares - or more than 3,800 square miles - is affected.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently brought out a report highlighting the damage being done to the land surface of the planet.It said human activities were degrading soils, expanding deserts, felling forests, driving out wildlife, and draining peatlands.In the process, the IPCC added, land was been turned from an asset that combats climate change into a major source of carbon.But scientists also say that deforestation presents just a share of the climate problem, and a relatively small one at that.""The fundamental issue in fighting climate change is fossil fuels,"" said Guido van der Werf, a climate scientist with Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam.""It might be too early to draw conclusions about how much of climate damage these fires in the Amazon have done.""And even if we find that out, it will be a few percent of global fossil fuel emissions at most. But, obviously, the Amazon also has many other functions that will suffer from deforestation.""There have been big forest fires in other parts of the world including in Indonesia, Siberia and Europe in recent days."
science	Climate change: Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions'		"People must use less transport, eat less red meat and buy fewer clothes if the UK is to virtually halt greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the government's chief environment scientist has warned.Prof Sir Ian Boyd said the public had little idea of the scale of the challenge from the so-called Net Zero emissions target.However, he said technology would help.The conundrum facing the UK - and elsewhere - was how we shift ourselves away from consuming, he added.In an interview with BBC News, Sir Ian warned that persuasive political leadership was needed to carry the public through the challenge.Asked whether Boris Johnson would deliver that leadership, he declined to comment.Mr Johnson has already been accused by environmentalists of talking up electric cars whilst reputedly planning a cut in driving taxes that would increase emissions and undermine the electric car market.Sir Ian said polluting activities should incur more tax. He believes the Treasury should reform taxation policy to reward people with low-carbon lifestyles and nudge heavy consumers into more frugal patterns of behaviour.It was vital, he said, for the changes to be fair to all parts of society.He also believes Net Zero won't happen unless the government creates a Net Zero ministry to vet the policies of all government departments in the way the Brexit ministry vets Brexit-related decisions.Emissions won't be reduced to Net Zero while ministers are fixed on economic growth measured by GDP, instead of other measures such as environmental security and a relatively stable climate, he argued.Asked why the UK should take the lead when China's emissions are so high, he answered that the Chinese government was very worried about the climate and was taking it very seriously.Sir Ian, a polar expert with a chair in biology at St Andrews University, suggested that the UK was in a good position to show the world how to achieve Net Zero. But he agreed that similar radical action was ultimately needed by all nations.He said that on broader issues the government had produced (or was in the process of producing) impressive strategies on the environment, waste, air pollution, marine and food.Some ministers were enthusiastic to translate these into firm strategies, but they needed support from the public, he said. He confessed that he was not optimistic about the future of the planet because so many systems of government needed to change in a short time.Sir Ian, who leaves Defra on Thursday after seven years in post, said: ""The way we live our lives is generally not good for the environment.""We like to consume things, but the more we consume the more we absorb the resources of the planet.""That means we have to grow those resources or we have to mine them - and in doing that we generate waste. And consumption is going up all the time.""(There's) a conundrum - how do we shift ourselves from consuming? We need to do more about learning to live sustainably. We talk about sustainability but we don't really know what it means.""We need to make major technological advances in the way we use and reuse materials but we (also) need to reduce demand overall - and that means we need to change our behaviours and change our lifestyles.""We certainly won't be able to travel so much as we have in the past, so we have to get used to using modern communications methods.""Moving material round the planet will be more difficult so we'll have to do more with 3D printing; that sort of thing.""We've got to reduce demand to a much greater extent than we have in the past, and if we don't reduce demand we're not going to reduce emissions.""Emissions are a symptom of consumption and unless we reduce consumption we'll not reduce emissions.""It will very rarely come down to a direct message like 'sorry, you can't buy that but you can buy this'. But there will be stronger messages within the (tax) system that make one thing more attractive than the other.""He said UK government strategies were in place on air, environment, resources, waste, marine, and food. ""[Ministers] need to be persuasive.""Asked if he was optimistic about the future of the planet, he said: “We have the intelligence to do it; we have the potential to develop the technologies to do it… I’m doubtful that we have the governance structures to make it happen at the speed it needs to happen at.""Richard Black, from the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said Sir Ian's words were ""somewhat surprising"".He added: ""They appear to contradict the mass of evidence assembled on getting to Net Zero, including the major report from the government's statutory adviser the Committee on Climate Change.""I understand that the Confederation of British Industry, the CBI, accept there will have to be behavioural change to meet Net Zero.A source in the organisation said they were frustrated that government climate policies were currently too weak.Given the very broad nature of Sir Ian's comments, we approached Downing Street for a comment.They declined and passed us back to Sir Ian's department, Defra. But their statement didn't address any of his key questions about governance, leadership and consumption.It said: ""The impact of climate change is clear and demands urgent action from countries around the world. The UK has already shown global leadership by becoming the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050 - but we know there is more to do.""That's why we're reforming farming policy to reward environmental actions, reviewing our food system to ensure it is more sustainable, taking steps to accelerate tree-planting and peatland restoration, and introducing a flagship Environment Bill to address the biggest environmental priorities of our age.""Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
science	Climate change action: We can't all be Greta, but your choices have a ripple effect	How years compare with the 20th Century average	"Is individual action pointless in the face of climate change? Let's not beat around the bush: the simple answer has to be ""yes"".Think about it: what difference does one person forgoing a lamb chop for a lentil bake, deciding to catch the bus rather than take their car, or deciding not to jet off for that autumn getaway in the Balearics make if the other 7,699,999,999 of us humans here on Earth don't do anything?It is a dispiriting conclusion and begs an obvious question, and one that I am sure has already occurred to you: why bother?That's exactly what I asked the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg when I met her last month. Rather than fly to her climate change meetings in New York, Greta had opted to be whisked across the Atlantic on a racing yacht.You remember the boat, the one with the bright blue plastic poo bucket?""The point"", she told me as we bobbed in Plymouth Sound, ""is to create an opinion. By stopping flying, you don't only reduce your own carbon footprint but also that sends a signal to other people around you that the climate crisis is a real thing and that helps push a political movement.""It's a good answer, and, helps explain why this Swedish teenager with pigtails has captured the world's attention.My riposte was maybe a little rude: ""So you're trying to make the rest of us feel guilty?""""No"", she replied calmly, and explained she doesn't think it is her job to tell other people how to live their lives. Rather, her convictions must guide her own behaviour.""I don't fly because of the enormous climate impact of aviation per person.""She acknowledges that she is a special case. ""Many people listen to what I have to say and I appear a lot in media so therefore I influence a lot of people and therefore I have a bigger responsibility because I have a bigger platform.""Previously, she's tried attending conferences by video link but it just doesn't make as much of an impression. ""I think it will have a bigger impact if I and many other young people are actually there"".And judging by the publicity she's getting, she is right.But let's be honest, you're no Greta Thunberg. Even if your choices do ripple out into the world and affect a few other people, your decision to eat a little less meat and turn down the thermostat a notch isn't the clarion call that is about to rally the world to the carbon cutting cause, is it?So, why should individuals take action?That is a question for a philosopher. It's their job to wrestle with debates about what principles should guide our behaviour. And I've got just the man. Prof Peter Singer of Princeton University in the US has been described as ""the world's most influential living philosopher"" by New Yorker magazine.For more on the UK's efforts to tackle CO2 emissions, download the BBC Briefing on energy. Part of a mini-series of downloadable guides to the big issues in the news, it has input from academics, researchers and journalists and is the BBC's response to demands for better explanation of the facts behind the headlines.Prof Singer describes himself as an expert in practical ethics and he is very clear on this question. He doesn't just think we should all take action but argues there is a very strong moral obligation why we must do so.""I think this is one of the great moral challenges of the 21st Century, perhaps the greatest moral challenge"", he says. ""If we are not acting, we are endangering everyone who is alive now and also future generations.""He compares you failing to cut your emissions with you taking a bulldozer and razing the crops of a subsistence farmer in Africa. If you did that, everyone would agree it was wrong, but the greenhouse gases you are responsible for have the same result, he argues.The fact that the cause is invisible gases, and that the effect may be felt in the distant future, doesn't allow each and every one of us to escape the moral obligation to act, Prof Singer insists.The reason is that our right to freedom of action doesn't extend to harming others.Here's another metaphor. Imagine there's a speed limit on a busy shopping street and someone says, ""I'm going to drive down there with my pedal to the metal, but don't worry, there's a good chance I won't kill anyone.""2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years10 warmest years10 coldest years20th Century averageHotterColderSource: NOAAYou wouldn't say that's fine, maintains Prof Singer. ""You'd say no, you don't have any freedom or right to put other people in grave danger of being injured or killed. And that is exactly what we are doing by going ahead with the levels of greenhouse gas emissions we are emitting today.""He says the fact that each of us only plays a minuscule part in the process doesn't make a jot of difference: the obligation on us all to act remains.I bet most of us instinctively recognise that there is real force in these arguments. So, why aren't all of us doing more to cut our emissions already?Time for the insights of a behavioural psychologist. Step up Professor Kelly Fielding of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.We are not the free-thinking independent spirits we imagine ourselves to be, says Prof Fielding.""What we know as social psychologists is that people are very influenced by what others do, even though we don't think we are"", she explains. ""It's a paradox. We think we make our own decisions, but the truth is we look to others for guidance about how we should behave.""When it comes to climate change, the problem is that we just aren't getting the cues we need from our friends and families or, for that matter, from government and business, she says.Yet surveys show that people all over the world are increasingly worried about climate change.A US poll published in June illustrated the point very forcefully. The Reuters survey found that while 69% of Americans wanted the government to take ""aggressive"" action to combat climate change, only a third would be willing to pay an extra $100 to make it happen.What the respondents are saying is: ""Yes, there's a problem, but it's not my job to sort it.""But don't despair, says Professor Fielding. The work of behavioural psychologists suggests It should be possible to flip these findings on their head.If people need cues from others before they change their behaviour, then all we need to do is get some people to start taking action and others will follow, she argues.Which brings us full circle; all the way back to Greta Thunberg and that super-fast carbon-fibre yacht.As Greta says, our actions are important not because they have a material effect on climate change, but because of the message they send to others.What you do influences your friends and family and will help create the political space for governments and businesses to take action. That, in turn, is likely to encourage other people and other countries to do more.And it is happening already. Who would have thought that a company making meat-free burgers could be worth almost $4bn; that the world's most powerful oil cartel would brand climate striking students the ""greatest threat"" to the oil industry; or that climate change would become the key issue for US Democratic presidential candidates?Yes, what I am suggesting is the possibility of a virtuous circle. And yes, this is an argument for us all to be a lot more optimistic about what can be achieved.Because there's another crucial point to remember. Climate change isn't binary: it doesn't just happen or not happen. The crucial question for us all is how much climate change the world will experience.We've already seen a degree of warming. The UN has urged us to try to stay below 1.5 degrees.So here's the thing: the more action we all take, the less our climate will change and the more liveable the world will be for ourselves, our progeny and all the rest of the magnificent abundance that is life on earth.Now come on, that's worth making a few lifestyle changes for, isn't it?"
science	Great auk extinction: Humans wiped out giant seabird	Storybook seabird	"""The great auk will always hold a place in my heart,"" Dr Jessica Thomas says.The Swansea-based scientist spent years piecing together an ancient DNA puzzle that suggests hunting by humans caused this giant seabird's demise.Dr Thomas studied bone and tissue samples from 41 museum specimens during a PhD at both Bangor and Copenhagen University.The findings paint a picture of how vulnerable even the most common species are to human exploitation.About 80cm (2ft 7in) tall, the stubby-winged and bulbous-billed great auks used to be found all across the north Atlantic - from North America through Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia and the UK.""Being flightless, they were always targeted by local people for food and for their feathers,"" says Dr Thomas.""But around 1500, when European seamen discovered the rich fishing grounds off Newfoundland, hunting intensified.""By about 1850, the great auk was extinct; the last two known specimens were hunted down by fishermen on Eldey Island, off the coast of Iceland.""We looked for signatures of population decline [before 1500],"" Dr Thomas said.One of these signatures might be a lack of genetic diversity, suggesting individuals were inbreeding and the species, as a whole, was becoming vulnerable to disease or environmental change.""But their genetic diversity was very high - all but two sequences we found were very different,"" Dr Thomas said.In fact, the genetic timeline Dr Thomas and her colleagues were able to create - published in the journal eLife - showed that, at the time the intensive great auk hunting began, the species was doing ""really well"".""They weren't at risk of extinction at all,"" said Dr Thomas.""It emphasises how vulnerable even the widespread and abundant species are to this intensive, localised pressure.""Follow Victoria on Twitter"
science	Climate change: Marine heatwaves kill coral instantly	'Ghost reefs''Canary in a coal mine'	"Increasingly frequent marine heatwaves can lead to the almost instant death of corals, scientists working on the Great Barrier Reef have found.These episodes of unusually high water temperatures are - like heatwaves on land - associated with climate change.Scientists studying coral after a heat event discovered that extreme temperature rises decayed reefs much more rapidly than previously thought.They published their findings in the journal Current Biology.The study revealed that corals became up to 15% weaker after an extreme heat event, causing some fragments to actually break off from the reef.Dr Tracy Ainsworth, from the University of New South Wales in Australia, worked on the study. She told BBC News that her whole research team, made up of scientists who have worked on corals for more than a decade, was shocked to find them to be ""really brittle"".More typically, temperature rises cause something called coral bleaching - when the coral expels vital algae that lives in its tissues. In those events, the coral itself remains intact. ""But what we're seeing here is that - when the coral tissue dies - it falls and breaks away from the skeleton,"" Dr Ainsworth explained.Commenting on the paper, Dr Laura Richardson, from the School of Ocean Sciences at Bangor University, UK, said that the really significant discovery was ""the rapidity with which the reef skeleton breaks down when you have these severe heatwaves"".Dr Richardson added that the team had documented, for the first time, that severe heatwaves were causing ""almost instant mortality of corals"".Dr Ainsworth said the researchers referred to the resulting, heat-damaged skeletons as ""ghost corals, because there was just nothing left"".""Within about 10 days, those samples that had been exposed to the heatwave... were actually floating.""Such damage to a living coral reef affects the entire marine ecosystem, as another member of the research team, Dr Bill Leggat from the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, warned. ""The scary thing is - this is a new phenomenon that's being caused by climate change. And the impacts are even more severe than we had thought,"" he told BBC News.Dr Ainsworth added that this could be ""the canary in the coal mine"" for these ecosystems. She said the findings were a strong warning that ""things are going wrong on some reefs around the world"".Commenting on the research, Dr James Guest from Newcastle University in the UK, who has been studying coral reef habitats for more than 15 years, said: ""It's hard to know just how much we have to keep saying that this is a big problem before policy-makers decide to do something about it.""During the high temperature event the team studied, which occurred on the Great Barrier Reef between 2016 and 2017, there was an estimated loss of a third to half of the corals. ""If you imagine losing 30-50% of the trees in England over the course of two years, it would be quite astounding."" said Dr Guest.As well as being vital habitats for marine life, coral reefs are vital to people in coastal communities, who depend on them for fishing, tourism and beach protection. The scientists say urgent action is needed to protect these vulnerable ecosystems from the impact of climate change.Duncan Mascarenhas is a sports scientist based at Edinburgh Napier University and is a British Science Association media fellow at BBC News"
science	Climate change: UK government 'like Dad's Army'	UK going backwards?	"The UK has been dealt a ""brutal reality check"" on its climate change ambitions, environmentalists have said.The government's official climate change advisers warn ministers are failing to cut emissions fast enough, and adapt to rising temperatures.Committee on Climate Change chair John Gummer likened them to the hapless characters in 1970s comedy Dad's Army.The government said it would soon set out plans to tackle emissions from aviation, heat, energy and transport.The prime minister recently announced that the UK would lead the world by cutting almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - so-called net zero.Theresa May also aspired to the UK hosting a hugely important global climate summit next year.But the CCC said that the UK was already stumbling over measures needed to achieve the previous target of an 80% emissions cut.Its report says new policies must be found to help people lead good lives without fuelling global warming.Policies are needed to ensure that people living in care homes, hospitals and flats can stay cool in increasingly hot summers.And ministers must show how funds will be found to protect critical infrastructure - like ports - from rising sea levels.The committee said unless it delivered on these issues, the government would not have the credibility to host a global climate change summit of world leaders, likely to be held in the UK next year.Doug Parr from Greenpeace UK said: ""This is a truly brutal reality check on the government's current progress in tackling the climate emergency.""It paints the government as a sleeper who's woken up, seen the house is on fire, raised the alarm and gone straight back to sleep"".The committee's deputy chairwoman Baroness Brown told BBC News: ""There's an increasing sense of frustration that the government knows what it has to do - but it's just not doing it.""The committee said the government's 2040 goal to eliminate emissions from cars and vans was too late.New ways must be found to nudge some drivers into walking, cycling and taking public transport, it believes.There's palpable annoyance from the committee that their recommendations are often ignored.In the list of actions needed to meet emission targets, such as improving insulation of buildings and increasing the market share of electric vehicles, the committee found only seven out of 24 goals were on track.Outside the power and industry sectors, only two indicators were on track.Committee chairman Lord Deben, the former agriculture minister John Gummer, said: ""The whole thing is really run by the government like a Dad's Army. We can't go on with this ramshackle system.""At current rates of global emissions cuts, the world may be heading for a temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of this century - but the report says England appears unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature.It warns that the UK is failing to insulate itself from the knock-on effects of climate change overseas, such as colonisations by new species, changes in the suitability of land for agriculture or forestry, and risks to health from changes in air quality driven by rising temperatures.The report says: ""Last June, we advised that 25 headline policy actions were needed for the year ahead. Twelve months later, only one has been delivered by the government in full.""It complains that in some ways the UK is going backwards.Green space in parks and gardens cools cities and helps reduce flood risks. But as more homes are crammed into cities, green spaces have shrunk from 63% of urban area in 2001 to 55% in 2018.Heat magnifies the production of pollutants, so more people are expected to suffer breathing problems.Meanwhile, the proportion of hard surfaces in towns has risen by 22% since 2001, even though they make floods worse.The report says the government's planning should consider the risks that the world may warm by as much as 4C by 2100.It warns that the new net zero target requires an annual rate of emissions reduction that is 50% higher than under the UK's previous target.It is 30% higher than what's been achieved on average since 1990 - a period when the UK has benefited from a relatively simple switch from coal to gas for electricity.The report says: ""The need for action has rarely been clearer. Our message to government is simple: 'Now, do it.'""A government spokesman said the UK had cut emissions faster than any other G7 country and set a strong example for other countries to follow.""We know there is more to do - and legislating for net zero will help to drive further action, as well as further measures to protect the environment from extreme weather, including flood protection, tree planting and peat-land management,"" the spokesman added.Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the government efforts were lagging far behind what is required.She said the report was a ""remarkable, damning assessment"".Friends of the Earth's Mike Childs said: ""Theresa May keeps talking about the need for climate action, while giving the green light to fracking and more roads and runways.""Reining in the rogue Department for Transport is crucial. Billions of pounds are being squandered on gas-guzzling developments, while trams, trains, buses and cycling are starved of investment.""Climate change policy is devolved. Scotland faces slightly tougher targets for emissions cuts than England, and Wales faces a slightly more lax target. Northern Ireland polices are not yet determined.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
science	Climate change: UK's 10 warmest years all occurred since 2002		"The top 10 warmest years on record in the UK have all occurred since 2002, a new analysis from the Met Office says.Its State of the UK Climate report shows that 2014 remains the warmest year in a temperature sequence now dating back to 1884.Despite last summer's blistering heat, 2018 only places as the seventh warmest year on record - as the statistic is based on temperatures all year round.When it comes to the coldest years, the most recent in the top 10 was in 1963.The patterns of warm and cold years in Britain are a clear signal of climate change, say scientists.It comes after the Met Office confirmed this week that the UK's hottest temperature ever - 38.7C (101.7F) - was recorded on Thursday in Cambridge.The Met Office scientist who compiled the new analysis says that the clustering of all the warmest years in the first two decades of the 21st Century is what would be expected in a changing climate.""It's certainly what we'd expect to see. Our climate in the UK has warmed at a very similar amount to the global temperature rise, so just under 1C for the UK,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy.""Under that warming climate, we would expect that the hot extremes would tend to cluster in more recent times and the colder extremes are further back in time.""Although we do still experience colder extremes like 'the beast from the east' last spring, generally speaking the story we have is that overall it's the warmer events and these higher temperatures that are dominating.""This is the fifth such report published by the Met Office and, thanks to a project to digitise historic weather records, it has now been extended to cover the years back to 1884.Previous versions only stretched back to 1910.This has not made any difference to the record of the UK's warmest years, but it has significantly changed the record of the coldest years, with five of the 10 chilliest occurring in the 1880s or 1890s.There is a significant difference between the coldest year in the sequence and the hottest - with the average temperature for 1892 just over 7C, while the average for the warmest saw an average approaching 10C.Colder years have been in short supply since the turn of the millennium, with 2010 being the chilliest, and that only ranks at 22nd on the cold list.Again it is not a measure of the most severe winters but of the lowest average temperature, based on levels measured all year round.""We expect that extremely cold years nowadays like 2010 aren't as extreme as the cold years in the past, but the warm years are more extreme than the equivalent from 50-100 years ago,"" Dr McCarthy told BBC News.There's no huge surprise here.For years the Met Office has been saying that its data shows unmistakeable evidence of rising temperatures, both in the UK and worldwide, driven by the gases given off by human activity.This latest analysis is another way of highlighting what our warming climate means. It won't be the end of deep freeze winters or of chilly summers - our island weather is too variable for that.But the report suggests that the records over the past century or more reveal a very clear pattern of change. An obvious question is: Don't we know this all already? And you'd be right. But each passing year offers another chance for climate scientists to search for trends and to share their findings.I'm old enough to remember the last of Britain's top 10 cold winters - back in 1963 - and everyone's becoming more familiar with the warmer conditions of recent years.2018 was the third sunniest year on record in a series dating back to 1929.Despite this, and the very hot summer weather that tied the record for the warmest three-month period, the overall temperature for the year only placed it in seventh place in the list of the top 10 hottest.One big factor dragging the year down was the so-called beast from the east, when a record low temperature was recorded on 1 March.Another may have been the snow, with the UK recording the most significant snowfall since 2010.When it comes to rain, six of the 10 wettest years in the UK have occurred since 1998.Over the last decade, our hot and cold seasons have been getting wetter than the long-term average with the summers seeing 13% more rain while the winters going up by 12%.""It is also interesting that a high number of the wettest years in the UK occurred recently, showing that climate change starts to show up even in highly variable aspects of weather such as rainfall,"" said Prof Gabi Hegerl from the University of Edinburgh who wasn't involved with the study.""Climate change already matters to the UK and makes a difference.""Despite the UK breaking the record for its warmest day last week, the Met Office researchers are reluctant to speculate on where 2019 might end up in the hottest years list.""It's been something of a mixed bag so far this year.

science	Climate change: Used cooking oil imports may fuel deforestation	Counting double	"Imports of a ""green fuel"" source may be inadvertently increasing deforestation and the demand for new palm oil, a study says.Experts say there has been a recent boom in the amount of used cooking oil imported into the UK from Asia.This waste oil is the basis for biodiesel, which produces far less CO2 than fossil fuels in cars.But this report is concerned that the used oil is being replaced across Asia with palm oil from deforested areas.Cutting carbon emissions from transport has proved very difficult for governments all over the world. Many have given incentives to speed up the replacement of fossil-based petrol and diesel with fuels made from crops such as soya or rapeseed.These growing plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and so liquid fuel made from these sources, while not carbon-neutral, is a big improvement on simply burning regular petrol or diesel.In this light, used cooking (UCO) oil has become a key ingredient of biodiesel in the UK and the rest of Europe. Between 2011 and 2016 there was a 360% increase in use of used cooking oil as the basis for biodiesel.Because UCO is classed as a waste product within the EU, UK fuel producers are given double carbon credits for using it in their fuels. This has sparked a boom in demand for used cooking oil that is so great it is being met in part with imports from Asia.In the UK, the most common feedstock source of biodiesel between April and December 2018 was Chinese UCO, totalling 93 million litres. In the same period, used cooking oil from UK sources was used to produce 76 million litres of of fuel.Now a new study, from international bioeconomy consultants NNFCC, suggests that these imports may inadvertently be making climate change worse by increasing deforestation and the demand for palm oil.The problem arises because used cooking oil in some parts of Asia is not classed as a waste product and is considered safe for consumption by animals.The report's authors are concerned that since it is more profitable to sell Asian UCO to Europe for fuel rather than feed it to animals, it is likely being replaced by virgin palm oil which is cheaper to buy.""Although correlation does not necessarily equate to causation, the available evidence indicates that palm oil imports into China are increasing, in line with their increasing exports of used cooking oils,"" the report states.Between 2016 and 2018, palm oil imports into China rose by 1 million tonnes, an increase of more than 20%.""As soon as that point is reached where you can sell used cooking oil for more than you can buy palm oil, it's a no brainer,"" said Dr Jeremy Tomkinson who co-authored the report for NNFCC.""What you are going to do if you're in Asia, you're going to sell as much UCO as you can to the EU and buy palm oil and pocket the difference.""Demand for palm oil has led to large-scale deforestation and the loss of natural habitats across Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Between 2010 and 2015, Indonesia alone lost 3 million hectares of forest to continued expansion of palm oil cultivation.Each hectare of forest that's converted to palm oil releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 530 people flying economy class from Geneva to New York according to a recent study.Most of the used cooking oil that's already imported is made from palm. But it's the extra demand from Europe, say the authors, that is likely to be fuelling deforestation.""It's irrelevant if the virgin palm is going into the biodiesel or into the animals,"" said Dr Tomkinson.""If we weren't pulling that resource out of the market, no new resource would be falling into it.""The UK government rejects the idea that imports are increasing demand for palm oil. The Department for Transport says that there is no evidence showing a causative link between policies on waste-derived biofuels and increased use of virgin oils.The department argues that they have worked hard to ensure that such indirect effects do not happen.""Biofuels are a key way of achieving the emission reductions the UK needs and we have long been at the forefront of action to address the indirect effects of their production, including pushing the EU to address the impact of land use change,"" a spokesperson said.""Last year alone biofuels reduced CO2 emissions by 2.7 million tonnes - the equivalent of taking around 1.2 million cars off the road.""One of the key elements that's making used cooking oil so valuable is the fact that producers in the EU are given double the number of carbon credits for using the waste material. While the EU allows all countries to ""double count"" carbon credits for UCO, the UK is one of the few countries to put this into practice.Oil importers say the ""double counting"" is vital in preventing even more palm oil from entering the European market.""Biodiesel made from waste oil is more expensive to produce; it has higher production costs,"" said Angel Alvarez Alberdi from the European Waste-to-Advanced Biofuels Association.""If we don't have a policy incentive of double counting then under normal market conditions you will have the cheapest available option and that is conventional palm based biodiesel that would still be able to reach the EU.""However, the report authors say that the policy has other dangers, not just because it may be driving up demand for palm oil in Asia but because it may also be stymieing development among other alternative fuel producers, such as ethanol in the UK.The authors want the government to review the practice and perhaps end the double credit for imported oil""If it comes from outside of the EU don't let it double count unless you put in increased levels of scrutiny to verify it's not having an impact on land use,"" said Dr Tomkinson from NNFCC.""If you don't do that then you only get a single credit for that used cooking oil.""Environmental groups are also concerned about the potential impact that UK and EU imports of UCO are having.""Making biodiesel from imported UCO is no longer the environmental good it was once perceived to be,"" said Greg Archer, UK director of the environmental group Transport and Environment.""There are real concerns some of these oils may not be genuinely 'used' or they may be indirectly causing deforestation. Governments need to scrutinise the source of UCO far more closely and require organisations certifying biofuel feedstocks to undertake far more rigorous and extensive checks.""Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc"
science	Climate change: 'No brainer' fuel change to cut transport carbon	Boost for business	"Adding more ethanol to the UK's fuel mix would cut carbon by as much as taking 700,000 cars off the roads, according to a group of MPs.The All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Bioethanol says the swift introduction of E10 fuel would also help the £1bn British biofuel industry.E10 is a mixture of 10% ethanol with 90% petrol, double the current permitted maximum.The MPs say that Brexit has distracted the government from taking action.One of the unintended consequences of 2015's diesel emissions scandal has been a jump in the sales of petrol cars, with a knock-on effect on sales of the fuel.This has contributed to the first increase in emissions of CO2 from new cars in two decades recorded in 2017.A significant plank of the government's plan to reduce carbon on the roads has been the introduction of biofuels made from crops, which soak up CO2 as they are grown.At present, ethanol made from wheat or sugar beet is blended into petrol to a maximum of 5%.The report's authors say that while electric cars and vehicles are the long-term solution to emissions from transport, E10 represents a big advance that could be achieved right now.""For many reasons it is absolutely a no-brainer,"" said Nic Dakin MP, the chairman of the all-party group.""On the environmental front, it's a cleaner, greener fuel at a time when we're trying to address air pollution and tackle climate change.""Cars aren't going to all switch to battery power overnight and if they did there isn't the capacity in the National Grid to power all of our transportation.""This must be a top priority for the government and we renew our call for a mandate to introduce E10 by 2020 at the latest.""In other European countries, the change to E10 has been fully embraced. France introduced the fuel in 2009 and last year it was the largest volume petrol grade sold, with 47% of the market.Germany, Belgium and Finland have also introduced E10, with other countries including China and India set to do the same. In Brazil the minimum ethanol content is now 27%.The report says that without the introduction of E10 fuel the UK's bioethanol producers, based in the North of England, will struggle to survive.Last September Vivergo, one of the three main producers of the biofuel announced it would close its facility on Humberside with the loss of 150 jobs.The introduction of E10 would likely secure and strengthen the industry which has the potential to support approximately 6,000 jobs in the UK.""We built a plant in 2010, we've had four periods when the plant has been offline, and the reason for that is lack of demand,"" said Grant Pearson from Ensus, one of the UK's three ethanol production companies.""We expected that demand would be at least twice what it is, and that move from E5 to E10 would just get us back on track.""Last year the government issued a consultation on the idea of increasing this to 10%, but since then nothing has happened, a decision that MPs describe as ""baffling"" and likely due to the distraction of Brexit.""It is bonkers that the Department of Transport has yet to publish its consultation on the introduction of E10,"" said Nic Daikin.""The British bioethanol industry is in a state of collapse, and ministers can not allow the fog of Brexit to distract them any longer from saving a £1bn industry that will not only make our cars cleaner and greener, but provide thousands of green jobs in the North and prove that the government is serious about championing the green economy.""In response, a Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We are committed to supporting cleaner and greener fuels, and we recognise the important role they have to play in decarbonising transport.""""Following our call for evidence on E10, we intend to publish our next steps in due course.""Critics of the introduction of E10 say that it is not certified to run in some older cars, principally those manufactured before 2000.The report says that this threat is minimal and that there is no evidence from Europe or the US where E10 is widely used of the fuel causing any significant damage to to any vehicle manufactured before the turn of the century.Indeed the report says that the fuel industry has ""given express assurances that were E10 to be mandated, motorists would still be able to purchase E5 (as octane 98) at many forecourts. Thus any older cars which are not expressly warrantied for E10 can still have access to fuel that is compatible with their engines.""Other critics of the switch are worried that going for extra ethanol in the mix might push up prices on the forecourt.""The cost impact is minuscule,"" said Grant Pearson.""The price of ethanol compared to petrol varies over time, we've had periods where ethanol has been cheaper than petrol. There's a tiny reduction in terms of potential mileage but its less than 1%, so depending on how heavy your shoe is you wouldn't see it in the mileage that your are doing.""If the bioethanol industry flounders, the report says, the UK would likely have to increase imports of biofuel from overseas, including used cooking oil from China, which is likely boosting the use of palm oil from deforested lands.Follow Matt on Twitter @MattMcGrathBBC"
