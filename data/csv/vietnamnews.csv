1	'Việt Nam’s diplomacy achievements in 2019'	"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Bình Minh. –\xa0 VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI – While the world saw profound global instability in 2019, the Pacific – Asia area proved to be the leading region in terms of economic integration, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Bình Minh has said.\nWriting on the achievements of Việt Nam’s diplomacy sector in 2019 as the year ended, Minh said while the global economy has slowed and\xa0conflict between globalisation and protectionism\xa0has become more fierce, the Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN) has stayed united and proved its\xa0important role in the policies of many major countries.\nFor Việt Nam,\xa02019 was a year with many achievements of the diplomatic sector in implementing the Party’s policies on international integration and economic diplomacy.\nThe country effectively implemented the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). After just a year in operation, the first new generation FTA in the world has helped Việt Nam's export turnover to members such as Japan, Canada and Mexico increase significantly compared to 2018.\nViệt Nam\xa0signed the Việt Nam - European Union Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) with the European Union and the Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA) and\xa0completed negotiations of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP).\nThe Global\xa0Competitiveness\xa0Index (GCI) 2019, issued on October 9 by the World Economic Forum (WEF), revealed Việt Nam had jumped 10 places from last year to 67, making it the most improved country of 2019.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) pledged to Việt Nam surpassed US$38 billion this year, marking a 10-year high and representing a year-on-year increase of 7.2 per cent. Việt Nam also welcomed more than 18 million international tourists in 2019.\nBesides economic integration, integration in\xa0politics - diplomacy, defence - security and\xa0culture - society was also strongly promoted.\nViệt Nam participated in joint maritime exercises for the first time with the US in the framework of ASEAN, signed\xa0a Framework Participation Agreement with the European Union that will facilitate\xa0Việt Nam’s\xa0contribution to the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations, and\xa0ratified Convention No\xa098 of the International Labour Organisation.\nThe country sent the second level-2\xa0field hospital to join the UN Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan after the first field hospital successfully completed its mission.\nAchieving second position at the 30th Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines recently and other outstanding achievements also confirmed Việt Nam's new position in the regional and international sports map.\nThe country's achievements in multilateral relations in 2019 also boosted its growing international status.\nEarly this year, Việt Nam hosted the second summit between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the US, a move highly praised by the international community for efforts to contribute to peace in the world.\nWinning 192 out of 193 votes on June 7, Việt Nam\xa0became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2020-21 term. This will\xa0be the second time that the country has held this post, demonstrating its wish to contribute to world security and peace and proving Việt Nam\xa0is a\xa0responsible member of the UN.\nIn terms of bilateral relations, Việt Nam maintained stable and positive relations with all countries. Leaders of Party, State,\xa0Government and National Assembly made 17 official\xa0visits abroad and received 22 high-ranking delegations paying a visit to Việt Nam, which helped gain\xa0important outcomes with\xa0partners.\nTo date, Việt Nam has established a network of 30 strategic partners and comprehensive partners.\nThe diplomatic sector contributed effectively to the defence of the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity, both on land and at sea. Việt Nam and Cambodia have signed and ratified two legal documents recognising 84 per cent of demarcation results, creating an important foundation\xa0to build a border of peace and development.\nIn the most complicated and serious situation in the East Sea in the past five years, Việt Nam properly assessed the situation, gave prompt\xa0reactions and\xa0dealt with the situation strongly to defend the country’s legitimate rights and interests.\nAt the same time, Việt Nam has also\xa0been working with ASEAN members and partners to build the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC)\xa0in accordance with international law.\nThe year 2020 has a very important meaning, when Việt Nam prepares for the Socio-Economic Development Strategy from 2021 to 2030 and celebrates 90 years of the establishment of the Việt Nam Communist Party, 75 years of the country’s establishment and 130 years of late President Hồ Chí Minh’s birthday, Minh said.\nIt is also important because Việt Nam will take on Chair of ASEAN 2020 and non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2020-21 term, holding the two responsibilities together for the first time.\nThis will be an opportunity for Việt Nam to take advantage of bilateral relations with other countries, creating new impetus for enhancing the role and position of the country.\nWith the theme 'Cohesive and Responsive'\xa0for the ASEAN Chairmanship 2020, and\xa0'Việt Nam: Trusted Partnership for Peace and Sustainability'\xa0as the non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Việt Nam will work\xa0with international friends and partners to foster multilateralism, the rule of law and enhance ASEAN’s centrality role in the regional structure, and further enhance\xa0co-operation between ASEAN and the UN.\nWith that spirit in mind, Việt Nam will work to affirm its important bridging role between ASEAN and the UN, contributing to the cause of promoting peace, co-operation and development in the region and in the world. – VNS"	politics-laws

Son received his\xa0life sentence in summing up. The Hà Nội People’s Court said that his family had returned the $3 million to the State\xa0on Friday so the proposed death penalty was not necessary.\nSon’s deputy\xa0Trương Minh Tuấn, who went on to become minister after the scandal broke, was sentenced to 14 years in prison including eight years for taking bribes and six years for violating regulations on "the\xa0management and use of public capital, causing serious consequences".\nPhạm Đình Trọng, former head of the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC)’s Department of Enterprise Management, was sentenced to five years in prison.\nLê Nam Trà, former chairman of MobiFone\'s board of directors, was sentenced to 23 years in prison including 16 years for taking bribes and seven years for violating management regulations.\nCao Duy Hải, former general director of MobiFone, was sentenced to 14 years in prison including 10 years for taking bribes and four years for violating the management regulations.\nOther defendants found guilty of violating regulations on the management and use of public investment capital, causing serious consequences, included Võ Văn Mạnh, director of AMAX Valuation and Investment Consultancy Company (three and a half years), and his employee\xa0Hoàng Duy Quang\xa0(three years).

The deal was concluded to have caused losses of approximately VNĐ6.47 trillion ($281.5 million) to the State and triggered a police investigation soon after.\nIt consequently led to the arrests of a number of high and middle level officials of the Ministry of Information and Communications, leaders of MobiFone and AMAX investment consultancy and valuation company.\nHà Nội People’s Court on Monday opened a trial against 14 defendants in the case, which is set to last until the end of this month.\nThe prosecutors also proposed jail terms of between two and six years for another nine defendants who are accused of breaches in public investment management causing severe consequences. — VNS\nThe People's Procuracy on Friday announced their punishment proposals for 14 defendants standing trial in the AVG case. — VNA/VNS Photo"	politics-laws
18	'Army stands firmly under Party’s leadership: top leader'	'General Secretary and President Nguyễn Phú Trọng inspects military equipment on exhibition at the political-military conference in 2018. — VNA/VNS Photo Trí Dũng\nHÀ NỘI The Việt Nam People’s Army (VPA) has always served as the core force to, together with the Party and the people, achieve accomplishments in national liberation and construction and defence throughout its 75-year history, Party General Secretary and President Nguyễn Phú Trọng has said.\nIn an article published for the 75th founding anniversary of the VPA (December 22, 1944), the Party and State leader stressed those accomplishments were the results of multiple factors, of which the Communist Party of Việt Nam’s (CPV)’s comprehensive, absolute and sound leadership is a decisive one.\nTrọng, who is also Secretary of the Central Military Commission, says in the article the Party has flexibly applied Marxism-Leninism and President Hồ Chí Minh’s thought to build a new-style army that suits the specific situation in Việt Nam. The Party also affirmed the inevitable need to turn the army into the key force in the cause of national liberation and defence.\nDuring the resistance war against the invading French colonialists, the VPA won glorious achievements, including the 1953-1954 Winter-Spring Campaign with the peak of the Điện Biên Phủ victory that forced the French government to sign the Geneva Accords in 1954, ending the war and restoring peace in Indochina.\nThis was the first time in contemporary history that an army equipped with rudimentary weapons defeated a professional counterpart, which marked the beginning of the collapse of colonialism and provided a strong boost to the national liberation movement around the world, he stressed.\nIn the anti-US war, the VPA, along with the entire Party and people, consecutively foiled war strategies. Such great victories won by the Vietnamese army and people drove the US to sign the Paris Peace Accords that committed to put an end to the war, and created a premise for the Spring General Offensive and Uprising in 1975, culminating with the historic Hồ Chí Minh Campaign, leading to the full liberation of South Việt Nam, national reunification and the end of the 30-year resistance war, the leader said.\nNot only fighting to liberate their own country, with a pure proletarian international spirit, the VPA has also stood side by side with armed forces of Laos and Cambodia in the fight against common enemies.\nRight after the anti-US war ended, the VPA immediately embarked on another fierce battle to protect the national border and performed its international mission of helping Cambodian people escape genocide.\nDuring the cause of national construction and defence in the renewal period, the army has carried forward its role in combat and production, while serving as an advisor of the Party and the State in military, national defence and drafting strategic guidelines for national protection.\nAt the same time, it has made outstanding performance in defence diplomacy, contributing to building a peaceful and stable environment for national building and development, Trọng says.\nOver the past 75 years, in any revolutionary period, even the toughest time, the CPV has maintained its comprehensive, absolute and direct leadership over the VPA.\nThis is an important factor for the success of national building and safeguarding, and also the decisive factor for the growth, combat capacity and triumph of the army, he says.\nThe Party General Secretary points out that unforeseeable and complex developments are lying ahead in the regional and global situation, along with increasing traditional and non-traditional security challenges and fierce strategic competition between world powers.\nThe East Sea (known as the South China Sea) issue also contains many unexpected risks, he says, adding that the trend of connectivity, globalisation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution have been exerting profound impacts on all countries in various spheres.\nInside the country, the macro economy has been stabilised but not quite sustainably. Although Việt Nam’s internal strength has been consolidated and its prestige and position in the international arena have been rising, the country still faces a range of difficulties and challenges.\nThe Party leader also called attention to the fact that hostile forces have stepped up the so-called “peace process,” “self-evolution,” “self-transformation,” “non-politicisation,” and “civilisation” of the army, especially before, during and after all-level Party congresses and the 13th National Party Congress.\nThe cause of national construction and defence goes with heavy requirements, with the struggle to safeguard the country’s sovereignty over its sea, islands and territorial integrity forecast to be a tough, long-term and complex one.\nIn 2020 and the years to come, the VPA will have to take on tougher tasks, he said, requiring the Party to maintain and enhance its absolute, direct and comprehensive leadership over the VPA in order to help the army complete its missions.\n“We believe that with its 75-year history of building and fighting under the Party leadership, the VPA will continue to write more glorious historical pages for the nation,” he concludes.

Việt Nam\xa0was the first country to sign a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union, of which Russia is a key member. Additionally, bilateral investment had\xa0continued to expand\xa0with many large projects, including oil and gas, according to the NA leader.\nShe added that co-operation in defence and security had\xa0increased while people-to-people exchanges had\xa0also been enhanced, and more young Vietnamese had\xa0chosen Russia to study in. Meanwhile, Việt Nam remained\xa0a popular destination for Russian tourists with more than 600,000 people from Russia visiting the Southeast Asian nation in 2018, and that\xa0figure reached\xa0500,000 in the first nine months of this year.\nIt was hard to find another\xa0country that the Vietnamese people held\xa0such a profound sentiment for like Russia, and this was shown not only through political and economic partnerships, but also cultural exchanges and connectivity, Ngân noted.\nThe Vietnamese leader went on to say the sound relations between\xa0the two countries had helped parliamentary co-operation to grow.\nDuring a\xa0trip to Việt Nam in December 2018 by Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav V. Volodin, the two sides inked a co-operation agreement on the establishment of an inter-parliamentary co-operation committee between the Vietnamese NA and the State Duma of Russia. This committee was the highest form of co-operation of the Vietnamese legislature, Ngân said.\nShe emphasised that amid complex developments and potential risks in the international arena, the continued enhancement of the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership was not only an objective requirement but also the aspiration of the two countries’ leaders and peoples. It also ensured the success of each nation’s reforms and development, while contributing to peace, stability, co-operation, development and prosperity in the region and the world.\nNgân underlined Việt Nam’s appreciation of Russia’s stance on the East Sea issue, which was supporting the peaceful settlement of disputes on the basis of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to help maintain peace, stability, freedom, safety and security of navigation and overflight in the East Sea, as well as supporting the full and serious implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea and the early finalisation of a Code of Conduct in the waters.\nShe repeated Party General Secretary,\xa0State President Nguyễn Phú Trọng’s statement that Việt Nam’s consistent policy was to always attach importance to and further strengthen its\xa0comprehensive strategic partnership with Russia, and considered Russia one of its\xa0leading partners. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin also described Việt Nam as a leading partner of his country in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs Chair of ASEAN and the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) in 2020, Việt Nam would\xa0continue reinforcing the strategic partnership between ASEAN and Russia and help promote Russia’s voice and stature in the region, she noted, adding that as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2020-21, it would\xa0also work\xa0closely with Russia.\nThe NA leader expressed her belief that the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership would continue to develop\xa0and overcome challenges\xa0to match their long-standing friendship.\nIn that process, their parliaments would\xa0continue to play\xa0a crucial role in forming\xa0favourable legal frameworks, increasing supervision and stepping up the implementation of co-operation agreements and projects. They would\xa0also co-ordinate more closely at international inter-parliamentary forums for the sake of the two peoples, as well as for peace, co-operation, development and prosperity in the region and the world, she said.\nThe speech by NA Chairwoman Ngân was broadcast live on the TV channel of the Federation Council (vmeste-rf.tv). — VNS'	politics-laws

Second is the cost for water transfer. Third is the administrative expense. Fourth is 5 per cent of (loan’s) interest rate. And fifth is 25 per cent for potential water loss,” he said.\nHe said city authorities strictly followed\xa0prevailing regulations and no changes were made in the way the city calculated the price of tap water.\nChung said the increased\xa0water price of the Đuống River plant\xa0was only an "estimated price" agreed by the city and the investor so the project could be established and carried out.\nHà Nội also made such an agreement with the investor of the Hồng River surface water plant with the estimated water price of VNĐ10,365 per cu.m, he added.\n“They were just prices to set up the projects,” the chairman said, implying the current water price of the Đuống River plant was yet to be fixed.\nThe Đuống River water plant – the largest of its kind in the northern region –\xa0 began operation in September 2019 with total capacity reaching 300,000 cu.m\xa0daily.\nRural clean water\nThe Hà Nội chairman on Wednesday also discussed municipal authorities’s efforts to supply clean water to residents in suburban areas.\nAccording to Chung, Hà Nội until 2015 had set up 109 projects under the management of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to bring clean water to rural areas. They mainly involved digging wells and so far only six were working well, he said. Many others could only supply unfiltered water.\nThe city had called for investment from the private sector which later resulted in 38 clean water projects being carried out by 23 investors, he said.\n“With (the city’s) great determination, we haven’t encountered a clean water shortage this year,” he said.\n“In fact, up to 75 per cent of rural residents have been supplied with urban water in 2019. A Hà Nội Party\xa0resolution, meanwhile, only set the goal of 50 per cent of rural residents having\xa0access to water at urban standards by 2020.”\nThe official said\xa0city authorities hastened the rural clean water programme due to their wish to provide quality water to residents for the sake of their health.\xa0— VNS'	politics-laws

82	"VN's trade turnover\xa0 to reach $500 bln: PM"	'Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc speaks at the November cabinet meeting, on Monday. — VNA/VNS Photo Thống Nhất\nHÀ NỘI — Trade turnover is set to reach a record US$500 billion this year with surplus hitting $9.1 billion.\nPrime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc revealed the good news on Monday, as he painted a bright picture of the country’s economy during 2019.\nAs he chaired the November cabinet meeting, the PM said Việt Nam’s exports are forecast to exceed $241 billion, an increase of 7.8 per cent compared to 2018.\nMacroeconomics was stable for the time being, he said, despite the consumer price index (CPI) in November increasing by 0.96 per cent over last month mainly due to a sharp hike in pork price.\nThe average CPI for the last 11 months, however, was up by only 2.57 per cent compared to the same period in 2018 – which was the lowest increase in the last three years.\nGrowth rate of retail and service sectors scored two digits in November, at 12.6 per cent which was the highest since 2014, the PM said.\nTourism also reached a new record high with 1.8 million inbound visitors arriving in Việt Nam last month alone.\nPork shortage\nAlthough the big picture looked good, there are concerns over a shortage of pork and an increase in the price of meat as the country heads into the festive season.\nIn a press conference on Monday afternoon following the cabinet meeting, deputy agriculture minister Phùng Đức Tiến confirmed that Việt Nam would be in short of about 200,000 tonnes of pork for the Tết (lunar new year) holiday which comes in less than two months’ time.\n“Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ has ordered imports of pork from our partner countries, but it should be done in a way to balance the interests of the consumers and the local pig farmers,” Tiến told the reporters.\nPork shortage is a grave concern in Việt Nam as Vietnamese heavily rely on pork for their daily meals. Statistics by the Ministry of Industry and Trade show that Vietnamese consume on average about 5.4 million tonnes of meat a year, mostly pork accounting for 70 per cent at 3.8 million tonnes.\nAn outbreak of African swine fever, also known as hog cholera with a high fatality rate, has led to more than 5.7 million pigs being culled across the country since early February this year. It resulted in a severe pork shortage in the last quarter of 2019.\n“The number of pigs being culled rapidly decreased since June 30, by 88 per cent to the peak month (of the outbreak), which creates favourable condition (for farmers) to start repopulating the herds,” the deputy minister said.\nTiến also reported that pork prices dropped by half to around VNĐ70,000 (US$3) a kilo from the peak price in November following a meeting with deputy PM Huệ to control the price surge.\nViệt Nam would not be short of other meats as the production of other livestock increased by up to 390,000 tonnes this year compared to 2018, he said.\nDeputy minister of industry and trade Đỗ Thắng Hải, meanwhile, warned that a pork price surge during or after Tết holiday would affect the lives of residents and the CPI if the Government acted carelessly.\n“In China for example, pork prices hiked by 100 per cent and the CPI also rose by 1 per cent,” he said.\nHải reported that his ministry demanded the Việt Nam Directorate of Market Surveillance to halt exporting pork to other markets like China as well as to prevent pork smuggling from Thailand into Việt Nam via the Cambodian border.\n“We haven’t signed any deals on pork trade with Thailand and Cambodia,” he added.\n“Pork smuggling from those markets poses risks to food safety while it might also infect the domestic pigs with diseases.” — VNS\nPM Phúc says goodbye to leaving health minister\nPrime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on Monday praised former health minister Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến for her dedicated contribution to the health sector in her last cabinet meeting.\nThe National Assembly in its meeting last month voted to remove the 60-year-old Tiến – the only female minister in the incumbent Government - from her post as she already reached the retirement age.\nThe health sector under Tiến’s leadership since 2011 gained great achievements, the PM said at the regular cabinet meeting on Monday. She was the one who initiated the policy to grant financial autonomy to hospitals, which helped to lift the income for medical staff, Phúc said.\n“The health sector also contributed to raising the life expectancy of Vietnamese through preventive health care and medical treatment. Việt Nam is proud to be one of the leading countries in terms of life expectancy,” he added.\nThe former minister said that she would always remember the last day she attended the cabinet meeting.\n“I am grateful to the Party, the Government, the National Assembly, the ministries, the municipalities and organisations which have accompanied the health ministry the whole time, especially during my tenure as a member of the Government,” Tiến said. — VNS'	politics-laws

He stressed that the country will do its best to fulfill those regional and international responsibilities.\nExplaining his viewpoint that Việt Nam should strive to become not only an economic but also cultural power, PM Phúc said in the context of comprehensive integration, the preservation of the traditional culture of the country and of each ethnic group is a task of equal importance with economic development.\nThe PM also spoke about solutions to assist the development of the private sector, which he described as an important part in national development.\nWorkers honoured with Labour Order\nA music performance to mark the 90th traditional day of the city’s workers. — VNA/VNS Photo An Đăng\nA ceremony was held in Hải Phòng City on Saturday to mark the 90th traditional day of the city’s workers (November 24) and the 90th founding anniversary of the Communist Party of Vietnam’s first cell in the port (November 28).\nOn behalf of the Party and State leaders, PM Phúc presented the third-class Labour Order to the cadres and workers of Hải Phòng Port in recognition of their particularly excellent contributions to national development.\nThe first generation of the port’s workers was formed in 1874, when the French colonialists began to build the first wharves in Hải Phòng. With an undaunted spirit, local workers fought against unjust treatment, thus greatly contributing to the national struggles against colonialists and imperialists.\n\nOn November 24, 1929, the fight against port owners by 500 workers achieved complete success, and this date became the traditional day of local workers.\n\nDuring the resistance war against the US, a number of emulation movements were launched among workers of the port. Besides, Hải Phòng Port was not only the place to receive assistance from other socialist countries but also the starting point of the Hồ Chí Minh Trail at Sea.\n\nIts workers stood side by side with military forces to fight and win against raids by the US air force and ensure safety for infrastructure and goods to serve the building of socialism in the north and support the battle against the US in the south.\n\nIn the reform period, Hải Phòng Port has been expanded and modernised. Its workers have actively engaged in emulation movements, helping to improve productivity and quality of their performance. From 2009 to 2018, about 1,320 initiatives, mostly proposed by workers, helped the port save VNĐ16.2 billion (over US$700,000).\nIn 2019, Hải Phòng Port is set to handle 35 million tonnes of cargo, earn more than VNĐ2.2 trillion ($95.7 million) in revenues and over VNĐ600 billion ($26.1 million) in profits, and contribute some VNĐ200 billion ($8.7 million) to the State budget.\nAccording to Secretary of the Hải Phòng municipal Party Committee Lê Văn Thành, the city has a strategic location in terms of socio-economy, security and defence of Việt Nam. Particularly, the over-145-year-old Hải Phòng Port is the most important gateway to the sea of the northern region. Its impressive performance has met the socio-economic development demand of the country. — VNS'	politics-laws
