1	'Việt Nam’s diplomacy achievements in 2019'	"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Bình Minh. –\xa0 VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI – While the world saw profound global instability in 2019, the Pacific – Asia area proved to be the leading region in terms of economic integration, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Bình Minh has said.\nWriting on the achievements of Việt Nam’s diplomacy sector in 2019 as the year ended, Minh said while the global economy has slowed and\xa0conflict between globalisation and protectionism\xa0has become more fierce, the Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN) has stayed united and proved its\xa0important role in the policies of many major countries.\nFor Việt Nam,\xa02019 was a year with many achievements of the diplomatic sector in implementing the Party’s policies on international integration and economic diplomacy.\nThe country effectively implemented the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). After just a year in operation, the first new generation FTA in the world has helped Việt Nam's export turnover to members such as Japan, Canada and Mexico increase significantly compared to 2018.\nViệt Nam\xa0signed the Việt Nam - European Union Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) with the European Union and the Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA) and\xa0completed negotiations of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP).\nThe Global\xa0Competitiveness\xa0Index (GCI) 2019, issued on October 9 by the World Economic Forum (WEF), revealed Việt Nam had jumped 10 places from last year to 67, making it the most improved country of 2019.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) pledged to Việt Nam surpassed US$38 billion this year, marking a 10-year high and representing a year-on-year increase of 7.2 per cent. Việt Nam also welcomed more than 18 million international tourists in 2019.\nBesides economic integration, integration in\xa0politics - diplomacy, defence - security and\xa0culture - society was also strongly promoted.\nViệt Nam participated in joint maritime exercises for the first time with the US in the framework of ASEAN, signed\xa0a Framework Participation Agreement with the European Union that will facilitate\xa0Việt Nam’s\xa0contribution to the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations, and\xa0ratified Convention No\xa098 of the International Labour Organisation.\nThe country sent the second level-2\xa0field hospital to join the UN Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan after the first field hospital successfully completed its mission.\nAchieving second position at the 30th Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines recently and other outstanding achievements also confirmed Việt Nam's new position in the regional and international sports map.\nThe country's achievements in multilateral relations in 2019 also boosted its growing international status.\nEarly this year, Việt Nam hosted the second summit between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the US, a move highly praised by the international community for efforts to contribute to peace in the world.\nWinning 192 out of 193 votes on June 7, Việt Nam\xa0became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2020-21 term. This will\xa0be the second time that the country has held this post, demonstrating its wish to contribute to world security and peace and proving Việt Nam\xa0is a\xa0responsible member of the UN.\nIn terms of bilateral relations, Việt Nam maintained stable and positive relations with all countries. Leaders of Party, State,\xa0Government and National Assembly made 17 official\xa0visits abroad and received 22 high-ranking delegations paying a visit to Việt Nam, which helped gain\xa0important outcomes with\xa0partners.\nTo date, Việt Nam has established a network of 30 strategic partners and comprehensive partners.\nThe diplomatic sector contributed effectively to the defence of the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity, both on land and at sea. Việt Nam and Cambodia have signed and ratified two legal documents recognising 84 per cent of demarcation results, creating an important foundation\xa0to build a border of peace and development.\nIn the most complicated and serious situation in the East Sea in the past five years, Việt Nam properly assessed the situation, gave prompt\xa0reactions and\xa0dealt with the situation strongly to defend the country’s legitimate rights and interests.\nAt the same time, Việt Nam has also\xa0been working with ASEAN members and partners to build the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC)\xa0in accordance with international law.\nThe year 2020 has a very important meaning, when Việt Nam prepares for the Socio-Economic Development Strategy from 2021 to 2030 and celebrates 90 years of the establishment of the Việt Nam Communist Party, 75 years of the country’s establishment and 130 years of late President Hồ Chí Minh’s birthday, Minh said.\nIt is also important because Việt Nam will take on Chair of ASEAN 2020 and non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2020-21 term, holding the two responsibilities together for the first time.\nThis will be an opportunity for Việt Nam to take advantage of bilateral relations with other countries, creating new impetus for enhancing the role and position of the country.\nWith the theme 'Cohesive and Responsive'\xa0for the ASEAN Chairmanship 2020, and\xa0'Việt Nam: Trusted Partnership for Peace and Sustainability'\xa0as the non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Việt Nam will work\xa0with international friends and partners to foster multilateralism, the rule of law and enhance ASEAN’s centrality role in the regional structure, and further enhance\xa0co-operation between ASEAN and the UN.\nWith that spirit in mind, Việt Nam will work to affirm its important bridging role between ASEAN and the UN, contributing to the cause of promoting peace, co-operation and development in the region and in the world. – VNS"	politics-laws

He was proposed a combined jail term of 14 to 16 years.\nThe 47-year-old businessman Vũ, meanwhile, was facing three to four years behind bars for giving bribes, said the Procuracy.\nSeveral violations in the signing of the AVG deal only surfaced last year following a Government inspection into the purchase, which saw MobiFone buying 95 per cent of shares of the private firm AVG in 2015. The deal was concluded to have caused losses of approximately VNĐ6.47 trillion ($281.5 million) to the State and triggered a police investigation soon after.\nIt consequently led to the arrests of a number of high and middle level officials of the Ministry of Information and Communications, leaders of MobiFone and AMAX investment consultancy and valuation company.\nHà Nội People’s Court on Monday opened a trial against 14 defendants in the case, which is set to last until the end of this month.\nThe prosecutors also proposed jail terms of between two and six years for another nine defendants who are accused of breaches in public investment management causing severe consequences. — VNS\nThe People's Procuracy on Friday announced their punishment proposals for 14 defendants standing trial in the AVG case. — VNA/VNS Photo"	politics-laws
18	'Army stands firmly under Party’s leadership: top leader'	'General Secretary and President Nguyễn Phú Trọng inspects military equipment on exhibition at the political-military conference in 2018. — VNA/VNS Photo Trí Dũng\nHÀ NỘI The Việt Nam People’s Army (VPA) has always served as the core force to, together with the Party and the people, achieve accomplishments in national liberation and construction and defence throughout its 75-year history, Party General Secretary and President Nguyễn Phú Trọng has said.\nIn an article published for the 75th founding anniversary of the VPA (December 22, 1944), the Party and State leader stressed those accomplishments were the results of multiple factors, of which the Communist Party of Việt Nam’s (CPV)’s comprehensive, absolute and sound leadership is a decisive one.\nTrọng, who is also Secretary of the Central Military Commission, says in the article the Party has flexibly applied Marxism-Leninism and President Hồ Chí Minh’s thought to build a new-style army that suits the specific situation in Việt Nam. The Party also affirmed the inevitable need to turn the army into the key force in the cause of national liberation and defence.\nDuring the resistance war against the invading French colonialists, the VPA won glorious achievements, including the 1953-1954 Winter-Spring Campaign with the peak of the Điện Biên Phủ victory that forced the French government to sign the Geneva Accords in 1954, ending the war and restoring peace in Indochina.\nThis was the first time in contemporary history that an army equipped with rudimentary weapons defeated a professional counterpart, which marked the beginning of the collapse of colonialism and provided a strong boost to the national liberation movement around the world, he stressed.\nIn the anti-US war, the VPA, along with the entire Party and people, consecutively foiled war strategies. Such great victories won by the Vietnamese army and people drove the US to sign the Paris Peace Accords that committed to put an end to the war, and created a premise for the Spring General Offensive and Uprising in 1975, culminating with the historic Hồ Chí Minh Campaign, leading to the full liberation of South Việt Nam, national reunification and the end of the 30-year resistance war, the leader said.\nNot only fighting to liberate their own country, with a pure proletarian international spirit, the VPA has also stood side by side with armed forces of Laos and Cambodia in the fight against common enemies.\nRight after the anti-US war ended, the VPA immediately embarked on another fierce battle to protect the national border and performed its international mission of helping Cambodian people escape genocide.\nDuring the cause of national construction and defence in the renewal period, the army has carried forward its role in combat and production, while serving as an advisor of the Party and the State in military, national defence and drafting strategic guidelines for national protection.\nAt the same time, it has made outstanding performance in defence diplomacy, contributing to building a peaceful and stable environment for national building and development, Trọng says.\nOver the past 75 years, in any revolutionary period, even the toughest time, the CPV has maintained its comprehensive, absolute and direct leadership over the VPA.\nThis is an important factor for the success of national building and safeguarding, and also the decisive factor for the growth, combat capacity and triumph of the army, he says.\nThe Party General Secretary points out that unforeseeable and complex developments are lying ahead in the regional and global situation, along with increasing traditional and non-traditional security challenges and fierce strategic competition between world powers.\nThe East Sea (known as the South China Sea) issue also contains many unexpected risks, he says, adding that the trend of connectivity, globalisation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution have been exerting profound impacts on all countries in various spheres.\nInside the country, the macro economy has been stabilised but not quite sustainably. Although Việt Nam’s internal strength has been consolidated and its prestige and position in the international arena have been rising, the country still faces a range of difficulties and challenges.\nThe Party leader also called attention to the fact that hostile forces have stepped up the so-called “peace process,” “self-evolution,” “self-transformation,” “non-politicisation,” and “civilisation” of the army, especially before, during and after all-level Party congresses and the 13th National Party Congress.\nThe cause of national construction and defence goes with heavy requirements, with the struggle to safeguard the country’s sovereignty over its sea, islands and territorial integrity forecast to be a tough, long-term and complex one.\nIn 2020 and the years to come, the VPA will have to take on tougher tasks, he said, requiring the Party to maintain and enhance its absolute, direct and comprehensive leadership over the VPA in order to help the army complete its missions.\n“We believe that with its 75-year history of building and fighting under the Party leadership, the VPA will continue to write more glorious historical pages for the nation,” he concludes.

She suggested the two sides give priority to areas where Việt Nam’s advantages match Belarus’ demands, such as textile and garment, wood, fishery, pharmaceuticals, computers and rice, and boost trade of agricultural products that can complement each other.\nThe two sides should also seek new opportunities for cooperation, make the most of the Vietnam-Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) Free Trade Agreement and promote the FTA among their business communities, she added.\nShe spoke highly of Belarus as a traditional and trustworthy partner of Việt Nam in defence and security, proposing the two sides continue maintaining effective cooperation, delegation exchanges and implementation of the Việt Nam-Belarus military-technical cooperation for 2016-20, and complete the legal framework for partnership in security.\nShe went on to emphasise Việt Nam’s consistent stance on the East Sea that all disputes must be settled by peaceful measures, in line with international law, including the UN Charter and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). All concerned parties must fully and effectively implement the Declaration on Conduct of the Parties in the East Sea (DOC) and soon conclude the Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC), she said.\nBoth leaders appreciated the operation of the Việt Nam-Belarus inter-governmental committee on economics, trade, science and technology.\nBelarus saw Việt Nam as a strategic partner and a springboard for increasing its economic presence in Southeast Asia, Kochanova said.\nBoth sides agreed that they would need to help joint ventures of the two countries gain broader access to Asian and European markets and that a Belarus Day would be held in Việt Nam in 2021.\nKochanova affirmed the Belarusian NA attached importance to ties with the Vietnamese NA, adding that a friendship parliamentarians’ group with Việt Nam would be set up in the future.\nTo further enhance ties between the two legislatures, the two leaders agreed to increase exchanges of high-level delegations, committees and friendly parliamentarians’ groups to boost mutual understanding and trust; continue effectively implementing the two sides’ agreement signed in April 2009 and promoting close coordination at multilateral forums; and jointly review and supervise the enforcement of agreements reached by the two countries’ governments and ministries.\n\n\n\n\nA talk is held between\xa0National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân and\xa0Chairman of the House of Representatives of the National Assembly of Belarus Vladimir Andreichenko in Minsk on Thursday.\n\n\nMeeting with Chairman of the House of Representatives\nThe same day, Chairwoman Ngân held talks with Chairman of the House of Representatives of the National Assembly of Belarus Vladimir Andreichenko.\nShe said Việt Nam always attached great importance to its traditional friendship and all-round cooperation with Belarus.\nVladimir Andreichenko said promoting cooperation with Việt Nam was a top priority in Belarus’s foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region, adding that both sides hold huge cooperation potential.\nAgreeing with NA Chairwoman Ngân’s suggestion to set up joint ventures between businesses of both sides, Vladimir Andreichenko said that Belarus would accelerate work to establish tea and coffee processing plants in Việt Nam so that the products would suit the taste of Belarusian consumers.\nShe suggested both sides maintain personnel training courses, and exchange information about the national security situation in each nation, including the fight against organised crimes, transnational crimes, high-tech crimes, and illegal immigration, among others.\nShe stressed the sound cooperative ties between the Vietnamese NA and the Belarusian House of Representatives in the past, recommending both sides maintain the exchange of high-level delegations, share experience in legislative work, and closely coordinate at multilateral forums to discuss issues of mutual concern.\nAndreichenko said as there is huge room for both nations to develop economic and trade cooperation, the two parliaments should play a more proactive role to support the bilateral collaboration.\nTogether with existing cooperative mechanisms, both parliaments should work on new initiatives to enhance cooperation, he said, competent committees of the two National Assemblies needed to join efforts to step up cultural exchange between the two countries.\nHe also stressed the necessity to promote cooperation at the local level, hoping the draft plan on Hà Nội-Minsk collaboration would be inked soon.\nNational Assembly Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân meets\xa0Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko\xa0in Minsk on Thursday.\n\n\nMeeting with President\nNA Chairwoman Ngân met Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko the same day, during which they discussed the partnership between Viêt Nam and Belarus across spheres.\nBelarusian President Lukashenko highlighted the fruitful bilateral cooperation in politics, economy, national defence and security, and education, with exchanges of visits and meetings by leaders, including those of legislative bodies.\nHost and guest shared the views that two-way trade still remain modest, standing at only $92.2 million last year and $41.1 million in the first half of this year.\nThey urged promoting the economic and trade collaboration to match the bilateral political ties, aiming to raise two-way trade revenue to $500 million as targeted by leaders of both sides.\nChairwoman Ngân expressed her hope that the two countries would continue to maintain the trustful and regular collaboration in national defence and security, culture, science-technology and tourism.

Việt Nam\xa0was the first country to sign a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union, of which Russia is a key member. Additionally, bilateral investment had\xa0continued to expand\xa0with many large projects, including oil and gas, according to the NA leader.\nShe added that co-operation in defence and security had\xa0increased while people-to-people exchanges had\xa0also been enhanced, and more young Vietnamese had\xa0chosen Russia to study in. Meanwhile, Việt Nam remained\xa0a popular destination for Russian tourists with more than 600,000 people from Russia visiting the Southeast Asian nation in 2018, and that\xa0figure reached\xa0500,000 in the first nine months of this year.\nIt was hard to find another\xa0country that the Vietnamese people held\xa0such a profound sentiment for like Russia, and this was shown not only through political and economic partnerships, but also cultural exchanges and connectivity, Ngân noted.\nThe Vietnamese leader went on to say the sound relations between\xa0the two countries had helped parliamentary co-operation to grow.\nDuring a\xa0trip to Việt Nam in December 2018 by Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav V. Volodin, the two sides inked a co-operation agreement on the establishment of an inter-parliamentary co-operation committee between the Vietnamese NA and the State Duma of Russia. This committee was the highest form of co-operation of the Vietnamese legislature, Ngân said.\nShe emphasised that amid complex developments and potential risks in the international arena, the continued enhancement of the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership was not only an objective requirement but also the aspiration of the two countries’ leaders and peoples. It also ensured the success of each nation’s reforms and development, while contributing to peace, stability, co-operation, development and prosperity in the region and the world.\nNgân underlined Việt Nam’s appreciation of Russia’s stance on the East Sea issue, which was supporting the peaceful settlement of disputes on the basis of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to help maintain peace, stability, freedom, safety and security of navigation and overflight in the East Sea, as well as supporting the full and serious implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea and the early finalisation of a Code of Conduct in the waters.\nShe repeated Party General Secretary,\xa0State President Nguyễn Phú Trọng’s statement that Việt Nam’s consistent policy was to always attach importance to and further strengthen its\xa0comprehensive strategic partnership with Russia, and considered Russia one of its\xa0leading partners. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin also described Việt Nam as a leading partner of his country in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs Chair of ASEAN and the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) in 2020, Việt Nam would\xa0continue reinforcing the strategic partnership between ASEAN and Russia and help promote Russia’s voice and stature in the region, she noted, adding that as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2020-21, it would\xa0also work\xa0closely with Russia.\nThe NA leader expressed her belief that the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership would continue to develop\xa0and overcome challenges\xa0to match their long-standing friendship.\nIn that process, their parliaments would\xa0continue to play\xa0a crucial role in forming\xa0favourable legal frameworks, increasing supervision and stepping up the implementation of co-operation agreements and projects. They would\xa0also co-ordinate more closely at international inter-parliamentary forums for the sake of the two peoples, as well as for peace, co-operation, development and prosperity in the region and the world, she said.\nThe speech by NA Chairwoman Ngân was broadcast live on the TV channel of the Federation Council (vmeste-rf.tv). — VNS'	politics-laws

And fifth is 25 per cent for potential water loss,” he said.\nHe said city authorities strictly followed\xa0prevailing regulations and no changes were made in the way the city calculated the price of tap water.\nChung said the increased\xa0water price of the Đuống River plant\xa0was only an "estimated price" agreed by the city and the investor so the project could be established and carried out.\nHà Nội also made such an agreement with the investor of the Hồng River surface water plant with the estimated water price of VNĐ10,365 per cu.m, he added.\n“They were just prices to set up the projects,” the chairman said, implying the current water price of the Đuống River plant was yet to be fixed.\nThe Đuống River water plant – the largest of its kind in the northern region –\xa0 began operation in September 2019 with total capacity reaching 300,000 cu.m\xa0daily.\nRural clean water\nThe Hà Nội chairman on Wednesday also discussed municipal authorities’s efforts to supply clean water to residents in suburban areas.\nAccording to Chung, Hà Nội until 2015 had set up 109 projects under the management of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to bring clean water to rural areas. They mainly involved digging wells and so far only six were working well, he said. Many others could only supply unfiltered water.\nThe city had called for investment from the private sector which later resulted in 38 clean water projects being carried out by 23 investors, he said.\n“With (the city’s) great determination, we haven’t encountered a clean water shortage this year,” he said.\n“In fact, up to 75 per cent of rural residents have been supplied with urban water in 2019. A Hà Nội Party\xa0resolution, meanwhile, only set the goal of 50 per cent of rural residents having\xa0access to water at urban standards by 2020.”\nThe official said\xa0city authorities hastened the rural clean water programme due to their wish to provide quality water to residents for the sake of their health.\xa0— VNS'	politics-laws

The four-day conference has been jointly organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government Inspectorate of Việt Nam.\nLiêm said that building and developing infrastructure was deemed the backbone of economic growth, laying the foundations for the Government to provide basic public services for the people.\n“Investment demand for infrastructure in many countries in Asia-Pacific through large-scale projects has shot up dramatically in recent years, but it also brings with it greater risks of corruption,” he said.\n“It is a big challenge that many Asia-Pacific countries and nations around the world are dealing with.”\nDiana Torres, Project Manager, Transparency and Accountability at UNDP in Asia and the Pacific, said that estimations from the Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH) expected as much as US$97 trillion was required for global infrastructure investment by 2040, but there was a shortfall of about $18 trillion.\nThe thirst for infrastructure funding would even be exacerbated as up to 30 per cent of the resources for infrastructure was going to be lost through mismanagement, inefficiency and on corruption, said Torres.\n“Poor governance, lack of transparency and corruption can undermine any efforts (for quality infrastructure development) due to weak human resources, increased operational costs and the selection of unqualified contractors,” she said.\nVCCI Chairman Vũ Tiến Lộc said the conference would offer the country ideas to prevent and combat corruption, especially in the relationship between the Government and the business community.\n“Integrity is the heart of the business community. Integrity means doing business in a fair and square manner, or in other words, abiding by general principles, “ Lộc told the conference.\nHe also said the business community had to be fully aware of the role of integrity while working with the Government in order to eliminate the so-called culture of greasing the wheels. — VNS'	politics-laws

Statistics by the Ministry of Industry and Trade show that Vietnamese consume on average about 5.4 million tonnes of meat a year, mostly pork accounting for 70 per cent at 3.8 million tonnes.\nAn outbreak of African swine fever, also known as hog cholera with a high fatality rate, has led to more than 5.7 million pigs being culled across the country since early February this year. It resulted in a severe pork shortage in the last quarter of 2019.\n“The number of pigs being culled rapidly decreased since June 30, by 88 per cent to the peak month (of the outbreak), which creates favourable condition (for farmers) to start repopulating the herds,” the deputy minister said.\nTiến also reported that pork prices dropped by half to around VNĐ70,000 (US$3) a kilo from the peak price in November following a meeting with deputy PM Huệ to control the price surge.\nViệt Nam would not be short of other meats as the production of other livestock increased by up to 390,000 tonnes this year compared to 2018, he said.\nDeputy minister of industry and trade Đỗ Thắng Hải, meanwhile, warned that a pork price surge during or after Tết holiday would affect the lives of residents and the CPI if the Government acted carelessly.\n“In China for example, pork prices hiked by 100 per cent and the CPI also rose by 1 per cent,” he said.\nHải reported that his ministry demanded the Việt Nam Directorate of Market Surveillance to halt exporting pork to other markets like China as well as to prevent pork smuggling from Thailand into Việt Nam via the Cambodian border.\n“We haven’t signed any deals on pork trade with Thailand and Cambodia,” he added.\n“Pork smuggling from those markets poses risks to food safety while it might also infect the domestic pigs with diseases.” — VNS\nPM Phúc says goodbye to leaving health minister\nPrime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on Monday praised former health minister Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến for her dedicated contribution to the health sector in her last cabinet meeting.\nThe National Assembly in its meeting last month voted to remove the 60-year-old Tiến – the only female minister in the incumbent Government - from her post as she already reached the retirement age.\nThe health sector under Tiến’s leadership since 2011 gained great achievements, the PM said at the regular cabinet meeting on Monday. She was the one who initiated the policy to grant financial autonomy to hospitals, which helped to lift the income for medical staff, Phúc said.\n“The health sector also contributed to raising the life expectancy of Vietnamese through preventive health care and medical treatment. Việt Nam is proud to be one of the leading countries in terms of life expectancy,” he added.\nThe former minister said that she would always remember the last day she attended the cabinet meeting.\n“I am grateful to the Party, the Government, the National Assembly, the ministries, the municipalities and organisations which have accompanied the health ministry the whole time, especially during my tenure as a member of the Government,” Tiến said. — VNS'	politics-laws

He stressed that the country will do its best to fulfill those regional and international responsibilities.\nExplaining his viewpoint that Việt Nam should strive to become not only an economic but also cultural power, PM Phúc said in the context of comprehensive integration, the preservation of the traditional culture of the country and of each ethnic group is a task of equal importance with economic development.\nThe PM also spoke about solutions to assist the development of the private sector, which he described as an important part in national development.\nWorkers honoured with Labour Order\nA music performance to mark the 90th traditional day of the city’s workers. — VNA/VNS Photo An Đăng\nA ceremony was held in Hải Phòng City on Saturday to mark the 90th traditional day of the city’s workers (November 24) and the 90th founding anniversary of the Communist Party of Vietnam’s first cell in the port (November 28).\nOn behalf of the Party and State leaders, PM Phúc presented the third-class Labour Order to the cadres and workers of Hải Phòng Port in recognition of their particularly excellent contributions to national development.\nThe first generation of the port’s workers was formed in 1874, when the French colonialists began to build the first wharves in Hải Phòng. With an undaunted spirit, local workers fought against unjust treatment, thus greatly contributing to the national struggles against colonialists and imperialists.\n\nOn November 24, 1929, the fight against port owners by 500 workers achieved complete success, and this date became the traditional day of local workers.\n\nDuring the resistance war against the US, a number of emulation movements were launched among workers of the port. Besides, Hải Phòng Port was not only the place to receive assistance from other socialist countries but also the starting point of the Hồ Chí Minh Trail at Sea.\n\nIts workers stood side by side with military forces to fight and win against raids by the US air force and ensure safety for infrastructure and goods to serve the building of socialism in the north and support the battle against the US in the south.\n\nIn the reform period, Hải Phòng Port has been expanded and modernised. Its workers have actively engaged in emulation movements, helping to improve productivity and quality of their performance. From 2009 to 2018, about 1,320 initiatives, mostly proposed by workers, helped the port save VNĐ16.2 billion (over US$700,000).\nIn 2019, Hải Phòng Port is set to handle 35 million tonnes of cargo, earn more than VNĐ2.2 trillion ($95.7 million) in revenues and over VNĐ600 billion ($26.1 million) in profits, and contribute some VNĐ200 billion ($8.7 million) to the State budget.\nAccording to Secretary of the Hải Phòng municipal Party Committee Lê Văn Thành, the city has a strategic location in terms of socio-economy, security and defence of Việt Nam. Particularly, the over-145-year-old Hải Phòng Port is the most important gateway to the sea of the northern region. Its impressive performance has met the socio-economic development demand of the country. — VNS'	politics-laws

VNA/VNS Photo\nBANGKOK – The Council of ASEAN Chief Justices (CACJ) convened its 7th meeting in Phuket, Thailand, on Friday under the chair of President of the Thai Supreme Court Slaikate Wattanapan.\nThe Vietnamese delegation to the event was led by Chief Justice of the Supreme People’s Court Nguyễn Hòa Bình.\nAt the meeting, the chief justices from the 10 member nations recognised the progress in the coordination within the ASEAN framework, noting that the member courts have actively updated their countries’ legal and judicial information on the ASEAN Judiciaries Portal, thereby meeting the demand for information about judicial and legal systems of the bloc.\nThey discussed technology application in the court sector so as to meet new requirements, decided to consider this issue more thoroughly, and also noted that this is a challenge for the regional court sector in the years to come.\nThe chief justices also looked into the serving of foreign courts’ summons and the recognition and permission of the enforcement of foreign judgments, judicial education and training, and children-related disputes among countries.\nRegarding the CACJ’s external relations, its working group proposed establishing an ASEAN Plus Three group that includes China, the Republic of Korea and Japan, considering this issue a top priority. Groups that gather ASEAN and other partners were also suggested with the most likely ones being European nations and the US.\nIn his speech, Bình said since the CACJ was officially recognised as an entity of ASEAN connectivity, cooperation among courts within the council’s framework has become increasingly vibrant and effective. Given this, the ASEAN governments have been showing their support for multilateral judicial cooperation activities within this framework, as well as bilateral cooperation between member courts.\nCourts of ASEAN countries have found a right direction, and the CACJ is greatly contributing to the solidarity, mutual understanding, cooperation and sharing in the ASEAN Community, he said.\nBình said the CACJ now has more and more ideas and activities, illustrating the member nations’ demand for judicial and legal integration. The council has also been making unceasing efforts to affirm its centrality in the judicial and legal integration process of the bloc.\nHe added that the Supreme People’s Court of Vietnam is a CACJ member that is always ready to make more contributions and efforts, with the highest sense of responsibility and goodwill, for the common success of the council and for a cohesive, rules-based, people-oriented and people-centred ASEAN Community.\nAt the meeting, participants approved some new initiatives and welcomed Việt Nam’s hosting of the 8th meeting of the CACJ. — VNS'	politics-laws
118	'More comprehensive approach to climate change needed, lawmakers urged'	'A raging flood that washed away crops, houses and damaged infrastructure of the mountainous commune Phú Sơn, Bù Đăng District, in Bình Phước Province in August this year. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — The Government needs a “more comprehensive and broader approach” towards climate change issues, National Assembly deputies said on Friday morning, as the country’s parliament discussed the two closely-related laws on dykes and prevention of natural disasters.\nNguyễn Lâm Thành from the Lạng Sơn Province delegation suggested that in the current context, the name of the law should be extended to “Law on prevention of natural disasters and climate change adaption.”\n“Climate change is an extended process that requires us to plan and carry out both short-term measures to deal with contingencies and strategic measures in the long run, so apparently, limiting the scope of the bill to just natural disasters is not sufficient,” Lâm Thành said.\nHe also asked that there should be responses prescribed in the law with regard to more forms of nature’s adverse phenomena, such as drought, severe cold or hoarfrost, instead of merely focusing too much on flooding triggered by heavy rain.\nRegarding the proposal to set up an Anti-Natural Disaster Fund that will be managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and be used during devastating disasters and natural emergencies and other national and regional anti-natural disaster efforts, deputy Lâm Thành said that more consideration should go into this idea to prevent the overlapping of roles because calling for and receiving international support and donations has been assigned by the Government to the Việt Nam Red Cross, according to the existing Law on Budget.\nThe Lạng Sơn deputy also urged more clarification on the management and cooperation between the Việt Nam Red Cross and the agriculture ministry in the event that the proposed fund was approved by the parliament.\nA deputy from Cần Thơ Province, Nguyễn Thanh Phương, is concerned about the necessity of an anti-natural disaster fund at a central level when there are already funds at local levels to serve these purposes, adding that the Government should prescribe a mechanism to transfer funds between the central-level fund and its local counterparts in case of necessities.\nPhạm Văn Hoà, a deputy from Đồng Tháp Province, was in favour of the idea but asked that serious oversight should be exercised over revenues and expenditures of the fund in order to preclude corruption, losses and waste of the valuable budget.\nLê Quang Trí from the Mekong Delta Province of Tiền Giang’s delegation at the meeting concurred with the draft law’s amendment which stipulates prioritising budget for developing and implementing science and technology programmes in preventing and dealing with natural disasters.\nTrí said that the investment into science and technology in this regard has not received due attention in recent years.\n“Stretches of the coastline in the Mekong Delta are suffering from serious erosion, with many parts experiencing erosion rates of 20-30m a year. For example, a dyke was built 1 kilometre from the shoreline 30 years ago, fast forward to the current time, the sea already laps at the dyke’s foot and threatens to consume it soon. There really should be research done into this issue to protect our coastline more effectively,” Trí said.\nSpeaking at the meeting, agriculture minister Nguyễn Xuân Cường said the bill was meant to catch up with the increasingly devastating and unpredictable natural disasters, further complicated by climate change.\nCường said the authors would submit explanations to clarify unclear items and collect more feedback – especially on issues with differing opinions – to improve the draft bill.\nLaws adopted\nIn the afternoon, the National Assembly voted to pass the Law on entry and exit of Vietnamese citizens with 91.51 per cent approval.\nTaking effect in July next year, the law would allow passport applicants to submit their information online and receive the passport later, instead of having to show up physically at the immigration police offices.\nNotably, citizens over 14 could opt to have their passports embedded with electronic chips that would allow them to make use of automated self-service ePassport gates that are becoming more commonplace in modern airports in developed nations.\nThe new law would also require separate passports for each individual, in contrast to the current regulations where a person younger than 9 years old will have to share a passport with their parents.\nAlso, in the afternoon, the National Assembly passed the law amending and supplementing some articles in the Law on Government Organisation and the Law on Local Administration Organisation on November 22 with 89.23 per cent approval.\nThe law will take effect from July 1, 2020.\nThe draft law amending and supplementing some articles of the Law on Government Organisation and the Law on Local Administration Organisation was tabled for discussion at a working session of the legislature on October 25.\nLawmakers expressed their approval for adjustments in the draft law and contributed opinions in order to improve the document.\nMost supported regulations on reducing the number of vice chairpersons of the district-level People’s Council and increasing vice chairpersons of the People’s Committee in a second-tier commune. — VNS'	politics-laws

122	'South Korea-Việt Nam relations going from strength to strength'	"On the threshold of the official visit to the Republic of Korea (RoK) by Việt Nam’s Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, Vietnam News Agency’s correspondent in Seoul Mạnh Hùng spoke to Chol Young Joo, Chairman of the Korea-Vietnam Friendship Association (KOVIFA), and Lee Jae Hyon, Senior Fellow, Ph D. Director of the Centre for ASEAN and Oceania Studies, the Asian Institute for Policy Studies, about relations between the two countries.\nChol Young Joo,\xa0Chairman of the Korea-Vietnam Friendship Association (KOVIFA)\nViệt Nam’s Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc will visit the RoK at the end of this month.\xa0What’s the significance of the event in promoting the two countries’ friendship, especially with\xa0Việt Nam and the RoK celebrating the 10th anniversary of upgrading bilateral ties to the Strategic Cooperation Partnership level?\nFirst of all, we welcome Việt Nam Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on November 25-26 for the ASEAN-Korea Special Summit.\nThe ASEAN-Korea summit, held in Busan on November 25-26, recognises ASEAN as one of South Korea's important partner partners in the New Southern\xa0Policy. 'People, Peace and Prosperity' are the agenda of this ASEAN-Korea Special Summit and it aims to maintain and develop peace and prosperity in Asia by expanding mutual exchanges.\nThe RoK and Việt Nam entered into a 'Strategic Cooperation Partnership' (concluded in 2009) after diplomatic relations in 1992, and the relations of the two countries continue to develop.\nIn March 2018, President Moon Jae-in held a summit with four Vietnamese top leaders, and proposed to upgrade to a 'Comprehensive Strategic Partnership' to further strengthen and deepen the bilateral relationship. We expect South Korea and Việt Nam to develop from a 'Strategic Cooperative Partnership'\xa0to a 'Comprehensive Strategic Partnership'.\nI expect that both South Korea and Việt Nam will lead people, peace and development in all fields including political diplomacy, economy\xa0and culture.\nWhat do you think about the role of people-to-people and cultural exchanges in the consolidation of relations between the RoK and Việt Nam?\nSo far, exchanges and co-operation between South Korea and Việt Nam have been centred\xa0on the relationship between government and government, enterprise\xa0and enterprise.\nNow,\xa0to develop into a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’, we can develop the culture and history of our two countries by developing into a relationship between people and people.\nBetween the two countries, I believe the expansion of people-to-people relations and cultural exchanges will play a stronger and stronger role in bilateral relations.\nThe exchange between South Korea and Việt Nam now includes 'family to family ‘,' village to village ',' alley to alley; ',' school to school', 'child\xa0to child\xa0', 'youth to youth' and\xa0'senior to senior'.\nI think the travel and tourism methods of the people of both countries will help us to understand the home, culture and history of both countries through 'home stay'.\nLee Jae Hyon, Senior Fellow, Ph D. Director of the Centre for ASEAN and Oceania Studies, the Asan Institute for Policy Studies\nWhat do you think about current Việt Nam and South Korea relations and how do you see bilateral relations developing in terms of politics, economy and culture?\nOur relations with Việt Nam are kind of high among ASEAN countries. If you look at some indicators like economic and\xa0social-culture relations, bilateral relations between South Korea and Việt Nam are deep and wide. For example, South Korea-Việt Nam bilateral trade accounts for 50 per cent of total trade value with ASEAN countries, or in other words half of our country’s trade is with Việt Nam and also our investors left in Việt Nam’s economy.\nAs for socio-cultural relations between South Korea and Việt Nam, South Korean's\xa0number one destination among ASEAN countries is Việt Nam and we have also co-operated in many areas of defence and security issues and I expect Việt Nam\xa0and our country’s bilateral relations will go further and deepen in the coming years.\nWith the already laid social, cultural and economic relations, as well as the basis of bilateral co-operation,\xa0relations will grow. In some areas like socio-cultural cooperation, I have to mention some elements: there are a quite number of Vietnamese students in South Korea and their performance is good. They will graduate, leave South Korea, return\xa0to Việt Nam and become bridges between the two countries.\nIn the future, I believe we have to develop and\xa0deepen our co-operation as Việt Nam and South Korea are both facing the dilemma between the US and China. Both\xa0the governments have to think about how to reduce the negative impacts from their trade war, that’s the way Việt Nam-South Korea strategic co-operation will go in the coming years.\nWhat do you think about the role of Việt Nam and the role of Việt Nam-South Korea in the development of ASEAN-South Korea ties and Mekong region-South Korea relations?\nViệt Nam has led the development of \xa0South Korea-ASEAN relations given our economic and\xa0socio-cultural relations. Việt Nam is one of the most important countries in ASEAN so in the development of South Korea-ASEAN relations,\xa0Việt Nam plays a vital role and in the coming years, Việt Nam’s role is more important in deepening our relations with ASEAN countries.\nSouth Korea is determined to upgrade our efforts in the Mekong area in the development and growth of Mekong countries and\xa0Việt Nam is one of the major players in the Mekong area so for South Korea’s successful co-operation with Mekong countries, Việt Nam should share its experiences in Mekong area and Việt Nam can guide South Korea to be successful player in the Mekong region.\nIn your opinion, what is the position and role of Việt Nam in\xa0South Korea’s New Southern Policy?\nFrom 2020, South Korea will start the second phase of the New Southern Policy and next year, Việt Nam\xa0is the chair country of ASEAN and Việt Nam was elected to be a\xa0non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the term\xa02020-21, so there are a lot of things Việt Nam and South Korea can do together regionally and globally.\nFor the success of\xa0the New Southern Policy, Việt Nam’s contribution is vital. The other important aspect of Việt Nam’s role in the success of South Korea’s New Southern Policy is Việt Nam’s contributions to peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.\nViệt Nam has close relations with North Korea and Việt Nam is one of the best countries that can give North Korea fundamental advice\xa0on opening up, reform and denuclearisation so in that sense Việt Nam plays a vital role not only for the success of the New Southern Policy but also for\xa0peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.\nAs I have mentioned earlier, most ASEAN countries, especially Việt Nam, and South Korea are facing the pressure and uncertainties from the fierce competition between China and the US. As the chair of ASEAN, I hope Việt Nam will lead ASEAN countries in developing strategic relations with South Korea in the frame of the New Southern Policy. There are a lot of things we can discuss, such as how to reduce the negative impact of the trade war and\xa0how to reduce the impact of the strategic competition between the US and China. — VNS"	politics-laws

It is then submitted to the NA for approval.\n“If it is the Government who proposes, make changes, finalises and implements a law, it will be against the principle as the Government will ‘kick the ball and blow the whistle’ at the same time,” Dung said.\nBắc Ninh Province Deputy Trần Thị Hằng agreed, saying that the current legislative procedure ensured the NA was proactive\xa0in making laws while affirming the parliament’s power and responsibility.\nDeputy Vũ Thị Lưu Mai from Hà Nội, meanwhile, said if the Government insisted on handing extra power to the law writers, it would be a "step backward in the history of the legislative activities".\nAccording to Mai, the 11th National Assembly in 2002 passed the amended Law on Promulgation of Legal Documents in which one of the key changes was to let the NA collect opinions to finalise draft laws.\nThe reason for such an amendment was to give parliament the legislative power it deserved, she said, and to tackle political bias in making laws for the sake of citizens and businesses.\n“There is absolutely no reason for the (current) 14th NA not to keep the fruitful achievements left by the previous NAs,” Mai said.\nPoor laws\nHải Phòng City Deputy Mai Hồng Hải questioned the quality of laws given that there were new laws which had to be reconsidered for amendments after going into effect\xa0for only one to two years.\n“Are laws being constantly changed\xa0because life is transforming too fast or the (poor) quality of writing them?” he asked.\nHải also pointed out the annual legislative plan was disrupted every year when there were new law projects introduced to the NA’s agenda while some were withdrawn without prior notice.\nDraft laws were often sent to NA deputies very late when the NA’s meeting already neared, he complained, which made it impossible for deputies to consult local residents in their areas about the laws.\nNA Standing Committee meeting\nThe National Assembly Standing Committee convened its 39th session on Thursday under the chair of NA Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân\nThe session heard proposals and reports on the arrangement of district and communal levels administrative units, and the establishment of several urban administrative units in eight provinces, namely Bắc Giang, Thái Nguyên, Điện Biên, Bình Thuận, Hà Tĩnh, Lạng Sơn, Tuyên Quang and Phú Yên.\n\nThe committee adopted eight resolutions on the arrangement of district and communal levels administrative units, and the establishment of several urban administrative units in the provinces.\n\nThe resolutions will take effect on January 1, 2020.\n\nNA Vice Chairman Uông Chu Lưu said the Government should organise the implementation of those resolutions, and take measures to ensure political stability, social order and safety, and unity in related localities.\n\nThe session also discussed the issue of shares by organisations that are not public companies, which is stipulated at Article 30 of the draft revised Securities Law.\n\nSome personnel matters were also tabled for discussion at the session. — VNS'	politics-laws

VNA/VNS Photo Phương Hoa\nHÀ NỘI — Most National Assembly (NA) deputies agreed on the need for the draft Law on Public-Private Partnership to finalise a legal framework of this type of investment and improve the effectiveness of long-term public-private partnership (PPP) projects.\nThe bill was one of several the NA discussed yesterday.\nWhile saying the law should soon be line with international practices and reduce the burden on public investment, many deputies proposed additional regulations to control risks in PPP investment.\nAccording to Deputy Nguyễn Anh Trí from Hà Nội, shortcomings have been found in PPP investment in the past few years, citing the fact that a number of projects suffered damage and loss of value after being handed over to local authorities.\nHe said the most important thing was to issue a law with specific terms and regulations.\nTo improve the efficiency of PPP investment, the Government should create favourable regulations which were not only attractive to big corporations but also individuals to pour money into supplying public services, he said.\n“It is necessary to encourage people, including Party members and officials, who have idle money to invest in building works for the country,” he said.\nBắc Giang Province deputy Hà Thị Lan agreed, saying PPP investment had contributed significantly to the development of the country’s major projects.\nHowever, no specific and strict regulations relating to this type of investment had been set. The issuance of the law on PPP was essential, she said.\nLan said the total investment of the project as stipulated in the draft Law of not lower than VNĐ 200 billion (US$8.6 million) was unreasonable and needed to be adjusted to attract domestic and foreign investors.\nRisk sharing\nRegarding risks in the management of PPP projects, Vũ Thị Lưu Mai, a deputy from Hà Nội, said PPP referred to voluntary economic agreements between the State and investors. Before signing the contract, investors must envision two factors - profit and risk - the greater the profit, the higher the risk.\nA draft law on PPP that allowed investors to increase fees and extend the fee collection period would affect the interests of citizens, she said.\n“In accordance with the draft law, the State will share 50 per cent of the risk for large-scale projects. How will it be implemented?” Mai said.\nDeputy Mai also suggested the compiling committee include provisions to determine the level of risk or which agency is authorised for risk identification.\nDeputy Lan from Bắc Giang said, as regulated by the draft law, the State Audit of Việt Nam (SAV) only auditing State capital in resettlement projects was not reasonable because it was very difficult to control risk during project implementation.\nShe said the SAV should cover projects related to public assets.\n“Allowing the SAV to audit all PPP projects helps the State have more effective monitoring channels and certainly does not affect investor attraction," Lan said.\nTo finalise the draft law, NA deputies asked the compiling committee to review areas of investment and specify the minimum scale of investment for each field.\nThey also suggested revising provisions on the appointment of contractors and reviewing regulations on issuing corporate bonds and other related content. — VNS'	politics-laws

It marked\xa0the mid-term review of the ASEAN Community’s Master Plan 2015-25, while\xa0Việt Nam would\xa0celebrate its 25th\xa0anniversary as a member of the bloc.\nHighlighting that Việt Nam’s Chairmanship was\xa0a major responsibility that could provide many\xa0opportunities for\xa0Việt Nam, he said: “Việt Nam will spare no efforts to successfully act as ASEAN Chairman 2020, making contributions to building a cohesive and consolidated ASEAN Community.”\nHe said Việt Nam had\xa0selected the theme “Cohesive and Responsive” for ASEAN 2020.

As ASEAN Chairman, Việt Nam represented\xa0ASEAN at\xa0the UN and also acted\xa0as a bridge between ASEAN and the UN to carry out ASEAN plans in synchronisation with UN\xa0goals.\n“We have to focus on the\xa0diversified viewpoints of many groups as well as protect ASEAN's interests.

Infrastructure-wise, all schools, classrooms and medical stations are expected to be built or upgraded with duration in mind, 100 per cent of communes are expected to have cement roads leading to the their centres, 99 per cent of households have access to the national power grid or other suitable power sources, 90 per cent of the residents have access to clean water and 100 per cent of the population have access to television and radio.\nBy 2030, ethnic minority groups would have their income equal to half the national average, with the rate of poor households slipping to under 10 per cent and no destitute communes and hamlets. 70 per cent of the communes in remote or ethnic minority-dominated regions will achieve new rural area status. The plan also sets the targets of having 40 per cent of the ethnic minority population being capable or trained in industrial jobs, tourism and service sectors, while 80 per cent of rural households are to be engaged in commercial agricultural production.\nUp to 100 per cent of all ethnic minority households living in geographically remote areas, special-use forests or natural disaster-prone zones would be relocated to more suitable living spaces.\nNotably, the plan also indicates that credit and financial support for ethnic minority groups and poor regions will switch from direct, monetary aid to conditional loans – with the money both used to invest into production and cover the costs for training and technical support, in order to enhance the effectiveness of the loans and efforts at sustainable poverty reduction.\nThe plan has received widespread support from NA members, especially those representing the voices and interests from ethnic minority and upland areas.\nDeputy Thào Xuân Sùng from the northern mountainous province of Hà Giang’s delegation said that the plan was clearly well-prepared and has taken into consideration feedback from several parties and reflected the will of ethnic minority groups in the country.\nThe adoption of the plan showcases the State and the people’s resolution on implementing policies to help push forward equity, unity, and respect between 54 ethnic minority groups in Việt Nam.\nStressing that when the State provides the right kind of support, Thào Xuân Sùng said that there should be policies and incentives in place to encourage scientists and businesses to invest and transfer technology to ethnic minority regions to help build sustainable livelihoods and accelerate poverty reduction.\n“Some might not know how to use fertiliser to maximise the output and quality of the crops. Not all could understand the impacts of climate and weather on agriculture and livestock production, scientifically. Traditional wisdom is not enough when the value chain production model is needed,” deputy Sùng said.\nTriệu Thế Hùng, a deputy from the Central Highlands Province of Lâm Đồng, said that the plan is “meaningful and profound, politically and socially speaking.”\nIn addition to economic development, the plan has also paid proper attention to the issues of education and culture for ethnic minority groups in remote and mountainous regions. — VNS'	politics-laws

Việt Nam was one of the first 107 countries to sign and ratify the convention.\nAddressing the ceremony, Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyễn Quốc Dũng underlined that seas and oceans\xa0not only connect continents but are also sources of livelihoods and the space for activities and interaction among more than 200 countries around the globe.\nDũng noted building a legal document to resolve all issues relating to the law of the sea and establishing a legal order for the seas and oceans were vital and also the aspiration of all nations as shown in the preamble of the UNCLOS.\n"Covering all activities on the seas and oceans, the UNCLOS is considered a constitution for the seas and oceans and serves as the legal foundation for all sea-related activities at the national, regional and global levels," Dũng said, adding that 168 countries had joined this convention so far, and almost all its regulations\xa0had become international practices.\nAccording to the official, the UNCLOS has become a solid international legal basis to define the rights, obligations and responsibilities of coastal countries, and to deal with issues related to the seas and oceans.\nDũng said over the last 25 years, Việt Nam had respected the guidelines and objectives of the UNCLOS while making efforts to enforce the convention in the East Sea.\nThe country had aligned its legal system on the management and use of the sea, especially the 2012 Law of the Sea, with the UNCLOS. Besides, it had handled sea-related differences by peaceful means and in line with international law, including the UNCLOS.\nUnder this policy, Việt Nam had held negotiations on and signed treaties on maritime delimitation with neighbouring countries like Thailand, China and Indonesia. It was also promoting talks on the delimitation of the sea area beyond the mouth of the Gulf of Tonkin with China, the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone with Indonesia, and the maritime delimitation with other neighbours, he said.\nDũng added the country had stepped up maritime co-operation in a diverse and substantive manner so as to optimise the sea’s potential and deal with emerging challenges and create a peaceful and stable environment in the East Sea.\nHe pointed out many recent complex developments in the East Sea that seriously violated the rights of Việt Nam and other regional countries which are stipulated in the UNCLOS.\nViệt Nam had persistently respected and complied with the UNCLOS, respected diplomatic and legal processes, and not wrongly interpreted or intentionally played down the significance and role of the convention, he stressed, adding that when there are differences relating to the interpretation and application of the UNCLOS, concerned parties need to solve those issues via negotiations or other peaceful measures in line with international law, including the UNCLOS.\n"When differences haven’t been resolved, relevant parties need to respect and fully implement the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC); exercise self-restraint; not take unilateral actions that may complicate the situation, elevate tensions or jeopardise regional peace and stability; and take part in negotiations in a constructive\xa0manner\xa0to soon finalise an efficient and practical Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC)\xa0in conformity with the UNCLOS," Dũng said. — VNS'	politics-laws

Huế had been recognised as Việt Nam’s city of festivals, and ASEAN’s cultural and tourism city, while the complex of historical relics and landscapes had been preserved and upgraded. The poverty rate in the city had dropped significantly, and living conditions had improved.\nHowever, the province’s economic development had not matched potential, the Politburo said, pointing out that urban development was slow and infrastructure remained uneven. Urban planning and management\xa0failed to match the pace of development, while administrative reform, Party building and apparatus building work had not been up to snuff.\nTo develop\xa0Huế into a centrally-run city, the Politburo agreed to issue a resolution and asked the province’s Party organisation, administration and people to seriously implement it.\nFor Buôn Ma Thuột, the Politburo recognised the city’s efforts to tap its potential, resulting in economic growth. The city had become a first-level city of Đắk Lắk Province and was advancing in the direction of a modern city. Living conditions had improved, Party building work received attention, and the administrative apparatus was shifting toward streamlined organisation and\xa0efficient operation. National defence and security in the city had been ensured.\nAt the same time, the Politburo said the city’s economic growth had not been on par with its\xa0advantages. Buôn Ma Thuột had yet to become the central city of the Central Highlands region. Poverty reduction in the city was not sustainable, and there remained complications in security and social order in some areas. Local infrastructure was poor, and transport links with other provinces were slow to be upgraded.\nAiming to turn Buôn Ma Thuột into a green and smart city, the central hub of the Central Highlands and a growth pole of\xa0the Việt Nam-Laos-Cambodia development triangle, the Politburo issued a conclusion on building and developing Buôn Ma Thuột.\nAlso at the meeting, the Politburo made decisions on\xa0personnel matters and gave opinions on other issues.

In the context where our own sovereignty over the islands and seas is being heavily violated, regulations as stipulated in the draft amended law could lead to the risks of ill-intentioned foreigners intruding into the country under the guise of tourists,” Nguyễn Thị Kim Thuý from the central city of Đà Nẵng’s delegation, said at the ongoing meeting of the 14th National Assembly (NA) held in Hà Nội on Thursday.\n“The opening up of the border needs to go hand in hand with enhanced management, on the principle that facilitation of economic development and ease of entry for foreigners would not comprise national defence and security,” Thuý said.\nAccording to the report from the Ministry of Public Security, the number of foreigners entering Việt Nam doubled from nearly 8 million in 2015 to more than 16 million by 2018.\nChina, South Korea, Japan, US, China’s Taiwan and Russia are the countries and territories with the highest number of citizens arriving in Việt Nam – of which, Chinese nationals account for 30 per cent, with 14.8 million.\nIn 2018, most foreigners came into Việt Nam for tourism purposes, with 13 million arrivals, followed by work purposes and visiting relatives, with 1 million and 300,000 arrivals, respectively.\nAccording to the Vietnamese authorities, in the 2013-18 period, the foreign labour workforce in Việt Nam has witnessed a trend where the number of manual labourers and technicians is decreasing while the number of those holding managerial and executive positions is going up.\nCentral budget distribution\nAlso, on Thursday, the National Assembly has adopted a resolution on the distribution of Central budget in 2020,\xa0with 90.48 per cent of approval votes.\nAccording to the resolution, revenues into the Central budget would be VNĐ851.77 trillion (US$36.7 billion) while the expenditure would be more than VNĐ1.069 trillion.\nRecurrent expenditure for ministries and other State agencies account for nearly 56 per cent of all the expenditure, while the development capital takes up only one fourth of the whole.\nThe Central budget will also provide financial support for regions in the country, with the northern mountainous provinces receiving VNĐ37 trillion, the Red River delta provinces receiving VNĐ16.3 trillion, the north-central and central coastal region receiving VNĐ40.3 trillion, Central Highlands receiving VNĐ10.3 trillion, VNĐ19.1 trillion for south-eastern region and VNĐ25 trillion for the Mekong Delta.\nThe NA has tasked the Government with assigning tasks in State budget collection, spending and allocation to ministries, central agencies and centrally-run cities and provinces in line with legal regulations.\nThe Government is also in charge of allocating the remaining capital of the national target programmes on new-style rural area building and on completely treating facilities causing serious environmental pollution.\nThe Government will implement solutions to restructure public debt in accordance with the Law on Public Debt Management, and instruct People’s Committees of centrally-run cities and provinces to submit budget collection and spending estimates to People’s Councils of the same level for approval.\n\nAccording to the resolution, the Prime Minister will assign the plans on public investment sourced from the State budget in 2020 to ministries, central agencies and localities before November 30.\n\nMinistries, central agencies and localities will submit detailed allocation plans to the Ministry and Planning and Investment no later than December 31, 2019.\xa0— VNS'	politics-laws

Historical reality has proven this.”\nThe spokesperson reiterated Việt Nam’s consistent stance that all international disputes, including those relating to sovereignty over Hoàng Sa and Trường Sa, must be settled by peaceful measures in accordance with international law, including United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982.\n"Việt Nam wishes that China will join efforts in developing the bilateral relationship and maintaining peace, security and stability in the region," Hằng said.\nThe Chinese spokesperson has also asked that Việt Nam should refrain from actions that could “complicate matters or undermine peace and stability” in the East Sea, just a few weeks after a simmering stand-off between the two countries when China deployed the survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 08 and a group of escort vessels right into Vietnamese Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf, provided for by UNCLOS 1982.\nChina has also been criticised for engaging in aggressive building of manmade features in the East Sea and militarising them.\nIn 2016 July, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration – established pursuant to the UNCLOS 1982 – has ruled legally invalid China’s sweeping nine-dash claims over the East Sea in the landmark Philippines vs China case.\nHowever, China refused to take part in the tribunal process and categorically rejected the verdict.\nImportant framework\nDirector of the Department of Law and International Treaty under Việt Nam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lê Thị Tuyết Mai, Canadian Ambassador to Việt Nam Deborah Paul, and EU Ambassador to Việt Nam Giorgio Aliberti have affirmed the crucial role of the UNCLOS in managing activities of nations at sea over the past 25 years and said the convention is an important framework for countries to address disputes and enhance maritime cooperation, during the second ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) workshop on implementing UNCLOS held on Wednesday in Hà Nội.\nBased on the convention, a number of initiatives have been proposed to promote cooperation between ASEAN member nations, and between the bloc and its dialogue partners to cope with marine security challenges.\nDuring the two-day workshop, participants focus discussions on measures to increase the efficiency of implementing the UNCLOS and related international legal documents in addressing maritime challenges such as sovereignty disputes, delimitation of maritime boundary, law enforcement at sea, maritime pollution, and climate change as well as terrorism and piracy.\nThey will also exchange views on new developments in the interpretation of the UNCLOS, share experience and new realities in law enforcement at sea and put forth recommendations to further reinforce cooperation between nations and strengthen the role of mechanisms and frameworks in sea and ocean governance. — VNS'	politics-laws

A private enterprise, meanwhile, needn’t hold bidding,” he said.\nCường also said it was too rushed to conclude that only the ACV had relevant experience in the field. And even if the AVC was the best of its kind, the deputy added, the case of Vân Đồn Airport proved the private sector could also pull off the job.\nRegarding investment capital for the airport, Cường was doubtful the ACV was the best option available. The corporation would have to borrow $2.67 billion of the $4.2 billion of the total investment for the project, according to a review of the project by the NA’s Standing Committee.\n“Three fourths of the investment will be from loans with complicated procedures and the risks are on the State,” he said.\n“In the meantime, there are many private companies which are always willing to invest and are very flexible in mobilising capital.”\nLạng Sơn deputy Nguyễn Lâm Thành also questioned the ACV’s financial capability despite the Government’s claim that the enterprise could mobilise money from its stable revenues at 21 airports.\nAccording to Thành, only eight of 21 domestic airports earn enough to cover their expenses or are profitable. The rest face losses and won't be able to contribute money to the ACV in the near future.\nThe mega project Long Thành International Airport in Đồng Nai Province is expected to need total investment of VNĐ336.6 trillion ($14.6 billion). The new airport is hoped to alleviate overloads at Tân Sơn Nhất Airport in HCM City. — VNS\nNA approves basic monthly salary raise\nHÀ NỘI — The National Assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution on the State budget for 2020, agreeing to raise the basic monthly salary for civil servants to VNĐ1.6 million (US$69).\nMore than 93 per cent of the NA voted for the resolution.\nAccording to the resolution, the State’s revenue next year is estimated at VNĐ1.5 quadrillion ($65.2 billion) while it will spend about VNĐ1.7 quadrillion ($73.9 billion).\nThe Government is allowed to overspend VNĐ234 trillion, about 3.44 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).\nIn particular, the central Government’s overspending is estimated at VNĐ217.8 trillion and VNĐ17 trillion for municipal governments.\nThe NA also approved the total amount of loans for the State to get in 2020 at nearly VNĐ488.9 trillion.\nCivil servants can expect a raise of VNĐ101,000 in their basic monthly salary from the current VNĐ1.49 million to VNĐ1.6 million since July 1 next year.\nAn officer’s monthly salary will be based on the basic salary multiplied with a variety of elements, including the number of working years and education level. — VNS"	politics-laws

163	'NA adopts socio-economic resolution for 2020, targeting 6.8% GDP growth'	'National Assembly deputies voted on the adoption of the Resolution on Socio-economic Development Plan for 2020 on Monday morning in Hà Nội. — VNA/VNS Photo Lâm Khánh\nHÀ NỘI — The National Assembly (NA) this morning approved the Resolution on Socio-economic Development Plan for the year 2020, targeting 6.8 per cent GDP growth and improvements to national competitiveness.\nA total of 430 legislators took part in the vote during the ongoing 8th session of the 14th NA tenure, with 426 in favour of the resolution, or 88.2 per cent approval, with two against and two abstaining.\nVũ Hồng Thanh, Chair of NA Committee of Economic Affairs, said that many have called for revisions of targeted GDP growth to “upwards of 6.8 per cent” or “within 6.7 to 6.8 per cent” in the resolution but the NA Standing Committee, the top body in the Vietnamese parliament, didn’t agree.\nThe 6.8 per cent GDP growth is a reasonable increase, ensuring harmonious relations between the need for economic growth and inflation control, Thanh said.\nThe resolution’s main goals are to maintain the stability of macroeconomic foundations, keeping inflation under control, raising productivity, efficiency, resilience, and competitiveness of the economy, while at the same time improving institutions and creating a fair and open business and investment environment.\nThe legislative body also noted that the Government and agencies must prioritise resources towards climate-resilient programmes and preventing the worst of climate change and natural disasters, to which Việt Nam is among the world’s most vulnerable countries.\nThe resolution wanted the increase of the Consumer Price Index to be below 4 per cent.\nAccording to the resolution, exports are set to grow by 7 per cent in 2020 but the economy will still experience a trade deficit, with export value growth trailing behind import value growth by about 3 per cent.\nThe figure was previously questioned by several NA members as Việt Nam for the last four years (2016-19) has enjoyed a trade surplus.\nMinister of Industry and Trade Trần Tuấn Anh said the caution was due to unpredictable headwinds in the global economy in 2020, with more trade disputes between countries and the rise of protectionism – some countries are ready to violate the covenant of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to protect domestic production.\nTuấn Anh also said that due to the ongoing US-China trade war and the upcoming ratification of the EU-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement, there will likely be an influx of foreign investors and foreign investment into Việt Nam, leading to higher imports of machinery, equipment and materials.\nThe ministry estimated that import growth in 2020 will be around 8-10 per cent, while the export growth will reach 6-7 per cent, meaning that the difference will be about 3 per cent, tipped towards imports.\nNA also asked for expedited\xa0implementation of national key infrastructure projects, including the North-South expressway, the Long Thành international airport in southern Việt Nam, and other major projects aimed at boosting regional connectivity.\nSocial targets\nIn terms of society, according to the resolution, development capital is to be 33-34 per cent of GDP, the rate of poor households – delineated by the multidimensional poverty approach – to fall by 1-1.5 per cent (and 4 per cent in mountainous households).\nThe rate of labourers that have undergone training will reach 65 per cent, with the rate of trained labourers who have obtained degrees and qualification certifications reaching 25 per cent.\nThe State-sponsored health insurance’s coverage is expected to reach 90.7 per cent of the population, with the number of hospital beds per 10,000 residents reaching 28 (up one compared to 2019’s objective).\nTying in with the resolution’s target of reaching forest coverage of 42 per cent, the Government is also told to expend all efforts to maintain the existing natural forest area and improve management of the environment.\nThe rate of industrial zones outfitted with wastewater treatment systems must reach 90 per cent, according to the resolution.\nRegarding foreign affairs, the Resolution also listed objectives such as performing the duties that come with the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council when Việt Nam holds these two positions next year.\nThe resolution also stressed the upholding of territorial sovereignty and maintenance of peace and stability as a foundation for economic development.\nPrevention of natural disasters law\nAlso on Monday, the NA heard the report on the draft amended law on prevention of natural disasters and the Law on Dykes.\nPresenting the draft amended law, Chair of NA Science, Technology and Environment Committee Phan Xuân Dũng approved of the new regulation which would form an anti-disaster task force at the commune level, with the core being the local militia and other organisations, in order to timely carry out necessary actions right in their neighbourhoods in case of natural disasters.\nHowever, the committee asked that the Government must clarify the role of this new task force and reconcile these new duties with their existing duties stated in the Law on National Defence.\nThe Government was also asked to make clear who has the authority to mobilise these task forces as well as the support policies for the task forces’ members.\nAccording to the report, State budget has\xa0only been able to cover only 20 per cent of the economic losses caused by natural disasters in localities.\nTherefore, many local governments have started to engage private sector in the construction of costly projects like land reclamation or dykes. However, there is a lack of detailed policies to encourage investments into this field as well as mechanisms to exploit these projects and reinvest into anti-natural disaster projects. — VNS'	politics-laws

As a result, the draft\xa0revised law will only make some changes to the Law on the Organisation of the Local Government.\nProposed changes in the law will focus on the decentralisation of tasks\xa0between central and local governments; between local administrations; the number of people sitting\xa0People’s Councils at different levels; and\xa0the number of vice chairs\xa0of district People’s Committees. The other major change\xa0in the law is there will only be two full-time people working in each Provincial People’s Council.\nOther changes\xa0are definitions of a "local government" at different levels. For example, the revised law says: “Local administrations at district level will have a\xa0People’s Council and People’s Committee.”\nSome National Assembly deputies have said the draft law should delegate more power to the leaders of People’s Committees. How do you respond to that proposal?\nThe current law on local administration states\xa0clearly the rights and responsibilities\xa0of People’s Committees at all levels. However, these\xa0are subject\xa0to supervision from\xa0local People’s Councils and socio-political organisations, particularly the people and the media. It is believed such a mechanism will help avoid misuse of power, particularly by members of the people’s committees.\nIn the draft law, a commune in the third category\xa0will have only one vice chairman, not three as in the first and\xa0second categories. Why is that?\nThe number of vice chairpeople\xa0in a commune of the third category will depend on the administrative category level of the commune. Under the current law, People’s Committees in\xa0the second and third categories have only one vice chair. A survey on the implementation of the 2015 Law on Local Administration showed\xa0the number of vice chairs\xa0of People’s Committees in\xa0the second and third categories had dropped considerably, harming the operation of communal People’s Committees.\nBased on the\xa0survey, the Government has decided a commune in the second\xa0category should\xa0have no more than two vice chairpeople while a commune in\xa0the third category will still have only one.\nHow do you respond to\xa0requests for\xa0the law be more specific in power delineation and classification to avoid overlapping and repetition?\nThe Law on Organisation of the Local Administration states\xa0clearly the principles of decentralisation and empowerment from the central Government to local governments,\xa0and other respective laws.\nEach local administration level should comprise of a\xa0People’s Council and People’s Committee. They will be\xa0organised to\xa0conform\xa0with the characteristics of rural/urban areas, islands and\xa0special administrative-economic zones\xa0as\xa0prescribed by\xa0law. —\xa0VNS'	politics-laws

167	"Reluctance to act biggest threat to VN's development: PM"	'Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc speaks at the National Assembly (NA) on the last day of a series of cabinet hearings yesterday.— VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — The greatest challenge to Việt Nam\'s development was a lack of aspiration to move forward while the biggest threat was reluctance to take action due to fear of responsibility, said Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc yesterday.\nIn his speech to the National Assembly (NA) on the last day of a series of cabinet hearings, Phúc reiterated the difficulties and hurdles on the way to Việt Nam becoming a developed, industrialised country by the middle of the century.\n“Eradicating poverty is hard enough, but making the country prosperous and stable while closing the gap and catching up with other developed countries will be even harder,” he told the NA.\n“The greatest challenge is not escaping the middle income trap but a lack of aspiration to go higher. The biggest threat is not (risks of) lagging economy but reluctance for actions for fear of responsibilities,” Phúc said.\nViệt Nam’s key driving force for growth and development was no longer natural resources, he said, but the population of nearly 100 million Vietnamese people.\n“Our political system is committed to take care of every single one so that none are left behind.”\n‘Dangerous matter’\nVietnamese-made social networks hope to have 90 million users by the end of 2020, the communications minister said on Friday.\nMinister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng told the NA that the ambitious number – given that the country’s population was 96.2 million in 2019 – could be reached with “public support in preferring Vietnamese products”.\nHùng took the hot seat on Friday as the NA continued into its third day of cabinet hearings with deputies bombarding the minister with questions over issues including fake news, spam phone calls and the development of e-Government.\nResponding to questions from HCM City deputy Tô Thị Bích Châu and Đồng Tháp deputy Nguyễn Thị Mai Hoa over the development of the Vietnamese digital ecosystem including social networks, Hùng said he set up a task force to support made-in-Việt Nam social networks as soon as he took office last year. His goal was to attract as many users as those of foreign platforms in Việt Nam – most notably, Facebook.\n“After one year, Vietnamese social networks have gained growth of 30 per cent with some 65 million users,” the minister said.\nThree new domestic social networks, namely Lotus, Gapo and Hahalolo, were introduced within months in 2019, joining in the race to attract users against other Vietnamese networks Zalo and Mocha as well as foreign players like Facebook and Google.\nThose international platforms generated more or less 90 million users in Việt Nam a month, Hùng said.\nThe US social network Facebook had the biggest share of the pie with between 60 and 65 million active users monthly, according to the company.\n“Now what we think, say, buy and even who we love, all can be found on social networks. It means that Vietnamese’ brains are staying in one place and it’s not in Việt Nam,” Hùng said.\n“What will they (foreign networks) do with it? It’s a very dangerous matter, a matter of national security.”\nThe minister, however, said the Government did not aim to replace foreign social networks with domestic ones.\n“Việt Nam has integrated and opened for investment. But to do business anyone in Việt Nam must abide by Vietnamese law and make Việt Nam more prosperous. Foreign social networks can exist alongside domestic ones if they follow Vietnamese law,” Hùng told the NA.\n‘Fake news battle’\nThe Government’s push to switch netizens to domestic social networks is part of its efforts to tackle the fake news epidemic.\nMinister Hùng cited an example saying that a task force of the communications detected and tried to remove 207 fake social media accounts and websites that spread disinformation over the last two months.\nOf those impersonation cases, 46 were "involved with names of Party and Government leaders", he added.\nHùng said other countries had already made laws to address misinformation, for example Singapore where fake news spreaders are subject to fines of millions of dollars and jail terms.\n“The Prime Minister has asked the Ministry of Public Security to co-ordinate with the Ministry of Information and Communications to soon issue legal regulations to battle fake news,” Hùng said.\nHe added that the communications ministry was working to find ways to identify users of social networks, and would require foreign social networks provide their users’ information upon request as regulated in the recently-adopted cybersecurity law.\nThe long-term solution to battle misinformation, however, should be education to raise awareness of citizens to learn how to distinguish between real and fake news, the minister said. — VNS\nBOX\nNever let such a tragedy happen again\nHÀ NỘI — Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on Friday called for never letting the tragedy in which 39 Vietnamese people died inside a lorry in the UK repeat itself.\n“Our deepest sympathies go to Vietnamese citizens who were lost in the tragedy that occurred recently in the UK.

The VNA again won a seat on the OANA Executive Board.\nThe WAFA News Agency of Palestine has become an observer of the organisation.\nOANA members agreed to adopt the minutes amending the OANA Statute, which was approved at the 44th Executive Board Meeting in Ha Noi in April.\nIn the Seoul Declaration adopted at the meeting, the agencies pointed out challenges they are facing amidst the development of technology and the spread of fake news.\nOn this occasion, the 45th and 46th meetings of the OANA Executive Board were also held in Seoul.\nThe Executive Board elected Lee Dong-min, a journalist of Yonhap, as OANA Secretary General.\nWithin the framework of the 17th General Assembly, the VNA and Xinhua, first-prize winners of the OANA Award for Excellence in News Agency Quality as announced at the 44th Executive Board Meeting, were honoured.\nOn the sidelines of the event, VNA General Director Lợi met with Yonhap President and CEO Cho, who said he highly valued the fruitful relations between the two news agencies.\nThe host expressed his hope for more support and co-operation from the VNA in the future.\nLợi said the relationship with Yonhap was one of the most successful, effective and diverse ties between the VNA and its partners.\nThe VNA’s VNEWS TV Channel and e-newspaper were using effectively TV news of Yonhap, he said, calling on the agency to produce and share news of more diverse content in both Korean and Vietnamese with the VNA.\nOANA now has 44 member news agencies from 35 countries in the region. The agencies are responsible for two-thirds of information produced throughout the world. Every day, they publish around 200 news stories, photos and video clips on the OANA website\xa0http://www.oananews.org.\nSince joining the OANA in 1969, the VNA has proven itself as one of the active members of the organisation.

His goal was to attract as many users as those of foreign social networks in Việt Nam – most notably,\xa0Facebook.\n“After one year, Vietnamese social networks have gained growth of 30 per cent with some 65 million users,” the minister said.\nThree new domestic social networks, namely Lotus, Gapo and Hahalolo, were introduced within months in 2019, joining in the race to attract users against other Vietnamese networks Zalo and Mocha as well as the biggest player being\xa0Facebook. The US social network has between 60 and 65 million monthly active users, according to the company.\n“Now what we think, say, buy and even whom we love, all can be found on social networks. It means that the Vietnamese’ brains are staying in one place and it’s not in Việt Nam,” Hùng said.\n“What will they (foreign networks) do with it? It’s a very dangerous matter, a matter of national security.”\nThe minister, however, affirmed that the Government did not set the goal of replacing foreign social networks with domestic ones.\n“Việt Nam has integrated and opened for investment. But anyone in Việt Nam to do business must abide by Vietnamese law and make Việt Nam more prosperous. Foreign social networks can exist alongside domestic ones if they follow Vietnamese law,” Hùng told the NA. — VNS'	politics-laws

Currently, the investor and general contractor have not reached an agreement and the contractor is submitting a lawsuit to an international court.\nAnh said he would coordinate with the investor to accelerate the implementation under the direction of the Government.\nThe Long Phú 1 thermal power project is invested by Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PVN), with a total capital of over VNĐ29.5 trillion (US$1.2 billion). The first unit was expected to be completed by October 30, 2018, and the second by February 29, 2019.\nRegarding Bạc Liêu Wind Power Project, the minister said he had received a report from local authorities and had submitted it to the Government.\nCommenting on the risk of electricity shortages, which is a concern for many deputies, Deputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng said despite efforts of the electricity industry, the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) and Vietnam Electricity to meet demand, the development of the electricity system faced huge challenges.\n“If we do not adopt an effective and drastic solution to solve the problem, the risk of electricity shortage is high in the coming years,” he said.\nDũng emphasised the need to revise the power development\xa0plan due to changes in electricity structure.\nThe Deputy PM said the Government would take measures to ensure there will be enough electricity for domestic consumption and production.\nPriority would be given to removing obstacles for key projects including Thái Bình 2 thermal power project and accelerate the progress of other projects like Quảng Trạch, Nhơn Trạch Thermal Power projects, he said.\nThanh Hóa Province deputy Mai Sỹ Diên raised his concern that enterprises from countries which are being punished by the United States and the European Union might take advantage of Việt Nam\'s export policies. This might lead to the possibility that Việt Nam would be investigated and face anti-dumping measures, causing damage to genuine Vietnamese businesses.\nAnh said there is a list of 25 items that are at risk of commercial fraud under the trade remedy mechanism.\nAccording to Anh, it is necessary to have coordination between the Ministry of Planning and Investment and relevant agencies to instruct localities in preventing trade fraud from monitoring illegal investment.\nThe minister admitted that there has been a phenomenon of purchasing foreign goods and then assembled or adhered with Vietnamese labels for consumption in the domestic market.\n"It is\xa0an act of infringing upon the interest of consumers and violated the Law on Measurement and Quality and the Consumer Protection Law,"\xa0he said.\nAnh agreed with deputies’ opinions on the need for a legal basis to regulate acts related to the abuse of fraudulent consumption in the Vietnamese market.

In general, Việt Nam’s agricultural economy had been developing on the right track.\n“With only total cultivation area of 10 million hectares, the country had produced 4.5 million tonnes of food, 5.5 million tonnes of meat and 8 million tonnes of fish,” he said.\nHowever, the biggest shortcoming of the sector was processing and consumption.\n“If this is not fixed, the problem of ‘bumper crops but low prices’ would repeat themselves again and again,” he said.\nPepper was an example. In recent years, in the Tây Nguyên (Central Highlands) provinces, the crop had been overproduced.\nViệt Nam produced 350,000 tonnes of pepper every year, accounting for 60 per cent of the world’s output.\n"That was too much," Cường said, adding that therefore, in the future, it was necessary to find solutions to re-organise production in terms of production chains and enhancement of processing and consumption.\nThe minister would continue his Q&A session in the afternoon. — VNS'	politics-laws

179	'Respect for international law crucial in East Sea'	'Eleventh South China Sea International Conference on “Cooperation for Regional Peace and Development”, organised by the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam in cooperation with the Việt Nam Lawyers Association and the Foundation for East Sea Studies, opened on Wednesday in Hà Nôi. — VNA/VNS Photo Văn Điệp\nHÀ NỘI — Experts and policymakers agreed that the rule of law and respect for international law are central principles in handling the South China Sea (known as East Sea in Việt\xa0Nam) issue at an international conference that began\xa0yesterday in Hà Nội.\nThe two-day\xa0event\xa0–\xa0drawing\xa050 speakers and some 250 officials, scholars and diplomats from Việt Nam and abroad – commenced shortly after a months-long standoff between Viet Nam and\xa0China in the waters over a survey ship, accompanied by coast guard vessels, encroaching the Vietnamese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\nDr. Nicola Casarini from the Istituto Affari Internazionali of Italy said at the second plenary session on “The South China Sea in Competing Visions” that Beijing continues to challenge the rules-based order in the area by building artificial islands with military facilities and weapons systems, drilling for oil and gas, and chasing off its Southeast Asian neighbours’ fishing vessels from waters where they have the rights to fish in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\nDeputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lê Hoài Trung said unilateral interpretation of international law in a way that goes against the international community’s common interest “undermined the rule of law” and “eroded trust in the international legal system” as he made a keynote speech at the 11th edition of the two-day South China Sea International Conference, themed \'Cooperation for regional security and development\'.\nThese moves could become “dangerous precedents that threaten regional and global peace, stability and security,” Trung said.\nThe diplomat said security and maritime safety in the South China Sea are critical for global trade and prosperity.\nNguyễn Vũ Tùng, Director of the Diplomatic Academy of Việt Nam, noted the “complicated developments” in the resource-rich sea area in the past 10 years.\nTùng said dialogue and co-operation continue to be the “main stream” – as manifested by the fact that ASEAN countries and China finished the first reading of the Single Draft Negotiating of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea in late July this year, in addition to marine drills between ASEAN and China as well the US – which helps foster trust and maintain security in the region.\n“However, militarisation, conflicts and escalation of tensions continue to be a worry – with acts of threatening or using asymmetric powers on the rise while the effectiveness of the international law system is challenged by parties who wish to impose their own interpretation of the law in their favour,” Tùng said.\nTùng said the South China Sea should\xa0be seen as a “connective sea” between oceans, “the meeting place of interests between countries within and outside the region."\nThis is basically the viewpoint\xa0within the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific region that the bloc adopted earlier this year, he said, referring to a document that confirmed the ASEAN stance on the policy to link the Indian and Asia-Pacific oceans.\nPeace and co-operation for development is the prevalent trend in general, with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS 1982) serving as the legal framework to settle disputes, while the South China Sea is situated within a region that draws attention from the entire world, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Trung said.\nHe added\xa0that coastal countries have claimed to respect international co-operation and there is a wealth of experience in settling overlapping claims via peaceful measures.\nHowever, Trung also wanted to note the ambiguity in the conformity of claimant countries and interpretation of UNCLOS 1982 in the settlement of disputes and differences, the wide-ranging nature of issues contained within challenges like maritime cooperation or overlapping claims, and how to make sure that competition will not outweigh co-operation.\nSpeaking to the media, John Rennie Short, professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in the US, said the forum serves as important platform for the world to hear about the positions of Asian countries – especially Việt Nam and the Philippines – as the South China Sea issue is usually “framed in terms of China or China versus the US.”\nViệt Nam needs to keep promoting its position and making a strong case to the wider world, particularly “the argument that things could be controlled by the rule of law rather than Chinese unilateral actions,” he said, especially as Việt Nam has virtually become the “frontline” against Chinese ambitions in the South China Sea.\nHowever, the US-based professor expressed optimism that as time goes by, ASEAN countries will get more interconnected not only in economic matters but also in terms of strategic interests and become “a more coherent unit” similar to that of the European Union, making the regional grouping\xa0a “stronger counterweight.”\nThe 11th edition of the annual conference includes six plenary and six roundtable sessions, focusing on various themes.\nAs part of the conference, a special session will be held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the 1982 UNCLOS, which became effective in November 1994. — VNS'	politics-laws
180	'Environmental violations and property scams focus of NA discussion'	'Deputy Trần Thị Quốc Khánh from Hà Nội delegation spoke at National Assembly\'s Tuesday session. — VNA/VNS Photo Văn Điệp\nHÀ NỘI — Environment violations, property scams and judicial sector’s workforce were the hot topic during Tuesday discussions of reports on legal violations and prevention of crime in the ongoing sitting of the National Assembly.\nTrần Thị Quốc Khánh, a legislator from Hà Nội, said "pollution is currently one of the public main concerns" despite efforts from Government.\nViolations were discovered but not handled strictly enough and did not serve to deter similar acts, she said.\n“The Government said in its report that the crimes regarding environment violations are ‘hard to define,’ which I find not persuasive. Have the relevant agencies failed to fully carry out their duties and only handled the violations with administrative fines, while forgoing possible criminal liability,” Khánh said, asking the Government to clarify further on this issue.\nNgô Sách Thực, from Bắc Giang, said emissions beyond allowed limit in industrial zones, improper treatment of toxic waste or importing of outdated machines or scraps, and water pollution as a result of livestock farming are still commonplace, resulting in health hazards to the public.\n“Only 1.58 per cent of the environmental violations are treated as criminal cases, which is only a minuscule ratio in the 22,535 cases discovered this year alone,” he said.\nHe added that despite potential widespread impacts, in the current Penal Code, there is no environmental crime considered to be “particularly serious,” given that environmental offenders won’t be given serious prison sentences.\nHe called for all administrative fines against environmental offences to be reviewed and adjusted if needed, especially against repeat offenders.\nDuring the discussions, NA deputies also asked for tougher actions against real estate scammers.\nGia Lai Province’s deputy Đinh Duy Vượt said real estate is currently a hotbed, rife with scammers – and in many cases – organised gangs are using sophisticated methods to cheat customers.\nMany unscrupulous real estate agents create imagined property projects, organised huge PR campaigns to attract buyers and ask them to pay up some money as “investors” of the project.\nThe buyers only realised they have been cheated and the projects were either not approved by authorities or did not go through proper legal procedures when it was too late, ruining many lives of innocent investors, Vượt said,\nHe asked police and the courts to investigate whether there is “support” from corrupt officials within Government’s agencies and local authorities.\nStaff slash\nRegarding concerns over staffing issues, Chief Justice of the Supreme People’s Court Nguyễn Hoà Bình said cases kept rising at a rate of 10 per cent annually.\nIn 2019, the number of cases increased by 12 per cent or 70,000 compared to last year.\nBình said as the scope of the economy and the population rise, it’s expected workload and pressure placed on judges and the court in general will be heavier, leading to many resigning.\nFacing this situation, the chief justice asked the judicial sector not to streamline the public workforce.\n"Issues such as housing, transport, hospital, education as well as utilities like electricity or water can all make use of privatisation or public-private partnerships, but the judicial activities can only be the realm of the State," Bình said.\nDeputy Judge of HCM City People’s Court Trịnh Ngọc Thuý said the salary for judges and court workers is not at a “liveable” level while the workload is mounting.\n“We could only let the judges resign if they are truly ill. In other cases, we encouraged them to stay on and quit at a different time, because we honestly don’t have enough money to cover the job-loss allowances,” Thuý said, adding that these people would no longer work conscientiously during the “wait,” subsequently affecting the morale and performance of the courts. — VNS'	politics-laws

Strong efforts have been made by locals preserving their culture and national identity.\nHowever, the Politburo also pointed out shortcomings in the implementation. Ethnic people still faced huge difficulties in their daily life. The rate of poor and near poor households remained high and the gap between the rich and the poor was increasing.\nThe Politburo blamed it on the fact that some policies enacted have failed to give priority to the socio-economic development of people in ethnic minority and mountainous areas.\nDue attention has not been paid to promote the potential and advantages of each region.\nThe lack of coordination between agencies in the implementation of some projects was also a problem.\nTo boost sustainable development, the Politburo emphasised the need to determine that ethnic tasks are important in the strategy of developing society and the economy of Việt Nam.\nLocal authorities and agencies were urged to complete the legal system relating to ethnic minority people.\nThey were asked to shift economic structure in line with market demand and mobilise resources to fully tap the potential of the relevant localities to reduce the gap with other regions.\nIt was necessary to enhance the quality of education in these areas.\nAccess to healthcare services for ethnic minority people should also be improved. A strategy on malnutrition prevention and combating should be set up as well as the one on enhancing health and stature among ethnic minority youth.\nAttention should be paid to strengthen human resource quality with a view to boosting the proportion of officials and employees who are from ethnic minority families in public administrative agencies. — VNS'	politics-laws

The visit is also expected to promote Việt Nam’s image as a country of reforms with active and responsible engagement in regional co-operation.\nAdvancing partnership for sustainability\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was established on August 8, 1967. Meanwhile, the ASEAN Community officially came into being on December 31, 2015 with a view to becoming a community that is “politically cohesive, economically integrated and socially responsible, oriented towards the people and centres on the people” on the basis of the ASEAN Charter and the ASEAN Community Vision 2025.\nThe bloc also aims to bring into play its central role in an open, transparent and rules-based order to maintain peace, security, stability and development in the region.\nIn 2019, under the chair of Thailand, ASEAN has continued to strengthen co-operation and connectivity under the theme “Advancing Partnership for Sustainability”, which is meant to consolidate the sustainability in its three pillars (the ASEAN Political-Security Community, the ASEAN Economic Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community), and associate the group’s development targets with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.\nViệt Nam contributes to ASEAN development\nSince it became a member of ASEAN on July 28, 1995, Việt Nam has made important contributions to the development of the bloc.\nThe country has co-ordinated with other member nations to build important orientations and policies for the bloc, including the ASEAN Vision 2020 and the ASEAN Vision 2025, the Hà Nội Plan of Action, the Declaration of ASEAN Concord II on the formation of the ASEAN Community, the ASEAN Charter, and the 2009-2015 Roadmap for an ASEAN Community.\nViệt Nam has also successfully served in important rotational roles of the association such as host of the 6th ASEAN Summit in 1998, Chair of the ASEAN Standing Committee in 2000-01, and Chair of ASEAN in 2010. It has been an active co-ordinator of ASEAN’s relations with major partners like the US, Russia, the European Union, India and Japan, while greatly helping with the formation, expansion and consolidation of ASEAN-led institutions.\nIt has always laid emphasis on the bloc’s solidarity and unanimity while helping to build and bring into play tools and mechanisms to ensure regional security, promote the building of trust and share common standards of conduct in the region, while solidify the group’s centrality through ASEAN-led mechanisms and forums. The country has also actively contributed to common efforts by ASEAN to respond to issues affecting regional peace and security, including those relevant to the East Sea.\nBesides, Việt Nam has taken the lead in regional economic integration and is one of the two countries to have fulfilled the highest percentage of commitments in the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint (95.5 per cent, following Singapore). The country has worked hard to help boost the building and implementation of economic co-operation agreements within ASEAN, as well as between the group and its partners. It has contributed co-operation initiatives in such fields as supporting micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises; facilitating trade; developing e-commerce; enhancing connectivity; and narrowing the development gap in ASEAN.\nMany practical co-operation ideas oriented towards the people have also been proposed by Việt Nam, including those on social welfare, support for vulnerable groups, education, healthcare, epidemic prevention, environmental protection and climate change adaptation.\nViệt Nam will serve as ASEAN Chair in 2020, which will be an important year for the realisation of the ASEAN Vision 2025 and also mark the country’s 25th anniversary as a member of the association.\nBuilding the ASEAN Community\nThe 35th ASEAN Summit is expected to be attended by leaders of the 10 member countries, the bloc’s partners (China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, India, Australia, New Zealand, the US and Russia), and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\nThe events are set to discuss measures to boost the building of the ASEAN Community and the implementation of the blueprints of the ASEAN Community Vision 2025. They will also look into initial implementation and ways to continue carrying out the ASEAN Leaders’ Vision Statement on Partnership for Sustainability, which was adopted at the 34th ASEAN Summit earlier this year; the priorities for 2019 under the theme “Advancing Partnership for Sustainability”; and orientations for the group in the coming years.\nAt the summit, participants are going to discuss measures to bolster extensive win-win relations with partners, review the implementation of action plans between ASEAN and its partners, and mobilise partners’ support for community building. They will also talk about the enhancement of ASEAN’s centrality in an evolving regional architecture, including promoting the possibility of co-operation in responding to global economic vagaries, adapting to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and dealing with global challenges like climate change, terrorism, trans-national crimes and cybersecurity.\nThe ASEAN chairmanship will be handed over to Việt Nam after the summit’s closing ceremony.\nAt the hand-over ceremony, PM Nguyễn Xuân Phúc will deliver a speech introducing the theme and major orientations for the ASEAN Year 2020. The country will also unveil a logo for the year and screen a video introducing its ASEAN chairmanship. — VNS'	politics-laws

VNA/VNS Photo Dương Giang\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0The National Assembly (NA) began an important discussion on socio-economic development and State budget performance in 2019 and plans for 2020 on Wednesday.\nMany deputies appreciated the socio-economic results achieved in 2019 and concurred with the findings and solutions stated in the Government\'s report.\nThey said that Việt Nam had\xa0attained comprehensive and impressive achievements in the\xa0face of\xa0many\xa0difficulties.\nCiting the report, Deputy Vũ Tiến Lộc from Thái Bình Province\xa0said all 12 socio-economic targets had\xa0been fulfilled. Macroeconomic stability had\xa0been maintained while inflation and unemployment were kept\xa0below three\xa0per cent and four per cent, respectively. Economic growth for 2019 was estimated at 6.8 per cent.\n2019 was the first year the processing and manufacturing sector had\xa0become the main driving force\xa0of the economy. The percentage of exports and investments in\xa0the domestic private sector had\xa0also increased.\nHowever, he said, maintaining the growth rate of 6.8 per cent and improving the quality of growth next year would be a challenge given unfavourable developments in the world and the domestic economic situation. According to him, the main target\xa0was enhancing the competitiveness of the business community.\n“The fact that Việt Nam slipped one place in the World Bank’s Doing Business report which was released recently implies that although the country\xa0has made great efforts to overcome difficulties, other economies are changing faster and becoming\xa0more competitive."\n"Without strong reform, we will fall behind, ” he said.\nRegarding solutions needed to\xa0push the development of household businesses, the deputy said by definition\xa0household businesses were\xa0small and micro enterprise. Thus, we could not eliminate household businesses or ask\xa0them to become\xa0enterprises, adding that regulations for\xa0household businesses would be included in\xa0the revised Law on Enterprises.\n“Only by doing so, can\xa0we ensure the effective development of household businesses and equity between them and other types of enterprises," he said.\nBắc Ninh Province\xa0Deputy Nguyễn Như So said in the first nine months of this year, investment capital in the non-state sector reached VNĐ624.6 trillion (US$26.9 billion), up 16.9 per cent over the same period last year, the highest in the economic sector. It showed the private economy was one of the important driving forces, contributing over 40 per cent of GDP and creating 1.2 million jobs per year. However, the development of the economy in the private sector hadn’t met its potential.\nSo suggested that a breakthrough policy\xa0should be issued to remove obstacles for\xa0the development of private enterprises.\nIt was necessary for the Government to encourage more private investors take part in fields which had\xa0been monopolised\xa0by the State such as infrastructure development and construction of airports and highways to create a level playing field.\nDeputy Hoàng Quang Hàm from Phú Thọ Province said the country\'s economy had\xa0developed rapidly and stably but Việt Nam was still among countries with a low average income, and had not yet "turned into a dragon or a tiger".\nThirty years ago, the world\'s GDP per capita was over $4,000, higher than $100 of Việt Nam, but the gap\xa0widened to $8,300 in 2017 and $8,400 in 2018, he said.\nTo avoid the risk of falling into the middle income trap, he said the Government should focus on labour\xa0skills, the development and application of science and technology and start-ups.\n“Only by improving labour\xa0skills and promoting scientific applications can\xa0we achieve growth with depth,” he said, adding that it required strong innovation and close connections between training facilities and enterprises.\nAccording to Lưu Thành Công, a deputy from Vĩnh Long Province, the biggest obstacle\xa0for farmers was not capital or farming techniques but information about the market.\nFarmers currently only receive information from agents and\xa0traders so they do not know whether their production follows\xa0market rules.\n“The situation that despite having bumper crops, farmers have to sell their\xa0produce at extremely low prices will continue to occur unless official information on market prices is provided to them,” he said.\nCông suggested farmers should be trained so they could decide on what crops of animals would best meet market demand. —\xa0VNS'	politics-laws

But, what if the audited organisation wants to protest or question the judgement, then where can they take their complaints to?” said deputy Lê Thanh Vân from Cà Mau Province’s delegation and a member of the NA’s Finance and Budget Committee.\n“Therefore, an amendment is needed to protect the legitimate rights and benefits of the legal bodies that are subjected to auditing by the State Audit,” Vân said, adding that this is in line with the law on complaints and denunciation and the law on criminal procedures code. — VNS"	politics-laws

231	'Long Thành international airport will operate by 2025: transport minister'	'Watch our video to see the plan for the new airport\nHÀ NỘI — Long Thành international airport will open its doors by 2025 at the latest and will handle 25 million passengers and 1.2 million tonnes of goods a year once the first phase is completed.\nMinister of transport Nguyễn Văn Thể, on behalf of the Prime Minister, made the statement on Thursday as he presented the report on the feasibility study for the airport’s first phase. The study will be reviewed by the National Assembly (NA) during the ongoing 8th session of the 14th tenure held in Hà Nội.\nThe planned airport, situated near its namesake township in the southern province of Đồng Nai, is a national key project and expected to become a major international aviation hub in the region when it becomes operational,\xa0Thể said.\nThe first phase of the project costs an estimated VNĐ111.689 trillion or about US$4.779 billion, a little lower than the previously NA-approved figure of $4.782 billion, with ground clearance costs not yet accounted for.\nAccording to the report, the project is made up of three investment phases with the ultimate goal of making the airport capable of serving 100 million passengers and handling 5 million tonnes of goods a year.\nIn the first phase of the project, one runway and one terminal will be built, together with other components.\nChair of the NA’s Economic Committee, which was charged with assessing the Government’s report, said that many NA deputies want the Government to add another runway to the first phase of the project, to make sure that if any incident were to occur, traffic at the airport\'s operation would not be disrupted.\nA rendering of the proposed Long Thành International Airport in the southern province of Đồng Nai. — Photo courtesy of Airports Corporation of Việt Nam (ACV)\nHowever, the committee still gave the nod to the Government’s plan on the first phase\xa0but asked that the Government quickly formulate the second and third phases of the projects.\nThe Government has also requested the NA to approve its plan to assign the State-owned Airports Corporation of Việt Nam (ACV) JSC as the main investor for Long Thành international airport right away, instead of going through open bidding as stipulated in the Law on Investment.\n“Carrying open bidding and weighing which investors to choose will certainly cost us another 1.5-2 years, while truth be told, there couldn’t possibly be any company other than ACV who has the experience, the capacity, and can satisfy the demands for the insurance of national security in a highly important project like Long Thành international airport,” Thể told the parliament.\nAccording to the Government’s plan, ACV will be the investor and operator of the airport, who will use its own capital to invest into the construction of the State management administrative building and essential component buildings of the airport.\nACV can make use of concession contracts to partner up with private businesses to carry out service components of the airport.\nFor construction components that are meant for air navigation management, the Government plans to assign the State-owned Việt Nam Air Traffic Management Corporation (VATM) to be the investor since this is the only company that is allowed to provide air navigation management services.\nLoans\nACV expects to contribute about $1.566 billion in capital in the 2019-25 period, or 37 per cent of the total investment for the first phase of the airport project, with the remaining $2.628 billion coming from loans.\nSo far, ACV has worked with 12 foreign and domestic credit organisations and signed memorandums of understanding (MoU) to secure loans of $5 billion, with the borrowing term set for 15 years, a grace period of 5 years and an annual interest of 5-5.5 per cent.\nThe Government said the loans would not raise public debt level since there’s no official development aid involved. But the NA’s Economic Committee is concerned that since this is a project guaranteed by the Government, meaning that any cost overruns or financial problems met by ACV then the Government will have the responsibility to resolve them and the loans will certainly add to the rising amount of public debt, hindering efforts to keep it at manageable level.\nTherefore, the committee asked the Government to fully assess the risks posed to public debt as a result of this plan.\nVATM, on the other hand, reportedly could contribute\xa0VNĐ2.125 trillion\xa0and intends to borrow the remaining VNĐ1.110 trillion from Vietnamese commercial banks, with interest of 11 per cent a year.\nLaw on Cadres and Civil Servants\nOn the same day, legislators discussed amendments and supplements to\xa0the Law on Cadres and Civil Servants and the\xa0Law on Public Employees.\nThe\xa0issues included officials\' appointment policies, punishment for those who have retired or resigned, and policies targeting talented people, among others.\nDeputy Tô Văn Tám from Kon Tum Province said current appointment procedures for ministries’ officials and cadres lack transparency.\n"In fact, there are cases where a young cadre is appointed, a usual question would pop up from the public: \'Who are her or his parents?\'. It implies that people lack\xa0trust in the integrity of appointing procedures,” Tám said.\nHe said that, in principle, all civil servants have the same opportunities for promotion, regardless of their background.\n“The problem here is the need to be open and transparent in the process of appointing staff. Therefore, it is essential to supplement the draft regulations on issues of openness and transparency in appointing individuals to the selected titles so people have full information. Based\xa0on such, people can exercise their rights in supervising cadres appointing procedures,” he said.\nRegarding regulations on punishment for retired or resigned officials who violated State laws, Deputy Nguyễn Văn Hiển suggested either reducing or cutting off permanently the pensions of such officials and cadres. The favourable\xa0policies these retired officials enjoyed should also be reduced or cut off, for instance, their titles, medals and\xa0orders, Hiển said.\nHiển said he had consulted German experience on this matter, according to which retired public servants are still responsible for their violations when they were in office and disciplinary measures are to reduce and remove permanent pensions.\nAt the same time, the legal consequence is that the disciplined person will no longer have the right to introduce and be introduced as the former Minister, Deputy Minister, etc.\nAccording to the draft, talented people in public duties are cadres and civil servants with outstanding professional capacity, making great and effective contributions to agencies, organisations and units. The State has a policy to reward those who are talented in public service.\nDeputy Nguyễn Quang Tuấn from Hà Nội, said talented people need a good training environment to develop well. However, he also said talented people who do not have integrity might not be of much help to the country.\n“There are people with talent\xa0but who only want to do good for themselves and not for the community. So I think the definition of \'talented people\'\xa0has to be more precise – they have to have talent, but they also have to have integrity, enthusiasm and devotion to contribute to the nation’s development,” Tuấn said.\nMinister of Home Affairs Lê Vĩnh Tân said it was rather difficult to give a comprehensive definition for “talented people” in many fields in the context of their possibile contributions to the country, so the draft only refer to them as those who are “talented in public services”. — VNS'	politics-laws

The current minimum wage approved by the national wage council is based on 48 working hours. If the working time is reduced to between 40 and 44 hours, wages must be recounted.\nThe NA Standing Committee proposed two options for overtime hours. The first is to increase from 30 to 40 hours per month and add regulations for specific cases allowed to work overtime 300 hours per year.\nThe second is to increase extra hours from 300 to 400 hours and there is no monthly overtime cap. The Government must continue to study NA deputies’ proposals and prepare a list of jobs allowed to increase extra hours.\nLộc is in favour of increasing total extra working hours to 400 maximum a year, saying that employers and employees can negotiate the amount of time.\nEmployees in a minority of sectors have the right to accept or refuse overtime during peak seasons, he said.\nThe current overtime working regulations are not relevant to seasonal sectors. In the fishery sector, shrimp supply is abundant in three to five months. That is when employees work overtime to take advantage of the sources, he said.\nDeputy Nguyễn Thị Quyết Tâm from HCM City said the economic competitiveness does not and should not depend on the strength of labourers. It depends on management capacity, technological innovation, working conditions and social progress.\nDeputy Nguyễn Thị Quyết Tâm is not in favour of increasing overtime hours. — VNA/VNS Photo Doãn Tấn\nNot in favour of increasing extra working time, she said labourers do not want to but they need to work overtime.\n“Why do they need to work overtime? Because their current incomes are not enough to live on.”\nThe NA must study a law that creates conditions for labourers to earn a living to afford their expenses, have time to study, improve skills and spend time for entertainment, families and other social relationships with an aim to realise human’s rights as regulated in the Constitution, she said.\nOn the sidelines of NA meeting on Wednesday, NA deputy Bùi Sỹ Lợi from central Thanh Hóa Province told Vietnam News Agency that trade unions want to reduce working time from 48 hours to 44 hours per week. But many employees do not want this because it will affect their incomes.

242	'Việt Nam achieves impressive growth this year: Deputy PM'	'Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ speaks at the National Assembly on Tuesday. Photo toquoc.vn\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam had overcome global economic headwinds and achieved impressive growth with a stable macro-economy, said Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ.\nHe attributed it to the fact inflation had been kept at 2.5 per cent despite the price of electricity and other public services in the health and education sectors rising.\nHuệ made the statement as deputies discussed socio-economic plans and the State Budget for next year.\nThe Government was striving for higher GDP growth by 2020, however, he said it was likely to remain at 6.8 per cent for several reasons.\nFirstly, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had lowered its forecast of global economic growth.\nPreviously, the IMF forecast global growth for 2019 at 3.2 per cent, while it was 3.8 per cent in 2018.\n“These indicators show the highest decline since the 2008 economic crisis," the Deputy PM said.\nIn other countries, economic growth was also predicted to be lower than forecast. The US is expecting GDP to increase by 2 per cent this year, much lower than the forecast of 3 per cent.\n"Việt Nam\'s growth of 6.8 per cent in 2019 and possibly higher, is a great effort. Of which, the main momentum was the manufacturing industry and domestic consumption," Huệ said.\nRegarding the agricultural sector, he highlighted the huge losses caused by African swine fever (ASF).\nASF has resulted in the loss of 5.5 million pigs, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of the total stock. This is why the agricultural sector has only increased 2.02 per cent in the first nine months while the Government was looking for a 3.5 per cent gain.\nHowever, the rapid growth of the manufacturing and processing industry and an increase of domestic consumption by nearly 12 per cent has helped offset the loss in agriculture as well as exports.\nThe Deputy PM said the economic situation in 2019 would continue to evolve in 2020 and might be even worse if conflicts between major economies couldn’t be handled.\nMaster plan\nA master plan on socio-economic development in ethnic minority mountainous and disadvantaged areas was also discussed by NA deputies yesterday.\nHoàng Văn Cường, a deputy from Hà Nội, said the master plan would be effective, changing the status of people in these areas because they held great potential.\nThe project has set a goal of doubling the incomes of ethnic minorities in these areas by 2025.\nIt has also suggested offering free cows and chickens to poor families to help develop the economy.\nThe project needed to set forth appropriate ways to support and explore potential in new fields and help people achieve a breakthrough, he said.\nGiàng A Chu, a deputy from Yên Bái Province, said: “For ethnic minority people, livelihoods and production development are fundamental elements. There should be a plan which helps local residents boost economic development."\nPolicies to attract investors and the business community should also be implemented in disadvantaged areas.\nHoà Bình Deputy Trần Đăng Ninh agreed.\nHe said all possible resources, particular those in locality, should be mobilised to implement the plan with a view to improving the lives of local people and shortening the financial gap between regions. — VNS'	politics-laws

She attributed the situation to the increase of unilateral actions that are not based on legal orders regulated in universal international conventions and violate the common principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which are threatening peace that humankind has been striving to maintain.\n\nThe situation needs coordination at multiple levels, including the engagement of multilateral institutions and particularly the IPU, the Vice Chairwoman said.\n\nShe applauded the IPU-141’s theme, which highlights the union’s resolve and actions to enhance the role of international law – the principle to regulate international relations and the basis to boost global governance and equal cooperative ties among countries, regardless of how big or small they are.\n\nThe official emphasised that Việt Nam persistently pursues a foreign policy of independence and self-reliance, and respects multilateralism, the rule of law and the common principles of international relations. It pays special attention to the maintenance of international order based on rules, common agreements and conventions among countries.\n\nThe country always adheres to regulations of universal international agreements such as the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and settles disputes by peaceful measures on the basis on international law, Phóng said, adding that it has also taken part in many multilateral treaties within the framework of the UN and other international organisations.\n\nViệt Nam will serve as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2020-21, ASEAN Chair in 2020 and Chair of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) for 2019-20, she said.\n\nTherefore, the country will continue helping to promote multilateralism and fair and equal dialogue, settle global issues and regional conflicts, and foster peace on the basis of international law, while enhancing regional cooperation in perfecting mechanisms for ensuring equitable and balanced interests for all relevant parties, the Vice Chairwoman noted.\n\nSuggesting ways to boost respect for international law, she said respect for the UN Charter, as well as compliance with international law and common principles and standards of conduct, must be reinforced at global, regional and national levels.\n\nIt is necessary to expand and bring into play the role of cooperation, dialogue and information sharing mechanisms to improve mutual understanding, trust and respect to seek peaceful solutions to regional disputes and urgent challenges, Phóng said.\n\nParliaments should also step up the ratification and participation of international treaties and agreements and multilateral legal documents; align their countries’ laws with international treaties they have engaged in; and increase monitoring the implementation of important agreements reached through multilateral negotiations, she said.\n\nPhóng also called for parliamentary diplomacy to be supported and the IPU’s role to be further promoted for the sake of global peace and democracy.\n\nAdditionally, she underlined the need to strengthen the IPU’s cooperation mechanisms with its member parliaments, the UN and international organisations, with a focus on sustainable development, poverty reduction, nutrition, gender equality, youth participation, management and sustainable use of natural resources, and connectivity among countries and parliaments in making policies on climate change response.\n\nSharing the Vietnamese official’s view, other delegates at the IPU-141’s plenary session also highlighted the importance of international law while condemning the violations and disregard for it, saying those actions are harmful to peace, security and development co-operation.\n\nThey stressed the IPU’s tasks and role in supervising and maintaining international law, asking the union to form sustainable mechanisms and solutions to ensure strict adherence to international law, especially the UN Charter, the International Human Rights Conventions, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the UNCLOS, because it is the only legal tool to resolve conflicts and disputes. — VNS'	politics-laws

VNA/VNS Công Mạo\nCẦN THƠ — In response to climate change, amendments to some parts of the 2014 Law on Environmental Protection are necessary, said Trương Đức Trí, Deputy Director of the Department of Climate Change under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.\nHe made\xa0the statement at a workshop entitled Improvement of Policies and Legislation to Respond to Climate Change in Việt Nam, organised by the Committee of Science, Technology and Environment (CSTE) and the German Corporation for International Cooperation\xa0(GIZ) on Monday.\nThe workshop is aimed at identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the legal framework, hearing the opinions of relevant ministries, provinces and experts and consulting on the proposed amendments and supplements to the Law on Environmental Protection from 2014 in terms of climate change-related issues.\nResponding to climate change has been integrated in the policies, legislation, programmes and development plans of the country, Trí said.\nThe Law on Environmental Protection was approved by the National Assembly in 2014.\n“It was the first time climate change response was enshrined in law, with 25 provisions in 10 articles in Chapter IV.”\nHowever, after five years of implementation, the legal framework for responding to climate change should be further improved to meet the demands of the new situation, he said.\nTrí suggested supplementing two clauses to Article 39 of the law. These clauses consist of climate change response, including human activities to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; climate change response associated with sustainable development and strengthening the resilience of the natural and social systems.\nHe also proposed adding some other clauses including those encouraging the collection, recycling, use or destruction of ozone depleting substances or controlled by the Montreal Protocol in civil and industrial refrigeration appliances when they are no longer in use.\nAddressing the workshop, Đào Anh Dũng, vice chairman of Cần Thơ City’s People’s Committee, said, like other localities in the country, the city was suffering from the impacts of climate change. It was reflected in the fact that extreme weather occurred more regularly.\n“High tides and river bank erosion has seriously affected the lives and production of local residents,” he said.\nMarcel Reymond, head of the Economic Cooperation Embassy of Switzerland in Việt Nam, said due to climate change, the Mekong Delta region suffered from US$130 to $190 million in damage every year.\n“It was essential for Việt Nam to further strengthen its legal frameworks and policy as well as improve technical standards to have an integrated implementation process,” he said, adding that the integration must be done separately at different levels from the Government, scientists, experts and communities.\nLâm Văn Bi, vice chairman of Cà Mau Province’s People’s Committee, proposed the Government allow the province to pilot the capital mobilisation of enterprises involved in climate change response and erosion control in the province. Accordingly, enterprises could exploit a certain land area to compensate the construction of the works they invested in the locality. — VNS'	politics-laws

297	"Việt Nam's Vanguard Bank is not a disputed zone: foreign ministry"	'Vietnamese foreign ministry spokesperson Lê Thị Thu Hằng during Thursday press briefing in Hà Nội. — VNA/VNS Photo Văn Điệp\nHÀ NỘI — Vanguard Bank, contrary to false territorial claims by China, belongs entirely to Việt Nam and is definitely not a disputed area or one with overlapping territorial claims.\nThe statement was made by Vietnamese foreign ministry spokesperson Lê Thị Thu Hằng during the regular\xa0press briefing held on Thursday\xa0in Hà Nội.\nShe was speaking in response to a comment made by her Chinese counterpart Geng Shuang earlier in September, which claimed China has sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the Vanguard Bank and demanded Việt Nam halt its oil and gas exploration in the area.\n“Việt Nam reiterated that the Vanguard Bank lies completely within Việt Nam’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf, as delineated from the Vietnamese shore\xa0in accordance with the United Conventions on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) 1982, and that the Vanguard Bank is not a disputed area or with overlapping claims,” Hằng said.\n"China does not possess any credible basis that is backed up by international law to lay claims to this region," foreign ministry spokesperson said, adding that the UNCLOS 1982 and recent judicial cases have all attested to this fact.\nAt the briefing, Hằng said the Haiyang Dizhi 08 survey ship and its accompanying vessels “are continuing to expand its activities and directly violating Vietnamese territory”.\nThis is the fourth time the Chinese vessels illegally entered Vietnamese waters since the first encroachment in early July.\n“Việt Nam resolutely protested these activities and has\xa0engaged diplomatically with China. Việt Nam once again demanded China immediately end their activities, withdraw vessels and stop all similar violations,” Hằng said, adding that Việt Nam is determined to protect its sovereignty and interests by all means permitted by international law.\nResponding to questions regarding China’s recent propaganda movie called “Nanhai, Nanhai” (Southern Sea) which contains inaccurate information that go against Vietnamese sovereignty in the South China Sea (known in Việt Nam as the East Sea), Hằng said: “As we have repeatedly said, Việt Nam has sufficient legal and historical evidences that proves Việt Nam’s sovereignty over the Trường Sa (Spratly) and Hoàng Sa (Paracel) archipelagoes in line with international law.”\nThat China is propagating and educating its population with wrong information that contradicts international laws and historical facts is harming bilateral relations, she said.\nAt the briefing, Hằng said Vietnamese authorities are working to verify the alleged announcements from China’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission that China is deploying deep-water oil rigs in the South China Sea, without giving clear indication to the exact location of the rigs.\nHowever, the foreign ministry spokesperson said all activities conducted in the South China Sea must comply with UNCLOS 1982, the principles of freedom of maritime and air navigation, and contributing to regional and global peace and order.\nAnti-money laundering\nSpokesperson Hằng on Thursday also dismissed a recent report from the Global Financial Integrity which lists Việt Nam amongst the countries with the worst money laundering situation.\n“The information by Global Financial Integrity is not accurate and does not reflect the reality and the Vietnamese Government’s efforts in the fight against money laundering. The Vietnamese Government is fully aware of the adverse impacts that money laundering activities have on the country’s socio-economic development,” Hằng said, adding that in recent years, Việt Nam has carried out numerous measures on many fronts to consolidate its legal frameworks, including integrating international norms and following recommendations to prevent money laundering.\nHằng noted that currently, Việt Nam has sufficient legal basis to prevent and combat money laundering, remarking that the activity is totally unlawful and subject to heavy punishments as regulated by the Penal Code.\nIn May this year, the Vietnamese Government has promulgated the action plan to deal with the risks of money laundering and terrorism funding in 2019-20 to beef up the efforts to prevent such activities, Hằng said.\nViệt Nam is also pushing to improve its financial and banking system, modernising the infrastructure, technology and management capacity of this sector to prevent monetary and financial crimes, including money laundering, according to the foreign ministry spokesperson. — VNS'	politics-laws
298	'GDP in first three quarters reaches record high: PM'	'Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc speaks at a\xa0cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning.\xa0— VNA/VNS Photo Thống Nhất\nHÀ NỘI\xa0— Việt Nam’s average GDP in the first three quarters of 2019 was at its highest level in nine years, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc announced on Wednesday.\nHe revealed the figure during a\xa0cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning.\nThe average gross domestic product (GDP) of the last nine months grew by 6.98 per cent compared to that of the same period last year.\nInflation was kept low and under control, increased by 2.5 per cent on average over a span of nine months. It was the lowest rise in the last three years, stated the PM.\n“We have gone through three fourths of 2019. I’d like to deliver good news, that is the socioeconomic status in the first nine months of 2019 has turned out better than expectations,” Phúc told\xa0the meeting.\n“In general, we have\xa0scored better across all fields compared to the same period in 2018.”\nAccording to latest statistics, the Government’s income in the first three quarters increased by 10 per cent over last year’s period.\nPM Phúc, quoting finance minister Đinh Tiến Dũng, said it might be feasible to exceed by up to 5 per cent the goal for the Government’s income set by the National Assembly this year.\n“This is the first time we have reached such a high number, having collected more than VNĐ1 quadrillion (US$43.4 billion) by September 15 (in 2019),” Phúc added.\nThe fiscal deficit stood at 3.4 per cent of\xa0GDP –\xa0lower than the target number of 3.6 per cent\xa0this year while public debt fell\xa0below 57 per cent to GDP.\nThe private business sector also saw a record high number of newly established companies after three quarters, with a total of 102,000 businesses. It was a year-on-year growth of 5.9 per cent in terms of quantity and 34 per cent regarding registered charter capital.\nExport surplus also reached a new milestone at nearly $6 billion.\nThe number of households living in hunger – who had no means to afford 9kg of rice a month\xa0– fell 33 per cent.\n“We are glad to see the living conditions of the people were improved regardless of where they are, in the cities and the countryside, in the mountainous and remote areas of ethnic minorities, along the borders and on the islands,” Phúc said.\nInternational organisations generally forecast Việt Nam would end 2019 with another year\xa0of impressive economic growth period.\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) projected the country’s GDP to stand at 6.8 per cent this year while Standard Chartered gave a slightly higher forecast of 6.9 per cent and expected Việt Nam to maintain growth momentum until 2021.\n‘Late awakened’\nThe PM, however, warned his cabinet to stay focused\xa0in the last three months to guarantee\xa0outstanding performance for the whole year.\nThe Government had to find a way to tackle the slow disbursement of public investment, with by now less than half of the total budget amount approved by the National Assembly being distributed to projects. Disbursement of foreign funding was even lower, reaching only 19 per cent, Phúc said.\nNatural disasters and diseases – particularly the Africa swine fever outbreak in which 5 million pigs were culled - caused serious difficulties for the agriculture sector, the PM said.\nThe newly-registered\xa0Foreign direct investment (FDI) into Việt Nam in the first nine months also decreased, which Phúc believed was an indicator\xa0that investment transfer from China to Việt Nam due to the China-US trade war was below expectations.\n“We have stressed the issue to officials at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Planning and Investment and Ministry of Information and Communications along with other ministries but we couldn’t fully grasp the chance,” Phúc said.\n“Officials awakened late to such an opportunity so many big groups have yet to enter Việt Nam like we had expected.” —VNS'	politics-laws

VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Dân\nHÀ NỘI \xad– The National Assembly Committee of Social Affairs opened its plenary session in Hà Nội on Wednesday\xa0discussing the revised Labour Code.\nDuring the three-day meeting, the NA deputies would collecting opinions, explanations and adjustments for the revised Labour Code; and give assessments to the Government’s report on use and management of health and social insurance fund in 2019 and 2018.\nThe committee will also organise a meeting on explaining the implementation of independent mechanisms to public hospitals.\nIn Wednesday’s morning session, the deputies discussed the revised Labour Code.\nThe committee’s deputy chairman Bùi Sỹ Lợi said the revised Labour Code, so far, had basically completed the adjustment scope and subjects of applications.\nAccordingly, the subjects of applications in the revised law are working groups without a labour relationship.\nThe law extends the scope of adjustments in terms of labour standards and conditions in order to ensure social welfare to the workers without labour relationships.\nThe revised law also defines the term “workers without labour relationships” in Clause 6, Article 3, and adds policies and State management regulations on promoting the law to worker groups in Clause 3, Article 4 and Clause 4, Article 212, Lợi said.\nReferring to the maximum overtime working time frame, Lợi said the Government wanted proposals to continue to be discussed at the National Assembly despite it being turned down by the NA Standing Committee.\nThis gave the committee had two options to be presented in the NA meeting.\nThe first was to keep the maximum overtime as per the current Labour Code but increase the overtime to 40 hours instead of 30.\nThe second option was to increase the maximum overtime to 400 hours from 300 hours each year as per the Government plan.\nThe government had to also assess the impact of the overtime increase and set up payment regulations to submit to the NA.\nNguyễn Ngọc Phương, NA deputy of Quảng Bình Province said advanced technological applications had helped reducing labour force. So workers had more chances to work overtime, he said.\n“If the work was heavy and hazardous, the overtime might be less. This depends on health and needs”, the deputy said.\n“However in the non-hazardous sectors where the retirement age was raised, the increase of overtime was acceptable”, he argued.\nThe increase was not just for employers but also employees because they wanted to earn more as well, Phương said.\nMeanwhile, deputy Nguyễn Quang Tuấn from Hà Nội said at present public servants had to work 40 hours a week while other labourers had to work 48 hours which was unfair.\nThe increase of overtime should be applied in specific circumstances and subjects, he said.\nHe also stressed the issue must be accompanied with provisions forcing employers to pay well.\nMany deputies said reducing working hours was a progressive trend, especially in the context of increasing advanced technology and skilled workers. So the working hours should be reduced to ensure health and safety.\nIncreasing overtime with limited inspections and monitoring, and light sanctions to violations might lead to over exploitation of labour force by businesses\nAs a result, the employees would be exhausted earlier than their working age.\nSome committee’s members agreed the retirement age increase but they acknowledged the complications of the issue.\nIn the end they agreed it was necessary to do the information dissemination to employees on their rights and plan a retirement age increase to each labour group. – VNS'	politics-laws

More than five\xa0million pigs have been culled.\n“The pathogens have spread rapidly. The virus has existed for a long time in the environment and in pork with diversified methods of transmissions. The management of ASF has faced difficulties due to large numbers of small-scale pig slaughtering and breeding households,” said Đông.\nHe said the only successful measure so far is to ensure biological safety in breeding. All pigsties must be safe and installed with antiseptic measures and nets to isolate pigs from insects which can spread pathogens.\nThe Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have held an ASF training course for first responders in Hà Nội. The course is expected to\xa0end tomorrow.\nThe course is part of capacity building events conducted by the US to share experience and expertise to help Việt Nam combat the transboundary animal disease.\nUS Ambassador to Việt Nam Daniel Kritenbrink said the US received a letter in April 2019 from Vietnamese deputy minister of agriculture and rural development, asking the US to provide assistance to Việt Nam.\nResponding to the request, the US is providing US$800,000 of laboratory diagnostic equipment to help Việt Nam detect ASF and a number of studies, assessments and seminars.\nThe ambassador highlighted the importance of collaboration between the two countries as the US regards Việt Nam as “a regional strategic partner” in combating the disease.\n“Since August 2018, the ASF virus has spread to 10 other countries in the region. We are confident that Việt Nam can play a critical role in helping us develop a regional approach to respond to ASF,” he said.\nCombating ASF is going to be a long-term challenge.

Only when workers have good spirit and physical strength can we attain high productivity and effective production,” she said.\nHải also said employers would benefit more than employees if the overtime limit was increased.\nNA chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân proposed submitting two options to the NA at its upcoming session this October.\nThe first option is to retain all current regulations. However, it would also require employers to restrict overtime to 40 hours per month instead of 30 hours and supplement regulations on organising overtime work from 200 to 300 hours.\nThe second option was the proposal submitted by the Government, aiming to expand the overtime cap from 300 hours to 400 hours per year for a number of trades and sectors. However, the Government was asked to consider NA deputies’ suggestions, preparing the list of those subjected to expansion of overtime cap as well as the detailed decree on implementation to submit to the NA.\nEntry and exit\nIn the afternoon, the NA Standing Committee gave feedback on the draft revised Law on exit and entry of foreign nationals in Việt Nam.\nThe law contains clauses on institutionalising the e-visa scheme that is being piloted, among other issues.\nThe NA Standing Committee asked the drafting committee carefully consider each item to ensure feasibility and national security and sovereignty, review the current conditions for visa waiving in coastal economic zones, and the proposal to raise temporary residence duration of foreign investors from five to 10 years.\nThe committee also commented the signing of an agreement between the Vietnamese Government and the European Union on establishing a framework for Việt Nam\'s participation in crisis management activities of the EU.\nYesterday was also the last working day of the NA Standing Committee\'s 37th meeting, which had lasted 11 days.\nSpeaking at the closing ceremony, NA Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân said this meeting by the NA Standing Committee had seen discussions on 13 draft law projects and other important items that would be tabled for review by NA deputies in the upcoming month-long eighth plenary session to be held in late October.\nMembers of the committee also opined on the preliminary report on the 5-year implementation of the Constitution, reports of the Government, the Supreme People\'s Court, the Supreme People\'s Procuracy on the settlement of complaints and denunciations in 2019, the State Audit\'s report in 2019 and audit plan for 2020. — VNS'	politics-laws

Ethnic minorities are living in 56 of the 63 provinces and cities nationwide.\nAlthough the ethnic minority and mountainous areas in the northwest, Central Highlands, southwestern and western central coastal regions hold strategic position in the country’s socio-economic development strategy as well as guarantee security, they still have with lowest quality of human resources, Chiến said.\nHe also said the regions had lowest access to basic social services and a high poverty rate.\nChiến blamed this on the fact the ethnic minority people live in the border and mountainous areas with severe climate and poor infrastructure.\nHigh cost of production and circulation of goods have made it difficult to attract social resources for socio-economic development.\nThe low efficiency of using investment capital and failure to exploit the potentials of the regions has also deterred their development.\nThanks to implementation of policy to support infrastructure development for ethnic minority and mountainous areas and poverty reduction models, the living standards of local residents has improved remarkably.\nOne such model is a fish farm built in the reservoir of the hydro power plant in Lai Châu which provides employment and salaries for a number of residents in the Than Uyên District.\nIn 2018, it helped see a reduction of 5 per cent of the number of poor households living in poverty compared to the previous year.\nBy the end of last year, there were 24,195 poor households, accounting for 25 per cent of the total households in the province.\nIn 2018, two districts, Tân Uyên and Than Uyên, were no longer on the list of the poor districts of the country.\nHà Ngọc Chiến, chairman of Ethnic Council, said the majority of council members agreed with the necessity of building the master plan as mentioned in the Government’s report.\n“It is essential to have a policy strong enough to attract investment in these regions, aiming at narrowing the development and income gap,” he said.\nBasing on supervisory results on the implementation of policies to support socio-economic development for ethnic minority and mountainous areas in 2016-18 period, Chiến said, the project would help enhance the effectiveness of policies and investment resource of the State and society.\nThe total capital for the project was estimated at VNĐ335.4 trillion at the minimum level.\nHowever, the ethnic council proposed the Government to clarify the foundation for resource estimate because the project failed to show\xa0list of investment.\nThe council also suggested the Ministry of Planning and Investment to make a report on resource assessment before submitting to the NA for approval.\nThe Government should make clear the State budget spending increase compared with the 2011-22 period and how to guarantee the investment resource.\nChiến said the Ethnic Council proposed the Government to amend the project and submit to the eight session of National Assembly for consideration.\nConstruction Law\nEarlier the same day, Minister of Construction Phạm Hồng Hà\xa0was questioned by standing committee members on lax management of\xa0construction violations.\nNguyễn Thanh Hải, head of the chairwoman of the National Assembly\'s Ombudsman Committee, said many individuals and organisations that violated construction regulations were punished for their violations, but the constructions were not dismantled.\n“Such management would make people lose their trust,” she said, adding that works that violate construction law should be stopped and dismantled if it affects people\'s lives.\nNA\xa0Judicial Committee head\xa0Lê Thị Nga shared the concerns.\n“If any ordinary citizen who put construction materials at their doors, urban management force would give a warning right away. But many huge construction works that violate the law still exist and the owners of such works are only given fines. Who would be responsible for such violations?” she said.\nMinister Phạm Hồng Hà\xa0acknowledged the concerns were completely\xa0reasonable.\n"Such limitations in the field of\xa0construction come from two factors - regulations and law enforcement, which\xa0are\xa0poorly implemented.\xa0We will try to address," he said.\nAlso in the discussion session, some participants said it was necessary to revise the Construction Law and relocate construction works which are intertwined in residential areas, affecting people\'s lives and health.\nHải from the Ombudsman Committee cited the case of the Rạng Đông factory fire and said many production projects are located in residential areas such as extracting gas, or flammable materials and explosives trading.\n"With existing construction works that are causing pollution to the surrounding residential areas, relevant authorities have\xa0to strictly comply with the Prime Minister\'s Decree 130 on relocation from urban areas and residential areas," she said.\xa0— VNS'	politics-laws

The Ministry of Finance was assigned to work with ministries and authorities in formulating a Government Decree to implement Protocol 7, which this draft aims to achieve.\nFinance Minister Đinh Tiến Dũng said the draft decree would create a legal basis for the application of customs modernisation for goods in transit between ASEAN countries, including Việt Nam, and reduce customs paperwork for transit goods.\nDũng said issuing the decree would enhance the competitiveness of enterprises engaged in good transit activities and bring into full play the advantages of the geographical position of the country in the transportation of transit goods.\nNguyễn Đức Hải, chairman of NA’s Committee on Finance and Budget, said the draft decree regulated some contents that haven’t been amended in the country’s legal documents including guarantees for goods in transit and priority regimes in customs procedures.\nNotably, the draft decree contained no provisions contrary to current laws and resolutions.\nMost NASC deputies agreed on the necessity of the issuance of the draft decree to incorporate Protocol 7 into national law and in accordance with international treaties, and NA vice chairwoman Tòng Thị Phóng underlined the need to ensure smooth links between Vietnam Customs and other countries.\nThe safety of the information system and interest of Vietnamese individuals, organisations should be guaranteed, she said.\nOther NA deputies proposed the Government enhance the capacity of the customs sector, particularly e-customs, ensuring smooth connectivity and strengthening inspection to prevent trade fraud.\nTax relief\nFinance Minister Đinh Tiến Dũng said the tax administration agency had made great efforts in recovering outstanding tax debts, increasing the amount of debt collection. However, tax debt is still prevalent.\nTotal outstanding tax arrears reached around VNĐ81.6 trillion (US$3.5 billion) by the end of last year, up 4 per cent compared to 2017. Of which, VNĐ41.3 trillion was irrecoverable, accounting for just over half of total unpaid tax debts.\nDũng attributed the situation to several reasons.\nThere are 2,635 taxpayers who died, went missing or lost civil act capacity with tax debt of VNĐ460 billion.\nA total 24,113 enterprises were dissolved but did not follow dissolution procedures and owe tax of VNĐ2.07 trillion. In addition, 216 enterprises were insolvent and went bankrupt but failed to pay tax of VNĐ398 billion.\nNotably, there are about 731,696 taxpayers abandoning their business addresses or having their business registration certificates revoked who owed tax of nearly VNĐ23.9 trillion, he said.\nThe Law on Tax Management stipulates that late payment interest is 0.03 per cent per day on the overdue payment.\nHowever, this regulation was ineffective when applied to the taxpayers mentioned above, he said, adding the total fines and interest of late payments reached VNĐ12 trillion by the end of last year.\n“Therefore, it is necessary to build a National Assembly resolution on handling tax arrears for taxpayers who fail to pay to the State budget,” Dũng said.\nHải, chairman of NA’s Committee on Finance and Budget, said the committee agreed on the need for a resolution on handling tax debts that can’t be collected by freezing tax arrears or writing off late payment interest for taxpayers as proposed by the Government.\nHe suggested the Government consider the settlement of tax debts for State-owned enterprises (SOEs) because SOEs were legal entities represented by the State and were in the process of equitisation.\nThus, the freezing and relinquish of tax debts should be handled during equitisation, he said.\nThe Government should review and report the settlement of tax debts for those related to land use or land rent. Accordingly, debts would be forzen or written off in specific cases, he said.\nLưu, the NA’s vice chairman, said regulations in the decree should be strict enough to prevent tax evasion.\n"We should only erase the tax debt when a court has confirmed the business is bankrupt," he said.\nHis opinion was shared by Nguyễn Thanh Hải, head of NA’s Ombudsman Committee, saying it was necessary to clarify individuals and organisation whose tax debts were erased and why. — VNS'	politics-laws

358	'NA Standing Committee discusses draft PPP law'	"Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyen Chi Dung presents the report on the draft law on\xa0Public-Private Partnership (PPP) at the National Assembly's Standing Committee meeting yesterday. VNA/VNS Van Diep\nHÀ NỘI — The draft law on public-private-partnership\xa0(PPP) projects, composed by the Ministry of Planning and Investment\n(\nMPI),\nwas submitted\nto the National Assembly Standing Committee for consideration yesterday.\nThe draft proposes PPP projects be unavailable in\xa0sectors that have so far seen no PPP projects, those with ineffective PPP projects, or those lacking appeal to investors, and others where other kinds of investment would be more fitting.\nUnder the draft, tourism; culture and sports; telecommunications infrastructure; infrastructure\nfor science and technology\ndevelopment; infrastructure at industrial parks, economic zones, industrial clusters, and high-tech parks; and infrastructure for rural areas and agriculture would be banned from running PPP projects.\nThere are also changes in the draft law regarding Government guarantees and risk-sharing. Specifically, the draft proposes Government guarantees of foreign exchange balance for PPP projects be determined by the NA and the Prime Minister, with a maximum of 30\nper cent\nof project revenue paid to private investors in VND.\nThe risk-sharing mechanism for revenue\nis also proposed\nin the draft law to\nbe extended\nto key projects decided by the NA and the PM.\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng\xa0said implementation of PPP projects in the past showed the investment in this model of PPP in Việt Nam still had many risks.\nAmong them, there are market risks, but there are also many risks stemming from the Government's decisions, such as decisions to abandon fee collection tools or to waive road fee\nadjustment\nof planning and pricing mechanisms, or changes in foreign currency policy. Such risks would affect\nproject\nrevenue.\nThe Minister of Planning and Investment said a risk-sharing mechanism is necessary.\nAccording to Dũng, the draft law's revenue risk-sharing mechanism\xa0lets investors share a part of the risk when a project has a revenue deficit.\nOn the other hand, the\nGovernment will receive back the shares when the project has revenue higher than the initial targets.\nSpecifically, the Government would have to commit to sharing with investors\xa0not\nmore than\nhalf\xa0of the deficit between actual revenue and committed revenue in the contract, while\xa0investors have to share with the Government not less than half\xa0of the increase in revenue between actual revenue and committed revenue in the contract.\nHead of the NA Judiciary Committee\xa0Lê\xa0Thị\xa0Nga\xa0said the proposal was not rational.\nWhen the Government signs a contract with investors, it should ensure the contract is\nfeasible\n, she said.\nFor instance, when building a build-operate-transfer toll booth, the Government and the investor should make sure the location is rational. It would not be right if the toll booth\nis set\nup at a location where people would object to pay, and then the Government has to share risk costs, she said.\nPhan\nThanh Binh, head of the National Assembly's Committee for Culture, Education, Youth, Adolescents and Children, proposed re-considering the risk-sharing mechanism in the draft law.\n“We are an agricultural country, but for farmers, do we have a\xa0policy to share\nrisk?\nWhy do we raise the problem of risk-sharing\nwhen it comes to\nPPP projects? Every year, when farmers face consumption problems, we\xa0say they have to deal with it because it’s A market problem!” he said.\nViệt Nam has so far attracted 336 PPP projects in transport, technical infrastructure, energy, water supply and drainage, environment, culture, sports AND education and training, among other fields.\nThe draft Law on PPP is expected be completed\nthis month\xa0before being submitted to the National Assembly for discussion in October 2019 and\xa0approval in May 2020.\nThe NA Standing Committee later the same day agreed with the addition of the Irish government’s non-refundable aid worth VNĐ77.49 billion (US$3.36 million) into the State budget estimate for this year.\n\nThe sum will be used for communes in especially disadvantaged circumstances under Programme 135.\n\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng said the aid will be given to the provinces of Hà Giang with VNĐ18 billion, Hoà Bình VNĐ20.9 billion, Quảng Trị VNĐ9.49 billion, Kon Tum VNĐ19.2 billion, and Trà Vinh VNĐ9.9 billion.\n\nUnder the agreement, the Irish government pledged to offer no more than 12 million EUR ($13.2 million) in non-refundable aid to a project on supporting communes in especially difficult situations under Programme 135 during fiscal years from 2017 to 2020.\n\nLast year, the five provinces were assigned to disburse upwards of VNĐ79.8 billion for the project. — VNS"	politics-laws

The complainants will be able to pursue a lawsuit against the State Audit if their questions are not handled properly by the State Auditor General.\nThe State audit is tasked with carrying audits at all central Government agencies and provincial departments and units to oversee the use of State budget and assets.\nNguyễn Đức Hải, chairman of the National Assembly’s Committee for Finance and Budget which was in charge of reviewing the amended law, said that the current Law on State Audit already regulated the process of handling complaints over audit reports. They were, however, very vague and did not guarantee the right of audited units to bring the matter to court.\nSeveral National Assembly deputies expressed their support for the amendment, Hải said.\nThe National Assembly’s Committee for Legal Affairs chairwoman Lê Thị Nga also agreed with the new amendment, but doubted the regulation over the responsibility of the audited units during an on-going legal case.\nAccording to the draft law, the complainants must accept the auditors’ report and abide by any demands by the auditors even if their lawsuits are yet to be settled.\nNga said that it was “inappropriate” and needed “reconsideration for adjustment”.\nGovernment's legal documents\nIn the afternoon session, the NA Standing Committee heard and discussed the Government’s proposals on amendments to the Law on Promulgation of Legal Documents, presented by justice minister Lê Thành Long on behalf of the Government.\nPart of the proposed amendments is to make the Government bodies that submitted the draft laws also in charge of receiving and amending draft laws, ordinances, and resolutions, based on feedback from the public and the NA.\nThe Government argued that this will help fix shortcomings that have manifested recently, by “ensuring continuity and consistency in the making of the law, ordinances and draft resolutions from research, policy recommendations, to drafting, submitting, and revising.”\nMinister Long also said that this would increase the pro-activeness and the responsibility of the drafting agencies, while keeping the NA Standing Committee’s role in directing account-giving, receiving and amending the laws.\nHowever, members of the NA’s top body didn’t think it was a good idea.\nNA vice chair Phùng Quốc Hiển said that in the last 17 years, complaints over the quality of draft laws rarely had to do with the reviewing committee but the shortcomings of the law and the drafting body’s preparedness.\nNA Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân said she personally was not in favour of the Government’s proposal.\n“During the making of the law on the promulgation of legal documents in 2015, the National Assembly discussed at length about this issue and didn’t find the proposal reasonable,” she said, adding that Việt Nam’s political system is stipulated in the Constitution, in which the National Assembly’s role is not just ratifying the Constitution or legal documents, but also making the laws.\nThe role-switching will make it harder to maintain oversight over the adoption of revisions and adjustments that the National Assembly demanded and make sure that the will of the constituents is respected. — VNS"	politics-laws

It proved that there is no ‘restricted areas and exceptions’ in the fight against corruption,” he said.\nHowever, Khải said the quality in settlement of a number of economic and corruption cases had not met the requirements. The recovery of assets in corruption cases was still much lower than the value of property which was illegally appropriated, he said.\nRegarding the existence of the “petty corruption” which causes trouble for residents and enterprises, the NA Judicial Commitee proposed the Government clarify exactly what\xa0the problems are before offering solutions.\nIt was necessary to determine the responsibilities of ministers or heads of agencies involved, the committee said.\nAccording to the committee, the punishment handed out has been strong enough.\nAs many 21 leaders have been punished so far this year, a decrease of eight people compared with the same period last year.\nIn response to voters’ complaints, the Judicial Committee suggested the Government Inspectorate, ministries\xa0of public security,\xa0justice and construction, and other agencies review the situation and set forth measures to cope with corruption fighting in the future.\nThe committee asked the Ministry of Public Security’s\xa0Investigation Police\xa0Department on\xa0Economic,\xa0Corruption-related Crimes and\xa0Smuggling, and Investigation Department of Supreme People’s Court to focus on detecting corruption in anti-corruption agencies and law enforcement agencies in next year’s working agenda.\nThe Inspectorate Director General attributed the phenomenon to the fact that some leaders of localities and agencies didn’t set good example and failed to take their duties in anti-corruption serious.\nA lack of efficient checks and balances\xa0and shortcomings in supervising responsibilities of high-ranking officials were also blamed.\nTo promote the work, Khải said the Government would strictly abide by the Party’s regulations on corruption prevention and combat as well as the Law on Anti-Corruption and Prevention. The administration reform would be boosted and weakness in the work would be tackled.\nThe inspection and prosecution of corruption cases would also be strengthened, he said.\nCrime combat and prevention\nTô Lâm, minister of Public Security, said the fight against criminals has achieved positive results while delivering a report on crime prevent and combat for 2019.\nThe number of criminal cases which have been solved reached 84.2 per cent, exceeding the target assigned by the National Assembly.\nCrimes related to “black credit” or predatory lending have been curbed and many serious cases that sparked public concerns have been dealt with, he said.\nSo far this year, the country has uncovered more than 20,000 drug cases and detained more than 30,000 people. Over one tonne of heroin, nearly six tonnes of synthetic drugs and 700kg of marijuana have been seized.\nWhile the number of criminal cases has decreased, violations still occurred.\nThe number of murders and child abuse cases has been increasing.\xa0Many murders or intentional attacks were carried out by people with mental illness or those affected by the use of drugs, causing concern among the public. New methods of human trafficking have been recorded, including surrogacy or fetus trafficking.\n\nPetty corruption in settling administrative procedures still took place in many localities, causing outrage for residents and enterprises.\n\nTo improve the effectiveness of crime combat and prevention work, Lâm said next year, the Ministry of Public Security would launch campaigns to suppress crimes relating\xa0to “black credit”, human-trafficking and child abuse.\nProvision of\xa0knowledge on legal documents would be strengthened together with raising the responsibility of local residents in detecting crime, he said.\nThe ministry would adopt measures to enhance the quality of investigation and settlement of criminals and strengthen inspections to ensure that wrongful conviction would not occur, he said. — VNS'	politics-laws
372	"Việt Nam opposes\xa0China's disruption of\xa0oil and gas activities"	"Viêt Nam Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Lê Thị Thu Hằng during Thursday press briefing in Hà Nội. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday condemned Chinese moves to hamper Việt Nam’s oil and gas businesses within the country’s rightful waters, saying they\xa0constitute a serious violation of international law.\n“Việt Nam’s sea economic activities, including oil and gas exploration and exploitation, are all conducted in Việt Nam’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf as defined from the country’s land territory, in accordance with United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS) 1982, to which both China and Việt Nam are signatories,” Lê Thị Thu Hằng, spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said at a press briefing in Hà Nội.\nHằng was responding to China’s recent claims that Việt Nam is conducting oil and gas activities illegally in Chinese waters.\nShe said UNCLOS 1982 is the sole legal basis to regulate the rights of each country and this has been complied with by signatory countries, manifested in arbitration cases and received general consensus from reputable lawyers.\n“Therefore, no country can lay claims to the waters in the East Sea [internationally known as the South China Sea] beyond the geographical limitations and contents regulated in the UNCLOS 1982,” she commented.\nUnlawful claims that go against UNCLOS 1982 cannot be used as basis to say there are disputed waters, the spokesperson said, adding that Việt Nam has sovereignty over Trường Sa and Hoàng Sa islands.\nThe foreign ministry has also provided updates on Chinese survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 08, saying the ship continues to infringe Việt Nam’s sovereignty, sovereign rights, exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf.\n“Việt Nam has been raising its opinions on the negative impacts this flagrant violation of the Haiyang Dizhi 08 causes to bilateral relations as well as to the security, order and peace in the East Sea and in the region,” Hằng said, adding that Việt Nam demanded China end this encroachment and withdraw the survey ship from Vietnamese waters.\nConcerning the reports the UK is intending to send aircraft carriers\xa0to the East Sea amid China’s growing ambitions in the region, Hằng said Việt Nam has on many occasions stated that the country welcomes all activities that aim to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in the sea, conform with UNCLOS 1982 and contribute to regional and global peace and security.\nOil deal\nHằng also spoke out regarding claims that the American multinational oil and gas group ExxonMobil is intending to rescind its decision to co-operate with the State-owned oil and gas group PetroVietnam in the Blue Whale project, lying within the Vietnamese EEZ.\nPVN itself on Thursday confirmed all ongoing projects in the central region – both onshore and offshore – are still being carried out by the contractor grouping comprising ExxonMobil, PVN and its upstream arm, PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corporation (PVEP).\nPVN, PVEP, ExxonMobil and ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Vietnam Ltd signed a framework deal on the Blue Whale project back in 2017.\nPVN said it is not commenting on “unofficial information” surrounding these projects and is working closely with media agencies to disseminate information of the “innovation and dedication” of the oil and gas workers.\nFreedom of speech\nHằng also responded to a question from Vietnam News Agency, which asked for the ministry’s comments regarding a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists which stated Việt Nam is amongst the 10 countries with the most stringent censorship of the press.\n“We totally rejected these allegations that were based on untruthful and subjective information regarding Việt Nam’s situation in these reports,” Hằng said, adding that Việt Nam is working on its legal system to uphold freedom of speech and freedom of press as enshrined in the 2013 Constitution, while making sure that the people are protected against fake news, news that goes against Vietnamese traditions and cultural values, and “misleading information designed to incite hatred and violence.”\nHong Kong\nRegarding the ongoing situation involving Hong Kong, Hằng stated that Việt Nam respects the policy of ‘one country-two systems’ policy and hoped that normal life would soon return to the city, in order for it to maintain its status as one of the most important financial and commercial hubs in the region and the world.\nShe also said Việt Nam has asked the Hong Kong administration ensure the safety of Vietnamese citizens who are visiting, living or working in the city amidst the protests.\nThe spokesperson added that Việt Nam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have enjoyed good relations with Hong Kong across many fields – from trade, investment to tourism and people-to-people exchanges.\n“Việt Nam will continue to put in efforts together with ASEAN countries to further foster the ties,” Hằng said.\xa0— VNS"	politics-laws

If\xa0we miss the 2020 mark then what implications might there be that in the last seven years since the adoption of the\xa0new Constitution, we have failed to achieve the targets we set out,” Hiển said,\xa0asking that the Government must clarify the causes for the holdup of the bills.\nHe also pointed out that while it might not be unconstitutional, many items on the Constitution have not been observed closely.\n“For example, the Constitution stipulates that all expenses can only be done once the estimates are approved by the National Assembly and relevant authorities, but in many cases there are no estimates to be found. Is that in line with the spirit of the Constitution?. I believe this issue, among others, needs to be looked into,” Hiển added.\nMoney problems\nChairwoman of the NA Judicial Committee Lê Thị Nga said that while the legal framework governing the judicial system has been mostly completed, there are still lingering issues – oftentimes the question of money – that affect the implementation, however.\nAccording to Nga, to uphold human rights and civil rights as enshrined in the country's Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Code clearly stressed the need to record audio and video of an interrogation – not only to produce evidence for investigators and to be used in legal proceedings,\xa0but it also serves a way\xa0to deter law enforcement’s unlawful uses of torture and forced confessions.\nHowever, Nga said that this regulation has not been implemented in real life, as the public security ministry claimed they don’t have the financial means to build a specialised interrogation room equipped with audio and video recording equipment.\nNga then asked the justice minister to report to the Government on this issue since when the regulations were put in the law, the Government was totally on board.\nFinancial difficulties were also said to be the reasons leading to many existing problems in the legal system, including a tight operating budget, lack of incentivising policies for judicial personnel and most importantly, insufficient budget to carry out judicial expertise.\nLater the same day, NA Standing Committee members discussed reports from the Government, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuracy on the\xa0settling of denunciations and complaints.\nDenunciations and complaints from citizens were still complex this year, focusing on\xa0issues like land, housing, corruption and the environment, although the number of complaints and denunciations cases fell by 7 per cent, according to the reports.\xa0Some localities failed to handle denunciations and complaints as they were expected to.\nThe National Assembly Law Committee\xa0instructed ministries, agencies and localities to\xa0improve the efficiency of complaint settlement. It was also necessary to increase State management efficiency, particularly in issues of public concern, to restrict the rise of complaints and denunciations.\nNA Deputy Chairman Uông Chu Lưu pointed to the need to hold more meetings between officials with citizens\xa0 to enhance the efficiency of complain and denunciation settlement.\xa0— VNS"	politics-laws

Up to 99 per cent of commune centres and 80 per cent of villages have had electricity, 65 per cent of communes have small irrigation systems to meet production and living requirements. Up to 76 per cent of communes meet national criteria for health.\n“The rate of poor households, especially ethnic minority households, decreases by an average of 3.5 per cent a year,” Chiến said.\nBy the end of 2018, more than 1.4 million people of ethnic minorities benefited from loan programmes at the Bank for Social Policies with the total funds of VNĐ46.1 trillion (over US$2 billion).\nHowever, the report shows some shortcomings in the implementation of the Government’s policies including the proportion of ethnic minority households falling back into poverty, generating poverty and near-poor households was high, the average income per capita per year of poor ethnic minority households was lower than the national level. People still faced many difficulties and had unstable livelihoods.\nIt cited unfavourable natural conditions, small area of arable land, poor transportation, severe weather, and divided terrain as reasons for the shortcomings.\n“The consequences of climate change, drought, natural disasters, floods and saltwater intrusion have greatly affected the results of poverty reduction, which is a reason for relapse into poverty and a rise in poverty among ethnic minority and mountainous areas,” said Chiến, adding that some places still maintained backward customs, practices, funerals, filial piety, which cost people money, limited education level and caused a lack of business knowledge, jobs and production capital.\nNA deputy chairman Phùng Quốc Hiển said that ethnic minority people were very interested in forest protection policies, but the allowance for this activity of only VNĐ400,000 ($17) per hectare a year was too little, unable to attract and ensure the minimum living standards for people.\nRegarding the situation of poverty relapse and illiteracy, Hiển said that the rate was still quite high and different from other regions.\nMinister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Đào Ngọc Dung admitted that the quality of life and human development coefficients of ethnic minorities were still low, and the gap in income rates among regions was still high. He said his ministry would issue an action plan to overcome limitations and weaknesses to have the best solutions, gradually improving the lives of the people.\nEarlier yesterday, the NA Standing Committee discussed and gave opinions on the revision of the 2005 Youth Law.\nNA Chairwoman Ngân commented that many policies in the revised law project were still general and overlapped with other fields. She asked the drafting board to abide by the provisions of the Constitution and relevant laws.\n“The issues of rights and obligations of the youth are quite well defined in specialised laws, so when approaching the rights of young people, it is necessary to avoid overlaps,” she said. — VNS"	politics-laws

They had organised an array of trade promotion events and were preparing for the Havana International Fair 2019. Regarding tourism, Cuba saw a significant surge in the number of Vietnamese visitors in 2018.\nThe country was facing formidable economic challenges, particularly the US’s tightened trade embargo, which had affected the country’s development and local livelihoods, he said, adding this had worsened the slow payment for Vietnamese businesses.\nThe Cuban Government affirmed its determination to fulfil all payment obligations, and was thankful to relevant authorities in Việt Nam for their trust and support for the country to seek rational solutions to the problem, he said.\nAccording to the Cuban minister, Việt Nam is currently the second largest trade partner of Cuba in Asia, and among the top 20 trade partners of the country in the world. As Cuba is running a trade deficit with Việt Nam, he expects that more Cuban products and services will have chances to hit the shelves in the Vietnamese market. In that way, Cuba will have better foreign currency reserves to complete its payment duties.\nHe took the occasion to call for further Vietnamese investment to Cuba, saying the country wanted to foster collaboration in finance and banking.\nAt the event, both sides agreed to carry out the evaluation on the implementation of the commitments at the 36th meeting, and results of the medium-term bilateral economic agenda during 2014-19.\nFurthermore, they reached consensus on the co-operation content of the 37th meeting, identified main contents of the bilateral agenda during 2020-2025, and defined priorities in their economic co-operation together with practical measures to remove bottlenecks for trade and investment activities. — VNS'	politics-laws

Gen. Phạm Văn Các, Director\xa0of the\xa0Investigation Police Department\xa0of\xa0Drug-Related Crimes (C47) under the Vietnamese ministry said crimes related to trafficking and illegal transportation of narcotics at sea, especially on international sea routes, have increased.\nData from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime showed approximately 420 million containers are shipped by sea every year worldwide but the number of containers monitored is less than 2 per cent, making it easy for transnational criminal organisations to take advantage of sea shipping to illegally transport drugs and banned goods.\nRecently, ASEAN enforcement has busted a considerable number of drug trafficking rings using sea routes. In 2018, Malaysia intercepted two tonnes of synthetic drugs being transported to the country, while Indonesia made a bust of 2.7 tonnes of synthetic drugs brought from China.\nCác said the transit of containers through many countries made it difficult to investigate ring leaders and called on ASEAN member nations to join investigation activities and proactively propose cooperation initiatives on combating drug crime and mobilising resources for the work.\nRepresentatives from Cambodia reported that the country has implemented five main strategies to effectively fight drug crimes, focusing on reducing supply of drugs, expanding international cooperation in combating drug crimes; making adjustments to policies and laws; and enhancing media campaigns to raise public awareness of the harms of illicit drugs.\nThe fifth meeting of the ASEAN task forces will be held by Brunei in 2020. — VNS'	politics-laws

Photo quochoi.vn\nHÀ NỘI — Although the number of criminal cases has been decreasing, work is needed to rein in social crime, attendees heard at a meeting organised by the National Assembly (NA)’s Judicial Committee held in Hà Nội yesterday.\nA total of 14,228 cases relating to economic management have been recorded so far this year, a decrease of 11 per cent over last year’s figure, Lieutenant General Lê Quý Vương, Deputy Minister of Public Security said while delivering a government report on crime prevention and combat for 2019.\nDuring the period, competent forces solved 33,470 criminal cases or 84.2 per cent of the total cases. About 2,167 organised crimes had been discovered and 137 victims of human trafficking had been rescued.\n“The investigation of cases under the direction of the Central Steering Committee on Anti-Corruption has been accelerated to meet the schedule,” Vương said.\n“Difficulties in asset evaluation have been solved as well as assessment of evidence, identifying crimes and recovering assets.”\nHowever, despite a decline in the number of criminal cases, an increase in complicated crimes and rampant violations in land planning, management and use have become a new challenge for law enforcement across the country, Vương said.\nAccording to Vương, the number of murders has increased. Many murders or intentional attacks were carried out by people with mental illness or those affected by the use of drugs, causing concern among the public. New methods of human trafficking have been recorded, including surrogacy or foetus trafficking.\nEconomic crimes and corruption have become more sophisticated and occurred in many sectors, with the use of high technology to dodge tax or lengthen toll collection at Build-Operate-Transfer booths.\nPetty corruption in settling administrative procedures still took place in many localities, causing outrage for residents and enterprises.\nViolations relating to land planning, use and management were also common, he said, saying it was the main reason leading to long-standing disputes.\nWhile agreeing with the government’s report, NA deputies pointed out shortcomings in crime prevention and combat and made proposals to increase the effectiveness of the work in the future.\nNguyễn Duy Hữu, a member of the NA’s Judicial Committee, proposed the Government strengthen the handling of violations of environmental laws. Although this kind of crime left long-term consequences and took a lot of time to recover, the criminal penalty was far too lenient. Most of the cases only received administrative punishments.\nHoàng Văn Hùng, an NA deputy, said although traffic accidents had declined in the number of cases, injuries and deaths, about 22 people died each day on average.\nThe deputy suggested the government set forth preventive solutions.\nThe punishments for violations relating to traffic safety regulations should be tightened, he said.\nMany NA deputies proposed that measures to enhance the competence of State management, inspection work in construction, commerce and information and technology to restrict violations as well as detect and strictly deal with crimes in these fields.

But laws must be tighter to ensure the right enterprises are selected.\nThese was an issue\xa0discussed during a meeting organised by the National Assembly (NA) on Thursday to review the draft Law on Public-Private Partnership (PPP).\nMost NA deputies agreed the law was essential to increase investment capacity for public projects and public services.\nBut the meeting was told there is still room for improvement and ensuring transparency of PPP projects is key to building a better future.\nAccording to NA deputies, the main problem which existed in PPP projects was how to select\xa0the right contractors.\nĐặng Hoàng An, deputy minister of Industry and Trade, said special attention should be paid to the signing of contracts between the State and private enterprises.\nHe said the draft law should be supplemented with strict regulations relating to the selection of investors.\nNguyễn Văn Phúc, an economist, said it was necessary for residents and enterprises to have a certain understanding about the nature of public-private partnership.\n“Private entities are not allowed to provide public services. Investing in the form of public-private partnership will create better products and services," he said.\nNguyễn Đức Trung, deputy minister of Planning and Investment, said the draft law contains 12 chapters and 117 items based on existing regulations on investment and investment contracts in the form of PPP. It is expected to amend some regulations related to project scale and competence to decide on investment policy.\nIn accordance with current regulations, State\'s investment in PPP projects must be in line with procedures of the law on public investment.\nThis led to a lack of flexibility in capital arrangement because it would be adjusted with finance plans.\nHe said it was necessary to set forth a new rule on the arrangement of investment from the State in PPP projects.\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment has proposed two options on allocation of State funds to PPP projects.\nFirst was to set up a development fund to allocate State money and grant guarantees for PPP projects. The second option suggested reserving separate funds for PPP projects in mid-term public investment plans.\nNA deputies said given the constraint budget, attracting private investment is essential to reduce pressure on the State budget.\nVũ Hồng Thanh, head of NA Economic Committee, emphasised the necessity of the law on PPP and the draft law would be submitted to the NA Standing Committee for consideration.\nAccording to the Government\'s report on the implementation of PPP projects, as of January 2019, the country has mobilised about VNĐ1.6 quadrillion (US$69.1 billion) from private investment to address urgent needs for infrastructure development. — VNS'	politics-laws

Việt Nam, as an active and responsible member of the international community, has significantly contributed to peace, cooperation and development, the PM said.\nHe gave a short review of the socio-economic situation in Việt Nam in 2019, noting that based on the results of the first eight months, it can be projected that the country will achieve a GDP growth of 6.7 to 7 per cent in 2019, higher than the regional and global average. Việt Nam stands determined to achieve an even greater growth in 2020, Phúc said.\nThe Government leader said 2020 will be an eventful year for Việt Nam, as it marks the conclusion of the Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2016-20 with major goals and missions, and the transition to a new phase of high growth in the third decade of the 21st\xa0century.\nMore notably, Việt Nam will take on dual international responsibilities: the ASEAN Chairmanship and a non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the 2020-21 tenure. “This is the pride of our nation and also our aspiration. It is as well a weighty responsibility entrusted by the international community,” he said.\nPM Phúc expressed the gratitude towards nations and partners for electing Việt Nam to the United Nations Security Council with a record number of votes. He also asked for cooperation of other ASEAN members during Việt Nam’s ASEAN Chairmanship for the success of the ASEAN Vision 2025.\nHead of the diplomatic corps in Việt Nam, Venezuelan Ambassador, Jorge Rondón Uzcátegui remarked that 2019 is a memorable year as Việt Nam marks 50 years implementing President Hồ Chí Minh’s testament, the “lodestar” for the Vietnamese people.\nHe also highlighted Việt Nam’s remarkable achievements in 2018, with a 7.08 per cent GDP growth, a good trade surplus, strong tourism development and increases in foreign investment attraction.\nThat Việt Nam was elected a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council with 192 out of 193 votes demonstrated the country’s excellent performance in the international arena, the ambassador said, adding that Việt Nam will also assume the Chair of ASEAN at a time when the bloc is strengthening its integration process and central role in Southeast Asia. — VNS'	politics-laws

440	'Australian PM to focus on economic co-operation during Việt Nam visit'	'Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he would focus on strengthening economic, security and people to people co-operation between Australia and Việt Nam during his visit to Việt Nam from August 22-24 during an interview with\xa0the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) and the Voice of Vietnam (VOV) ahead of his visit.\nAustralia and Việt Nam have just elevated the bilateral relationship to strategic partnership which serves as a firm foundation for a deeper and wider co-operation between the two countries. Could you please tell us how significant your upcoming visit to Việt Nam would be in this context?\n\nAustralia’s relationship with Việt Nam has never been stronger. I am looking forward to meeting again with Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc to discuss ways to drive forward the strategic partnership which we established in 2018. Việt Nam matters greatly to Australia. We are committed to this vital relationship and we want to fulfil its potential. My focus during the visit will be strengthening economic, security and people to people co-operation between our two countries. We share a similar outlook on our region and the world. As countries, we both want open trade and freedom of the high seas. As people, we are pragmatic and straightforward. Over the past few years, trade between us has deepened and strengthened.\n\nAustralia and Việt Nam face uncertain times and global economic headwinds. My government is strongly committed to deepening Australia’s relations with Southeast Asia and with ASEAN, and our engagement with friends and partners, like Việt Nam, is more important than ever to maintaining the security and prosperity of our two peoples.\n\nWhat are the key issues and areas\xa0that you would like to exchange views with leaders of Việt Nam during the visit and how would they contribute to fostering the Australia-Việt Nam Strategic Partnership and to bringing the best benefits to the peoples of the two countries?\n\nI am looking forward to working with Prime Minister Phúc to identify ways in which we can deepen and broaden the trade and investment relationship between our two countries. We are building a true economic partnership. Our two-way trade hit a record A$14.5 billion in 2018 – a doubling since 2012, growing by 11 per cent annually over the past five years. Only our trade with India is growing at a faster rate. Our investment relationship is also expanding, reaching A$3.2 billion in 2018. We are partners in APEC, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA. We are working together to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership this year.\n\nViệt Nam’s strong economic fundamentals – political stability, a network of free trade agreements, competitive labour costs and a favourable geography – position it well for future growth. The Government’s commitment to ongoing economic reform and embrace of trade liberalisation is to be commended.\n\nAustralian commodities, like coal, iron ore and cotton are helping fuel Việt Nam’s economic development and globally significant manufacturing industry. Australian education is training the next generation of Vietnamese workers with the skills for the digital and data age. Australian exports of beef, wheat, wine and horticultural products are increasingly served in restaurants and enjoyed around family dining tables across Việt Nam.\n\nIn 2020, Việt Nam will assume the ASEAN Chair and become a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Could you share with us your views on how this would help enhance bilateral co-operation between Australia and Việt Nam\xa0in sustaining peace, stability and prosperity in the region?\n\nBoth Australia and Việt Nam want to see an Indo-Pacific region that is secure strategically, stable economically and sovereign politically. We have a shared neighbourhood. For over two decades, Australia and Việt Nam have worked together on this vision. Our bilateral co-operation stretches from maritime security (ships visits, exercises and training with a recent highlight being the visit of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2019), to counter terrorism (special forces exchanges and exercises), aviation safety\xa0and military medicine (training and visits).\nASEAN - a grouping of independent, sovereign states committed to promoting stability and prosperity - sits at the centre of Australia’s vision for Southeast Asia. My government is committed to further strengthening Australia’s ties with ASEAN, including during Việt Nam’s Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2020, to build an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region where trade, capital and ideas flow freely, and the rights of all states are respected. We look forward to working with Việt Nam on its agenda for ASEAN next year.\n\nAustralia also looks forward to working with Việt Nam during its term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2020. We have developed an increasingly strong defence relationship over the past 21 years. One practical highlight of our growing defence relationship is our provision of airlift to Việt Nam to help deploy 63 personnel and their equipment to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) on October 1, 2018. We have provided English language and peacekeeping training support to Vietnamese peacekeepers since 2011, and more recently we have provided Việt Nam with a range of equipment and vehicles to support its deployments. The very practical success of our United Nations peacekeeping co-operation was reflected in the Joint Vision Statement on Further Defence Cooperation signed by our defence ministers in November 2018.\nThe Australian Defence Force looks forward to continuing to strengthen engagement with Việt Nam\xa0and assisting the Vietnamese People’s Army to prepare for future UN deployments in response to common security challenges. — VNS'	politics-laws

The Chinese survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 entered waters near the Việt Nam-controlled Vanguard Bank on July 3, with the first encroachment of China’s oil rigs five years ago. The first intrusion of a Chinese oil rig triggered fierce anti-China protests in Việt Nam, without any special international reactions. But this time, the incident upset Việt Nam, the Government and people, and went further to make the United States criticise Beijing for “bullying behavior” in the area. This means that July’s action came from the desire to demonstrate\xa0China’s presence in this area and reflected the recent the US-China relations including economic conflicts.\nAs the result of the trade war with the US, China’s economy is reported to continue to stall, and the Chinese government may want to incite nationalism to distract the public’s attention from some difficult diplomatic situations. Of course, China’s political and military intention in this area should not be excluded. China has remained the power with the upper hand over its neighbours, along with about 25 to 30 military outposts from the Paracel islands to the Spratlys. The dominant status in this area will give China a lot of diplomatic cards at the\xa0negotiating table with the other great powers and with the states in this area including Việt Nam. China’s intention is said to originate from its ‘national interests, virtual or real’, territorial [maritime], military, economic, diplomatic gains\xa0and desire for recognition (in the Hegelian term), which are pursued by all the states in general, especially by the rising great powers.\nIn your opinion, what are legal frameworks necessary for ensuring the security and freedom of aviation and navigation in the sea?\nPersonally, I cast doubts on the capability and possibility of the international law in solving the international territorial problems. But I think, for the peace and prosperity of people, we should not resort to only\xa0naked power or military force. We should not give up the efforts to cite, utilize\xa0and adopt\xa0international norms for the peaceful solving of the problems among states. There is a legal framework for security and peace in this sea besides the general and traditional principle of free navigation.\nThe Vanguard Bank, the westernmost reef of the Spratly islands, hosts Việt Nam’s strategic DK1 oil rigs which are called ‘ocean fortresses’, and sits well within the 200 nautical miles of Việt Nam’s exclusive economic zone. The exclusive economic zone, set by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is the foremost legal frame of reference with which the Hà Nội Government can strengthen its own position. Although the Chinese government has contested the UNCLOS rule, especially as interpreted by Việt Nam and other countries around this sea, Beijing’s method of justification for its action, the nine-dash line, cannot be said to be an international legal frame consented to by other states.\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) dismissed the nine-dash line claim as groundless in 2016, which has not been respected by the Chinese government. But PCA, like other international courts, has no realistic power to\xa0enforce of its own decision. This is the limitation of international norms and legal judgments we\xa0sometimes look to. But a legal frame would be a weak state’s good weapon for criticizing the illegal action of the stronger state\xa0and for getting the world’s opinion support.\nCan you predict developments relating to the security situation in the area in the coming time?\nConsidering the salami-slicing tactics of China\xa0in this area and Hà Nội’s cool (this means ‘reasonable’) and wise policy reaction even under the pressure of Vietnamese people’s anger and protests, we can forecast that outright and armed conflicts will not happen. But every statesman should be careful not to escalate an incident into a serious confrontation or conflict especially in a crisis\xa0which is stirring public protests like this. Crisis management is a statesman’s vital virtue.\nWhen a claimant intrudes into the area which it claims as ‘its area’ or as having an interest in it, its actions are\xa0apt to make itself a recurrent pattern, though not going up to the extreme line. That is the salami-slicing or grey-zone tactic. Of course, those activities threaten\xa0the security situation in the area, provoking the concerns of people. This kind of tactic\xa0will be witnessed for the foreseeable future in this area.\nIn your opinion, what should the Việt Nam authorities do to protect its legitimate sovereignty and interests in the Vanguard Bank in particular and the East Sea in general?\nViệt Nam, sharing a dozen hundred kilometre border with China and having experienced a war with China in 1979, is evaluated as a state with high tolerance of strategic risk, including during the confrontation with China in 2014. At\xa0the end of a very dangerous and collision-possible period of two-month stand-off, China eventually backed down and pulled its energy rig in that year. This is the diplomatically and strategically wise course to be taken in the coming time.\nIn an international crisis threatening the state’s security and sovereignty, the most important stance a state should take is to maintain strategic, theoretical and policy consistency, which could gather\xa0international support and could get the normatively stronger position.

474	'The 70th Anniversary of the Geneva Conventions – An Opportunity for Việt Nam to Stand at the Front of Recommitment to International Humanitarian Law'	'The original Geneva Convention.\nThe Embassy of Switzerland in Việt Nam would like to draw attention to this year’s 70th\xa0anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, a key element of International Humanitarian Law and of ongoing importance. On August 12,\xa01949, the four Geneva Conventions were adopted. After two world wars, the international community had realised the need to protect the values of humanity in times of war. The recommitment of all States to international humanitarian law and dedicated efforts to strengthen it are very much needed today, too.\nIn 1859, Geneva-born businessman Henry Dunant was travelling through Northern Italy where he stumbled across a scene of a major military campaign. He found thousands of dead and tens of thousands of wounded soldiers, left unattended and without proper medical care by their respective armies.\nThe scenes he witnessed motivated him to publish an account A Memory of Solferino\xa0in which he suggested the creation of relief societies – known today as Red Cross societies – as well as the formulation of what he called “some international principle, sanctioned by a Convention”, both with the aim of alleviating the suffering of the wounded in the battlefields. Five years later, in 1864, the first Geneva Convention, signed by fourteen States, was born.\nThis first legal framework establishing rules for the conduct of war helped to limit the effects of armed conflicts. A second convention protecting the shipwrecked followed in 1907, and a third one regulating the treatment of prisoners of war was adopted in 1929. The fourth Convention added an essential element: the protection of the civilian population, heavily affected by modern warfare particularly during World War II.\nToday, all States are parties to the four Geneva Conventions. By adhering to them, States agree to protect all persons who are not or no longer participating in hostilities, such as wounded and sick soldiers, prisoners of war and civilians. In combination with three additional protocols adopted in 1977 and 2005 respectively, the Geneva Conventions are the centrepiece of International Humanitarian Law. Switzerland was the first country to ratify them in 1950. For Việt Nam, which became a State party in 1957, it was the first international convention it chose to ratify.\nThe Geneva Conventions are saving lives every day. They alleviate human suffering and grief and thus play a crucial role in post-conflict reconciliation and in the restoration of peace. Evolving methods of warfare and the rise of new political and military challenges however pose considerable challenges to international humanitarian law. Additional efforts are, therefore, necessary to ensure respect for it and to maintain the relevance of the Geneva Conventions in a world in which armed conflicts continue to cause immense harm, particularly to the most vulnerable among us.\nFew countries understand the relevance of the Conventions better than Việt Nam, which has seen two devastating wars fought on its territory. Việt Nam and its people have first-hand experience with the suffering caused by war. The painful lessons learned can help protect victims of future wars. With its upcoming Chairmanship of ASEAN and its membership of the UN Security Council, Việt Nam can make an important contribution to\xa0raising awareness about the enduring relevance of International Humanitarian Law and the need to strengthen its application in armed conflicts worldwide.\nLet us use the occasion of this 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions to reflect on their achievements, and on what needs to be done to ensure their lasting success.'	politics-laws

476	'UNCLOS 1982 remains a framework for legal order for the seas and oceans'	'Groups of mainland visitors and officials visited officers stationed on the\xa0Ladd Reef of Việt Nam\'s Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelago. — VNA/VNS Photo Trần Việt\nHÀ NỘI — The year 2019 marks the 25th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS 1982) and also the 25th year since Việt Nam ratified the convention.\nOn the occasion, Dr. Lê Thị Tuyết Mai, a member of the Executive Board of the Việt Nam Society of International Law, Chair of Việt Nam Lawyers Association Branch at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director General of the Department of International Law and Treaties, wrote an article entitled “UNCLOS 1982: Overarching framework for establishing the legal order for the seas and oceans, promoting development and cooperation at sea".\nThe following is the full text of the article.\nOn June 23, 1994, the National Assembly of Việt Nam adopted the Resolution ratifying the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This year marks the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of UNCLOS and the ratification and deposit of the instrument of ratification by Việt Nam with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Việt Nam participated in the UNCLOS negotiation and was among 107 states signing UNCLOS on 10 December 1982 when the Convention was open for signature. Its active participation to and implementation of UNCLOS shows Việt Nam’s good faith, respect and hope for an equitable legal order for the seas and oceans.\xa0Article 2 of the above-mentioned Resolution of the National Assembly of Việt Nam emphasises: “By ratifying the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Socialist Republic of Việt Nam expresses our determination to coordinate with the international community to establish an equitable legal order for the seas and oceans and promote development and cooperation at sea”. Dr Lê Thị Tuyết Mai\nUNCLOS constitutes the overarching legal framework for the seas and oceans\n1. As a multilateral treaty, UNCLOS is considered the second most important legal instrument established after World War II, only after the Charter of the United Nations. It is universally ratified and/or accepted. The annual United Nations General Assembly Resolution on Oceans and Law of the sea affirms that “the Convention sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out and is of strategic importance as the basis for national, regional and global action and co-operation in the marine sector, and that its integrity needs to be maintained”.\nIn the Preamble of UNCLOS, the State Parties affirms their “desire to settle … all issues relating to the law of the sea” and establish “a legal order for the seas and oceans”. Prompted by such desire, with 320 articles and 9 annexes, UNCLOS provides in a clear and comprehensive manner the legal status of all maritime zones under or beyond national jurisdiction, rights and obligations of every State including coastal, landlocked or geographically disadvantaged States in the use, exploitation and management of the seas and oceans and marine resources. UNCLOS also sets out principles and provisions on navigation and aviation; conservation and management of marine resources including living and non-living resources; protection and preservation of marine environments, marine scientific research and\xa0maritime security; and dispute settlement and co-operation among State Parties.\n2. The role of UNCLOS as the overarching universal legal framework is also affirmed in Articles 293 and 311 on the relation between UNCLOS and other sources of international law including conventions, international agreements and customary international law. States emphasised in UNCLOS that any agreements between two or more state parties of UNCLOS on the issues provided in UNCLOS must be compatible with UNCLOS; “the Convention shall not alter the rights and obligations of State Parties which arise from other agreement compatible with this Convention” (Article 311.2); agreement modifying or suspending the operation of provisions of this Convention may not affect “the effective execution of the object and purpose of this Convention”, “the application of the basic principles embodied herein” and “the enjoyment of other States Parties of their rights or the performance of their obligations under UNCLOS” (Article 311.3); agreement expressly permitted and preserved by other articles of this Convention are not affected (Article 311.5). Regarding the relations between UNCLOS and other sources of international law, such as customary law, only rights and obligations arising from rules of international law compatible with UNCLOS are recognised and applied by competent courts and arbitral tribunals under Part XV of UNCLOS (Article 293.1).\nParagraph 8 of the Preamble of UNCLOS, which states that “matters not regulated by this Convention continue to be governed by the rules and principles of general international law”, should be interpreted in a manner compatible with the objectives and provisions of UNCLOS as mentioned above. In fact, this paragraph provides for the relation between UNCLOS as lex specialis with specific provisions on the law of the seas and general international law (or lex generalis) with general principles and provisions for all branches of international law, such as principles of pacta sunt servanda, peaceful settlement of international disputes and\xa0provisions on interpretation of treaties embodied in the Vienna Convention on the Law of treaties 1969. Furthermore, the Preamble of UNCLOS affirms itself that UNCLOS settles all issues relating to the law of the sea. Therefore, such interpretation of this paragraph 8 that UNCLOS is not the only legal framework and there are other frameworks to regulate the use of seas and oceans such as customary law established before UNCLOS, is totally contrary to UNCLOS’s objectives and purposes and undermines the universally recognised values of UNCLOS.\nIn a recent case, an arbitral tribunal established under UNCLOS Annex VII considered the relation between UNCLOS and other sources of international law, especially the validity of any rights established before UNCLOS and concluded as follow: (i) UNCLOS does not affect the rights and obligations established independently to UNCLOS and not incompatible with the Convention; (ii) UNCLOS prevails the rights and obligation established independently to UNCLOS and incompatible with the Convention. This arbitral tribunal also emphasised that no provision in UNCLOS allows historic rights of one State to resources in the exclusive economic zones, continental shelf of other States as well as high seas and the international seabed Area. UNCLOS also does not allow the preservation or protection of historic rights incompatible with UNCLOS.\nUNCLOS clearly establishes legal regimes of maritime zones, rights and obligations of States\n3. By codifying customary law, States agree upon and clearly stipulate\xa0in UNCLOS legal regimes of all maritime zones, setting the limits of the maritime zones under sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal States (i.e. internal waters, territorial sea and contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf); the maritime zones beyond national jurisdiction, including high seas and the international seabed area (seabed and subsoil as well as mineral resources as common heritage of mankind). UNCLOS also provides rights and obligations of States Parties of different categories in these maritime zones. Core provisions of UNCLOS contain legal status of exclusive economic zones, continental shelf, regime of islands, artificial structures and co-operation for protection of the marine environment, conservation and management of marine resources. Under the light of the provisions of UNCLOS on EEZ and continental shelf, all activities of exploring and exploiting natural resources in EEZ and continental shelf of a coastal State are subject to permit of the coastal State and those activities carried out without express consent of the coastal State are illegal, and constitute manifest violation of the provisions of UNCLOS.\nThe exclusive economic zone (EEZ) was first embodied in UNCLOS by the strong support of developing countries including Việt Nam. UNCLOS provides that, within the EEZ of a coastal State, extending up to 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured (Article 57), the coastal State has sovereign rights to the natural resources of the waters superjacent to the sea-bed and of the sea-bed and its subsoil; sovereign rights to the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone; jurisdiction to marine scientific research and protection and preservation of the marine environment (Article 56). Other States, whether coastal or landlocked, enjoy the freedom of navigation and overflight and the laying of submarine cables and pipelines (Article 58). Landlocked or geographically disadvantaged States shall have the right to participate, on an equitable basis, in the exploitation of an appropriate part of the surplus of the living resources of the EEZ of coastal States of the same sub-region or region (Articles 69 and 70); living resources, including migratory species,\xa0are subject to conservation and development\xa0in conformity with the provisions of UNCLOS (Articles 61-73). UNCLOS also clearly provides that other States, in exercising their rights and performing their duties in the EEZ, shall have due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal State and shall comply with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal States as well as other rules of international law (Article 58).\nThe continental shelf of a coastal State comprises the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that beyond its territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of its land territory. In reality, the outer edge of continental shelf differs among regions, some may not extend to 200 nautical miles but some may extend beyond such limits. Under Article 76 of UNCLOS, the continental shelf of a coastal state may extend to at least 200 nautical miles from the baselines; wherever the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines, the coastal State has the right to establish the outer limit of its continental shelf, by either, not exceed 350 nautical miles from the baselines or not exceed 100 nautical miles from the 2500 meters isobaths. However, in order to extend the limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, coastal States are obliged to submit to the Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf with full geodetic data; then the Commission will consider and make recommendations to coastal States. In its continental shelf, the coastal State has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources (Article 77.1). It should be noted that such sovereign rights are exclusive in the sense that no other countries may explore and exploit the natural resources in its continental shelf without express consent of the coastal State (Article 77.2); coastal State enjoys exclusive rights to authorize and regulate drilling on the continental shelf for all purposes (Article 81). The exercise of rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf must not infringe the freedom of navigation and other freedoms under UNCLOS.\nRegarding legal regime of islands, Article 121 of UNCLOS sets criteria to determine whether a geographical feature is an “island” or a “rock”. Accordingly, an island is a naturally formed area of land, surrounded by water, which is above water at high tide; an island can sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have its own territorial sea, contiguous zones, exclusive economic zone or continental shelf applicable to other land territory. Rocks which do not meet the two aforementioned criteria shall have 12 nautical miles- territorial sea only, no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf. Low-tide elevations have no territorial sea of their own (and no exclusive economic zone and continental shelf); they do not affect the limit of maritime zones (Article 13.2).\nAccording to a recent award of an Arbitral Tribunal under Annex VII of UNCLOS, “rock which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone and continental shelf” as the legal regime of islands in Article 121 UNCLOS depends on the objective capability of the feature in their natural characteristics to sustain human habitation or economic life of their own without external sources or only with exploiting objectives. The Tribunal also concluded that none of geographical features in the Spratly Islands are capable of creating EEZ or continental shelf; islands in the Spratly Islands cannot create maritime zones as a whole. The high-tide features create territorial sea while low-tide elevations do not.\nArtificial structures cannot be considered islands since they are not naturally formed areas of land. UNCLOS clearly regulates the construction of artificial structures. In particular, the coastal State, in the EEZ, shall have the exclusive right to construct and to authorise and regulate the construction, operation and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, of which their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone or the continental shelf (Article 60.8). Moreover, due notice must be given of their construction and permanent means for giving warning of their presence must be maintained; any installations or structure which are abandoned shall be removed to ensure safety of navigation, considering any generally accepted international standards established in this regard by the competent international organisation (Article 60.3).\nUNCLOS also requires States to co-operate in protection of marine environments and conservation and management of natural resources in coastal States’ maritime zones as well as high seas (Part XII). UNCLOS provides that States bordering an enclosed or semi-enclosed sea should cooperate to manage living resources, adopt scientific research and marine environment policies and undertake relevant activities. Landlocked States enjoy the rights to access the sea and transit through transit waters. States Parties shall prevent and control marine pollution and be liable for damages resulted from the responding violations. Marine scientific researches are subject to the rights and duties of other States as provided for in this Convention.\nIt should be emphasised that every maritime area has its own legal regime as stipulated in UNCLOS, including rights and obligations of coastal States and other different categories of States. Coastal States, on the one hand, enjoy the rights in their maritime zones, and, on the other hand, have the obligation to respect rights of other States and perform other obligations under UNCLOS.\nUNCLOS establishes institutions, mechanisms to ensure its implementation, including mechanisms for settlement of disputes concerning interpretation and application of the Convention\n4. To ensure full and consistent implementation of the Convention in practice, UNCLOS establishes a set of bodies and mechanisms with different roles and functions which supplement each other. Specialised organisations established under UNCLOS include: (i) the International Seabed Authority (ISA, designated to organise and control the exploration and mining of the mineral resources in the Area – common heritage of mankind and administer a benefit-sharing mechanism); (ii) the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS, whose functions are to consider the submissions of coastal States and make recommendations regarding the establishment of outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles); (iii) the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS, a judicial body having the mandate to adjudicate disputes between States arising out of the interpretation and application of the Convention). In addition, the annual Meeting of the States Parties to UNCLOS (SPLOS) is convened in accordance with the Convention to consider the reports of organisations established under the Convention; make decisions on budgetary matters and working conditions of those organisations as well as discuss any issues arising from the implementation of the Convention.\n5. UNCLOS also provides for mechanisms for the settlement of disputes among States with respect to the interpretation and application of the Convention (Part XV). Such mechanisms have been used by states quite often in practice. It is worth noting that the dispute settlement mechanisms under UNCLOS are only applicable to the settlement of disputes between States concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention (Articles 279 and 288) and constitute peaceful means for dispute settlement under international law as clearly endorsed in the United Nations Charter, including diplomatic and legal processes.\nAccordingly, when a dispute arises with respect to the interpretation and application of UNCLOS, State Parties concerned are obliged to carry out exchange of views regarding dispute settlement through negotiation or other peaceful means (Article 283).\nIf the exchange of views or negotiation in a reasonable period do not result in a settlement agreement, the parties may agree to submit the dispute to international judicial bodies for a binding decision, including the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS – established under Annex VI of UNCLOS), an arbitral tribunal (constituted in accordance with Annex VII of UNCLOS) or a special arbitral tribunal (constituted in accordance with Annex VIII of UNCLOS). States, at any time, can make declarations choosing one or more of those aforementioned procedures.\nIn order to resort to the compulsory procedures under UNCLOS, the parties to a dispute must satisfy the requirement that the parties have already carried out exchange of views, as previously mentioned, and have not reached an agreement on dispute settlement through another compulsory procedure entailing a binding decision and that agreement does not exclude dispute settlement procedures under UNCLOS (Article 282). The Convention also has clear provisions to ensure that, other than certain exceptions under Article 298, in case where the parties to a dispute which have not made declarations choosing a procedure or not\xa0accepted the same procedure or otherwise not agreed on means of dispute settlement, such dispute shall be submitted to a compulsory procedure – arbitral tribunal to be established in accordance with Annex VII of UNCLOS. In fact, such arbitration procedure has been used by many States. Although there are cases in which a party to a dispute makes certain objections\xa0and there are certain exceptions, in the event of disagreement over the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, the tribunal itself has the competence to make a decision on whether it has jurisdiction over the dispute (Article 288); the decision of the arbitral tribunal is final and binding upon all parties to the dispute, even if a party to such dispute did not participate in the procedure (Article 296).\nBesides, UNCLOS also provides for a compulsory conciliation procedure. Accordingly, even if a party to a dispute makes a declaration excluding a compulsory dispute settlement procedure with regard to certain types of disputes, and such dispute arises after the entry into force of UNCLOS and both parties could not reach an agreement through negotiation in a reasonable period, either party to the dispute may choose to submit the dispute to a Conciliation Commission (established in accordance with Annex V of UNCLOS). Although the conclusions and recommendations of the Conciliation Commission don’t have binding effect, parties to the dispute are obliged to negotiate on the basis of the report and recommendations in order to reach a resolution of the dispute. Timor Leste, after a period of fruitless negotiation with Australia, had resorted to the Conciliation Commission under Annex V of UNCLOS to seek a resolution for its long-standing dispute with Australia over maritime delimitation and marine resources sharing.\nThis marks the first time the compulsory conciliation procedure has been successfully applied. On the basis of the Report and recommendations of the Conciliation Commission, Timor Leste and Australia had negotiated and reached a Treaty on maritime boundary delimitation in March 2018, binding on both countries and eventually settling the dispute between these two countries.\nIt has been practically proved that decisions rendered by judicial bodies set forth under UNCLOS, especially ITLOS or arbitral tribunals, constituted significant contributions to the interpretation of the provisions of UNCLOS and clarification of controversial and ambiguous issues or any claims or activities contrary to the UNCLOS. It should be noted that effective implementation of UNCLOS by its State parties, like other international treaties, is not only reflected in their positions at global and regional forums relating to seas and oceans, but in fact depends on actions of State parties in using seas and oceans as well as marine resources and requires good faith and due regards of every State party.\nUNCLOS is the legal framework for promoting co-operation in response to maritime challenges, for the preservation and sustainable use of seas and oceans and marine resources\n6. Coastal states have established their respective maritime zones in accordance with UNCLOS, enacted domestic legislations on seas, engaged in various programs and activities of cooperation on ocean management such as through bilateral, regional, sub-regional and global co-operation mechanisms, such as regional sea commissions, regional fishery organisations, marine environment protection mechanism, or implementing area-based marine protection projects. Such practices have vividly depicted at many levels the effort and willingness of almost all countries and international organisations in the implementation of UNCLOS.\nMany international organisations, with the UN and UN Oceans system at the forefront, have actively promoted the implementation of UNCLOS in every aspects, including encouraging those states that are not yet parties to UNCLOS to ratify or accede to UNCLOS; providing capacity-building assistance for least-developed and developing countries to better fulfil their obligations under the Convention and providing financial supports through Trust Funds for these countries to participate in forums on seas and oceans within the framework of UNCLOS and United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Moreover, the UN Secretary-General prepares and submits annual reports on emerging issues on implementing UNCLOS to the UNGA, SPLOS and related international organisations, providing a basis for countries to discuss and review the implementation of the Convention in general. The UN also maintains an Open-ended Informal Consultative Process (ICP) to discuss emerging issues on ocean management and make recommendations on necessary measures and issues which should be codified within the framework of UNCLOS to better manage seas and oceans.\nAs a result of discussions and recommendations of ICP, after a long and informal discussion at the UN since 2004, the UNGA decided to convene an Intergovernmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), which held the first session in Oct. 2018 and second session in April 2019. When adopted, this legal instrument is expected to be a significant addition to the existing legal framework on seas and oceans set by UNCLOS, for the sustainable use and conservation of common resources of mankind for present and future generations.\nUNCLOS continues to serve as the legal framework for countries to address traditional challenges such as maritime delimitations and disputes, piracy, cross-border criminals, as well as emerging challenges including marine pollution, running out of resources, marine plastic debris, climate change, sea level rise, sustainable development of ocean economy (blue economy) towards achieving the goal of\xa0conservation and sustainable use of seas and oceans and their resources, in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14) under the UN 2030 Agenda.\nAll maritime disputes must be settled by peaceful means in accordance with international law including UNCLOS\n6. In certain regions still exist maritime disputes such as disputes over the delimitation of overlapping maritime entitlements, identification of regime of geographical features in the seas or the exploitation and sharing of marine resources, in particular mineral resources. Such disputes are inevitable because UNCLOS authorizes coastal states to establish broad maritime zones under national jurisdiction, leading to the existence of overlapping maritime areas claimed by opposite or adjacent coastal states. This situation is rooted in the significant role of seas and oceans and marine resources for the development of states. It is an undeniable fact that some maritime disputes arise from absurd claims made by related coastal states totally contrary to UNCLOS.\nFacing maritime disputes in many areas around the globe, the international community agrees that all states must fully respect and implement UNCLOS, clarify their maritime claims and settle all disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law including UNCLOS, and thus reaching appropriate resolution of disputes between parties concerned, or at least provisional measures and at the same time making efforts towards an equitable settlement solution, ensuring legal rights and legitimate interests parties concerned.\n7. In the context of complicated developments in the East Sea (South China Sea), states concerned must respect the legal order for the seas and oceans established under UNCLOS, respect diplomatic and legal processes including on-going negotiations, refrain themselves from taking actions which undermine the role of UNCLOS in order to ensure peace, security, safety and freedom of navigation in the region and the world at large, for the common benefit of the region and international community. Maritime claims by states must be clarified in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS. In case of disputes or differences regarding the interpretation and application of UNCLOS, parties concerned are obliged to resolve such disputes by peaceful means, in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS. Pending the disputes resolution, parties concerned must fully respect and comply with the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea of 2002 (DOC), refrain from undertaking unilateral activities which could complicate the situation and escalate the disputes. Parties concerned should also participate constructively in the negotiations toward an effective and substantive COC in conformity with international law, including UNCLOS.\n9. Being a coastal State and Party to UNCLOS, Việt Nam has been making its utmost efforts for peaceful resolution of maritime issues in the East Sea in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS. Furthermore, Việt Nam has also been fully implementing UNCLOS since Việt Nam accepted to be bound by UNCLOS and becoming a State Party to UNCLOS 25 years ago. Together with other State Parties, Việt Nam will continue to promote full respect for and implementation of UNCLOS with a view to protecting the legal values of this universal legal framework. — VNS'	politics-laws

Co-operation to prevent non-traditional security challenges continues to be promoted.\nThe bloc\xa0has achieved stable economic growth with a predicted rate of 4.9 per cent in 2019 and a total gross domestic product\xa0of US$3 trillion.\nIt has reached out to top economic partners through free trade agreements\xa0and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.\nASEAN has also become a very attractive tourist destination, with intra-bloc tourist arrivals reaching approximately 50 million in 2018 and international tourist arrivals hitting nearly 130 million.\nThe rights of people in the region have been promoted through efforts to\xa0combat\xa0climate change, natural disasters and epidemics; the protection of vulnerable groups; visa-free movement among ASEAN countries for a period of 15 to 30 days; freedom to seek employment through mutual recognition agreements; and the provision of consular assistance.\nCohesion for adaptation\nThroughout its existence, ASEAN has become more self-reliant and resilient with the key to success being its solidarity, the Deputy Prime Minister said.\nPromoting this year's\xa0theme “Advancing partnership for sustainability” and continuing the 2018 theme “For a self-reliant and innovative ASEAN”, the bloc continues to show its adaptability.\nBy adopting the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) at the 34th ASEAN Summit in June of this year, ASEAN has demonstrated its central role in changing regional issues.\nDeveloping smart cities, responding to marine waste, integrating the ASEAN Community Vision 2025 with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030\xa0and responding to cybersecurity and population ageing\xa0challenges are among the body's recent focuses.\nAt the 52nd ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting earlier this month, member countries’ ministers affirmed ASEAN’s stance and principles, emphasising the importance of\xa0complying\xa0with international law and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and voicing concerns over the situation in the East Sea.\nIn the context of trade tensions between the major economies and increased protectionism, ASEAN is committed to accelerating intra-bloc trade and investment, promptly finalising the\xa0RCEP\xa0and strengthening a fair and rules-based international multilateral trade system.\nImportant milestone\nNext year will be an important milestone for Việt Nam as it will take the ASEAN Chairmanship and celebrate\xa025 years since\xa0its admission to ASEAN.\nDuring this time, Việt Nam will have many opportunities to affirm its new position both in the region and internationally. Việt Nam will also serve\xa0as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the 2020-21 term.\nViệt Nam’s top priority in 2020 is to contribute to the successful implementation of the goals set in the ASEAN Community Vision 2025. This is also an opportunity for the country to promote bilateral relations with ASEAN nations and partners, further improve its international position\xa0and promote the country's image, cultural identity, land and people around the world.\nIn order to realise this vision, it is essential for Việt Nam to mobilise the support and consensus of ASEAN countries and the bloc’s friends and partners, together with the efforts of all ministries, sectors, localities, businesses and people. — VNS"	politics-laws
478	'Two men to be prosecuted for scamming Phan Van Anh Vũ'	"Defendant Phan Văn Anh Vũ (also known as Vũ Nhôm), 42, former chairman of the Đà Nẵng-based Bắc Nam 79 Construction Joint Stock Company, at trial in HCM City on June 7. — VNA/ VNS Photo Thành Chung\nHÀ NỘI — The Investigation Police Agency under the Ministry of Public Security (MoPS) has suggested the People’s Procuracy prosecute two suspects for “swindling to appropriate assets” in the high-profile case concerning Phan Văn Anh Vũ (also known as Vũ Nhôm), former chairman of\xa0Bắc Nam 79 Construction Joint Stock Company in Đà Nẵng.\nThe two suspects are Hoàng Văn Châu and Thanh Minh Hùng. Both of them reside in HCM City.\nThe two men were accused of misappropriating hundreds of thousands of US dollars from Vũ by promising to help him and his relatives get US passports.\nAccording to the results of the investigation, since late April and early May 2017, after\xa0articles and images concerning\xa0Phan Văn Anh Vũ – many of which contain State secrets – surfaced on many websites, the Investigation Police Agency summoned Vũ for questioning.\nThe agency also issued a decision to stop him from leaving Việt Nam to help the investigation. On June 30, 2017, the MoPS\xa0launched legal proceedings against him for “deliberately disclosing State secrets”.\nTo avoid being investigated, Vũ contacted and transferred money to Châu, asking him to help Vũ and his relatives get US passports to leave the country.\nAfter receiving money from Vũ, Châu contacted Hùng, an\xa0acquaintance,\xa0as Hùng said that he knew an agency that offered the service. In December 2017, Châu told Vũ that he had the passport which was left at the US Embassy in Singapore, and asked Vũ\xa0to come to Singapore to collect it.\nOn December 21, Vũ used a passport under another name (Lê Văn Sáu) to go to Cambodia and then entered Singapore. At the same time, the MoPS decided to put him on a wanted list. Then, in January last year, he was arrested.\nAlthough Vũ told the police he had been scammed out of US$700,000 but it was revealed through the investigation that Châu and Hùng only took $145,000\xa0and $5,000, respectively, from him.\nThe Investigation Police Agency proposed that $150,000 out of VNĐ3.5 billion ($150,800) – the money that Châu's wife voluntarily returned – should be confiscated while the two suspects face trial.\nAccording to the agency, this was the money that Vũ has transferred to Châu for illegitimate purposes, requiring confiscation to offset the damage.\nVũ, 1975, a real estate mogul in the central city of Đà Nẵng, was charged with several serious criminal offences – deliberate disclosure of State secrets, tax evasion, abuse of power, and violations of State regulations on management and use of State assets, resulting in serious losses and wastefulness. He\xa0was sentenced to 17 years in prison for “abusing position and power to appropriate assets” and an eight-year sentence for\xa0“deliberately disclosing State secrets” in another case. — VNS"	politics-laws

The work has made important contributions to the formation of a firm economic-defence posture, meeting the requirements for the safeguarding of the country.\nThe utilisation of defence-purposed land for certain terms in economic production and building activities has ensured the principle of closely combining socio-economic development with national defence, as it both ensures the long-term reserve of land in service of national defence and brings about economic benefits, the reports affirmed.\nMilitary-run enterprises have created jobs for labourers, thus helping ensure social security, poverty eradication and stability in far-flung areas and in key and strategic locations.\nThe session further heard that over recent years, the defence ministry has actively instructed the restructuring of military-run enterprises with a view to strongly reducing the number of enterprises with 100 per cent State capital while focusing in the fields providing direct services to national defence and security.\nParticipants were also told that on the basis of the Land Law and Government’s regulations, the Central Military Commission of the 2016-21 tenure has issued many documents relating to the work, and the Ministry of National Defence ordered inspection of and supervision over the use and management of defence-purposed land while violations have been properly dealt with.\nConcluding the session, PM Phúc hailed the efforts and determination by the commission and the ministry in the work.\nAs for the tasks in the future, the Government leader asked the commission and the ministry to absorb ideas contributed and perfect documents to submit to relevant authorities for consideration and decision.\nThe documents should say that enterprises will be allowed to use defence-purposed land for economic production and building, and contracts that have expired or proved poorly-effective must be resolutely terminated while effective and suitable ones allowed to run to the end of their terms. The ministry should exercise a close management of the work, maintain stability of the military and prevent hostile forces from taking advantage of the work for sabotage activities.\nPhúc expressed his hope that the ministry will lead and set an example in the equitisation, divestment and handing over the land used by enterprises engaged purely in construction, trade and services and those related to military and defence missions at a low level back to localities. Basic and long-term policies and solutions should be worked out for close management and bringing into the fullest play the efficiency of the defence-purposed land for both national defence and development. — VNS'	politics-laws

This has brought about significant and tangible benefits to each and every member state.\n\nAccording to Dũng, during the ASEAN’s past journey, multiple milestones have been reached such as the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC) in 1976, which provided the fundamental principles for peaceful and friendly relations among member states.\n\nAnother example is the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) established in 1992, the first building block for the regional economic integration and connectivity. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994 for exchange and cooperation in addressing regional security issues. Notably, the signing of the ASEAN Charter in 2007 has created the legal basis for establishment of the ASEAN Community resting on three Pillars in 2015, he stated.\n\nThe official underlined these historic milestones are vivid testimonies to ASEAN’s consistent aspirations and determination to maintain peace and promote sustainable development through dialogue and rules-based cooperation, and by strengthening intra- and extra-ASEAN connectivity, and enhancing ASEAN's adaptability in the new era, towards “an inclusive, rules-based, people-oriented and people-centered community”.\nIn 2019, under the theme “Advancing Partnership for Sustainability”, ASEAN continues its efforts to promote sustainability across all the three pillars of the Community.\n\nNext year, Việt Nam will assume the ASEAN Chairmanship, a weighty responsibility, said Dũng, stressing that Việt Nam pledges to join hands with other ASEAN member states to build upon past achievements, further promote dialogues and cooperation, and strive to foster a stable and peaceful environment conducive to development.\n\n“We also remain committed to expanding business and investment opportunities, improving the quality of life and community health, promoting social security and welfare, fostering ASEAN's common identity, connecting the peoples of ASEAN and promoting ASEAN’s values beyond the region.\n\n“ASEAN cooperation remains one of the top priorities in Việt Nam's foreign policy. Throughout the last 24 years since our admission to ASEAN in 1995, our country, as an active and responsible member state, is proud to have proactively made significant contributions to the ASEAN Community building,” said the official.\n\nHe expressed his hope that in the near future, especially in 2020 as Việt Nam assumes the ASEAN Chairmanship, the country wishes to receive continued support and cooperation of all ASEAN friends and other regional and international partners and friends so as to make even greater contributions to building a peaceful, stable, prosperous, people-centered and people-oriented ASEAN Community.\n\nASEAN flag hoisting is an annual event conducted by all the 10 member countries of the association that groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Việt Nam. — VNS"	politics-laws

All local people must also be able to enjoy the fruits of tourism development for what they have contributed.\nReferring to Lào Cai\'s Sa Pa as the "town in the mist,” PM Phúc remarked that aside from world-renowned tourist attractions in coastal localities, with the huge potentials of northern mountainous provinces such as Lào Cai, Việt Nam could make a name for itself in mountain tourism globally.\nIn addition, the PM urged the province to sustainably develop local traditional industries, like the making of steel billets, cement, kaolin, and yellow phosphorus, saying the Government does not welcome investors in mining with a short-term vision, outdated technology and small-scale production that may hamper environmental sustainability while contributing little to economic growth and improving local incomes.\nHe also underlined the need to intensify prevention of illegal mineral exports and revoke inefficient mining projects.\nThe leader moved on to talk about Lào Cai’s promising agriculture, highlighting seven crops set to grow on large-scale specialised farms, including high-quality rice, specialty rice, medicinal herbs, vegetables, high-quality tea, tropical fruits, temperate fruits and flowers.\nIf advanced techniques and technologies are applied, average agricultural revenue can reach VNĐ120-150 million (US$5,160-6,450) per hectare and possibly up to VNĐ300 million per hectare or more in the next few years, he said.\nPhúc suggested Lào Cai develop agriculture on three pillars – organic and clean farming, use of high technology in production and processing, and linkages in value chains.\nHe asked the province to improve accessibility of land and information for businesses and enhance quality of business support services while investing more in vocational education and human resources quality, taking advantage of its central location on the Kunming (China)-Lào Cai-Hà Nội-Hải Phòng-Quảng Ninh economic corridor.\nThe Vietnamese Government leader also sent a message to investors, saying all investors to Lào Cai in particular and the Northwest region in general are appreciated as, in spite of this land’s great potential, local people struggle to make ends meet and infrastructure is poor in many areas.\n“Each penny from the investor, each livelihood or job created is valuable. Business aside, what matters is the thought towards the society, the country and the people,” he said.\nHe wanted the investors to honour their commitments and make a worthy contribution to the local economy, not only helping create employment but also improve incomes, productivity and social welfare for local people.\nThe event, themed ‘Lào Cai – A Destination of Success’, brought together over 500 delegates, many of whom were representatives from major groups and enterprises at home and overseas.\nLater at the conference, Lào Cai signed cooperation agreements with 11 partners, worth over VNĐ124 trillion ($5.3 billion) and presented decisions approving investment for eight projects worth VNĐ22 trillion (US$1 billion).\nThese projects are expected to commence between 2019 and early 2020.\nDuring 2004-18, Lào Cai attracted 618 domestic projects worth VNĐ93 trillion, while licencing 29 foreign-funded projects worth $574.7 million.\nStriving for top 15\nLater on Saturday,\xa0the Government leader had a meeting with the Lào Cai Government, where he asked that Lào Cai would soon\xa0to be named among top 15 developed localities in Việt Nam.\nAt the meeting, Đặng Xuân Phong, Chairman of the Lao Cai People’s Committee, informed the PM on the province’s recent socio-economic development.\nIn the first six months of 2019, its Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) grew 10.02 per cent.

Ninh also approved the plan to equitise the Airports Corporation of Việt Nam and 10 internal water management units, which were not subject to equitisation.\nThese documents ran counter to the Politburo’s conclusions and the Government’s decree on equitisation and divestment of State capital in tandem with the restructuring of State-owned enterprises.\nAs a member of the Party Central Committee, Secretary of the Party Civil Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Finance, Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Vietnam Social Security Management Council from July 2006 to 2011, Ninh lacked responsibility, violated the Law on Social Insurance and the Government’s decree on the Việt Nam Social Security (VSS).\nHe let two VSS general directors (in 2008 and 2009) seriously violate legal regulations by signing contracts allowing Agribank Financial Leasing Company No 2 to get loans worth VNĐ1.01 trillion (US$43.43 million).\nThe bankruptcy of\xa0 Agribank Financial Leasing Company No 2 resulted in a huge loss for the State. The two VSS leaders and many officials and Party members involved in the case faced criminal investigations, which are ongoing.\nThe Politburo said Ninh’s violations were serious and affected the prestige of the Party organisation and himself, causing public concern. Ninh accepted his responsibility for the violations and wrongdoings.\nThe Politburo also asked agencies to issue administrative disciplinary measures against Ninh in proportion to the Party’s disciplinary measures.

Therefore, units that do not meet 50 per cent of criteria in terms of natural area and population will be merged in the first phase.”\nHe said the city would submit two proposals to the home affairs ministry. The first option is to merge three wards together. However, he said it couldn’t guarantee meeting the area criteria after the merger. The second option is merging two wards.\nLê Thị Thìn, deputy chairman of Thanh Hóa Province’s People’s Committee said the province has 143 communes which were to be rearranged. After the mergers, it will have 559 administrative units at commune level, a reduction of 12 per cent.\n“The arrangement of officials should be organised in an objective and transparent manner. The gathering of opinions from contingent of commune officials and protecting the interests of involved personnel was also a must,” she said.\nEven the name of merged communes should be chosen carefully.

The law regulates that the central-level planning serves as a foundation for planning activities at lower levels, meaning the planning work of ministries, sectors and localities can only be done when overall national planning is made. This would mean planning at lower levels would take years to complete, they said.\nThe regulation aims to ensure comprehensive planning but it is difficult to implement, they added.\nDeputy PM Dũng asked the Ministry of Planning and Investment to work with ministries and agencies to guild the implementation of the law.\nRegarding local adjustments of planning from now to 2020, he proposed the National Assembly Standing Committee allow authorised agencies to decide the implementation of urgent investment projects for socio-economic development which will later be updated by new planning.\nConcerning planning works that were done and examined before the law took effect but were not approved, he proposed the National Assembly Standing Committee to allow these planning works to be approved.\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment was also asked to set up interdisciplinary teams to help localities and sectors remove difficulties. — VNS'	politics-laws

563	'Building project delays, traffic management and\xa0karaoke bar safety issues discussed'	'The People’s Council of Hà Nội discuses on karaoke bar safety issues yesterday.\xa0 — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Issues relating to the management of delayed projects that use non-State budget capitals and violate the current Land Law in Hà Nội were among three main topics at the question-and-answer session of the ninth meeting of the People’s Council of Hà Nội yesterday.\nThe three-day meeting was opened on Monday and is due to end today (Wednesday).\nAlso discussed were the problems with traffic congestion in the city and the large number of karaoke lounges operating illegally despite being classed a serious fire risk\nThe aims of the meeting were the implementation of the city’s major socio-economic tasks in the first six months of this year and addressing pressing issues of the city that voters care about most.\nChairwoman of the People’s Council Nguyễn Thị Bích Ngọc said the management of delayed projects was a major concern for city’s voters because it linked to land issues, which directly affected local people’s daily lives.\nDelegate Trần Vân Hoa, said the city had 38 delayed projects but still failed to revoke 18 delayed projects while the People’s Committee of Hà Nội had already issued a decision to revoke a total of 38 delayed projects in May 2018.\n“So, what are the causes?” Hoa added.\nIn response to the answer, director of the city’s Natural Resources and Environment Department Nguyễn Trọng Đông said the major cause was that projects’ investors were reluctant to co-operate with authorised agencies.\nĐông said under the current Land Law, revised in 2013, investors would receive compensation for their property built on the land.\nHowever, when the authorised agencies came to work out compensation packages, they refused to co-operate, he said.\nĐông also pointed out that pre-2017, the People’s Committee of the city would have full responsibility over projects including revoking when necessary.\nBut now, since new regulations were passed, the onus lies with the People’s Committee of districts, which put district-level committees in an awkward position, he added.\nAccording to Đông, the delayed projects were located in three districts of Ba Đình, Hoài Đức and Phú Xuyên.\nAlso discussed at the session were plans to boost traffic management to reduce congestion and pollution in the capital.\nNgọc said the project, which started two years ago, showed initial effectiveness but there were still shortcomings.\nDelegate Trịnh Xuân Quang, of Thanh Xuân District, said the city had assigned its Planning and Investment Department to work with relevant agencies to research and consult regulations to encourage enterprises to invest in sectors of smart traffic, urban railway and buses under the model of Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) in December 2018.\n“However, the department has not finished the task,” Quang said, while also asking about the cause, responsibility and solution.\nDirector of the department Nguyễn Mạnh Quyền said the department had already consulted with the city on how best to attract enterprises to invest.\nBut, under the city authority’s order focus would initially concentrate on three urban railway routes No 2, No 3 and No 5.\nQuyền said two investors, VinGroup and T&T Group, showed interest and were compiling their pre-feasibility study to report to the Government.\nNevertheless, the Government recently ordered to temporarily halt all projects under the PPP model to wait for a new law on PPP investment that was expected to be adopted by the National Assembly in October.\nThe third topic discussed was fire prevention in the city.\nDelegate Phạm Thu Hương said some serious fires occurred in the city at karaoke bars, of which 300 were being run illegally in the capital. Hương asked for causes and solutions to the problem.\nDirector of the Hà Nội’ Police Department Đoàn Duy Khương said the police had suspended 1,150 venues from operating for violating fire prevention regulations, but many ignored warning and remained open.\nPoor management of local administration was blamed for the situation.\nKhương said violations must be dealt with strictly, and raising public awareness was the best solution.\nMeanwhile, on the first working day, participants of the three-day meeting had adopted to spend an additional of VNĐ124 billion (US$5.3 million) each year for poverty elimination and raised tuition fees for kindergartens and high schools in the city. Accordingly, the tuition fees will be raised depending on the region.\nAs planned, the three-day meeting will approve 15 resolutions that serve the city’s socio-economic development.— VNS'	politics-laws

Industrial projects were mainly concentrated in Hà Nội, Hải Phòng and Bắc Ninh such as Samsung, LG, Microsoft and Canon, and just stopped at processing and assembling with low added value, the PM noted.\n\nThe region should maintain its role as the country’s centre of politics, economics, culture and science-technology, and strive to become one of the nation’s two biggest economic hubs besides the key southern economic region, he said.\n\nThe region must take the lead in science-technology and innovation as well as economic restructuring, the PM added.\n\nHe also urged the region to push ahead with building rural areas and reforming administrative procedures, improving the business environment, preventing corruption and wastefulness, and ensuring social safety.\n\nRegional links were\xa0a focal point at the conference, with local\xa0leaders\xa0proposing several measures to promote regional connectivity.\n\nChairman of Hà Nội's People’s Committee Nguyễn Đức Chung submitted six key measures, emphasising the development of transport networks, industrial parks, clean water supplies, waste treatment, housing and environmental protection.\n\nChairman of Hưng Yên's People’s Committee Nguyễn Văn Phóng asked the\xa0Government to help\xa0Hà Nội and Hưng Yên implement transport projects, including connecting the\xa0Hà Nội – Hải Phòng and Cầu Giẽ – Ninh Bình expressways.\n\nLeaders from Quảng Ninh Province suggested speeding up the construction of the Hà Nội-Cái Lân railway and building a high-speed rail route linking Hà Nội, Hải Phòng and Quảng Ninh.\n\nThe northern key economic region, comprising Hà Nội, Hải Phòng, Bắc Ninh, Quảng Ninh, Hải Dương, Hưng Yên and Vĩnh Phúc, covers nearly 16,000 sq.km, making up 4.7 per cent of the country’s total area. It has a population of over 16 million, accounting for 17 per cent of the nation’s\xa0population.\n\nThe region boasts a modern and synchronous transport infrastructure network linking regional localities such as the Hà Nội – Hải Phòng, Hà Nội – Cầu Giẽ – Ninh Bình, Hà Nội – Thái Nguyên, Hà Nội – Lào Cai, and Hạ Long – Hải Phòng highways, along with domestic and international airports such as Nội Bài, Cát Bi and Vân Đồn, and important seaports like Lạch Huyện and Cái Lân.\n\nAccording to Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng, the region’s average gross regional development product (GRDP) growth exceeded 9 per cent in 2016-18.\n\nLast year, its total GRDP made up about 31.73 per cent of the country’s total, ranking second after the key southern economic region. The region contributed over 31 per cent to\xa0State budget\xa0revenue\xa0and accounted for over 30 per cent of national exports.\n\nThe total development investment in the region reached nearly VNĐ1.6 quadrillion (US$70 billion), making up 29.76 per cent of the country’s total investment.

The company plans to offer e-learning subscription packages from 2020. —\xa0Photo courtesy of ColorME\nKhoa Thư\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0It may be Sunday morning, but you’ll find Nguyễn Việt Hùng enjoying a coffee, and of course, keep up-to-date with work as he fastidiously checks his smart phone.\nAt 24 years old, Hùng entered Việt Nam’s start-up community with a debut business named ColorME.\nEntering the market five years ago, ColorME offers graphic design courses for young adults at VNĐ500,000 (US$21.68) each.\n“It is not a new idea,” Hùng said. “Similar courses have appeared for so long before ColorME.”\nStarting up with 45 first trainees who\xa0were recruited via a simple Facebook event, his company now teaches 1000 trainees a month at its four branches, three in Hà Nội and one in HCM City.\n“After the lightning success of the first batch, the second one witnessed a boom in attendance registration with more than 100 people,” he said. “This was a eureka moment and I felt the urge to develop an inclusive electronic platform as soon as possible.”\n“It is not a zero-sum game, as I started low-key, others can do exactly the same. The problem only comes when your business grows bigger and administrative duties are no longer effective to be implemented manually. You will need an app that helps you cover all the paperwork, present data in the most digestible way for easy tracking and monitoring.”\nAfter five years, the app now has a friendly user interface (UI) with minimal layouts running smoothly even in low mobile data mode.\nBoth trainers and trainees use the system to check in, check out, access to the cloud library, upload products, write and get comments.\n“We are trying to detail features and enhance experiences of users as much as possible,” Hùng said.\nWhile trainees can learn anytime, anywhere based on their interests and abilities, their feedback is collected and sorted into key words, becoming an important resource for ColorME team to continuously reflect and update syllabuses to best satisfy changing demands.\nInstead of investing into fingerprint machines, the company allows staff to scan QR codes for checking in and checking out which requires location, Wifi connection and registered devices.\nData collected will help to calculate workers’ salary at the end of the month based on their performance.\n“The process, commonly known as digital transformation, enables a small company like us to save a lot of money, keep the payroll small and efficient and offer more added value for customers,” Hùng said.\n“It feels like we set foot in a field where many others cultivated. How to perfect services and how to grow sustainably, those questions keep echoing in our heads. A capable tool, I think, is our answer.”\nInnovation\nViệt Nam has set an ambitious goal to have one million enterprises in the first year of the new decade.\nBùi Tất Thắng, former head of Development Strategies Institute under Ministry of Planning and Investment, stressed innovation as the key for the country’s start-up community.\n“Việt Nam has jumped ten places in the 2019 Global Competitive Index while innovation has been considered as a breakthrough in its ten-year development strategy from 2021 to 2030,” he said.\n“The Government needs more assistance policies to unleash the potential of private enterprises, especially technology-based start-ups, at the same time, creating favourable conditions which uphold transparency and accountability for them to develop,” Thắng added.\nColorME has just had its first venture round and gotten support from 18 investors. In the next five years, the company expects to expand to other markets in the region.\n“But first, we will start 2020 by launching an e-learning subscription package at VNĐ100,000 ($4.34) per month which offers users courses on demand and the huge resource of some 1,000 articles on graphic design. The beta version is now being experienced by some 2,000 people,” Hùng said.\n“To us, it is a constant progress of trial and error to gradually scale up the company. With the digital platform as a backbone, our aspiration is to simplify operational procedures to a level which allows the instant deployment of courses in a foreign country,” he said.\n“As innovation takes time, we are going on a restless journey.” —\xa0VNS'	society
647	"Gov't and private sector must join hands to lift start-up community"	'Director of the Songhan Incubator, Lý Đình Quân. VNS Photo Chi Lan\nLý Đình Quân, director of the Songhan Incubator, one of the first\xa0private start-up incubators in Việt Nam, talks with reporter Chi Lan about the role of the private sector to support a new generation of start-ups in Viet Nam.\nThe Government offered little incentives and support for the private sector when Songhan Incubator was established in January 2017. Why did you decide to open the incubator back then?\nFirst and foremost, it was my vision that innovative technologies would surely be a foundation for the country’s future economic growth. They will draw attention from various institutions and a new generation of start-ups and businessmen will blow a fresh wind into the economy.\nThe establishment of the incubator is an essential tool in the initial phase (of a start-up) when young entrepreneurs have the opportunity to grow their capabilities and receive support in terms of market knowledge, business models and chances to reach out to the investors.\nIn retrospect, I feel I’ve done the right thing to help the young mature and succeed in their first stage from where they can keep developing their businesses on their own. That way it’s better and more sustainable for them.\nWhat do you think are the advantages of the private sector over the Government in supporting\xa0start-ups?\nThe initial phase of planting a start-up generally requires both the private sector and the Government to join hands. It’s impossible to have just the Government or the private sector do the work of building an entire start-up ecosystem from scratch.\nThe Government has the resources and can implement start-up policies yet it doesn’t have great insight into the market. The private sector, on the other hand, is in constant touch with the market and customers, and can give reliable feedback\xa0to the Government on which policies to adjust\xa0to catch up with market movements.\nSonghan Incubator has been recognised for its role in promoting start-ups in universities across the country. Could you tell more about this?\nThe Songhan Incubator has co-operated with more than 20 universities over the last three years. In my view, universities are like material sources of business talent\xa0and we’re there to help universities develop their own strategies to make those talents shine.\nFor example, we came to Thái Nguyên University three years ago and helped them completely change their way of thinking and thus their methods to facilitate new start-ups. The university can now hold professional business competitions to look for hidden talents while running a start-up support centre at the same time.\nWe also worked with the Foreign Trade University to grow its own start-up ecosystem and reach out out-of-school resources to inject the latest innovation and creativity trends into the university. By doing so, its students can easily approach such knowledge and set up start-ups not limited by any boundaries.\nOur incubator\xa0as well as others and even the authorities\xa0can work to support young students by providing them the best start-up education so they can have a higher rate of success after graduation. Another thing is we should provide a better environment in university for scientists to work on research projects that can be market feasible and eventually commercialised.\nYou have worked with several\xa0provincial authorities to offer know-how about setting up a local start-up ecosystem. What do you think are the most common and biggest challenges for municipal Governments when trying to create\xa0start-up ecosystems?\nThe initial phase is the most important stage in building a fundamental and basic ecosystem. When the basic ecosystem is shaped, people will soon realise the benefits it brings and will proactively engage with it.\nBut the real hard work mostly lies in the first stage with all kinds of difficulties and\xa0few interested in investing in it.\nIf we don’t have insight about the methods or the techniques to build an ecosystem, it will take a lot of time. For example, connectivity among stakeholders\xa0is not the real issue but the techniques to forge such connectivity are crucial.\nAuthorities have to invest in primary infrastructure and offer initial financial support as well as other incentives like office seating arrangements, aid for intellectual property rights and business establishment.\nAuthorities can also attempt to raise the quality of the ecosystem by considering the quality of lecturers, experts, investors and the investor connectivity network. Those elements are generally weak in Việt Nam.\nIn underdeveloped provinces where entrepreneurial spirit is not as high as in big cities, that leaves most of the work to local authorities.\nMost of the provinces started making ecosystems without knowing exactly what they should do to implement Project 844 (a Government\xa0project to promote and facilitate start-ups nationwide), or figure out what kind of policies to make as they can’t approach and utilise the resources from universities, companies or businessmen.\nI think the biggest challenge for local authorities is human resources, especially those who work in institutions to support start-ups.

VNA/VNS Photo Phạm Cường\nĐẮK LẮK — Buôn Ma Thuột City in the Tây Nguyên (Central Highlands) province of Đắk Lắk is projected to become the central municipality of the Tây Nguyên region under the Conclusion 67-KL/TW of the Politburo on Buôn Ma Thuột development to 2030.\nThe conclusion was issued based on the review of the 10-year implementation of the 10th tenure Politburo’s Conclusion 60-KL/TW on building Buôn Ma Thuột.\nThe document said Buôn Ma Thuột’s development should be based on the full exploitation of the city’s potential and advantages, especially natural resources, cultural and historic values, geographical location in the centre of the region and the Việt Nam-Laos-Cambodia development triangle.\nThe city should strive to maintain sustainability, push economic restructuring, develop its processing industry, software, and clean energy; green tourism and services; as well as hi-tech urban agriculture. Importance will be attached to the application of scientific and technological advances of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and to promoting innovation and creativity as well as improving the quality of human resources.\nAll resources will be mobilised to invest in socio-economic development and urban infrastructure. Economic development should go in hand with social and cultural development, while urbanisation should be combined with building new-style rural areas.\nEfforts should be taken to improve the material and spiritual life of the people, especially ethnic minority people, preserve and develop the culture of local ethnic groups, and ensure national defence, security and social order and safety, creating the foundation for Buôn Ma Thuột to become the real urban centre and a hub for the region.\nThe Politburo’s conclusion also outlined tasks and measures to realise the targets, one of which is to build and manage the development plan for the city to 2030. The plan should be in harmony with national development, regional development and provincial development, ensuring the close connection between industry and agriculture-services, urbanisation and new rural area building, while enhancing the conservation of natural resources and the environment, along with preparedness to cope with climate change and natural disasters.\nBuôn Ma Thuột will be developed into a processing centre for products that are the strength of Đắk Lắk Province and the Central Highlands. Priority will be given to developing renewable energy, urban eco-agriculture and high-tech agriculture in combination with tourism.\nBuôn Ma Thuột is envisioned to become a leading service hub in the Central Highlands, capable of serving luxury tourism and international events. The city will build its image as a global coffee city.\nThe Central Government and Đắk Lắk Province will prioritise investment in building a synchronous and modern infrastructure system for the city, connecting it with adjacent provinces, regions and other countries by road, railway and aviation.\nThe pace of key projects will be accelerated, such as the eastern belt road, the western belt road No 2, upgrading of National Highway 29, the Buôn Ma Thuột - Nha Trang (Khánh Hòa Province) Highway, Buôn Ma Thuột – Liên Khương (Lâm Đồng Province) Highway and the Buôn Ma Thuột – Tuy Hoà railway. Buôn Ma Thuột Airport will be upgraded to an international airport.\nThe Politburo’s document set out the creation of a favourable environment for business to attract and effectively use investment from all economic sectors, both domestic and international. The local government is required to research and propose policies and mechanisms designed specifically for Buôn Ma Thuột City, Đắk Lắk Province and the Central Highlands region, that suit local economic, social and cultural characteristics, with a view to creating breakthroughs in investment attraction.\nMeasures should be taken to improve connectivity between Buôn Ma Thuột and localities in the Central Highlands, the central coast and the Laos-Việt Nam-Cambodia development triangle, especially in tourism.\nThe document also provided measures regarding human resource training, science and technology co-operation, the building of the Party and local political system.\nThe Politburo asked the Party Committee of the Government to direct relevant ministries and agencies to co-ordinate with the Party Committee of Đắk Lắk Province to build plans and ask the National Assembly for permission to implement on a trial basis specific mechanisms and policies for Buôn Ma Thuột. — VNS'	society

Public auctions for vehicle plates are hindered by the lack of regulations. — VNA/VNS Photo Quang Đán\nHÀ NỘI — Vehicle licence plates have to be considered public assets eligible for transactions, experts said about the Government’s plan to sell highly sought-after lucky numbers via auctions.\nIn July 2017, a pilot programme by the public security ministry allowed vehicle\xa0owners in Hà Nội, HCM City, Đà Nẵng, Hải Phòng and Cần Thơ to buy\xa0registration plates via auctions.\nThe auctions were to be conducted publicly to enhance transparency, curtail bribery and increase State revenue.\nThree years have passed yet the programme has not been implemented nationwide due to issues involving ownership of the\xa0plates.\nThere is confusion around whether vehicle owners can keep their plates won at auction after selling their vehicles, as well as if they can trade the plates like as normal assets.\nAccording to regulations, vehicle registration plates are public assets and the Government’s management tools, which means trading vehicle registration plates is forbidden under the Road Traffic Law.\nThere is no regulation defining which plates are lucky and can be sold via auctions.\nAccording to Lê Xuân Đức, deputy head of Traffic Police Department under Ministry of Public Security, plates with 88888 or last two numbers of 68 or 86 are popular.\nIn Vietnamese, an alternative pronunciation of the number six is 'lục'\xa0which sounds like 'lộc', meaning a windfall of money while an alternative for the number eight is 'bát'\xa0which sounds like 'phát', meaning progress. The number nine's alternative pronunciation is 'cửu', meaning\xa0everlasting and making it\xa0another lucky number in Vietnamese belief.\nThe prices of plates with lucky numbers are extremely high and\xa0sometimes cost more than the\xa0cars carrying them.\nĐỗ Văn Sinh, member of the National Assembly’s Economic Committee, said vehicle registration plates should be conisdered\xa0public assets which are eligible to be traded, exchanged and inherited.\nEconomist Nguyễn Minh Phong told VTV that Việt Nam had not set standards for plate auctions, making it impossible to implement the plan in 2020.\n“Auctioning vehicle registration plates can help raise money for social welfare activities and contribute for the State budget if it is conducted properly,” said Nguyễn Việt Bắc, director of Tân Việt Bắc Company.\nThe State budget is estimated to earn VNĐ5 trillion (US$222.2 million) a year from these transactions. —\xa0VNS"	society

Local authorities have called for investment to process the leaves to produce oil and use the residue to grow mushrooms, vegetables and flowers.\nA hectare of land can produce about 20 tonnes of lemongrass leaves a year, and the leaves, after oil is extracted, can be used to produce around two tonnes of mushroom a year, according to the district’s authorities.

668	"Gov't has backup plans for North-South Expressway if no investors found: minister"	'Minister Nguyễn Văn Thể said that he did not rule out the worst scenario in which no investors made it through the preliminary bidding round for sub-projects of the NSE. VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — The Government has prepared a backup plan to fund the North-South Expressway (NSE) amid fears that private investors might not be financially capable of carrying out the mega project, the transport minister has said.\nMinister Nguyễn Văn Thể told\xa0Đầu tư\xa0(Investment) newspaper on Friday that he did not rule out the worst-case scenario in which no investors made it through the preliminary bidding round.\nIf that was the case, the ministry would immediately report to the Prime Minister and work with the National Assembly’s Standing Committee (NASC) to decide on the next move, Thể said.\n“We will either carry on with the bidding to select the investors under the PPP (Public-Private Partnership) which will consequently result in a project delay, or ask the NASC to allow us to use the State budget for investment and earn back the money by selling the tolling rights to corporations,” he said.\n“Another solution planned by the Ministry of Transport is to issue Government bonds or project bonds to carry out the projects if we can’t find the investors.”\n“This is a fundamental project of the country so we’re paying extra attention to the structure quality. The whole project must be completed in line with required procedures and ensured of the quality”.\n‘Extra cautious’\nThe preliminary bidding rounds for eight sub-projects of the NSE project closed last month with a total 32 investors and investor partnerships applying. The project management boards are scrutinising the capabilities of the potential investors.\n“We are rushing through the assessment of the investors’ application to the sub-project of National Highway 45-Nghi Sơn section to report the results to the Ministry of Transport by December 31, 2019,” said Project Management Board (PMU) 2 deputy director Bùi Văn Rạng.\nThe PMU 2 is in charge of a 43km-long road section with investment estimated at about VNĐ6.3 trillion (US$273.9 million). Three investor partnerships applied, Rạng said.\nThough the PMU 2 was supposed to announce bidding results by December 15 according to the law, it asked the transport ministry for a deadline extension by 15 days as it wanted to seek guidance from higher-level authorities over some issues in the bidding.\nAccording to\xa0Đầu tư, at least another three PMUs also asked to extend the deadline by 15 days – the maximum amount of time permitted by the Law on Bidding.\n“Apart from trying to clarify some issues regarding the financial funding agreement, the bidding team has to be extra cautious and carefully assesses the applications due to the special status of the projects,” an official of a PMU said on condition of anonymity.\nAccording to the ministry, each candidate will be judged on a 100 point scale, of which their financial capability will account for 60 points. Their experience in doing a similar project is worth 30 points and their proposed method to carry out the construction will take up 10 points.\nDespite the deadline extension, the ministry will be able to stick to schedule and announce the results of the preliminary bidding in February 2020, said deputy transport minister Nguyễn Nhật.\nThe second and final round of bidding will open the same month to select and then announce the final winners in late July, he said.\n“If everything goes smoothly, all work to pick the investors can be wrapped up by the end of August 2020,” Nhật added.\nCredit limit\nEight sub-projects of the NSE are expected to cost VNĐ118.7 trillion ($5.1 billion), of which VNĐ55 trillion will be funded by the State while another VNĐ63.7 trillion will be mobilised from investors.\nHow Vietnamese investors will be able to guarantee such a large amount of money has been the biggest concern so far, especially when outstanding loans of domestic banks are already very high.\nAccording to a State Bank official speaking anonymously, transport projects under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) and Build-Transfer (BT) models over the last few years usually required a large investment which led to a high demand for bank loans, but the payback period was very long.\nThat put pressure on banks trying to balance their credit, he said.\n“So far the total amount of outstanding loans and credit agreements for BOT and BT projects already touches the banking credit limit for the sector,” he said.\n“If banks can’t raise their authorised capital, it will be very difficult to facilitate funding for eight PPP sub-projects of the NSE.” — VNS'	society

Sets are small bulblets which are harvested before they mature. The onions can be grown from seeds, transplants or sets.\nVĩnh Châu farmers grow three crops a year on around 6,500ha, with the early and main ones accounting for 5,000ha, according to the bureau.\nThe main crop, planted in the dry season, has an average yield of 1.5-2 tonnes per 1,000sq.m. However, farmers who grow the main crop often face a fall in prices because of excessive supply.\nThe town’s red onions are delicious and both sold domestically and exported. VNS"	society

The country's largest shrimp producer, the province targets exports worth US$1.2 billion of shrimp next year.\nThe province has 300,000ha of aquaculture, with shrimp and mud crabs its key farmed aquatic species. It has harvested 522,800 tonnes of aquatic species from aquaculture and fishing in the first 11 months of the year, up 3.9 per cent against the same period of last year.\nChâu Công Bằng, deputy director of the province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said about 150,000 tonnes of farmed shrimp a year are produced in the province.\nShrimp cultivation uses hi-tech farming techniques. Farmers breed shrimp under various models such as industrial, intensive or extensive shrimp farming, super-intensive shrimp farming, and shrimp-rice or shrimp-forest farming.\nThe province has 2,510ha of super-intensive shrimp farming area with an average yield of 40-50 tonnes per hectare a crop. The model has a success rate of 85 per cent.\nThe super-intensive area will be expanded to 2,800ha next year, according to the People’s Committee.\nLâm Văn Bi, deputy chairman of the People’s Committee, said the fishery sector would be developed into a large commercial sector that has high yield, competitiveness and quality.\nThe province will also focus on breeding a broader variety of aquatic species and invest more in processing fishery produce. It is calling on investment in seafood processing and logistics services for fishing activities and fishing boat repair activities.\nWith its three sides bordering the sea, and a coastline of 254 kilometres, the province has great potential for developing brackish water and freshwater aquatic species.\nBesides shrimp and mud crabs, farmers breed aquatic species like clams, snakeskin gourami, giant river prawns, giant mottled eels and marble goby.\nIn Cà Mau City, Tân Thành Ward and Tân Thành Commune are well known for breeding giant mottled eels and marble goby.\nHuỳnh Văn Hận, who breeds giant mottled eels and marble goby in 21 ponds in Tân Thành Commune, earns a profit of VNĐ300 million (US$12,900) for each fish crop.\nThe quality of fry of giant mottled eel and marble goby is the most important factor in breeding the two fish species. Giant mottled eel and marble goby are easy to breed and have few diseases. Farmers use trash fish to feed them.\nIn recent years the two fish species have fetched high prices because of their delicious taste. Traders buy giant mottled eel and marble goby from farmers for around\xa0VNĐ450,000 ($19) a kilogramme.\nTân Thành Ward and Tân Thành Commune have 800 households who breed a total of 600ha of giant mottled eel and marble goby, with an average yield of 2.4-2.8 tonnes per hectare a year.

Photo thanhnien.vn\nLÀO CAI Nguyễn Thị Vân (not her real name) from the northern mountainous province of Lào Cai was lured across the border to China and sold off as a wife when she was 16 years old.\nThree months later, she escaped from her husband and returned to Việt Nam, but it was not easy for her back in her hometown where villagers criticised her for going in the first place.\nShe decided to leave her village and move to a reintegration shelter which was also a home for human trafficking survivors in Lào Cai.\nLào Cai Province, located on the border with China, is a hot spot for human trafficking.\nBetween 2015 and October 2019, the province welcomed home 436 trafficking victims from China.\nMost of the victims are forced to work as prostitutes for no money, while others are sent to labour in the farms or forests unpaid. Others go to work in China legally then change jobs with the promise of higher salaries, but end up trapped by the traffickers, according to local authorities.\nTheir refuge, the Compassion House, is supported by the Pacific Links Foundation, and offers reintegration services, vocational training, academic schooling, literacy and reproductive health awareness for female human trafficking victims.\nIt\'s not just about accommodation; the home is a place where human trafficking survivors who risk their lives to regain their freedom receive emotional support from psychological consultants so they can find jobs and legal assistance and regain their self-confidence.\nVân, now 23, is working as a cook at a restaurant in Sa Pa after finishing college and marrying a man who sympathises with her past.\nThe house has helped hundreds of women overcome the trauma of their ordeals so they can find work and reintegrate into society.\nNguyễn Tường Long, head of the Compassion House’s management board, said: “Most victims suffer from severe psychological trauma. Many want to commit suicide, feel inferior and stay away from other people. It takes a lot of effort to help them reintegrate.”\nLong, also the founder of the Compassion House, said many victims preferred to remain isolated, which put them at further risk of being trafficked again.\nIn 2007, when he was head of the provincial Department of Social Evil Prevention, he opened the Compassion House.\nSince then, more than 220 victims have received assistance, some of them as young as 10 years old.\nStaff member Phạm Hoàng Thanh told\xa0Thanh Niên\xa0(Young People) newspaper that she was obsessed with the trafficked women’s stories. Many victims escaped from their husband’s families in China and left their babies behind, she said. Some were distraught about leaving their children behind, and there was one girl who walked for dozens of hours back to Lào Cai, starving, scared and with injuries to her eyes and legs. Others had been infected with HIV/AIDS after being raped.\nAt the house, the victims receive physical and psychological assistance first, then get access to reintegration services and can choose whether staying at the house or return home.\nIf their living environment is not safe enough, the consultants advise them to stay at the house. None of them are allowed to use mobile phones and they are advised to ignore strangers.\nLương Hồng Loan, deputy director of the Pacific Links Foundation, said strict regulations at the house were necessary to protect the victims.

The key objective of our trip was to offer prosthetics for victims of bombs and mines left over from the war. I was really deeply moved to see dozens of people who had lost either their legs or arms that came to\xa0ask us for help. I understood these people were only a very small number among the tens of thousands of Vietnamese people who have been maimed by bombs and mines left from war.\nThe explosion of a bomb left over by the war in Hà Đông District,\xa0Hà Nội, in 2016 caused injuries to many people. Following the explosion you visited the victims. What do you have to say about\xa0such accidents?\nWhenever I hear a report about a bomb or mine explosion, I immediately tell myself and the Việt Nam Association for Supporting Unexploded Ordnance/Mine Action Efforts (VNASMA) that we have not done our duty to educate the people on how to handle unexploded ordnance\xa0left over from the war. Such an accident was a precious lesson for us. We told ourselves to do more in our mass communication campaign to help people handle such a situation.\nCan you tell us a little bit about the funding required to run the VNASMA?\nThe VNASMA has been in operation for five years. One of the driving forces for us\xa0is to think about people who have been killed or maimed by unexploded bombs or shells. We tell ourselves that we should do more to accomplish our mission, which is to help the Vietnamese war victims. Luckily, we have received support from many organisations, including banks, mass organisations and the general public. For example,\xa0MB Bank has donated a total of VNĐ3.5 billion to the VNASMA to help war victims.\nIn addition, we have also received support from former US pilots who were our enemies during the war in the northern Vietnamese airspace. So far we have held three meetings between Vietnamese and US pilots who took part in the air battles. Two meetings were held in Việt Nam and the other was in the US. Those meetings help tighten\xa0friendship between people of the two countries. And American pilots have successfully advocated the US government to support Vietnamese war victims through a programme of the US government.\nWhat does the VNASMA have planned for the\xa0future?\nFor the immediate future, we will pool efforts to make the VNASMA further complete\xa0in its organisation. This is very important for us in carrying out activities.We will also look for more funding to help victims of war ordnance\xa0in a hope to help enjoy a better life and integrate into society.

Thủy,\xa0who was aware the student was missing from\xa0class, did not report his absence. The actions of the defendants resulted in the boy’s death. The autopsy showed that the boy died of thermal shock and respiratory failure.\nAccording to the indictment, Phiến drove the 16-seat school bus to pick up Quy at 6am on August 6. The two then went to pick up 13 students for school, including Lê Hoàng L. – the victim. The six-year-old boy was picked up at Trung Yên Plaza Building.\nAt 7:22 am on the same day, the bus arrived at the Gateway International School in Cầu Giấy District. Phiến remained on the bus while Quy helped students to get off. However, at that time, there were two students, who were twins, crying, so Quy had to guide both children off the bus. All students were led off the bus, however L. remained onboard as he was sleeping. Quy closed the doors without checking for any other students.\nAfter the door was closed, Phiến drove and parked the bus at the dormitory of the nearby Academy of Journalism and Communication. He left the bus and closed the door without checking for any students onboard.\nAfter taking the students to school, Quy went to the office to sign off on her job for the morning.\nAt 3.30pm, Phiến returned to the parking lot and drove the bus back to school. When Quy opened the doors of the bus to let students on, Quy found the young boy unconscious on the floor behind the driver's seat.\nMedical staff from the school took the boy to hospital,\xa0but doctors were unable to revive him.\nAt 4pm the same day, the boy’s family received news that their child had not been present in class. Later, the family was informed the child had been found inside the school bus, and then was told he had died. — VNS"	society

He had never dreamed of owning a\xa0house as nice as this one.\nPhước, 44, from Duy Xuyên District’s Duy Phú Commune, said he was born into a poor family. Bored living in poverty and without work, he found himself in trouble with the police and spent a short term in prison.\nAfter being released, he decided to start a new life.\nHe found a job thanks to the support of local authorities and built a new house on the plot of their previous rundown home with the help of brick factory\xa0owner\xa0Phan Ngọc Anh.\n“My house was built at a\xa0cost of VNĐ100 million (US$4,300). Anh helped with the bricks and lent me VNĐ50 million,” Phước said.\nPhước is one of many people in Duy Xuyên District receiving help from Anh, who has dedicated\xa0his life to charity work.\nAfter leaving the army in 1974, Anh worked at An Hòa brick factory, where he was promoted to factory director in 1984.\nHowever, in 1989, he quit his job due to the workload and low\xa0income that was not enough to support his family, he said.\nAnh found another job as a labourer, building roads and bridges.\nThe job was not easy so\xa0he decided to open his own brick kiln in 1990, the 65-year-old businessman told\xa0Dân trí online newspaper.\nThe business\xa0encountered many difficulties in the early years\xa0and he was unable to sell his products. In order to maintain production, he borrowed nearly VNĐ1 billion ($43,000) from relatives.\n“At that time, VNĐ1 billion was a lot of money. But then I also went bankrupt,” Anh said.\nNot discouraged, in 2001\xa0he borrowed more money from relatives and capital under the Government’s poverty alleviation and hunger eradication project to open a brick factory.\nLady Luck had finally found him. Gradually, his products started to sell. He was able to pay off his debt and keep the factory running.\nThe business is running smoothly now, but instead of spending the money on himself, he's decided to donate 80 per cent of the\xa0profit to help needy people.\n“I understand what my parent’s taught me about\xa0doing good things in life and sharing\xa0with people less fortunate than me,” Anh said.\n“I give them thousands of bricks\xa0sometimes, or a cow to help them escape poverty.”\nThe case that stands out for him is\xa0one of\xa0a whole family infected with HIV. He helped them build a house and live normal lives.\nIt just makes sense to him. “Other people’s happiness is my happiness.”\n“I want to stay healthy and continue to work so I can earn more money to help the poor,” Anh said.\nNguyễn Ngọc Tiến, chairman of Duy Phú Commune People’s Committee, said\xa0Anh had\xa0helped many poor households escape\xa0poverty.\nHe had also helped\xa0build roads, houses, schools and canals, and supported\xa0local residents to develop production.\nHe had donated VNĐ16 billion since 2011, Tiến said.\nThere were also others Anh had supported\xa0that local authorities were unaware of, Tiến added.\nIn other districts, Ánh has contributed a massive VNĐ50 billion for infrastructure projects since 2012.\n“We cannot list all the households and welfare projects\xa0Anh has helped out with here,” said Nguyễn Văn Kiên, vice chairman of Duy Phú Commune.\nIn July, he was awarded the Third-class Labour Medal by Party Secretary,\xa0President Nguyễn Phú Trọng for his contributions to society. — VNS"	society

Maths, literature, and science are taught separately.\nPhú said the multi-age classrooms bring\xa0many advantages for students. Older children get self-esteem and act as role models for younger classmates,\xa0while young children aspire to do work like the older children.\nDedicated teachers\nSong Tử Tây covers\xa012 hectares, making it the second largest in Trường Sa Archipelago. Due to its severe natural conditions and a shortage of water, vegetables and meat, only male teachers\xa0live and work there.\nNguyễn Hữu Phú and Nguyễn Bá Ngọc are the two teachers who volunteered to move to the island.\nPhú said he moved to\xa0the island two years ago. On his very first days, he had to learn to do all the jobs which are usually done by female teachers.\n“I have learnt the skills of dancing, doing crafts and setting up art performances\xa0to bring happiness and joy\xa0for students,” he said.\nNguyễn Bá Ngọc said he was assigned to be in charge of pre-school students. As a new graduate\xa0and unmarried man, he had to learn every skill to take care of children.\nNgọc said he was confused and embarrassed at first, but things got better soon.\n“The children are amazingly studious and obedient. They like to go to school,” he said.\nPhú said the lives of the people on the island were tough, but the children always wanted to go to school.\nPhú said he was allowed to return the mainland for a month-long holiday this summer, but he would cut it short\xa0and come back to the island sooner as there were a lot of jobs that needed to be done before the beginning of the new academic year. — VNS"	society
686	'Agriculture minister calls for stable pork prices'	'A woman buys pork in Nhớn Market, northern Bắc Ninh Province. Pork prices have soared in recent months. —VNA/VNS Photo Thanh Thương\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0Soaring pork prices are making farmers reluctant to sell their pigs, worsening the current supply shortage.\nSpeaking at a conference on Thursday, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường pointed out the tactics farmers and traders use to take advantage of Việt Nam\'s demands for pork products, especially during the year-end.\n“Even when a pig weighs 120kg they refuse to sell, wishing to raise it to grow as big as a buffalo,” he said.\n“Traders hoard thousands of pigs from region to region, waiting for the prices to rise to their expectations. They even smuggle to China to enjoy higher prices."\nThe minister asked firms to work together\xa0to offer suitable prices for pork products to serve rising domestic demand ahead of\xa0Tết (Vietnamese Lunar New Year Holiday) and for exports.\nThe domestic pig breeding industry has had a bumpy year, Cường said, with productivity\xa0dropping 13.5 per cent compared to 2018.\nAfrican swine fever wiped out 9 per cent of Việt Nam’s pig herd.\nAccording to the Department of Animal Health, there are some 25 million pigs including 2.7 million sows, mostly on big farms where standards of hygiene are maintained, making it possible to rebuild the pig herd.\nProvinces of Hưng Yên, Hải Dương, Phú Thọ and Bắc Giang have seen their herds recover and\xa0860 areas of biosafe pig farming have been established with investments from private firms.\n“Pork production has attracted\xa0big corporations such as CP and\xa0Masan. Masan, for example, has opened hundreds of outlets for its cold meat products,” he said.\n“The ministry has also urged localities to ensure food supply and safety during Tết,” he added.\nUp to December 22, African swine fever had been newly reported in 23 communes with nearly 30,000 pigs culled. The number is predicted to reach 40,000 by the end of the year, down 74 per cent compared to November and 97 per cent compared to the outbreak\'s peak in May when some 1.27 million pigs were culled.\nFacing the threat of food shortages as the disease spread, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) promoted poultry, cattle and aquaculture as alternatives for pork.\nDespite these efforts, according to the agriculture ministry, the country’s total meat output in 2019 fell 4.1 per cent compared to 2018, estimated at 5.14 million tonnes.\nExtreme weather events severely affected\xa0agriculture in 2019. The market for pork products was also vulnerable to fake news as some people spread baseless information about diseases to force farmers to sell pigs at low prices, Cường said.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, Việt Nam imported 96,000 tonnes of pork valued US$108 million, up 101.7 per cent in volume from the same period in 2018 to stablise the domestic market.\nPork accounts for some 70 per cent of all meat consumed in Việt Nam, making the country second-largest pork consumer in Asia behind China. —\xa0VNS'	society
687	'HCM City told to centre development around transport'	"Construction of Metro Line No.1 in HCM City between Bến Thành Market in District 1 and Suối Tiên Tourism Park in District 9. — VNA/VNS Photo Tiến Lực\nHCM CITY — Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a strategic solution that could help HCM City address its current challenges and develop a sustainable transport network, which would help create a smart and liveable city,\xa0said the director of the municipal Department of Transport, Trần Quang Lâm.\n“A sustainable approach” workshop held recently in the southern city sought to seek feasible solutions for the development of transport and urban integration, and facilitate the participation of private developers in rail projects based on the TOD model through discussions among policymakers, investors and experts.\nLâm said the city was facing two major challenges in the development process, namely how to attract investment for its remaining mass rapid transport (MRT) projects and how to encourage more people to using MRT services.\nAccording to the city’s transport master plan, it plans to build a public transport system comprising eight MRT lines, three tram or monorail lines with a total length of about 240km and a bus rapid transit (BRT) network.\nMRT No.1 between Bến Thành and Suối Tiên and MRT No.2 linking Bến Thành and Tham Lương and BRT No.1 are under construction and will start operating in the next few years.\nLâm said the slow implementation of the projects was affecting the city's plans to meet public travel needs and development of its transport system.\n“It is necessary to apply lessons from abroad to implement TOD projects.”\nNeil Ronald Harvey, general director of global consulting firm Arup Việt Nam, said leveraging TOD could help the city achieve a more sustainable, connected and green future, and generate significant progress towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n“This could improve daily commutes in HCM City, and fundamentally reshape the city through better integration of land use with transport infrastructure and altering ingrained travel habits.”\nThis is a good time to bring together the public and private sectors to explore and advance TOD opportunities in the city, he said.\nArup’s experts are willing to share their experiences and insights into TOD in planning, financing and design, and offer recommendations and strategies, he said.\nAssoc Prof Nguyễn Quốc Hiển, director of the Management Authority for Urban Railway’s project preparation and investment unit, said the city should diversify investment sources.\n“Public-private partnership (PPP) is the best option for the city in implementing major projects.”\nUrban development and plans around metro terminals could help attract more real estate investment, he added.\nAndy Hodgson, principal – advisory, planning and design at Arup, said TOD was often focused on practical considerations for the developer such as footfall, location, look and feel, uniqueness\xa0and commerciality.\nSuccessful city planning is therefore about developing a common objective between city planning and the strategies of investors and developers, he said.\n“This means striking the right balance of direct and indirect government revenue streams for development around transportation infrastructure.”\nThere are a number of opportunities that the Government can leverage to support financing of new infrastructure, including direct value (PPP, master developer), and indirect value (property and land tax, developer contributions, betterment charges, tax increment financing), according to Hodgson.\n“Ultimately there is no one-size-fits-all approach, with cities taking many different approaches concluding in varying degrees of success.”\nIn the HCM City context, there was a need for co-ordination around a clear development plan delivered through commercially and economically distinct zoning that was activated by transit, he said.\nThe key then would be balancing short- and long-term revenue streams to catalyse the right type of development for the city, he added. — VNS"	society
688	'Survivors remember victims of Christmas bombings'	'by Dương Hoàng Phương\nHÀ NỘI — On the night of December 26, 1972, Nguyễn Văn Cầu returned to his house on Khâm Thiên Street after a\xa0late shift at Hà Nội Mới (New Hà Nội) newspaper.\nWhen he got there, all he could see were\xa0flames and\xa0ruins, with\xa0cries ringing out in the dark. The entire street had been\xa0laid to waste by bombs dropped by 30 US B52 aircraft.\nBefore leaving his house to go to work, the last thing he did was\xa0tell his family to hide in a bomb shelter.\nThe pain he felt was unbearable when he arrived at the shelter at\xa019 Sân Quần Alley to find\xa0his wife’s body half buried in rubble.\nHis son, brother and two nieces could not be found.\nHe lost five loved ones that\xa0night.\nThe shelter could not save\xa0innocent civilians from the carpet bombing which ravaged 1km of the densely-populated area, destroying almost 2,000 houses, pagodas, temples, schools and clinics.\n“Two big bombs were dropped either side of Khâm Thiên Street. The one that hit the shelter\xa0killed more than 50 people inside,” Cầu said.\n“The authorities took the\xa0unclaimed bodies\xa0to Văn Điển Cemetery for burial.\xa0My brother’s body was not found until two months later in a garbage dump,” he said.\nKhâm Thiên Street was ravaged on the night of\xa0December 26, 1972. VNA/VNS File Photo\nCầu’s relatives were among 287 civilians killed in one of the largest airstrikes ever carried out by the US Air Force in the capital.\nAmong the victims were 91 women, 40 elderly people\xa0and 55 children. Up to 290 others were wounded.\nIn just one night, about 8,000 local residents were left homeless, and 178 children were made\xa0orphans. There was also a man who lost his wife just two days after their marriage. Some families were completely wiped out.\nAfter seven days of consecutive bombings across\xa0Hà Nội, local residents returned home on Christmas Day, believing the enemy would not conduct any raids during\xa0the holiday.\nThe raid on Khâm Thiên surprised everyone because it held no\xa0strategic value for the\xa0Americans.\nNguyễn Văn Hòa, living at 31 Khâm Thiên Street, then a high school student, was lucky to survive the raid.\n“I still vividly remember it.\xa0The feeling back then is much lighter now, but the obsession is always there: dilapidated houses, smoking bombs, ruins.”\n“The B52 attacks always took place at night. The next morning, everyone saw the entire street had been razed and we could see from one end to the other end. Rescue forces had to work hard to recover the victims. The whole\xa0scene was such a disaster.”\n“After 47 years, this area has changed so much, way different to what it was before. Today, thanks to the efforts of the Khâm Thiên people, everything has been restored. But for the previous generation like us, it is still unforgettable,” he told Việt Nam News.\nEvery year, December 26 is\xa0the joint death anniversary of nearly 300 Khâm Thiên\xa0people.\nIn 1973, in remembrance of the victims, a memorial of a woman holding a child lying\xa0motionless in her arms was erected at No 51. The woman appears to be taking\xa0a step forward with a blank expression on her face, showing the spirit of ‘never give up”.\nThe memorial has become a gathering point for\xa0local people every year to mourn the victims and to look back at the past when Hà Nội’s people and troops fought and won a legendary victory.\nDuring the 12 days and nights of the 1972 campaign, dubbed\xa0“Hà Nội-Điện Biện Phủ in the Air”, the Vietnamese Air Force shot down 81 aircraft, forcing the US to sit down at the negotiating\xa0table to sign the Paris Agreement in 1973 and pull out of Việt Nam.\n“There is Vietnamese saying that ‘one should not hit a man when he is down’. Losses of\xa0the past cannot be\xa0changed. Now we have\xa0normalised relations with the US following our State policy,” Nguyễn Văn Cầu, now in his 80s, said.\n“I think Việt Nam-US relations now follow\xa0the spirit\xa0of “shelving the past, looking to the future”, because Việt Nam\xa0is willing to be\xa0friends with all countries. We should together preserve peace and\xa0create a peaceful environment to build and develop the national economy and improve people’s lives for independence, freedom and happiness,” Hòa, the witness, said. — VNS'	society

People will also get free medical consultations and blood testing at the sites instead of going to hospitals. People and residents in surrounding areas can visit to the site to donate blood whenever they feel is most convenient.\nThrough the gift of testing packages, blood donors can get more useful information about health such as the number of blood cell components, liver and kidney function, early diagnosis and control of risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, blood diseases, cancer screening.\nLeaders of NIHBT and Đống Đa District visit a blood donor at the third fixed blood donation site in Đống Đa District, Hà Nội. — VNS Photo Thanh Hải\nBlood shortage occurs nationwide\nNIHBT said that many localities across the country are facing a shortage of blood for emergency aid and treatment, especially blood types O and A, due to the lack of blood donors during the end of the year and Tết (Lunar New Year) holiday periods.\nIt is estimated that the whole country needs around 300,000 units of blood during this period. However, NIHBT said that its maximum blood collection is only about 200,000 units due to the decline of donors and increase of blood demand for emergency aid and treatment.\nNearly 50 per cent of blood is\xa0donated from students. Blood shortage usually happens during\xa0summer, as well as before and after the Tết holiday because many donors, mainly students, come back to their home towns\xa0for summer or Tết vacations.\nIn 2019, the country received over 1.6 million blood units, meeting 70 per cent of blood demand for emergencies, treatment and prevention. The NIHBT has provided 640,000 units of blood and blood products to 170 hospitals in 25 provinces and cities in the north, covering approximately 40 million people.— VNS'	society

My children also study harder. I can also sew at night. I am very happy,” said Lầu Thị Chá, a resident from Hua Sin 1 village.\nHạng A Tà, Chá’s neigbour, said people used to use oil lamps, candles or burn\xa0firewood for light in the past.\nSome families bought a generator and placed it under the stream to make use of water flow to produce electricity.

Those who grow Cát Chu and Hòa Lộc now use bags to cover young mangoes to protect them from pests. This method also helps reduce the use of pesticides, gives the fruits an attractive appearance and increases yields by 20-30 per cent.\nMore than 6,300ha of orchards now fruit in the off-season, when farmers can get VNĐ10,000 per kilogramme more than during the main season.\nĐoàn Thanh Hiền, a member of the Mỹ Xương Mango Cooperative in Cao Lãnh District, was one of the province’s first farmers to adopt good agricultural practices (GAP) standards to grow mangoes in the off-season.\nThe main harvest season is April-May.\nThe province has focused on GAP in recent years and now has mangoes grown to VietGAP quality on 181ha and GlobalGAP quality on 42ha.\nIt exports the fruit to a number of markets, including the US and Australia.\nIt has helped its four mango co-operatives and 37 co-operative groups link up with companies in HCM City and Hà Nội to export the fruit to South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Russia and China.\nMango is one of the five key agricultural produce in Đồng Tháp’s agricultural restructuring plan for the period up to 2020.\nIt targets output of 125,000 tonnes worth VNĐ1.9 trillion ($81.9 million) this year, up VNĐ269 billion from last year, according to the department. – VNS'	society

Children, old people and those with respiratory diseases\xa0start experiencing health effects when the AQI hits 100.\nSeven million children die of air pollution-related diseases per year while nine of 10\xa0breathe air not healthy for humans worldwide, according to the World Health Organisation.\nChildren’s health and cognitive development are damaged by exposure to poor environmental conditions, especially polluted air.\nCity authorities called for interdisciplinary co-ordination in coping with rising air pollution.\nThe Hà Nội Department of Environment Protection Department was asked to maintain the stable operation of air quality tracking systems and\xa0integrate\xa0its information with data collected from the stations of French\xa0and US embassies.\nThe Department of Health will have to implement mechanisms to prevent respiratory diseases once the AQI reaches unhealthy levels, including guiding people to protect themselves from filthy air.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Construction is responsible for working with Urban Environment Company\xa0and its subsidiaries to control dust by vacuuming and watering streets whenever the AQI starts being reported at 'unhealthy for sensitive groups'\xa0levels at 101. All trucks weighing from 1.5 tonnes can only enter the city within Belt Road No 3 from 22.00 to 6.00 of the following day.\nCity police were asked to launch campaigns to fine vehicles loading construction materials and waste without suitable covers. At the same time, city authorities will encourage people to stop using honeycomb briquettes and burning crops, which both\xa0worsen\xa0air pollution in Hà Nội.\nEarlier this month, the Ministry of Health\xa0for the first time\xa0announced a list of 14 recommendations to deal with air pollution.\nThe announcement was made only a week after extreme air pollution hit Hà Nội with the AQI stuck at hazardous levels.\nAccording to Lê Việt Phú, an economist from HCM City-based Fulbright University Việt Nam, air pollution cost\xa0the country 5 to 7 per cent of GDP in 2018, equivalent to US$11.4 to 15.9 billion, with approximately 40,000 deaths related to unhealthy air. — VNS"	society

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — More than 1.5 million domestic jobs were created in 2019, while 147,000 people were sent to work overseas, the labour ministry reported on Wednesday.\nIn a year-end review conference by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, deputy minister Lê Tấn Dũng said that a total of over 1.65 million Vietnamese were employed this year, slightly surpassing the initial target by 3.5 per cent.\nSuch achievements came following a series of actions and plans carried out by the ministry to develop the labour market, forecast demand and play an intermediary role to connect supply and demand in the market, Dũng said.\n“The ministry has carried out a range of programmes, projects and policies on employment aid for workers, especially young adults, people with disabilities, rural and migrant workers, women and those of ethnic minorities,” he said.\nThe ministry also tried to improve the performance of job centres while opening various job exchanges and job fairs more regularly, according to the deputy minister.\nRegarding efforts to expand the overseas labour market, Dũng reported that the ministry successfully explored a number of new and potential markets in Europe in 2019.\nIt also identified the underdeveloped southwestern region to be a new source of labour supply, offering more training to local workers there who were then able to sign work contracts with partners abroad, he added.\n“We’ve managed to send more than 147,000 labourers to work overseas under contracts (in 2019). In total, we’ve sent more than 550,000 workers abroad over the last four years.”\nSuch fruitful outcomes, however, could not entirely lift the increasing pressure to create more sustainable jobs for the young generation and especially those in the countryside, the deputy official admitted.\nOne of the biggest issues was a weak network of vocational training facilities which failed to meet the demand of the labour market and the needs of socio-economic development of the localities, Dũng said.\nAnother rampant problem was employees working overseas who dropped their contracts and illegally stayed in the foreign country, which consequently diminished efforts to export more workers, he said.\n‘Take better care’\nSpeaking at the conference, National Assembly (NA) chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân praised the ministry for achieving all key targets, one of which was to amend the important Law on Labour and had it pass through the NA.\nWhile asking the ministry to keep rolling out programmes to increase the quality of vocational training, Ngân also demanded it to start assessing and reviewing the prevailing social security policies in 2020. Those which are deemed no longer appropriate should be changed for new ones, she said.\n“We have to realise policies towards those with war merits. We have to take better care of them,” the chairwoman said.\n“We have to raise the living standards of ethnic minority folks and those living in remote areas even higher”. — VNS'	society

However, the data is not synchronised, making it difficult to share data among facilities.\nUp to 70 per cent of pharmacies have medicine management software but still sell medicine without prescriptions.\nAt private medical facilities, prescriptions are written so it is difficult to track who prescribed the medicine and to ensure the prescribed medicine is sold to patients.\n"Since the software is applied nationwide, written medical records will be replaced with technology," he said.\nAll prescriptions sent from healthcare facilities nationwide would be saved on the software and shared with patients and medicine suppliers.\nThe e-prescriptions would be connected with e-medical records.\nThrough the system, only prescribed medicines could be sold to avoid the abuse of antibiotics and controlled medicine.\n“Patients can track the names of doctors who prescribed the medicine to ask for repeat prescriptions and give feedback. Data will be saved on the system to identify prescription violations,” he said.\nPatients would be also warned of outdated and prohibited medicine.\nNguyễn Hà, an office worker in\xa0Hà Nội’s Hoàn Kiếm District, said “The national e-prescription is such a good idea to manage prescription in the era of 4.0.

I only need to tell the pharmacist the code to buy medicine.”\nThe system is being piloted in Hà Tĩnh and Hưng Yên and has been assessed as operating smoothly so far. The pilot is set to end in a year.\nAll prescriptions have been sent to the software and shared with the health ministry, local health departments and healthcare facilities. Pharmacies have received the prescriptions and sold medicine following the prescriptions.\nWith only one code for each prescription, patients can buy medicine anywhere in Việt Nam.\nIn 2018, the health ministry launched a software to connect medicine supplying facilities.

Nearly 30 cyberattacks are reported in Việt Nam every day. — VNA/VNS Photo Huy Hùng\n\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam reports approximately 26 cyberattacks per day, with Governmental agencies, banks and e-commerce websites the most vulnerable.\nNguyễn Thành Hưng, deputy minister of information and communications, delivered the data at the Tuesday cyberattack drill for northern provinces in Hà Nội hosted by the Việt Nam Computer Emergency Response Team (VNCERT).\nThe drill drew the participation of 300 attendants, including about 150 IT technicians and officials from the State agencies, banks and enterprises.\nHưng said that the Government was focusing resources into building a functional e-Government, with the websites or electronic portals being a fundamental part to connect authorities with people and businesses.\nSo far, 17 of 23 ministries and all 63 provinces and cities of Việt Nam have launched their own websites.\nFrom October 20 to November 17, 744 cyberattacks were reported to VNCERT including 428 malware attacks, 254 phishing scams and 62 website defacement attacks. Việt Nam’s websites, especially those belonging to State agencies, have thousands of security holes, which could allow hackers to gain unauthorised access and interfere with operations and data.\nThe systems’ low security sophistication can lead to breaches of information related to servers, services, domains or email lists. Failures to update security patches also allow hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and let the number of holes remain high.\n"Information security is quite similar to healthcare sector, in developing countries, the focus is primarily on treating the diseases while the developed countries pay a lot of attention to preventive measures," Hưng said, urging State agencies to focus more on protection against attacks rather than how to deal with incidents and breaches when they already occur.\nNguyễn Trọng Đường, deputy head of Authority of Information Security, said the Government should have invested in training the IT labour force and upgraded technology and innovation.\nThis year\'s drill focused on websites’ attack prevention and control. Participants were divided into 30 teams and each managed an independent network of servers running on cloud software. Stimulated attacks were carried out in different ways, forcing teams to be flexible in making responses.\nTeams were required to perform quick situation analysis, investigation and come up with solutions to resist the attacks, protecting systems, making patches and mitigating further incidents.\nA similar event for southern provinces is set for December 26 in Vĩnh Long Province. — VNS'	society

As many as 1,100 households in Nam Sơn, Hồng Kỳ and Bắc Sơn communes were to receive compensation worth a total of VNĐ3.4 trillion (US$146.2 million). However, the compensation payment was not completed.\nSo far, after nearly 20 years living with environmental pollution and noxious odours released by the rubbish dump, local residents have blocked lorries from taking rubbish to the dump six times.\nThe first time was on June 26, 2016, because they did not agree with the compensation plan.\nThe latest incident was the third time this year the residents blocked the lorries.\nAt present, about 80 per cent of rubbish from Hà Nội is taken to the rubbish dump, equal to about 5,000 tonnes per day. — VNS'	society

The income enables families to plant long-term crops and breed animals.”\nThe commune has hundreds of ethnic minority households growing mulberry and breeding silkworms on an area of 200ha, he said.\nSilk processors now buy cocoons at VNĐ130,000-150,000 ($5.6-6.5) per kilogramme and farmers earn VNĐ30,000-50,000 per kilogramme, according to agricultural officials.\nUnder the five-year plan for sericulture\xa0it unveiled in June, the province aims to have 9,500-10,000ha under mulberry, including 8,100-8,500ha of new and hybrid trees with high yields, by 2023. — VNS"	society

With the accusation from the procuracy, I might have to pay with my own life,” Son said, staring down at the floor.\nThe prosecutors in their opening statements proposed a death penalty for the former minister for his alleged breaches of public investment management causing severe consequences and bribery.\nSon begged for a lenient punishment to give him "the chance to live with family, friends and comrades after serving my sentence".\n‘Bitter end’\nAnother ex-communications minister standing trial, Trương Minh Tuấn, also expressed his regrets and repentance.\n“I’ve had 41 years serving the country, including 10 years in the army and there were times I stood guarding the border in the north. It never once occurred to me that there would be a day I’d come to a bitter end like this – saying my last words in a trial which will soon deliver my sentence,” Tuấn said.\n“My violations are like cuts of a blade that will leave scars on my soul for the rest of my life,” he said, barely holding back the tears.\nThe ex-official also asked for a lighter sentence, though he admitted the prosecutors had already showed leniency for him.\nHà Nội People’s Court opened a trial against 14 defendants in the case last Monday and a verdict is expected on the morning of December 28. — VNS'	society

There are many works that have been damaged or degraded during the maintenance period, but investors have not been able to get contractors to promptly repair them. In many cases, repairs were delayed for a long time, affecting traffic safety and causing public annoyance.\nThe DRVN asked the Road Administration and the Department of Transport to intensify inspections,\xa0detect defects\xa0of the works and request concerned agencies to repair them.\nThe directorate also highlighted the need to\xa0evaluate the repairing work\xa0of the investor, project management board and enterprise and strictly handle violations, it said.\nRegarding\xa0BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) investors who fail\xa0to take responsibility for maintenance work, the DRVN asked the departments of transport and the Road Administration to propose fines, cut\xa0maintenance costs,\xa0stop collecting fees, and\xa0handle contractual violations, depending on the seriousness of the violation.\nFor public investment projects, BT (Build-Transfer) projects and other projects, contractors would see their project guarantees revoked\xa0or be banned from participating in bidding for a period of time.\nFor projects using State funds, the units must report truthfully on the quality of the project when maintenance expires and take responsibility for project quality.\nFor projects that the Ministry of Transport, DRVN and local departments of transport are assigned to act as investors, the Directorate for Roads of Việt Nam requested\xa0units to urgently ask contractors to repair damage\xa0or defects during the maintenance period and strictly supervise the repair performance. — VNS'	society

Liên started to donate her breast milk last\xa0year after she gave birth to her first child. She has donated nearly 70 litres so far.\n“The breast milk is believed to be a precious gift, helping newborn and premature babies in the hospital to strengthen their resistance against diseases,” Hương said.\nAnother volunteer, Trương Thị Khánh Ly, is a nurse at the hospital. She spends her lunch break travelling 30km from Hội An Ancient Town to take breast milk from Bùi Thị Thuý Lan – a “VIP” donor, who already gave more than 105 litres in seven months.\nAround 400 mothers have passed strict hygiene and safety tests to allow them to donate milk to the bank, helping hundreds of newborn babies, especially those who are ill.\nIt is estimated about 50 volunteers like\xa0Hương and Ly, now working for the milk bank. They are medical staff of the hospital, Thanh Niên (Young People) newspaper reported.\nThey are divided into three groups to cover all districts of the city and manage the list of donors. The volunteers are tasked to receive and transport the milk after the donor contacts the milk bank’s hotline.\nThe volunteers are given specialised bags and a hygiene kit to store the breast milk at the correct temperature.\nEach trip must take no longer than two hours to ensure the quality of the milk. After the breast milk is transported to the milk bank, it will be sterilised and stored.\nData shows nearly 5,450 litres of breast milk have been donated so far.\n11,000 babies benefit from donated breast milk.\nNearly 11,000 babies have benefited from the milk bank in the past three years, said Nguyễn Thị Thu Phương, deputy head of the hospital’s Neonatal Department.\nPremature babies and ill newborn babies, whose parents were poor, would receive the free milk from the bank, she said.\nAdditionally, the donated breast milk would be provided to the babies in the hospital, who need help when their mother was ill or had not enough breast milk.\nThere is a small fee to cover sterilisation and preservation of VNĐ130,000 (US$4.3) per 100ml, she said, with the money being used to pay for equipment and maintain the storage facility.\nLê Đức Toàn, secretary of the hospital’s Youth Union, said the bank’s volunteer team was expected to be developed into a network with its supports outside the hospital, aiming to help more babies in the future.\nThe Việt Nam’s first breast milk bank opened on February 6, 2017 after the Đà Nẵng Department of Health and the hospital worked with international organisations to highlight the importance of breast milk and the ability milk banks to offer a solution for optimal growth and development of children.\nThe hospital is one of leading hospitals in the field of paediatrics and obstetrics nationwide. It welcomes 13,000-15,000 births each year.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, breast milk is the natural first food for babies, it provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a child’s nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one-third during the second year of life.\nBreast milk promotes sensory and cognitive development, and protects the infant against infectious and chronic diseases. Exclusive breastfeeding reduces infant mortality due to common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea or pneumonia, and helps for a quicker recovery during illness. —VNS'	society

Giving blood to save people is a noble gesture, deepening the tradition of loving people of Vietnamese people.”\nBình also said organisations and sectors should have more activities such as blood donation\xa0and patient support activities like the Red Sunday programme.\nDeputy Minister of Health Đỗ Xuân Tuyên said blood donations have been developed strongly in the country in the past. Blood collection has increased to 1.6 million units in 2019, compared to more than 100,000 units in 1994. Blood volume is mainly donated from volunteers, reaching 98 per cent of total collection.\nTuyên said the situation of blood shortage was being handled. The country has thousands of people who have donated their blood more than 50 times and hundreds of families who donate together. Many organisations and companies regularly organised blood donation events.\nHowever, Tuyên said the amount of blood supply nationwide has only reached 75 per cent. Seasonal blood shortages and shortage of specific blood types still often occurs.\n“The Red Sunday programme has been contributing to handling the situation of blood shortages that usually happen before and after Tết (Lunar New Year) holidays,” stressed Tuyên.\nTuyên expected more people will participate in the Red Sunday in particular and the country’s blood donation movements in general in the future.\nTiền Phong (Vanguard) newspaper editor-in-chief Lê Xuân Sơn said that the Red Sunday programme cannot grow without the enthusiastic participation of Youth Union members, young people and blood donors from all walks of life.\n“Blood collection has increased from 96 blood units at one blood donation point in Hà Nội in 2009 to 49,733 units in 33 provinces and cities with 70 blood donation points in early 2019,” said Sơn.\nLieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Viết Lân from the Ministry of Defence said this is the fourth time he has donated since\xa0he was a student in 1995. From 2017 until now, he has participated in blood donation for three consecutive years.\n“I think this is a meaningful festival because a drop of blood can save lives,” said Lân.\n“I will continue to donate blood as long as I can.”\nThe organisers expected that the Red Sunday 2020 that takes place in 40 provinces and cities with nearly 80 blood donation points will collect at least 50,000 blood units.\nInitiated in 2009, the Red Sunday, is organised by Tiền Phong newspaper in collaboration with the National Traffic Safety Committee, National Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, aims to handle shortage of blood for emergency and treatment during periods of the Lunar New Year. — VNS'	society

He also suffered from severe malnutrition,” Thành said.\n“Volvulus and necrosis of the small intestine are rare so it's a challenge to diagnose and treat them, even in hospitals equipped with full medical equipment and devices. It was more difficult here at the field hospital in the war-torn South Sudan,” he said.\n“The patient was in critical condition and could have died, so we had to make a quick decision after primary diagnosis in order to save him,” Thành said.\n“Due to a shortage of medical equipment, we had to perform open surgery on the patient,” he said.\n“It was lucky that the surgery was successful after five hours,” Thành said.\n“The patient was transferred to a higher level hospital after a few days for further treatment and he was discharged after two weeks,” he said.\n“The procedure was praised by Mongolian soldiers and doctors, as well as UN staff. Many foreign doctors were surprised that the Vietnamese doctors were able to perform the surgery in difficult conditions,” Thành said.\n“I feel very proud and happy to have saved our patient that day,” he said.\nDoctor Lại Bá Thành (second from left) performs an operation\xa0on a Mongolian patient at Việt Nam’s level-2 field hospital in South Sudan. — Photo courtesy of Doctor Lại Bá Thành\nThis is just one example of over 30 operations Thành successfully performed during his 14 months serving as a UN peacekeeper in South Sudan.\nThành left Việt Nam for the African country together with 62 other military officials in October 2018.\nThe Vietnamese medical contingent was in charge of running the UN level-2 field hospital in Bentiu to provide medical care for over 1,800 military and civilian UN staff working in the north of South Sudan. They also took part in foreign affairs and offered medical care to locals.\nChallenges\nAccording to UN standards, a level-II field hospital must be able to examine and offer treatment to a maximum of 40 outpatients a day and 20 inpatients within seven days. It should also self-equip with sufficient medicines, needles and other supplies needed in any circumstances while being able to provide both land and aviation patient transfers to a medical facility of a higher level.\nOperating this kind of field hospital in a foreign country was a huge challenge for the Vietnamese army doctors, who had literally no experience before.\nAlthough an intense training course was designed for the doctors with lessons in politics, English, military capabilities, survival skills, and ensuring security and safety, things in reality went beyond their imagination.\nThành remembers vividly their first days in Bentiu.\n“All of us were shocked. Temperatures in Bentiu, one of the driest areas in South Sudan, range from 45-50 degrees Celsius. And there were no trees, making it even hotter,” he recalled.\n“We ate canned food without vegetables. Water resources were not guaranteed in terms of both quality and quantity, and sanitation was very poor,” he said.\n“Instead of carrying out operations in well-equipped and hygienic operating rooms, we had to perform field operations in tents filled with dust,” Thành said.\n“Working in a war-torn country, we also had to take measures like any army unit during a war. We had to strictly follow UN peacekeeping rules as well as local and Vietnamese laws and military discipline to ensure safety,” he added.\n“However, as soldiers, we encouraged each other to overcome these difficulties.”\n“We found ways to adapt to the new environment such as learning from soldiers from other countries and planting trees and flowers with seeds brought from Việt Nam to make the barren area greener while supplementing our diets with vegetables,” he said.\n“And we all gradually fitted into the new environment,” he said.\nApart from performing their daily duties as doctors, the Vietnamese soldiers took part in exchanges with delegations from other countries where they shared experience, and sang and danced with each other like close friends.\n“Fourteen months working in South Sudan was a great chance for military doctors like us to learn a lot of new things,” Thành said.\n\n\nThe first members of\xa0Việt Nam’s level-2 field hospital arrive in South Sudan on October 2, 2018. — VNA/VNS Photo\nMission completed\nAll of the hospital staff returned to Việt Nam last month. “We were proud to have fulfilled the tasks assigned by the State and army,” Thành said.\nThe hospital treated 2,022 patients including UN staff in South Sudan and local officials and residents, according to the Việt Nam Department of Peacekeeping Operations.\nMany serious cases were successfully treated, including 62 surgeries.\nDeputy Prime Minister Trương Hoà Bình said at a ceremony held by the Ministry of Defence on December 5 in HCM City to welcome the doctors home that the dedicated military medical personnel's outstanding reputation honoured the country.

737	'A flight to remember'	"The Vietnam Air Force’s Brigade 918 in 2004. Photos\xa0Courtesy of Nguyễn Anh Sơn\nThu Vân\nHÀ NỘI - A group of Vietnamese engineers were sent to build concrete structures on Gạc Ma, Cô Lin and Len Đao (Landsdowne) Reefs on March 14, 1988, but were attacked by six Chinese frigates.\nSixty four engineers were killed, 11 wounded and nine kept in prison by the Chinese navy.\nInjured soldiers were taken to Sinh Tồn Island (Sin Cowe Island), an island in the Spratly Islands. On March 15, 1988, Colonel Nguyễn Anh Sơn and his flight team under the Vietnam Air Force’s Brigade 918 was tasked with delivering clothes and medicines to the Sinh Tồn Island.\n“We have to drop the supplies near the island, not too far so that our soldiers can come and take them,” Sơn said.\nThe most important thing was not to break the serum bottles, he added.\nSơn, who had been trained as an army pilot in Bulgaria for six years, proposed to his seniors that he would try to drop the supplies at the height of less than 50 metres.\nAfter some serious consideration, the plan was approved. In reality, no pilots in the brigade had ever dropped supplies from such a low position. Safety reasons, of course.\nOn March 16, five packages of supplies were loaded onto the AN-26, a twin-engined turboprop military transport aircraft, designed and produced in the Soviet Union. From the Cam Ranh Airport, Sơn and his flight crew would have to avoid areas where Chinese navy ships were located if they wanted to be safe.\nThat would require more fuel.\nBut since the supplies cargo took much of the space, carrying extra fuel tanks was not an option.\nThey decided to take the shorter route.\nThere was no guidance system for AN-26 at the time: once the aircraft was 200km from the coast, they were on their own with no dials to guide the way.\n“We knew it was dangerous – we knew it could mean fatal – but our comrades were waiting and we couldn’t look at them in the eyes if we could not deliver,” Sơn said.\nThe only spot the crew can observe to know they’re near their target is Đá Lớn Reef, which was 50km to the east of Sinh Tồn Island.\nThirty minutes after taking off, which meant they had been quite far, Đá Lớn Reef was no where to be seen.\nSơn said the crew would keep flying for ten more minutes.\nIt was getting dark and the fuel was limited.\nTen minutes passed. The crew were silent.\nColonel Sơn felt uneasy. He decided one last idea, ordering the crew to turn right.\n\n\nColonel Nguyễn Anh Sơn pilots a flight in 2004.\nFor many times during his army life, he had never returned without completing his mission. There was one time in Siem Riep where he was informed that the safety zone was only two kilometres, but he still decided to land and bring injured comrades home.\nThen the silence on board was broken as one of the crew member shouted out: “There it is!”. Đá Lớn Reef was seen.\nMinh, the pilot, decreased the altitude. Then he said: “There’s a battle ship in front of us!”\nThe ship, as big as a football pitch, was just under the aircraft. Sơn could almost felt the flag on the ship's mast touching the fuselage.\n“Keep flying straight, even if they start shooting it would be hard to be shot at this angle,” Sơn said.\nLuckily, there was no shooting. They avoided the ship, but missed their chance to drop the supplies at that side of the Sinh Tồn Island. The crew decided to drop the supplies at the north side of the island.\nThey could see their soldiers running to their direction, the clear blue sea, and the greenish coral under the water. The aircraft continued to decrease its altitude.\n“I knew it was dangerous, but I couldn’t risk breaking all the serum bottles that my comrades need to treat the injured.

Students should not be on our roads without protective equipment for their developing brains.”\nThe Helmets for Kids programme demonstrates to students, as well as their parents, the importance of wearing a helmet whenever they are travelling on a motorcycle or bicycle, he added.\nThe programme gifted helmets to students and taught them injury prevention on roads through various activities and games.\nNguyễn Thảo Chi, a fifth-grader, said: “Before the programme I knew that I should wear a helmet, but my family could not afford to provide me one. I am so happy I have this helmet now, and will wear it always.”\nThe AIP Foundation has collaborated with the Việt Nam National Traffic Safety Committee and Ministry of Education and Training for the programme with sponsorship from the Vietnam Garment Manufacturing Company-TAL Apparel.\nHelmets for Kids was implemented for the first time in Bình Xuyên District last year at the Bá Hiến B Primary School, and resulted in 76 per cent of its students wearing helmets as against 1 per cent before the programme.\nGreig Craft, founder and president of the AIP Foundation, said: “Changing the culture surrounding road safety is not always easy, but that’s why we start in the classroom by targeting children. The Helmets for Kids programme is not only about providing new helmets, it is also about teaching young children important skills which will last throughout their lifetime.” — VNS'	society

Preliminary results were published in July this year.\nThe census began on April 1 this year, making it the\xa0fifth population and housing census in Việt Nam since the country’s reunification in 1975. The\xa0previous census was conducted in 2009.\nThe census found the population density of Việt Nam was 290 people per square kilometre, up 31 people compared to 10 years before. These results positioned Việt Nam as the third most densely populated country in Southeast Asia, behind the Philippines with 363 people per square kilometre and Singapore with 8,292 people per square kilometre.\nThe average life expectancy among the Vietnamese population was 73.6 years old, 71 years old for males and 76.3 for females. Life expectancy in the country has increased since 1989, rising from 65.2 in 1989.\nMore than a third of the population aged 15 years and over graduated from upper secondary school or higher, making up 36.5 per cent, a nearly two-fold increase compared to 2009.\nNearly 88 per cent of the Việt Nam population aged 25-59 participated in the labour force, with the greatest proportion of the labour force aged 25-29.\nHousehold accommodations and living conditions also significantly improved. Nearly 99.4 per cent of households used national grid electricity for lighting and 97.4 per cent of\xa0households used hygienic water sources.\nNguyễn Bích Lâm, director of the GSO, said the census would serve the country’s socio-economic development policy making and monitor progress towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe census applied information technology in all aspects to improve information quality, increase the transparency of statistical analysis, shorten the time for data processing and cut costs, he said.\nNaomi Kitahara, UNFPA\xa0Representative in Việt Nam, said the census helped the international community understand more broadly Việt Nam’s progress and areas needed for international support.\nThe success of the census counted on the\xa0efforts of the entire political system, including from the Census Steering Committees at all levels, of nearly 147,000 thousands of enumerators, team leaders and supervisors, and most importantly, the participation of the Vietnamese people themselves, she said.\n“The success of the census provides a further track record of the Government’s impressive capacity to co-ordinate and conduct the Population and Housing Census and other large-scale population-based surveys,” she said.\nSpeaking at the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ said\xa0Việt Nam was the first\xa0country to equip mobile equipment of different kinds for enumerators to collect information and data.\nThe success was recognised by the international community and several countries came to Việt Nam to learn from this experience, including Sri Lanka and Nepal.\nDeputy PM Huệ asked organisations to make reports and analysis based on the census data. The analysis will be the foundation for future socio-economic strategies.\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng said over the last 10 years, despite a number of difficulties and challenges, Việt Nam had made significant achievements across health care, education, employment and living conditions of the people, through direction from the Party, management from the State and the tireless efforts of the people.\nThe education level among the population improved and more children are enrolled at school, while the rate of persons with technical qualifications grew whereas population health, especially maternal and child health, advanced, he said.\n“The achievements can serve as motivation to realise aspirations for a prosperous and happy country for Việt Nam,” he said. — VNS"	society

Once completed, the planning would be handed over to the Hà Nội Urban Planning Institute.\nIn the first quarter of next year, the planning of Sóc Sơn urban area is expected to be reported. Phú Xuyên and Xuân Mai urban areas with six sub-projects were under construction for approval, he said.\nNguyễn Nguyên Quân of the city’s People’s Council said the city had aimed to\xa0complete the planning of the satellite urban areas in 2015, but the target had been missed.\nHe said it was necessary to assign responsibilities to those involved, especially the Department of Planning and Architecture which was the focal point for\xa0planning tasks and appraisal.\nDue to the delay in satellite urban planning, the localities were currently facing difficulties in infrastructure construction as well as construction permits, he said.\nIn reply to Quân, Anh said the\xa0slow construction progress of satellite urban areas was due to the low capacity of the planning consultancy units, a shortage of input data for planning and the lengthened process of stakeholders' consultation.\nFor example, the planning of Sơn Tây satellite urban area consisting\xa0of six wards was assigned to T&T Group. However, due to the consulting unit's inability, the project has not been completed.\nHe suggested it was necessary to accelerate the process of digitising land data to serve planning work. In addition, local leaders needed to strictly follow the planning and supervision of individuals and organisations in the area.\nAccording to the Government’s general planning in 2011, five satellite towns would be built in suburban areas of the city and could accommodate 1.4 million people, accounting for 15 per cent of the city’s population by 2030. — VNS"	society

Việt Nam is a key destination and transit country for rhino horn and other illegal wildlife products. Reducing demand for rhino products in the country is integral to decreasing trade flows and combating poaching.\nRhino horn products are consumed in Việt Nam largely for their perceived health benefits and reflection of wealth and status. The two new PSAs, including two images and messages, challenge these beliefs.\nThe first PSA emphasises the fact that strength and stamina do not come from consuming wildlife products, but instead are the direct results of work and perseverance.\nThe second PSA highlights the incompatibility of wildlife consumption with international business practices. It stresses the risks, including the loss of prestige and reputation, of using, buying, or gifting illegal wildlife products such as rhino horn.\nTo ensure their effectiveness, the PSAs have been developed in partnership with the Vietnamese business community. They will be disseminated through multiple media platforms including print, billboards, and social media to achieve maximum exposure. They will also be promoted by partners such as the Central Committee of Propaganda and Education, Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Vietnam Automobile and Transport Association, and the Vietnam Central Buddhist Association.\nThe Chí Initiative phase 3, funded by USAID, was launched in August 2018. The campaign is working to further mobilise the business community to integrate the protection of wildlife as an element of corporate social responsibility and as a means of making Vietnamese businesses more competitive\nTRAFFIC, a non-governmental organisation working on the wildlife trade, launched the first phase of the Chí initiative in 2014 based on consumer research which identified wealthy Vietnamese businessmen between the ages of 35 and 55 year as a key rhino horn user group. The overarching message of Chí drives the concept that success, masculinity, and good fortune come from an individual’s strength of character and not from the use of illegal wildlife products. — VNS'	society

When she opened the door, she found a newborn girl with her umbilical cord still attached lying in a box at the door.\nThe girl needed special care at hospital for two months and Thanh looked everywhere, but couldn't find any of her family, so she decided to\xa0bring up the girl.\nNow the girl is an eighth grader and\xa0calls Thanh her grandmother and\xa0Thanh’s son her father.\nThanh moved to Liên Nghĩa Town in 2009 and opened an art gallery. She earns her living by drawing pictures and writing stories for newspapers, before fate struck again.\nOn a rainy afternoon in March 2010, when she was drawing pictures in her gallery, two soaked girls and a boy sought shelter in her gallery.\nSpeaking to them, Thanh found out the children were aged between seven and 12. They did not know who their parents were, they were illiterate and earned their living by selling lottery tickets.\nThey did not dare return to their boarding house because they would be beaten by their employers for not selling enough tickets that day.\nFeeling pity for the children, Thanh decided to take them in, and soon, more poor\xa0children came to her house\xa0as her reputation spread.\nSo far as many as 31 children have been brought up by Thanh. At present, nine of them are living with her. The youngest is four years old and the oldest 12.\nTo bring up the children, Thanh must work very hard and look for donations wherever she can find them.\nDespite every obstacle, Thanh feels happy because all of the children are obedient, study well and help\xa0her with the housework.\n“I’m older and older, I do not know how much longer I can live. But if more orphans come, I will feel happy to receive them into my house and take care of them,” said Thanh.\nSpeaking to Thanh Niên,\xa0Nguyễn Anh Đức, deputy chairman of the Liên Nghĩa Town People’s Committee, praised Thanh for her kind heart.\nMany children have grown up and gotten good jobs thanks to Thanh, he said, adding that local authorities had created good condition for Thanh to maintain her work.\nĐức hope that more sponsors would support Thanh so that more orphans and poor children would be helped. — VNS"	society

The clinics will\xa0improve the quality of\xa0primary care for local people.”\n“Expanding covered healthcare services for insured patients will be\xa0good if the health fund has enough to cover the\xa0expenditures,” Hương said.\nHowever, she noted\xa0that the low cost for\xa0health insurance cards may not be\xa0sufficient for the national health insurance fund to cover.\xa0In addition, hospital fees have increased, she said.\nDr Nguyễn Minh Tùng, deputy head of the Bạc Liêu Province's Department of Health, said that the current cost to\xa0buy\xa0health insurance is equal to 4.5 per cent of basic wages for people employed in companies.\nUnder the regulations, the costs are staggered, with the fee\xa0for one person in a family higher than the fee\xa0for the other members of the family.\nHowever, Tùng said the\xa0costs should be increased to 20 per cent of the basic wage instead of 4.5 per cent.\nHương\xa0said this would not affect the\xa0poor and near-poor whose coverage\xa0would be\xa0paid by the local health insurance\xa0fund.\nLê Văn Khảm, director of the Health Insurance Department under the Ministry of Health, said the\xa0health insurance fund would\xa0ensure sufficient\xa0funds\xa0for\xa0insured patients’ medical examinations and treatment next year.\nPhạm Văn Toàn, deputy head of the insurance department, said the cost for buying health insurance, however, would\xa0have to increase in the future to achieve a balanced fund.\nOther issues discussed at the meeting concerned problems related to Việt Nam Social \xa0Security’s payments for insured patients to health facilities and independent health insurance assessments.\nDelegates said that an independent health insurance assessment agency\xa0separate from\xa0Việt Nam Social Security should be created\xa0to address this issue.\nAccording to the department, the number of insured people this year is 89.8 per cent of the population, compared to 71.3 per cent in 2014. The figure\xa0has already exceeded the Government's goal, which was to have\xa080 per cent of the population covered\xa0by the end of 2020.\xa0—\xa0VNS"	society

ACV said it expected\xa0to have VNĐ36.6 trillion ($1.57 billion) by 2025, or 37 per cent of the investment.\nACV has been working\xa0with 12 domestic and international organisations to borrow the remaining amount at an interest rate of 5-5.5 per cent a year with a loan term of 15 years.\nHowever, lawmakers have expressed concerns over the financial capacity of ACV\xa0to build the country’s largest airport, saying that it\xa0could add $2.63 billion to the public debt.\nVũ Hồng Thanh, chairman of the NA’s Economic Committee, said that ACV’s plan\xa0to\xa0borrow nearly\xa0$2.63 billion of the $4.2 billion needed for the project would likely be guaranteed by the Government, thus adding to the public debt.\nBecause ACV has already been tasked with expanding\xa0Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport and other airports, the Government should\xa0evaluate ACV's ability to raise more capital, he added.\nLong Thành is a massive project that will affect\xa0national\xa0defence and security, and the appropriate\xa0investor\xa0must be chosen\xa0to assure efficiency and socio-economic development, according to\xa0Thanh.\nNinety per cent of NA deputies approved Resolution 95 which addresses the\xa0feasibility report for a\xa0runway, terminal and other components in the first phase of construction, with the aim of\xa0serving\xa025 million passengers and 1.2 million tonnes of goods each year by 2025.\nTotal investment of the airport should not exceed VNĐ336.63 trillion ($16 billion) as approved in June 2015, with the first phase costing around VNĐ111.69 trillion ($4.8 billion), it said.\nThe NA also agreed to divide the national defence area of 1,050 hectares into two main parts. An area of 480 hectares will be used to develop the airport with military actions\xa0prioritised.\nUnder the NA resolution, two roads connecting the airport with Highway 51 and HCM City –\xa0Long Thanh – Dầu Giây expressway will be added.\nThe Government is expected to\xa0build a transport system connecting the airport area with the Southern Key Economic Region.\nThe NA has also urged the Government to speed up land clearance for the huge project, saying that the\xa0current process was too slow.\nThe\xa0airport proposal\xa0was approved by the NA four years ago, but funding has remained a significant\xa0issue.\nConstruction was\xa0expected to start\xa0early next year.\xa0To be\xa0built in\xa0three phases over three decades, it would be\xa0the country’s largest airport.\nThe first phase is scheduled for completion in 2025, with\xa0a capacity of 25 million passengers a year.\xa0The next two phases would\xa0run from 2030 to 2035 and from 2040 to 2050.\nOnce completed, it would\xa0have an annual capacity of 100 million passengers and five million tonnes of cargo.\nLocated 40km east of HCM City, the Long Thành airport is expected to\xa0relieve overloading at\xa0Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport in HCM City, the country’s largest airport. — VNS"	society

All 40 patients continued their treatment and did not quit, he said.\nDr Lê Trường Giang, chairman of the HCM City Public Health Association, said the programme was later expanded to six districts because of the positive results. Last year, Right Care was offered in District 7 as well.\nIn addition, medical staff began taking a mobile healthcare vehicle to sites near patients for X-ray tests.\nIf their tests were abnormal, they were then given a free Gene Xpert sputum test which can quickly diagnose pulmonary TB and multi-drug-resistant TB.\nAs\xa0of September this year, a total of 1,703 more TB patients had been diagnosed in the eight districts where the programme now operates.\nAs many as 1,005 of them were treated at health centres, which offer free treatment to all TB patients in the country.\nIn seven of the eight districts, the rate of TB patients giving up treatment was less than two per cent.\n“Identifying high-risk groups and encouraging them to receive free X-Rays or Xpert sputum tests have been important factors in trying to detect\xa0the remaining 40 per cent of people with TB in the city,” he said.\nAround 60 per cent of people who have contracted TB have already been detected, according to estimates from the HCM City Health Association.\nHCM City has the largest number of TB patients in the country, with nearly 15,000 people treated every year, according to the National TB Prevention Programme.\nA nurse taking care of a TB patient at Phạm Ngọc Thạch Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo Đinh Hằng\nLatent TB infection\nSince the second quarter of last year, the programme has provided TB skin tests for 8,017 relatives of patients who had no symptoms in eight districts. Among them, 2,413 tested positive for TB and 55.4 per cent of them were treated.\n“If they are not treated, the latent TB infection will have an increased chance of developing active TB and they could transmit the virus to other people,” Giang said.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a "state of persistent immune response to stimulation by mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens without evidence of clinically manifested active TB".\nIn other words, if someone has latent TB, they are infected with TB bacteria but do not have signs of active TB disease and do not feel ill. However, they can develop active TB in the future.\n“Diagnosis and treatment of latent TB infection can help Việt Nam eliminate TB by 2030, which is the Government’s goal,” Giang said.\nDr Lê Văn Thể, head of District 1’s Health Centre, said: “The district has seen a decrease in the detection of new TB incidences. I expect that the programme, especially mobile X-ray vehicles, will start in District 1 in the near future.”\nNguyễn Hữu Hưng, deputy head of the city\'s Department of Health, has asked the city’s steering board for the National TB Prevention Programme to work with the HCM City Public Health Association on a detailed action plan to expand the programme throughout the city.\nThe plan will be submitted to the city\'s People’s Committee for approval of funds.\nNguyễn Viết Nhung, head of the National TB Prevention Programme, said the Right Care programme had been very effective in identifying and testing people with TB, a practice that the national prorgramme does not undertake.\nHealth staff in other provinces and cities have been encouraged to take part in Right Care. The national goal is to have TB prevalence in less than 131 per 100,000 people, and the number of mortalities due to TB less than 10 per 100,000 by 2020.\nThe aim is also to reduce the number of multi-drug-resistant TB patients to fewer than 5 per cent of the total number of TB patients by 2020.\nThe country ranks 14th of 22 countries that have the highest burden of TB globally.\nViệt Nam has on average 130,000 new TB patients each year, including 5,100 multi-drug-resistant TB patients. About 17,000 people in the country die due to TB each year. — VNS'	society

The objective is to master the MultiBac technique and implement the technology in large-scale biofermenters in Việt Nam, he said.\nTogether with Vabiotech and supported by the FVMR Hub, Berger is targeting the use of MultiBac towards the production of vaccines for pandemic (avian) influenza, as well as rabies and other pathogens.\n“Vabiotech is particularly interested in using MultiBac to produce vaccines to combat avian flu. We saw a few years ago how quickly avian flu, which began in Việt Nam, developed into a global threat for humans,” Berger said. “While the threat of avian flu in Việt Nam still looms, deployment of a suitable vaccine could therefore help prevent future pandemics,” he said, adding that the new technology had been used by many major vaccine manufacturers around the world and successfully developed in more than 1,000 laboratories.\nDr Đỗ Tuấn Đạt, president and director general of Vabiotech, said that MultiBac was particularly suitable for the production of new vaccines with large volumes.\n“Vabiotech is aiming to use MultiBac to produce avian flu vaccines and rabies vaccines, " Đạt said.\nHe explained that with traditional vaccines, based on virus isolation, scientists had to cultivate vaccines on monkey kidneys and chicken eggs.\n“Using this innovative technology, scientists only need to understand the characteristics of the virus strain and genome to start growing. The study period can be shortened to three weeks from the normal level of three months,” Đạt said.\n“When a pandemic happens, the demand for vaccines is high. This new technology will help shorten the research time, improve quality and reduce production costs,” he said.\nAccording to Đạt, the project was in the technological exploration stage and would take at least three years for the company\'s R&D department to develop it successfully. — VNS'	society

VNS Photo Văn Châu\nHCM CITY —\xa0There was not a single social housing project in HCM City this year, and with support funds for them being limited, there is a fear the situation could continue, experts said.\nThe city has a population of around 13 million including about 3 million migrants, according to the HCM City Real Estate Association (HoREA).\nHousing development is of paramount importance as the city would add one million people to its population every five years in 2021-35, Võ Văn Hoan, vice chairman of its People’s Committee, said.\nLê Hoàng Châu, chairman of HoREA, said: “The city’s biggest and most difficult problem is to address the housing needs of a large number of low- and middle-income people, including Government workers, students, workers, and migrants, to ensure social welfare and sustainable development.”\nThe city has nearly 476,000 families, or 25 per cent of the total number, that do not own homes and live with relatives. Of them, more than 20,000 live along and near canals and 35,000 in old apartment buildings that need to be renovated.\nNext year the city is expected to have 20,000 units of social housing, a very small number compared with the demand.\nThe reason is that social housing brings little profit to developers, meaning they are reluctant to undertake them unless there are subsidies and support policies from the government.\nThe city People’s Committee recently announced VNĐ10 billion (US$430,000) has been earmarked for loans to buy social housing this year in 12 districts.\nThe amount is very modest, experts said.\nPeople are finding it very difficult to find apartments for less than VNĐ2 billion ($ 85,500) in the city.\nPrices are up 5-10 per cent on average from just six months ago as a quickly rising population and shortage of new supply puts increasing pressure on them.\nDemand far outstrips supply, Châu said.\nAdministrative procedures take too much time\xa0while transportation to the city’s central areas is not good, meaning people do not want to stay too far from them, he said.\nHoan said to address this problem the city administration plans to call on the private sector to invest in low-income housing.\nIt has also instructed the Department of Construction to review and amend policies to create favourable conditions for enterprises to invest in such housing and for people to be able to buy them.\nChâu said HoREA has called for upgrading traffic infrastructure to link the five suburban districts of Củ Chi, Cần Giờ, Bình Chánh, Hóc Môn, and Nhà Bè with the city’s central areas so that they become more attractive as residential areas. — VNS'	society

But now there is no water. I was quite surprised,” said Đẹp.\nAccording to the Agriculture and Rural Development Department of Vũng Liêm District, all sluice gates at rivers and canals were closed to prevent saline water intrusion to paddy fields.\nThe salinity tended to increase and continued intruding inland with the tide, the department said.\nThe agricultural staff had to measure the salt levels in paddy fields to make appropriate recommendations to farmers as well as provide instructions of taking care rice in conditions of freshwater shortage and salinity intrusion.\nThe agriculture sector of Vĩnh Long Province reported that the salinity measured on Cổ Chiên River in Vũng Liêm District was ranging from 5.8 to 8.2 grammes per kilogramme of water, 0.3 per thousand higher than the peak of 2016, while the salinity on Hậu River in Tân Định District was 6.3 per thousand, increasing by 1.4 per thousand of the peak of 2016.\nThese high salinity levels would be able to devastate large tracts of rice and other crops if the water is let onto the fields.\nThis was the worst saline water intrusion in 38 years in Vĩnh Long Province, according to the provincial hydro-meteorological Centre.\nThe salinity intrusion occurs from February to May, with a peak in March and April, every year.\nBut in recent years, the phenomenon has happened earlier with higher salt levels due to climate change.\nThis was the first time the salinity reached 8.2 grams per thousand at Nàng Âm Gate and 6.6 per thousand at Vũng Liêm Gate in December.\nFarmers and authorities were implementing several measures to protect rice and crops, said Ngô Minh Tấn, deputy chairman of Thanh Bình Commune of Vũng Liêm District.\n“The saline water intrusion was serious, but the farmers had effective measures such as building up anti-saline sluices, so their production had not yet been affected so far,” said Tấn.\nThe provincial authority has recommended farmers reserve freshwater from lakes and ponds for daily life and crops and to use it sparingly.\nThe province is also pushing progress of 83 irrigation works to cope with drought and saltwater intrusion.\nThe agriculture department is also asked to closely monitor the salinity at rivers’ mouths to provide timely updates to local farmers. — VNS'	society

790	'Northern midlands and mountains set development direction'	"Delegates attend a\xa0conference discussing social, economic development and national defence and security in the northern midland and mountainous region, held in the northern province of Thái Nguyên on Saturday. — VNA/VNS Photo Quân Trang\nTHÁI NGUYÊN — Transport infrastructure is vital, while agriculture, processing industry and tourism are foundations for social and economic development in northern midland and mountainous regions, Secretary of the Party Central Committee (PCC) Nguyễn Văn Bình has said.\nBình, who is also head of the PCC Economic Commission, made the statement at a conference discussing social, economic development and national defence and security in the northern midland and mountainous region to 2030, held in the northern province of Thái Nguyên on Saturday.\nBesides the mentioned breakthroughs and foundations, Bình emphasised protecting ecological security and national defence as keys for development, towards the formation of a regional economic space.\nHe urged the region to take advantage of its internal resources with central Government investment as an important source in leading and opening local resources.\nHe also stressed rational, efficient and sustainable exploitation of resources, to harmonise economic development with ensuring ecological security and national defence and security, between exploiting natural resources and preserving landscapes for tourism development, between improving the quality of labour, stabilising the population and free migration, between the development of border trade and the enhancement of national defence and security.\nAccording to the report of the PCC Economic Commission, after 15 years of implementing Resolution 37-NQ/TW on the direction for social and economic development and national security in the northern midland and mountainous areas by 2020 of the Politburo, the region have witnessed great achievements.\nNotably, the average growth rate of the whole region in the period of 2004-18 reached 10 per cent, gross regional domestic product (GRDP) per capita in 2018 reached VNĐ44.86 million (US$1,900) per head, nearly 12.9 times higher than in 2004.\nThe economic structure shifted positively towards modernity and has promoted the region's internal resources, strongly attracting investment in the region.\nAccording to the report, the security and political situation are stable. People's lives have been improved.\nThe region has achieved and exceeded nine out of 12 targets set in Resolution 37-NQ/TW. One target is likely to be achieved by 2020. There are still two uncompleted targets.\nHowever, Bình noted that the region remained the poorest region of the country.\n“The economic scale of the region is still small, while its potential and advantages have not been fully exploited or improperly operated,” Bình said, adding unsustainable economic growth and low economic restructuring of most localities are problems facing the region.\n“The regional economic structure has not yet met the region’s characteristics,” he said.\nAttending the seminar were representatives of leaders of ministries, central agencies, leaders of provinces and departments of 16 provinces in the northern midland and mountainous region and many experts, scientists and managers.\nThey focused on discussing and contributing ideas to the key points for sustainable development of the region to 2030, including institutional linkages, co-ordination of socio-economic development and ensuring regional defence and security.\nThey also discussed poverty reduction in the region, breakthroughs in the new context to develop tourism, developing border-gate economy in association with tourism and hi-tech agriculture, mechanisms and policies to mobilise and allocate resources for social and economic development and ensure national defence and security, agreements on border trade between Việt Nam and neighbouring countries to develop the border-gate economy. — VNS"	society
791	'Libraries look to the future'	'Vũ Dương Thúy Ngà\nVũ Dương Thúy Ngà, director general of the Library Department, under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, talks to Hà Nội Mới (New Hà Nội) newspaper about the legal obligation for libraries to share resources\nAre there any differences in the services offered between different types of libraries?\nThe rapid application of technology has helped more people access public information. Such a change has required libraries\xa0to adapt to the changed behaviours of library\xa0users. The traditional name “library” has been called by new names, like “electronic library”, "digital library”, “virtual library” and “online library”. Each library name reflects the service change offered by that library.\nFor example a digital library\xa0means all information is digitised and is accessible through computers only, whereas information is accessible through various\xa0electronic devices at an electronic\xa0library (e-library).\nDespite the rapid development of modern technology, the traditional libraries\xa0still have a role to play.\nWhat is the current status of electronic libraries\xa0in Việt Nam?\nElectronic libraries\xa0first came into being in the early 1990s, particularly in major cities and in\xa0big university libraries. These universities received large sums of investment. By now most major public libraries and university libraries have been digitised with advanced library software.\nWhat\xa0about the development of libraries in schools?\nNo doubt, it is an imperative need to have libraries in all schools ranging from primary to secondary schools. Libraries offer both teachers and students more chances to broaden their knowledge. Some primary and secondary schools have already applied high tech in their libraries to help students get the information they need.\nWhat are the challenges the library sector in Việt Nam faces in developing an e-library system?\nOur library technical infrastructure remains very modest while electronic materials are still poor and not many people have shown their interest in using the e-libraries either.\nThe most challenging issue is that our current Law on Intellectual Property Rights does not have any specific rules governing the library field.\nWhat about the application of the Copyright Law for e-libraries?\nMany breaches\xa0of the Copyright Law have been reported. In my opinion, the best way to deter such acts is to step up\xa0mass communication on intellectual property rights, copyright\xa0and other rights. We also need to give much stronger fines on any acts of violation. Parallel with that, all libraries, including e-libraries, have to strictly follow the Law on Intellectual Property Rights and the Library Law which was adopted by the National Assembly in early 2019.\nCan you talk about the plan to link\xa0all libraries nationwide which was approved by the National Assembly in early 2019?\nLinking libraries nationwide has been going on in Việt Nam for quite a few years. For example, libraries at the Hồ Chí Minh City National University and other universities have joined\xa0to help their readers look for the books they want or to facilitate loans of books between the libraries.\nMeanwhile, the Hà Nội National University has collaborated with some 28 universities nationwide to form a library network to help students share\xa0books on science and technology.\nFurthermore, a Việt Nam Library Alliance has been created to serve as a catalyst for book sharing among all Vietnamese universities.\nUnder the Library Law, which was approved on November 21,\xa0all libraries – be they private or public, have to abide by that law. Major libraries have to share their resources with small libraries._VNS\n.'	society

He was then arrested for further investigation.\nSome 13kg of synthetic drugs was confiscated by the Ministry of Public Security’s Department of Anti-smuggling investigation and HCM City Police in September also at the border gate.\nThe drugs were hidden inside the engine block of a coach from Phnom Penh en route to HCM City.\nHeroin, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are taken from Cambodia and hidden among imported cargo and tourists luggage through local border gates of Mộc Bài and Xa Mát to HCM City and other southern provinces.\nTraffickers try all means to disable scanners and service dogs, including dividing the shipment into smaller loads and wrapping the drugs in thick layers of tape and hiring tourists to deliver them.\nTo track down international drug trafficking rings, Tây Ninh Province has launched several investigations into seizures and signed agreements with three Cambodia’s localities of Svay Rieng, Tbong Khmum and Prey Veng to tighten monitoring along the border between the two countries.\nIn 2017, Tây Ninh Province’s law enforcement forces collaborated with Cambodia’s Bavet City Police to confiscate a record haul of nearly 63,500 drug tablets weighing 17kg,\xa0Hải Quan\xa0(Customs) newspaper reported.\nFrom 2016 to September 2019, provincial authorities started legal proceedings in 40 drug-trafficking cases involving 58 traffickers and more than 103kg of synthetic drugs.\nA border liaison office has also been established between the two countries to exchange information on drug rings, suspects and tactics criminals use to deliver drugs from Cambodia to Việt Nam. Tây Ninh Province Police tackled two drug trafficking cases thanks to information collected by the office.\nThe end of 2019 and the coming\xa0Tết\xa0(Vietnamese Lunar New Year) are expected to witness more drug and fireworks smuggling cases through border gates in Tây Ninh.\nThe provincial Committee for Combating Smuggling, Commercial Fraud and Counterfeit Goods said they had organised campaigns to push back crime along the Cambodia – Việt Nam border.\nAn annual report issued by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) in March 2019 reported the record seizure of ATS and new psychoactive substances of 116 tonnes in East Asia and Southeast Asia in 2018.\nDrug markets in ASEAN countries are switching from heroin to ATS, according to UNDOC’s Global SMART Programme. Việt Nam, in particular, has recognised the rise of meth originating from the Golden Triangle being trafficked from neighbouring countries Cambodia, Laos and China.\nThe National Committee on AIDS, Drugs and Prostitute Control of Việt Nam was established in 2000 to prevent, combat and control drugs by 2030, with community-based approaches playing an essential role to prevent drugs from being smuggled across the country’s border. — VNS'	society

VNA/VNS Photo Dương Ngọc\nHÀ NỘI — Despite the number of people covered by health insurance rising in Việt Nam, the abuse of health services and the health insurance fund is still a challenge for the country.\nLê Văn Khảm, director of the Department of Health Insurance under the Ministry of Health (MoH), made the statement at a conference on Thursday in Hà Nội to review five years of the Social Health Insurance Law and make recommendations for the revised law.\nMore than 83.5 million people across Việt Nam were covered by health insurance by the end of last year, representing 88.5 per cent of the population, Khảm said.\nThe number of health insurance holders has exceeded the goal set by Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc of reaching 80 per cent of the population joining social insurance by the end of 2020.\nHowever, he pointed out several common health service abuses, including the prescription of unnecessary high-tech tests and health centres asking patients to pay for medicine covered by health insurance.\nSome facilities provide medical technical services to patients not in accordance with professional procedures issued by the Ministry of Health or practitioners did not have necessary certificates.\nSome patients were hospitalised when it was not necessary or had their treatment at the hospital prolonged, he said.\nAddressing the conference, Nguyễn Trường Sơn, Deputy Minister of Health said health insurance was an important social policy of the Party and the State, a financial mechanism in the healthcare sector for the sake of equity, efficiency and protection of people’s health.\nThe quality of health check-ups and treatment with health insurance had improved, he said.\nPeople have access to modern technical service and new and effective types of drugs which helped them overcome sickness and fatal disease.\nThe health insurance fund has become a basic financial source for the operation of hospitals and health facilities, Sơn said, adding that the health insurance policy had ensured risk sharing among health insurance participants.\nSơn said that there were still shortcomings with the Social Health Insurance Law.\nHe cited unspecific guidance documents and inconsistencies between the law and other legal documents related to health insurance. The low competence of health facilities and their staff was also a problem.\nTherefore, he said, it was essential to revise the law.\nOne of contents of the draft Health Insurance Law amended by the MoH was the establishment of an independent health insurance assessment agency, separate from the current Vietnam Social Security.\nThe ministry also suggested setting up a National Advisory Council whose operation would be decided by the Government.\nAccording to Khảm, the organisation of an independent agency would help ensure the transparency and objectiveness of the assessment while the National Advisory Council would ensure the Social Health Insurance Law was carried out in a consistent manner. — VNS'	society

But the country’s largest shrimp producer has rapidly developed various kinds of farming models for the crustacean such as intensive farming, super - intensive farming, advanced extensive farming, shrimp – rice farming, and shrimp – forest farming.\nUnder the shrimp – forest farming model, for instance, farmers use 40 per cent of a mangrove forest area for raising shrimp and 60 per cent for planting trees.\nLê Minh Tỵ, a farmer in Ngọc Hiển District’s Rạch Gốc Town, said under this model he only had to buy shrimp fry and not even food for the animals as they eat the natural food available in the mangrove forest.\nThe shrimp living in mangrove forests are healthy and have few diseases, according to Tỵ.\nThe creatures bred under this and the shrimp – rice farming model are considered organic shrimp.\nVũ Thành Chung of Ngọc Hiển District said he raised 5ha of organic shrimp and sold his entire output to the Minh Phú Seafood Corporation and earned VNĐ200 million (US$8,600) a year.\nThe corporation has signed deals with nearly 100 farmers in Ngọc Hiển to breed organic shrimp on a total area of 500ha.\nIt buys the crustaceans from the farmers at 10 – 15 per cent higher than market prices.\nLý Hoàng Tiến, chairman of the Ngọc Hiển People’s Committee, said: “Organic breeding of shrimp in mangrove forests reduces pollution, helps adapt to climate change and ensure a steady output.”\nThe province has 17,000ha under shrimp – forest farming model, including 1,200ha that meet Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) quality standards.\nAccording to Trần Văn Thức, deputy director of the department, the province expects to increase the area to 19,000ha next year.\nIt has more than 70,000ha of mangrove forests.\nIt also has 9,600ha of acacia and 9,400ha of cajuput for producing timber.\nWith the use of advanced farming techniques to create seedlings and intensive farming to grow cajuput forests, farmers have reduced the period required to harvest the wood from 15 – 20 years earlier to six-eight years now.\nThe quality of forest wood also increased two- or three-fold, the department said.\nNguyễn Văn Thư, deputy head of the province’s Forest Protection Sub-department, said there were 19,000ha of quality forests by the end of last year.\nThey generate 150 – 250cu.m of wood per hectare four to five years after planting and farmers can earn VNĐ130 - 200 million ($5,600 – 8,600) per hectare, according to the official.\nMore than 1,000ha of forests have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.\nLinkage\nMany farmers in the province have tied up among themselves and with processors of key products, helping improve their incomes and provide quality products to the latter.\nTwenty-two shrimp processors have contracts with 15 shrimp co-operatives and co-operative groups.\nThe contracts are also for developing shrimp farming areas meeting international standards.\nNguyễn Văn Lâm, chairman of the Cái Bát Co-operative in Cái Nước District, said its 350ha organic shrimp – rice area had received ASC certification.\nThe certification was possible due to the linkages among farmers in the co-operative and with processors, he said, adding that they helped improve the yield and quality of the shrimp and reduce diseases.\nThe province had 14,000ha of organic shrimp – rice farms as of October, according to the department.\nChâu Công Bằng, deputy director of the department, said the province had not fully exploited its agricultural potential and had a number of limitations.\nThey included tardy zoning plans, lack of infrastructure and the low use of advanced farming techniques.\nBut the province was trying to popularise the use of hi-tech farming and seeking to protect the environment.\nIt offered incentives to companies investing in concentrated farming areas.\nIt had also created linkages between farmers and processors to guarantee outlets for the former and improve quality.\nThe department has earmarked hi-tech agriculture zones in Năm Căn, Ngọc Hiển, Đầm Dơi, and U Minh districts.

This allows the 31 Thanh Lương – Bình Long longan growers and 32 poultry farmers in the commune to use these collective ownership certificates to sell their produce.\nAccording to the province Department of Science and Technology, these collective ownership certificates indicate the brand names and value of the province’s farm produce.\nThey also encourage farmers to invest in technology.\nAuthorities in Tây Ninh and Bình Phước provinces have joined hands to create areas specialising in high-value crops to build brand names for major produce, enhance trade promotion and encourage farmers and firms to advertise their products at trade fairs and exhibitions to expand their markets.\nIn Tây Ninh Province, Lavifood JSC has contracted to buy the entire output of 224ha of orchards.

For each cycle, people can gain more than VNĐ100 million (US$4,300) per hectare, which helps raise living standards,” Quế told Nông thôn Ngày nay (Countryside Today) newspaper.\nNguyễn Văn Thắng was handed two hectares of land by\xa0the commune six years ago, and started planting a\xa0small forest of acacia.\n“I harvest after six to seven years. Minus all the costs, I can earn roughly VNĐ200 million from this plot,” he said.\nSeeing the promise the industry had, Thắng decided to spend more money on his acacia plantations.\nTimber was now\xa0one of the leading industries in Phú Thọ Province with 130,000ha of manmade forests and\xa050,000 ha of natural forests, said ranger chief Phùng Văn Vinh.\nPhú Thọ had\xa0more than 2,700 timber process facilities and is in a constant thirst for materials, Vinh said.\n“This had led people to harvest trees after just five-to-six years old. Few growers were\xa0willing to wait seven or eight years as\xa0the market demand was high while they were short of capital,” he said.\nEarly harvests\xa0meant tremendous losses because trees aged 10 years and older could fetch three or four times more, the ranger said.\nVinh said the province was trying to encourage residents to hold off before they harvested their trees, and has offered a\xa0grant of VNĐ7 million per ha and once the plantations reach 10 years old.\n“Apart from efforts to promote mature forests, we are also trying to increase productivity to 15 cubic metres per ha per year, which will greatly contribute to the timber production industry while raising people’s living standards.” — VNS'	society

For treatment, he chose\xa0the HCM City Traditional Medicine Institute\xa0where doctors recommended that he receive\xa0auricular acupuncture to stop his cravings for cigarettes.\nThe treatment consisted of four one-millimetre and\xa01.5- millimetre needles inserted into\xa0four acupuncture points on the external ear surface for a period of three to four days.\n“After three treatments on the same points, my cravings stopped\xa0even when I was in front of smokers,” the man, who declined to reveal his name,\xa0said.\nHe\xa0continued treatment to ensure that he would no longer smoke.\nAnother patient, a\xa023-year-old man\xa0from\xa0Tân Bình District, who did not want to reveal his name,\xa0received the same acupuncture treatment,\xa0which stopped his cravings.\n“I smoked for two years. Whenever I felt sleepy, I would\xa0smoke\xa0to stay\xa0awake. And at\xa0work, many people around me did not like the\xa0smoking smell. So I was determined to give it up,” he\xa0said.\nDr Trần Minh Quang, deputy head of the institute’s general planning division, said that acupuncture needles stimulate the central nervous system which helps\xa0to diminish cravings.\nThe inserted needles are kept in one ear for three or four days\xa0after which the patient\xa0returns to the hospital where doctors remove the needles and then perform the same procedure on\xa0the other ear.\n“Whenever addicts feel cravings, they are told to press acupuncture points\xa0on the external ear surface,” Quang said.\nAt the institute, patients are told to\xa0meet doctors to receive\xa0counseling to ensure that they follow the procedures.\nThis year, the institute conducted research from April to June on the effectiveness of using auricular acupuncture on 35 smokers. Of the group, nearly 60-65 per cent of them were able to give up smoking.\nIn 2016, Nguyễn Thị Tân, dean of the faculty of traditional medicine at Huế University of Medicine and Pharmacy, conducted research on 300 smokers\xa0with Kyung Hee University in South Korea and Quảng Nam Province's Department of Health on auricular acupuncture.\nThe result showed that 66 per cent quit\xa0smoking after five sessions of auricular acupuncture. The research was sponsored by the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare.\nLast month, at a conference on treatment of smoking addiction with a combination of traditional and\xa0modern medicine, Trương Thị Ngọc Lan, the institute’s deputy head, said that auricular acupuncture helped\xa0to reduce craving rapidly.\nThe therapy should be used with other kinds of\xa0traditional treatments because smoking can lead to other\xa0health disorders.\n“Giving up smoking is not difficult, but how to prevent re-addiction is very important,” Lan said.\nNeedles are inserted into four acupuncture points on a patient's\xa0ear\xa0to treat a smoking addition. — VNS Photo Gia Lộc\nSmoking addiction is a serious public health issue in Việt Nam, and the demand for treatment\xa0is\xa0high.\nAt least 70 per cent of smokers want to give up smoking and two-thirds of people who resumed smoking again\xa0wanted to treat it, according to the\xa0institute.\nDr Trần Thái Hà, head of general planning division at the National Hospital of Traditional Medicine, said that counselling for treatment of smoking addiction with and without medicines\xa0doubles the success rate for smoking cessation.\nAccording to the US\xa0Center\xa0for Disease Control and Prevention, 20 minutes after quitting, the\xa0heart rate drops to normal. Twelve hours after quitting, the carbon monoxide level in the blood drops to normal. And\xa0one\xa0year after quitting, the added risk of coronary heart disease is half that of a smoker’s.\nQuang said that the cost of auricular acupuncture is low and therefore accessible to many people. The treatment causes no side effects and can be used repeatedly.\nAt a previous conference, the institute provided training\xa0in the treatment to doctors\xa0in the city and other provinces in southern and Central Highlands regions.\nAccording to a Global Adult Tobacco Survey\xa0conducted in 2015 by the Ministry of Health\xa0in collaboration with the Hanoi Medical University\xa0and General Statistics Office of Việt Nam\xa0), more than 45\xa0per cent of men, 1.1\xa0per cent of women, and 22.5 per cent overall (15.6\xa0million adults) smoked tobacco in Việt Nam.\nThe survey found that 29\xa0per cent of those who had ever smoked (6.4 million adults) had\xa0quit smoking, while\xa05.2 per cent of smokers (0.8 million adults) said they planned to quit within the next month. — VNS"	society

821	'Vietnamese lecturers want to be paid better'	"A class at Thái Nguyên University. Besides pay increase, recognition and favourable environment to develop are important motivations to lecturers. — VNA/VNS Photo Quân Trang\nHÀ NỘI — Up to 55 per cent of lecturers of the National Academy of Public Administration – Central Highlands Campus are eager to change jobs as they expect a pay increase if they do so.\nPhạm Thị Hằng, an academy lecturer, said a survey of 40 workers revealed only two of them felt “contented” with their current jobs.\nOther higher education institutes in Việt Nam report the same situation. Low wages and poor management pose threats of a brain drain and cannot create motivation for lecturers to contribute.\n“Twenty-two surveyed workers expect to have their income increased to push themselves to work harder,” Hằng told Thanh Niên (Young people) newspaper.\nĐỗ Hoàng Ánh, a lecturer of Hà Nội University of Social Sciences and Humanity, said despite colleges’ efforts to increase salaries, pay was still within the framework of wage policy, leaving lecturers unable to secure comfortable lives,\xa0especially\xa0in big cities.\nCurrent salary ranges also do not reflect the lecturers' contribution and productivity of different positions.\nThe current salary of a public university director is under VNĐ20 million (US$863) per month. A doctoral lecturer can only earn from VNĐ65,000 to VNĐ120,000 ($2.81-5.18) for each session. After a decade of teaching, their monthly salary will be about VNĐ4.5 million ($194).\nHowever, Ánh said low wages are just a small part of a bigger picture. What lecturers really need, according to him, is a fair working environment which can address income needs including salary, allowance, subsidy and welfare, ensure adequate living standards, facilities, respect, safety and opportunities to contribute and be recognised as well as protection mechanisms.\nViệt Nam’s higher education institutes, however, face three major challenges. First is the imbalance in wage policy and income that lecturers\xa0receive. Second is the lack of recognition for contribution of teachers, while the third is the struggle for autonomy.\nPhan Thị Hời from Lạc Hồng University said a study of 225 lecturers and workers of private universities in Đồng Nai Province and HCM City showed a good working environment featured\xa0a comfortable vibe, helped them stay focused and offered facilities for\xa0research.\nAccording to Hời, a sense of belonging is essential to nurturing ties\xa0between lecturers and universities, while they need\xa0favourable conditions to pursue their chosen research career.\nNguyễn Thanh Hà from Banking University of HCM City said the average salary of the school staff in 2018 was VNĐ15 million ($647).\nTo encourage lecturers to do research, they grant VNĐ35 million ($1,511) for each excellent study and VNĐ20 million ($863) for each reference document. Nearly 70 per cent of surveyed lecturers said they were satisfied with their salary. However, some of them are reported to still be discontented with their additional income, saying the\xa0money was not justly distributed.\nNguyễn Thành Độ from the National University of Economics said goals set by lecturers depended on their titles, academic ranks or fields of study.\nAwards or pay increases may be important, yet recognition from colleagues, respect from students and opportunities to learn and contribute must be what lecturers prefer, he said. — VNS"	society

If they can’t, it isn’t of dire necessity anyway,” Thành said.\nHe explained that the new textbooks thoroughly changed the approach methods and the teachers would be able to quickly realise the key messages of the books to deliver to their students regardless of whether they ran trial classes or not.\nThành also said teachers didn’t have to read the whole 32 books but only their structures to determine which books would best fit their schools and students.\n“For example, each teaching session for the first-graders will have pictures and writings. Based on them, the teachers will visualise each textbook’s way of thinking and its problem-solution approach and decide which to select,” he added. — VNS'	society

Two hours after treatment, the rapid heartbeat was under control and the patient recovered.\nThe patient weighed less than any other previous patients treated with this method by doctors in the southern and central region.\nSince June, when it began performing this technique, the hospital has performed radiofrequency catheter ablation on 40 older patients.\nIn the northern region, Việt Nam National Children’s Hospital has performed radiofrequency catheter ablation on infants as well.\nThe technique should be performed only when medication fails, because complications can occur after treatment, according to Phúc.\nAn said that health insurance covers the treatment.\nThe prevalence of children with congenital heart disease in the country is 1/100 and with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome 1/1,000, according to Dr Nguyễn Trí Hào, acting head of the heart department at Children’s Hospital 1.\nAccording to Phúc, heartbeat disorders are often complications from heart surgery on children with congenital heart diseases. — VNS"	society

833	'In Thái Nguyên, communities help to ease HIV/AIDS burden'	"Khoa Thư\nHoàng shows a client how to use oral stab test for HIV. —\xa0VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nTHÁI NGUYÊN — Đàm Huy Hoàng’s heart skipped a beat as the second pink line started appearing on his client’s HIV test strip.\nGrabbing a jacket, he took the young man to Thái Nguyên's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention for a confirmatory test.\nThe accuracy of screening tests using finger prick blood samples is up to 97 per cent, and it had Hoàng worried.\nIn his early 30s, Hoàng leads a double life – a cashier for a local water treatment plant by day, and an HIV tester in his free time whenever there is a need.\nFour years ago, Hoàng and his friends established Family – a self-help group working to promote the rights of the LGBT community.\nTheir initiative quickly caught the eye of the provincial centre for HIV/AIDS prevention. A partnership was created in 2016 that made Family responsible for administering community-based HIV testing for high-risk groups, including men having sex with men (MSM), finding cases of infection and persuading them to have antiretroviral (ARV) treatment with the support of Thái Nguyên CDC and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nSince then, the group of 20 members has provided free HIV screening tests for 700 people and accompanied 200 HIV-infected people on their ARV treatment journeys.\nMost of them are students and workers, aged from 18 to 25.\n“It is not simple to convince MSM to take HIV tests as they have to face enormous social stigma and always tend to hide their own identity,” Hoàng said.\n“Over the past four years, we have approached a thousand MSM. In conversations, we avoid mentioning sexual orientations and HIV, instead, we introduce our services of providing free condoms and lubricants. The process has to be repeated over and over again to build trust until they are comfortable enough to expose themselves and are ready to take tests,” he added.\nSo far, this year, the group has uncovered 37 cases of new HIV infections. All of them were sent to Thái Nguyên CDC for treatment.\n“We face huge challenges dealing with clients’ emotions while waiting for their test results,” said Hoàng. “Administering a test is easy, you only need to follow certain steps but no one has ever told us how to psychologically support people while they are waiting for the results.”\nOne of Family’s earliest clients committed suicide. The tragic incident has haunted Hoàng for years.\n“It used to take a week for test results to come back. It was hell for our clients. Sucidal thoughts came up at night when they were all alone. We had to follow them, and talk to them about self-harming,” he said.\n“Now, test results are ready within a day, and we tell them being HIV-positive is not a death sentence as long as they follow ARV treatment. That is really a relief.”\nThere is a bookshelf filled with dozens of Japanese\xa0manga\xa0comics in Hoàng’s tiny bedsit, which also serves as a meeting place and test centre.\n“Clients can read a couple pages of the comics while waiting for their test results. It stops them from thinking too much, even for 20 minutes,” he said.\n\n\nFamily’s bookshelf is filled with comics and brochures for clients to read while waiting for their results. —\xa0VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nPaying back\nLê Thanh Hậu used to be a drug user before witnessing his family break into pieces.\nReturning from a local drug rehab centre in 2016, he started revamping his life by becoming a volunteer at Thái Nguyên Province Outpatient Clinic, supporting ARV patients and searching for new cases of HIV infections.\n“It was strange how health workers at Thái Nguyên CDC treated me dearly like a family member,” Hậu said. “Their kindness motivated me to do something good in order to pay back for the sinful past I left behind.”\nAlong with four friends, Hậu wanders into countless alleys in Thái Nguyên City and nearby localities in search of drug users to convince them to take HIV tests.\n“There used to be some infamous spots where hundreds of needles used to hang out of banana trees,” Hậu said.\n“The situation has changed a lot now. Drug users are getting younger. They prefer amphetamine-type stimulants like ecstasy which make them lose control and become more vulnerable to HIV due to unsafe sex,” he added.\nSome of Hậu’s friends, who were unable to quit the habit, show him where addicts gather.\n“People say I will fall back into my old ways if I keep on visiting drug dens. But no way, I have paid enough,” said Hậu.\nThis year, Hậu’s group has found 18 cases of HIV infections and helped 120 patients to undergo ARV treatment.\n“I receive a monthly allowance of only VNĐ300,000 (US$13) but I never want to quit this job.”\nMore than anyone, Hậu understands the discrimination HIV-infected people have to tolerate.\n“Compared with removing a scar from my arm, fighting against stigma is so difficult. People with HIV need social acceptance and tolerance to step out of their dark zones and undergo treatment. The mission would be impossible without the community’s participation,” he said.\nCommunities make the difference\n“They are our trusted partners,” said CDC Thái Nguyên Deputy Director Lê Ái Kim Anh about Hoàng and Hậu.\nThái Nguyên Province is ranked fourth nationwide in terms of the number of people suffering from HIV, following Hà Nội, HCM City and Hải Phòng, and sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise.\nWith nine colleges and two industrial zones, the province has a high population, making it hard to estimate the number of HIV-positive cases.\nThanks to restless efforts of community groups, more than 79 per cent of people living with HIV know their status, nearly 73 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV receive sustained ARV therapy, and over 95 per cent of them have viral suppression treatment.\n“Communities make the difference in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” said Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control.\n“However, the withdrawal of foreign resources has posed several challenges to these groups as they do not have legal status or financing. We are working with them to overcome these difficulties,” he added.\nTo Hoàng, funding cuts do not bother him much.\n“We estimate there are 5,000 HIV-infected people who have no idea about their status. Our journey has not come to an end yet,” he said.\nAnd to Hậu, “being an event planner helps to sustain my social service. Why stop when I still feel content doing this job?” — VNS\nLê Thanh Hậu plays guitar at home where also serves as his group’s meeting place. — VNS Photo Khoa Thư"	society

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Hà Nội plans to build ten more pedestrian bridges in crowded streets in the inner city in an attempt to reduce traffic congestion and ensure safety.\nSeven steel structure frame pedestrian bridges will be built along the routes of Nguyễn Trãi in Thanh Xuân District, Láng in Đống Đa District and Nguyễn Văn Cừ in Long Biên District. Traffic is held up with long tailbacks in these streets, especially during rush hours.\nThe remaining three pedestrian bridges will be built across Tô Lịch River.\nThe city’s People’s Committee has approved projects to build four pedestrian bridges. Of that, one is at the T-junction of Triều Khúc Road in Thanh Xuân District and three in Nguyễn Văn Cừ Street in Long Biên District.\nThe four bridges will be assembled with a steel structure with surface drainage system. The construction is scheduled to finish next year.\nIn reply to the municipal Department of Planning and Investment’s requirement on evaluating the construction of three pedestrian bridges across Tô Lịch River and three bridges along Láng Street, the Department of Transport said the construction was necessary and urgent.\nThere is a high density of agencies, schools and vehicles in Láng Street. The demand of moving across Láng Road to the sidewalk section of Tô Lịch River as well as the need for walking across the river has been increased.\nThree bridges include Tô Lịch 1 Bridge, which locates between the Cót and 361 bridges, Tô Lịch 2 Bridge locating between 361 and Trung Hoà bridges, and Tô Lịch 3 Bridge locating between Trung Hoà and Hoà Mục bridges. Each bridge has an estimated length of 40 metres.\nThe pedestrian bridges along Láng Road includes Bridge No1 locating near 1174 Láng Road with a length of 43m, Bridge No2 near 778 Láng Road with a length 33m, and Bridge No3 near Láng Hạ Market with a length of 41m.\nAccording to the department Láng Road connects three big districts including Thanh Xuân, Đống Đa and Cầu Giấy, and plays an important route in connecting the Nội Bài International Airport.\nIt has a high density of vehicles, posing risks for pedestrians as the bus stops are far from existing bridges.\nThe construction of the bridges is urgent to ensure safety and convenience for pedestrians.

835	'Việt Nam needs little more time to achieve 90-90-90'	'Eamonn Murphy (middle) meets with patients receiving\xa0methadone treatment at a health clinic\xa0in Tân Yên District, Bắc Giang Province.\xa0— VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nViệt Nam News reporter Khoa Thư talks to Eamonn Murphy, Regional Director of UNAIDS, Asia and the Pacific, about the opportunities and challenges facing the elimination of HIV as a public health threat by 2030\nOver the past decade, Việt Nam has witnessed a decline in the number of new HIV cases and AIDS-related deaths. 2020 is the deadline set for the ambitious goal of 90-90-90 by the UN. How do you assess the country’s performance in the fight against HIV/AIDS and its chances to achieve the goal?\n90-90-90 is a set of treatment-focused targets to move the agenda faster, saying 90 per cent of those living with HIV know their status, 90 per cent are receiving treatment and 90 per cent on treatment have viral suppression which stops forward transmission.\nYes, these are ambitious targets. But if we don’t set ambitious targets we are not pushing the agenda.\nWith a communicable disease like HIV, we need ambitious targets to get community control.\nViệt Nam has set these targets and is doing very well in terms of working toward these targets. Viral suppression is very high, you may achieve the target there.\nViệt Nam is also innovative in testing; self-testing for example.\nIf you are afraid to go to health services, to a doctor or healthcare worker, even sometimes to an NGO, having a test at home means you know your status and if you’ve got HIV then you know you can access treatment.\nSocial health insurance is another innovation to make treatment available locally and with subsidised costs so more people can get it.\nThe viral suppression and the message about U=U (Undetectable=Untransmittable) are to encourage people why they should access it early.\nViệt Nam has set in place the right, sustainable programme to achieve these ambitious targets.\nIt just needs a little more time than 2020.\nViệt Nam wants to put an end to the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Based on your evaluation, what are the challenges facing Việt Nam?\nViệt Nam recognises that the epidemic is changing. In response, the country is innovating and changing its programmes including bringing in PrEP(pre-exposure prophylaxis).\nThailand was the first country in the region to use PrEP. Việt Nam is overtaking Thailand because it recognises the importance of the new tool of prevention as we don’t want people to be on HIV treatment for life.\nThe social dynamic of young people has also been well recognised. A community participation organisation (CPO) in HCM City, for example, found up to 77 per cent of approached young MSM (men having sex with men) have never accessed testing or services.\nWith the support of the Government, they can improve the programme to reach people.\nIt is also critical to have political leadership and services to continue to innovate across the board and to maintain that leadership and service innovations.\nViệt Nam’s achievements have been built on a sustainable base. There are some countries with better outcomes but it’s all thanks to foreign donors. That’s why I think Việt Nam can achieve the end of HIV as a public health threat by 2030.\nA patient gets ARV HIV drugs. — VNA/VNS Photo\nSince March 2019, HIV sufferers in Việt Nam have been switching to ARVs covered by social healthcare insurance, making Việt Nam one of a few countries in the world that allocates social insurance funds to pay for HIV/AIDS treatment. What do you think about the change in terms of efficiency and sustainability?\nThe move has made HIV treatment and hopefully later some of the prevention available through the public system through insurance.\nBecause your economy is thriving, foreign funding is now moving to more disadvantaged countries.\nThe government needs to both encourage and support people to continue treatment.\nIt is also important to set the goal of having a separate HIV programme in the general health system that fights against stigma and discrimination, as healthcare workers need to understand the issue to make sure clients are comfortable to come and stay in the services.\nOtherwise, we’re going to push people underground and the epidemic will rebound.\nIt has been not even a year since the change and the Government reviews how it is operating every month. We should be aware of the need to continually refine and change the nature of the programme to best serve clients and push back HIV.\nThe World AIDS report 2019 released on November 26 stressed upon the role of communities in prevention and control of HIV/AIDS. What are your recommendations for Việt Nam’s society to accelerate their involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS?\nViệt Nam needs to further strengthen its partnership with communities via social contract which is not just for HIV but many other health issues.\nThe Government should start funding CPOs working in this field which support HIV-infected people who need lifetime treatment and accelerate HIV/AIDS prevention.\nSuccessful countries have shown many experiences in building partnerships with communities, non-profit and private sectors in helping deliver services because it cannot be done solely by the Government’s health system. — VNS'	society

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — One in every three ethnic minority children suffers from stunted growth, while one in five is underweight, according to the findings of a new report.\nThe study, released by the World Bank (WB) and Việt Nam’s National Institute of Nutrition, is the latest comprehensive research on persistent malnutrition in the ethnic minorities.\nEthnic minorities account for 73 per cent of the poor in the Southeast Asian country.\nAccording to the report, the rate of malnutrition in Vietnamese children remarkably decreased over the last two decades, from 36.5 per cent diagnosed with stunted growth in 2000 to 24.6 per cent in 2015.\nThe disparities between children of ethnic minorities and those of Kinh people who have the largest population in Việt Nam, however, grew larger over time.\nThere was approximately 31 per cent of minority children stunted in 2015, more than doubling the rate of Kinh people at 15 per cent and the average national rate at 17.5 per cent.\n“Despite Việt Nam’s impressive progress in reducing the rate of malnutrition over the past two decades, ethnic minorities children still lag behind, and the disparity is widening,” said WB country director for Việt Nam Ousmane Dione.\n“The next phase of efforts on malnutrition should be more targeted, concentrating on the provinces with the highest problems, to create a breakthrough.”\nPoverty was believed to be the root of rampant malnutrition in the ethnic communities, as the report found only 39 per cent of children of two years old and younger received a nutritionally adequate diet.\nUndernourishment in such time span – which is dubbed the first golden 1,000 days in a child’s life – can lead to extensive and largely irreversible damage to physical growth and brain development, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).\nMalnutrition is a worldwide issue which is proved to be the cause of death for 45 per cent of children aged below five and also leaves long-term negative impacts on a person’s productivity and lifelong income.\nThe economic costs of undernourishment are estimated to bring a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) down by between 2 and 10 per cent, according to the WB. — VNS"	society

Four hours later, testers know the results.\nPatients still have to cover full payment of the testing service without knowing that only half of the medical supplies are used.\nAccording to medical experts, this action could lead to false results.\nBy cutting the testing strips in half, the medical workers have one extra piece of strip after testing two patients.\nEach quick HIV test kit which consists of 100 testing strips costs VNĐ3 million (US$130).\nDirector of the city Department of Health Nguyễn Khắc Hiền said the department has ordered Saint Paul Hospital to clarify the number of extra testing strips and where they are supplied to.\nAccording to Trần Thị Nhị Hà, deputy director of the health department, the hospital representatives explained the testing strips cut in half were for trial use purpose only. The trial testing results were not given to patients.\nHowever, the health department has not accepted the explanation and asked for further clarification and strict punishment, she told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper.\nThe health department has also asked the hospital to review their management responsibilities in this case.\nAccording to World Health Organisation, the accuracy of quick HIV tests may be affected by factors including whether technicians follow testing process or not.\nSaint Paul\xa0is one of four major hospitals of the capital city with 600 beds and more than 1,000 medical workers.\nAbout 600,000 patients have their health check up there every year. The number of inpatients reaches 45,000 people per year. — VNS"	society

Some were even found on restricted roads and areas.\nOne of the drivers parking in a restricted road said it is very difficult to find parking space for trucks in the area and he drives his truck away if traffic police officers or other officials arrive.\nBùi Văn Quân, chairman of the HCM City Freight Forwarders Association, said hundreds of forwarders, especially cargo transport companies in District 9, face difficulties since there is no parking space for their trucks. Many of them have to park on roads or lease space in private lots.\n“Transport firms pay large amounts of money for parking and as fines for violations,” he was quoted as saying by Tuổi Trẻ\xa0(Youth) newspaper.\nA number of them have had to suspend their operations due to losses, he added.\nThe association has urged city authorities to use vacant plots of land in districts 9 and 2 as temporary parking lots, pointing out that thousands of trucks would otherwise have no parking space in the two.\nTemporary parking lots\nĐỗ Ngọc Hải, head of city Department of Transport’s road transport management division, said the lack of parking space has affected both passenger and cargo transport.\nIt also has other adverse impacts, such as an increase in the number of accidents, he said.\nHe blamed the situation on the lack of land for construction of parking lots and terminals.\nThe association’s proposal that the city should lease land in districts 2 and 9 and build temporary parking lots was rejected by the department since the proposed areas do not meet the conditions required for building parking lots, he explained.\nThe department would consider other areas in districts 2, 9 and Nhà Bè and complete construction works expeditiously, he added. — VNS'	society

VNA/VNS Photo Hồ Cầu\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam has made good progress in human development, with an average annual Human Development Index (HDI) growth of 1.36 per cent during the 1990-2018 period.\nThis places Việt Nam among the group of countries with the highest HDI growth rates in the world.\nThis is one of the key finding of the 2019 Human Development Report, released on Monday by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) entitled “Beyond income, beyond averages, beyond today: Inequalities in human development in the 21st Century.”\nAddressing the report launch in Hà Nội, UNDP Resident Representative Caitlin Wiesen said the 2019 Human Development Report disclosed the next generation of inequalities emerging around digital technology, education, and the climate crisis and proposes new ways of measuring and approaching inequalities.\nWiesen praised Việt Nam for having firmly embarked on people-centered development and equality in its current socio-economic development strategies and plans.\n“Việt Nam’s significant Human Development progress since 1990 has been achieved with relatively low increases in inequality,” she said.\n“Taking into account the Inequality Adjusted HDI, Việt Nam is eight places higher than its HDI ranking in 2018.”\n“Việt Nam is at a critical juncture as it designs its next Socio-Economic Development Strategy, with decisions made today determining whether the country will continue its current pattern of growth with relatively low inequality or whether new forms of emerging inequalities will be further entrenched and deepened with unsustainable growth pathways.”\nAccording to the report, Việt Nam’s 2018 HDI of 0.693 is above the average of 0.634 for countries in the Medium Human Development group.\nViệt Nam ranks 118th out of 189 countries, and needs only an additional 0.007 points to join the High Human Development group. Việt Nam’s HDI rank in 2018 is higher than India’s, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Cambodia.\nMeanwhile, Việt Nam’s loss of HDI value due to inequality in 2018 is 16.3 per cent, its loss of income due to inequality is 18.1 per cent and, its GINI coefficient – a statistical measure of economic inequality in a population – at 35.3 – are among the lowest in the East Asia and Pacific region.\nViệt Nam has also been performing well in terms of gender equality. The Gender Development Index value of 1.003 puts the country in the top five groups of 166 countries in the world, with Việt Nam ranking 68th out of 162 countries in Gender Inequality Index. Particularly commendable is the share of seats in parliament which places Việt Nam among the top third of countries globally.\nHowever, Caitlin said, there were important areas for improvement. Việt Nam ranks among the bottom third of countries globally in terms of sex ratio at birth (1.12), violence against women by non-intimate partners (34.4 per cent) and women with accounts in financial institutions or with mobile money service provider (30.4 per cent).\nAlthough Việt Nam’s forest coverage as among the top third of countries globally, the country is among the bottom third of countries in terms of carbon emission per capita.\nAddressing these would be a key challenge to ensure the sustainability of Việt Nam’s growth, she said.\nCaitlin suggested that Việt Nam should raise people’s awareness on sex-selection issue.\n“If it is not addressed, they will create lots of destruction for Việt Nam in the future,” she told Việt Nam News.\nNguyễn Tiến Phong, Assistant Resident Representative of UNDP, said regarding to socio-economic sustainability, a lot of jobs generated by small and medium enterprises did not require skills, meaning Việt Nam ranks low in skilled labour force and vulnerable employment.\nVũ Đại Thắng, Vice Minister of Ministry of Planning and Investment said Việt Nam has issued an action plan on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.\nThe Vietnamese Government’s determination was represented by the Nation Assembly's\xa0approval of the master plan on socio-economic development for ethnic minority people with the goal of ensure equality in human development. It was in accordance with the spirit “Don’t leave any one behind” upheld by the government, he said. — VNS"	society

Experts recommend keeping stations in city centres\xa0to serve as interchanges for\xa0public transport. — VNA/VNS Photo Huy Hùng\nHÀ NỘI — While Việt Nam Railway wants to keep its stations in city centres, many localities plan to push them\xa0to outlying areas, pleading\xa0pressure on inner-city traffic infrastructure, Thanh Niên (Young People) newspaper has reported.\nIn 2017, Hà Nội Police put forward a proposal to move the historic Hà Nội Railway Station, which was built in 1902, to the other side of the Hồng (Red) River or Thường Tín District, saying with 10km of railway running through the capital and many level crossings, the station was\xa0putting an enormous burden\xa0on the city’s traffic infrastructure\xa0and posing the threat\xa0of accidents.\nThe railway sector fiercely opposed the plan.\nBefore Hà Nội, the Government had given permission to Đà Nẵng to move its railway station out of the city centre under a\xa0public-private partnership model. The project, however, has been delayed due to funding\xa0difficulties.\nĐà Nẵng recently relaunched the project under the form of a build-transfer\xa0(BT) model with\xa0total investment of VNĐ12 trillion (US$516.5 million).\nThe central provinces of Bình Định and Khánh Hoà have also shown an interest in relocating their main railway stations in\xa0Quy Nhơn and Nha Trang.\nThe Ministry of Transport has approved the Hà Nội-based Tuấn Dung Group to conduct a pre-feasibility study in\xa0Nha Trang in the form of a BT. In return, the corporation will receive an area of land where the current station is located once it moves.\n“Golden locations” where\xa0railway stations are located in big cities are targets of many large private developers. Therefore, relocating stations is not simply a question of easing traffic congestion but also of a conflict of interest among authorities, citizens and enterprises.\nThere are rising concerns about how these areas will be used when stations are relocated. If new apartments or high-rise offices are built, the initial purpose of reducing traffic jams will not be accomplished.\nThe\xa0historic, cultural\xa0and architectural values of stations\xa0also need to be considered before they are relocated.\nTokyo, Paris, Frankfurt and\xa0Beijing all have railway stations in downtown areas, serving huge numbers of passengers each day.\nVũ Anh Minh, director of the Việt Nam Railway Company, said the railway had two preeminent characteristics – safety and convenience in terms of favourable locations. Big cities usually develop overpasses or tunnels to address traffic congestion caused by inner-city railways instead of relocating stations to save expenses.\n“Localities are not interested in railways because they do not generate fast money. However, they must ensure the benefits of citizens, the country and the railway sector in developing projects,” he said.\nTo utilise stations’ “golden locations”, Minh said they planned to upgrade existing facilities for use as offices.\nArchitect Ngô Viết Nam Sơn said central stations such as Hà Nội and\xa0Sài Gòn could\xa0become interchange hubs connecting North-South routes with metro lines. Relocating these stations would mean\xa0missing a chance to\xa0develop\xa0public transport.\n“To reduce congestion, the railway sector could\xa0reduce freight carried to and from central stations and focus on transporting passengers instead,” he said. — VNS'	society

Four smart registration kiosks have been installed to help people quickly carry out registration procedures without requiring the guidance of medical staff.\nBy simply inserting a medical insurance card or a flashcard supplied by the hospital to the infrared eye for identification, all patient information will be recorded.\nAfter patients choose the content of examination, the screen will immediately display the clinic they need to go for check-up and treatment.\nThese kiosks can check the validity of a health insurance card, capture patients' image with the front camera, and work closely with the hospital's overall management software to receive patients’ feedback\xa0on service quality.\nA patient is using smart registration kiosk at Eastern People Military Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo\nThe hospital has also implemented a range of other IT applications such as Room Access Control System, Disabled Robot Arm, and smart medical record cabinets.\nLê Thị Mến, a 72-year-old patient living in District 9’s Long Bình Ward, said she was surprised by the changes in the hospital over the years.\n“I am very interested in the machines that the hospital has been equipped with from the lobby to the toilet. Auto technology products are everywhere to give us instructions,” she said.\nExplaining about the information technology development at the hospital, Colonel Việt said the hospital was the first to be given financial autonomy in the country, so it faced various difficulties.\nOld and degraded facilities as well as a shortage of medical staff has reduced the quality of medical examination and treatment. Therefore, the number of patients coming to seek medical treatment was very few.\n“We were concerned about how to improve the hospital’s quality while maintaining the cost of treatment and the number of staff,” Việt said.\n“There was only one way - application of information technology to solve the problem.”\nThat’s when the Information Technology Centre was founded.\nThe hospital’s Board of Directors had constantly developed creative ideas to improve the medical examination and treatment process based on the actual operational needs of the hospital.\nA series of innovative ideas have been nominated by hospital staff and the centre helped turning them into high technology products.\nColonel Trịnh Ngọc Chí, deputy director of the hospital, said thanks to high-technology products, more people came to the hospital, rising from 700-800 patients in recent years to 1,800 patients at the peak per day.\nThe hospital’s management has also been easier. Chí said the board of directors would know what toilets needed to be cleaned and what areas were overloaded with patients via smart medical monitoring system.\nChí said the hospital would continue promoting the application of information technology in hospital management and operation, especially artificial intelligence to give the best services to patients. — VNS\n3D Printing technology is already being in use at\xa0Eastern People Military Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo"	society

However, the city currently has 40,000 homes for that purpose.\nVũ Văn Phấn, deputy director of the Housing and Real Estate Market Management Agency under the Ministry of Construction, said policies have\xa0failed to\xa0encourage\xa0the private sector to invest in housing developments for workers, making investors less interested in social housing projects.\nBesides, in many cities and provinces, leaders had\xa0not properly followed a\xa0regulation to\xa0reserve\xa020 per cent of the land area\xa0used\xa0for commercial housing to build social housing. This leads to a lack of land when it comes to the demand for social housing projects, Phấn said.\nHe said urgent policies and incentives are needed to encourage enterprises to develop social housing, including cutting red tape for\xa0land clearance and\xa0administrative procedures, and allocating State funds to cover the interest rate for commercial banks to provide loans (with preferential interest rates) for social housing developers. — VNS'	society

Việt Nam lacks a well-connected logistics network which can boost agricultural product trade and export. —\xa0VNA/VNS Photo Danh Lam\nHÀ NỘI — Despite being considered as the driving force of Việt Nam’s economic growth, agriculture has been held back by an incomplete logistics system which fails to ensure quality and connect farms with markets, according to Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).\nViệt Nam has recently opened its doors for agricultural products to be exported to the international markets, yet struggled to win over customers and couldn’t compete with products from other countries in terms of quality and price due to drawbacks of the existing logistics system.\nMost small- and medium-sized enterprises fail to afford the cost of logistics services.\nAccording to Việt Nam Association of Logistics Services Enterprises, the expenses for storing and transporting agricultural products account for up to 30 per cent of selling prices, higher than those of Thailand and Singapore.\nMeanwhile, low-cost logistics services lack quality control indicators, causing high losses due to damage and bacterial infection.\nHải quan (Customs) newspaper reported that the percentages of food loss and waste in the supply chain for HCM City’s market, for example, are 32 per cent for vegetables, 14 per cent for meat and 12 per cent for fish.\nTrần Thanh Hải, deputy head of the Department of Import and Export under Ministry of Industry and Trade, blamed poor storage and delivery systems as the main causes to low business indexes of agricultural products in Mekong Delta.\nDespite being Việt Nam’s largest rice bowl and agricultural region, the area does not have a completed supply chain while scattered ports have limited capacity, increasing logistics expenses from US$7 to $10 for each tonne of agricultural products.\nUp to 90 per cent of rice grown in Mekong Delta is sold directly to traders, then re-distributed for rice processing companies and exporters. The process is similar to other types of\xa0fruit\xa0and vegetable\xa0due to the lack of collection centres which can sort, pack and preserve agricultural products following food safety standards.\nAs agricultural products come through many stages before finally approach markets, prices are pushed higher while farmers do not benefit from the process.\nAlthough provincial authorities\xa0in Việt Nam have recognised these problems and plan on building their own logistics centres, a network linking\xa0these centres which involves land reserve, infrastructure and facilities have not been developed.\nIn the Mekong Delta, goods are transported via waterways while in other parts of the country, road transportation is the most common.\nPoor logistics systems also hinder border trade.\nAccording to Việt Nam Border Traders Association, the total value of goods exchanged through border gates, including rice, peppercorn, rubber and coffee, reaches US$30 billion per year, increasing by more than 20 per cent per year.\nHowever, MARD said storage systems, especially cold storages, at border gates were unable to satisfy the rising demand of agricultural exports while cargoes are still mostly manually loaded, slowing down cross-border clearance activities.\nTrần Công Thắng, deputy head of the Institute of Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development, said degraded markets at border gates and insecure payment services restrained border trade between Việt Nam and neighbouring countries. —\xa0VNS'	society

He was recently honoured for his "good behavior" as part of the Civilisation Trip campaign in HCM City.\nHe first had the idea of offering free rides\xa0when he noticed students walking\xa0under the sun\xa0and seniors walking home, sometimes as far as five kilometres,\xa0because they wanted to save a small amount of\xa0money for more vital daily needs.\n“I earn\xa0VNĐ200,000 to VNĐ300,000 (US$8.7-12) each day\xa0and spend the remaining time driving\xa0disadvantaged people for\xa0free.

VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0Tighter regulations are needed to ensure good quality water is sourced for years to come.\nThat was the message delivered by Nguyễn Thị Hồng Khánh, from the Ministry of Construction’s Technological Infrastructure Department.\nShe believes a solid legal framework is necessary to make sure there is plenty of water for future generations.\n“We need a scheme for the Water Supply Law, and submit it to the Government and the National Assembly,” Khánh said.\n“It is needed to survey and catalogue important sources to have an effective protection, exploitation and use plan.”\nThere are more than 200 water supply enterprises, mainly operating as joint stock companies.\nThe national programme to ensure water supply and prevent water loss in the 2018-25 period has been implemented to promote investment and improve modern and energy-saving water treatment technology. It also establishes criteria for evaluating a safe water supply work.\nAt\xa0a recent conference hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Directorate of Water Resources and East Meets West Foundation in Hà Nội, a\xa0representative from the Directorate of Water Resources said since 2013, many provinces have actively enacted policies to call on the private economic sector in rural clean water supply works.\nWhile piped water supply systems have increased in rural areas, more than 30 per cent of community managed and public water works are out of service.\nAccording to a Directorate of Water Resources’ latest report, most of the rural water supply works in northern Thái Bình Province have been transferred to the enterprise for management.\nIn northern Bắc Giang Province, 12 local enterprises have built and are managing water plants that supply clean water to about 124,000 people.\nIn northern Hà Nam Province, from two in 2013, now there are 11 enterprises built and managing rural water supply works\xa0serving 150,000 people.\nIn the Mekong Delta province of Tiền Giang, there are 15 enterprises invested for water supply system with 13 among total 29 provincial plants managed by local companies.\nHowever, the representative said: “The rural population is sparse while the acreage is large. Many areas are developing so constructing water supply works requires high cost but economic efficiency is low. Investors must consider before joining.\n“We lack of capital mobilising measures. Many provinces have had supportive policies but not enough financial resources to support the private sector.”\nThe conference reviewed the Innovations for Private Sector Development Project (PSI), funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affair and Trade ( DFAT), that has carried out in three nations: Việt Nam, Laos and Cambodia.\nIn Việt Nam, the AU$2 million-funded PSI started in 2016 has succeeded in providing new piped water works for more than 6,600 rural households. The project has co-ordinated with eight private investors.\nIts first phase, lasting 20 months, with four private companies, two in northern mountainous Sơn La Province and two in northern Hà Nam\xa0Province built plants to supply 3,610 households.\nThe second phase, from May 2017 to September 2019, provided clean water to 2,990 households in two provinces of An Giang and Nghệ An.\nParticipating in the project in Nghệ An Province’s Phú Thành Commune, Lê Thị Kim Chung, from provincial Women’s Union said local authorities have focused on disseminating clean water to people.\nPSI-invested water supply work in Phú Thành Commune has help 1,630 households access to clean water.\n“We organise many community-based meetings to introduce and provide full information on the project, explaining about clean water’s importance for health.” — VNS'	society

As a result the demand for the labour force to meet specific job requirements is also subject\xa0to change. In such a situation, knowledge, science and creativity will become decisive factors while the capital of human resources has much greater significance than material resources.\nRecent changes in Việt Nam and the world have shown many jobs have been created in all economic sectors, however, their requirements in terms of knowledge, working skills and methods are totally different. Jobs which used to be performed by workers are now done by machines or robots. It is forecast that\xa0employment demand for architects, engineers, mathematicians and computer experts will increase rapidly while employment in mechanical engineering and installation and paperwork will be reduced considerably. However, jobs in other fields like business, finance, sales and construction will not be impacted much.\nTechnological change has caused a serious impacts on the labour force, yet the number of people who have job skills is still too low. Does this cause concern?\nIn 2018 the number of people who were awarded their job diploma after attending a three month training course or a bit longer than that was about 22.12 per cent.\nSecond, in 2018, the percentage of Vietnamese working people who attended a training workshop – either informal or formal and have been in these working positions more than three years was about 58.6 per cent.\nSo,\xa0the percentage of Vietnamese working people who have attended training workshops is very low. In 2018, our informal economic sector, including the household economy\xa0involved in agriculture activities or fisheries, employed more than 60 per cent of the national labour force.\nThe labour market has not yet generated a real high demand for people with high working skills. Meanwhile, our public job training system has not met the demand of society, the national economy and working people in general.\nWhat are the challenges that the Vietnamese working people are facing now?\nAmid Industry 4.0, technology is subject\xa0to rapid changes and so is production.\nFields that have high labour productivity\xa0require their employees to have strong\xa0skills. Of course, they will earn high wages. Meanwhile, unskilled workers are facing the danger of losing their jobs as they are likely to be replaced by robots.\nThe biggest challenge for the Vietnamese working force nowadays is their poor working skills. That’s why it’s high time for them to improve their labour skills to keep pace with the fast development of technology.\nViệt Nam faces a big shortage of high skilled workers. What should we do to raise our labour quality?\nThe first thing we should do is to raise the awareness for the whole society, including all families, enterprises and people to create a learning society and learning for life. We should also place the mission of human development as the centre in our national development strategy.\xa0—\xa0VNS\n.'	society

This year, only students in Argentina, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Republic of Northern Macedonia, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Việt Nam still took the paper test.\nBy\xa0 the\xa0 time\xa0 the\xa0 ranking\xa0 was\xa0 published,\xa0 the\xa0 international\xa0 comparability\xa0 of\xa0 Việt\xa0 Nam’s\xa0performance\xa0 in\xa0 reading,\xa0 mathematics\xa0 and\xa0 science\xa0 could\xa0 not\xa0 be\xa0 fully\xa0 ensured.\xa0 For this reason,\xa0 the\xa0 OECD\xa0 did\xa0 not\xa0 report comparisons of Việt Nam’s performance in PISA with other countries.\nInitially, OCED suggested that Việt Nam’s test data would be published in 2020. The organisation wanted to spend more time to delve into the difference of Việt Nam’s test results, the ministry said.\nHowever, thanks to the active co-operation of Việt Nam in processing the data after the tests, the organisation agreed to announce the result of Việt Nam with other nations in December 12, without naming the country in the ranking.\nThe ministry said OECD had sent the head of data analysis committee to Việt Nam to evaluate the process of organising the test. The organisation said Việt Nam made no errors in the process of organising and scoring the test.\nFollowing the PISA 2018 ranking, Asian countries once again came out on top. China and Singapore rank first and second, South Korea ranks 9th and Japan ranks 15th.\nEuropean countries such as Estonia, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Norway are also in the high-ranking group.\nPISA is an international study that was launched by the OECD in 1997, first administered in 2000 and now covers over 80 countries. Every three\xa0years, the PISA survey provides comparative data on 15-year-olds’ performance in reading, mathematics and science.\nThe Vietnamese education ministry said it wants to take part in PISA programme to see where Vietnamese students are placed in the world and to draw up an overall picture of the country's education situation in comparision to other countries' education, which will then help to formulate necessary policies. — VNS"	society

1	'Việt Nam’s diplomacy achievements in 2019'	"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Bình Minh. –\xa0 VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI – While the world saw profound global instability in 2019, the Pacific – Asia area proved to be the leading region in terms of economic integration, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Bình Minh has said.\nWriting on the achievements of Việt Nam’s diplomacy sector in 2019 as the year ended, Minh said while the global economy has slowed and\xa0conflict between globalisation and protectionism\xa0has become more fierce, the Association of South East Asia Nations (ASEAN) has stayed united and proved its\xa0important role in the policies of many major countries.\nFor Việt Nam,\xa02019 was a year with many achievements of the diplomatic sector in implementing the Party’s policies on international integration and economic diplomacy.\nThe country effectively implemented the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). After just a year in operation, the first new generation FTA in the world has helped Việt Nam's export turnover to members such as Japan, Canada and Mexico increase significantly compared to 2018.\nViệt Nam\xa0signed the Việt Nam - European Union Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) with the European Union and the Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA) and\xa0completed negotiations of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (RCEP).\nThe Global\xa0Competitiveness\xa0Index (GCI) 2019, issued on October 9 by the World Economic Forum (WEF), revealed Việt Nam had jumped 10 places from last year to 67, making it the most improved country of 2019.\nForeign direct investment (FDI) pledged to Việt Nam surpassed US$38 billion this year, marking a 10-year high and representing a year-on-year increase of 7.2 per cent. Việt Nam also welcomed more than 18 million international tourists in 2019.\nBesides economic integration, integration in\xa0politics - diplomacy, defence - security and\xa0culture - society was also strongly promoted.\nViệt Nam participated in joint maritime exercises for the first time with the US in the framework of ASEAN, signed\xa0a Framework Participation Agreement with the European Union that will facilitate\xa0Việt Nam’s\xa0contribution to the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions and operations, and\xa0ratified Convention No\xa098 of the International Labour Organisation.\nThe country sent the second level-2\xa0field hospital to join the UN Peacekeeping Mission in South Sudan after the first field hospital successfully completed its mission.\nAchieving second position at the 30th Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines recently and other outstanding achievements also confirmed Việt Nam's new position in the regional and international sports map.\nThe country's achievements in multilateral relations in 2019 also boosted its growing international status.\nEarly this year, Việt Nam hosted the second summit between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the US, a move highly praised by the international community for efforts to contribute to peace in the world.\nWinning 192 out of 193 votes on June 7, Việt Nam\xa0became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2020-21 term. This will\xa0be the second time that the country has held this post, demonstrating its wish to contribute to world security and peace and proving Việt Nam\xa0is a\xa0responsible member of the UN.\nIn terms of bilateral relations, Việt Nam maintained stable and positive relations with all countries. Leaders of Party, State,\xa0Government and National Assembly made 17 official\xa0visits abroad and received 22 high-ranking delegations paying a visit to Việt Nam, which helped gain\xa0important outcomes with\xa0partners.\nTo date, Việt Nam has established a network of 30 strategic partners and comprehensive partners.\nThe diplomatic sector contributed effectively to the defence of the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity, both on land and at sea. Việt Nam and Cambodia have signed and ratified two legal documents recognising 84 per cent of demarcation results, creating an important foundation\xa0to build a border of peace and development.\nIn the most complicated and serious situation in the East Sea in the past five years, Việt Nam properly assessed the situation, gave prompt\xa0reactions and\xa0dealt with the situation strongly to defend the country’s legitimate rights and interests.\nAt the same time, Việt Nam has also\xa0been working with ASEAN members and partners to build the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC)\xa0in accordance with international law.\nThe year 2020 has a very important meaning, when Việt Nam prepares for the Socio-Economic Development Strategy from 2021 to 2030 and celebrates 90 years of the establishment of the Việt Nam Communist Party, 75 years of the country’s establishment and 130 years of late President Hồ Chí Minh’s birthday, Minh said.\nIt is also important because Việt Nam will take on Chair of ASEAN 2020 and non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2020-21 term, holding the two responsibilities together for the first time.\nThis will be an opportunity for Việt Nam to take advantage of bilateral relations with other countries, creating new impetus for enhancing the role and position of the country.\nWith the theme 'Cohesive and Responsive'\xa0for the ASEAN Chairmanship 2020, and\xa0'Việt Nam: Trusted Partnership for Peace and Sustainability'\xa0as the non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Việt Nam will work\xa0with international friends and partners to foster multilateralism, the rule of law and enhance ASEAN’s centrality role in the regional structure, and further enhance\xa0co-operation between ASEAN and the UN.\nWith that spirit in mind, Việt Nam will work to affirm its important bridging role between ASEAN and the UN, contributing to the cause of promoting peace, co-operation and development in the region and in the world. – VNS"	'politics-laws'

He was proposed a combined jail term of 14 to 16 years.\nThe 47-year-old businessman Vũ, meanwhile, was facing three to four years behind bars for giving bribes, said the Procuracy.\nSeveral violations in the signing of the AVG deal only surfaced last year following a Government inspection into the purchase, which saw MobiFone buying 95 per cent of shares of the private firm AVG in 2015. The deal was concluded to have caused losses of approximately VNĐ6.47 trillion ($281.5 million) to the State and triggered a police investigation soon after.\nIt consequently led to the arrests of a number of high and middle level officials of the Ministry of Information and Communications, leaders of MobiFone and AMAX investment consultancy and valuation company.\nHà Nội People’s Court on Monday opened a trial against 14 defendants in the case, which is set to last until the end of this month.\nThe prosecutors also proposed jail terms of between two and six years for another nine defendants who are accused of breaches in public investment management causing severe consequences. — VNS\nThe People's Procuracy on Friday announced their punishment proposals for 14 defendants standing trial in the AVG case. — VNA/VNS Photo"	'politics-laws'
18	'Army stands firmly under Party’s leadership: top leader'	'General Secretary and President Nguyễn Phú Trọng inspects military equipment on exhibition at the political-military conference in 2018. — VNA/VNS Photo Trí Dũng\nHÀ NỘI The Việt Nam People’s Army (VPA) has always served as the core force to, together with the Party and the people, achieve accomplishments in national liberation and construction and defence throughout its 75-year history, Party General Secretary and President Nguyễn Phú Trọng has said.\nIn an article published for the 75th founding anniversary of the VPA (December 22, 1944), the Party and State leader stressed those accomplishments were the results of multiple factors, of which the Communist Party of Việt Nam’s (CPV)’s comprehensive, absolute and sound leadership is a decisive one.\nTrọng, who is also Secretary of the Central Military Commission, says in the article the Party has flexibly applied Marxism-Leninism and President Hồ Chí Minh’s thought to build a new-style army that suits the specific situation in Việt Nam. The Party also affirmed the inevitable need to turn the army into the key force in the cause of national liberation and defence.\nDuring the resistance war against the invading French colonialists, the VPA won glorious achievements, including the 1953-1954 Winter-Spring Campaign with the peak of the Điện Biên Phủ victory that forced the French government to sign the Geneva Accords in 1954, ending the war and restoring peace in Indochina.\nThis was the first time in contemporary history that an army equipped with rudimentary weapons defeated a professional counterpart, which marked the beginning of the collapse of colonialism and provided a strong boost to the national liberation movement around the world, he stressed.\nIn the anti-US war, the VPA, along with the entire Party and people, consecutively foiled war strategies. Such great victories won by the Vietnamese army and people drove the US to sign the Paris Peace Accords that committed to put an end to the war, and created a premise for the Spring General Offensive and Uprising in 1975, culminating with the historic Hồ Chí Minh Campaign, leading to the full liberation of South Việt Nam, national reunification and the end of the 30-year resistance war, the leader said.\nNot only fighting to liberate their own country, with a pure proletarian international spirit, the VPA has also stood side by side with armed forces of Laos and Cambodia in the fight against common enemies.\nRight after the anti-US war ended, the VPA immediately embarked on another fierce battle to protect the national border and performed its international mission of helping Cambodian people escape genocide.\nDuring the cause of national construction and defence in the renewal period, the army has carried forward its role in combat and production, while serving as an advisor of the Party and the State in military, national defence and drafting strategic guidelines for national protection.\nAt the same time, it has made outstanding performance in defence diplomacy, contributing to building a peaceful and stable environment for national building and development, Trọng says.\nOver the past 75 years, in any revolutionary period, even the toughest time, the CPV has maintained its comprehensive, absolute and direct leadership over the VPA.\nThis is an important factor for the success of national building and safeguarding, and also the decisive factor for the growth, combat capacity and triumph of the army, he says.\nThe Party General Secretary points out that unforeseeable and complex developments are lying ahead in the regional and global situation, along with increasing traditional and non-traditional security challenges and fierce strategic competition between world powers.\nThe East Sea (known as the South China Sea) issue also contains many unexpected risks, he says, adding that the trend of connectivity, globalisation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution have been exerting profound impacts on all countries in various spheres.\nInside the country, the macro economy has been stabilised but not quite sustainably. Although Việt Nam’s internal strength has been consolidated and its prestige and position in the international arena have been rising, the country still faces a range of difficulties and challenges.\nThe Party leader also called attention to the fact that hostile forces have stepped up the so-called “peace process,” “self-evolution,” “self-transformation,” “non-politicisation,” and “civilisation” of the army, especially before, during and after all-level Party congresses and the 13th National Party Congress.\nThe cause of national construction and defence goes with heavy requirements, with the struggle to safeguard the country’s sovereignty over its sea, islands and territorial integrity forecast to be a tough, long-term and complex one.\nIn 2020 and the years to come, the VPA will have to take on tougher tasks, he said, requiring the Party to maintain and enhance its absolute, direct and comprehensive leadership over the VPA in order to help the army complete its missions.\n“We believe that with its 75-year history of building and fighting under the Party leadership, the VPA will continue to write more glorious historical pages for the nation,” he concludes.

Việt Nam\xa0was the first country to sign a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union, of which Russia is a key member. Additionally, bilateral investment had\xa0continued to expand\xa0with many large projects, including oil and gas, according to the NA leader.\nShe added that co-operation in defence and security had\xa0increased while people-to-people exchanges had\xa0also been enhanced, and more young Vietnamese had\xa0chosen Russia to study in. Meanwhile, Việt Nam remained\xa0a popular destination for Russian tourists with more than 600,000 people from Russia visiting the Southeast Asian nation in 2018, and that\xa0figure reached\xa0500,000 in the first nine months of this year.\nIt was hard to find another\xa0country that the Vietnamese people held\xa0such a profound sentiment for like Russia, and this was shown not only through political and economic partnerships, but also cultural exchanges and connectivity, Ngân noted.\nThe Vietnamese leader went on to say the sound relations between\xa0the two countries had helped parliamentary co-operation to grow.\nDuring a\xa0trip to Việt Nam in December 2018 by Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav V. Volodin, the two sides inked a co-operation agreement on the establishment of an inter-parliamentary co-operation committee between the Vietnamese NA and the State Duma of Russia. This committee was the highest form of co-operation of the Vietnamese legislature, Ngân said.\nShe emphasised that amid complex developments and potential risks in the international arena, the continued enhancement of the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership was not only an objective requirement but also the aspiration of the two countries’ leaders and peoples. It also ensured the success of each nation’s reforms and development, while contributing to peace, stability, co-operation, development and prosperity in the region and the world.\nNgân underlined Việt Nam’s appreciation of Russia’s stance on the East Sea issue, which was supporting the peaceful settlement of disputes on the basis of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to help maintain peace, stability, freedom, safety and security of navigation and overflight in the East Sea, as well as supporting the full and serious implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea and the early finalisation of a Code of Conduct in the waters.\nShe repeated Party General Secretary,\xa0State President Nguyễn Phú Trọng’s statement that Việt Nam’s consistent policy was to always attach importance to and further strengthen its\xa0comprehensive strategic partnership with Russia, and considered Russia one of its\xa0leading partners. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin also described Việt Nam as a leading partner of his country in the Asia-Pacific region.\nAs Chair of ASEAN and the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) in 2020, Việt Nam would\xa0continue reinforcing the strategic partnership between ASEAN and Russia and help promote Russia’s voice and stature in the region, she noted, adding that as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2020-21, it would\xa0also work\xa0closely with Russia.\nThe NA leader expressed her belief that the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership would continue to develop\xa0and overcome challenges\xa0to match their long-standing friendship.\nIn that process, their parliaments would\xa0continue to play\xa0a crucial role in forming\xa0favourable legal frameworks, increasing supervision and stepping up the implementation of co-operation agreements and projects. They would\xa0also co-ordinate more closely at international inter-parliamentary forums for the sake of the two peoples, as well as for peace, co-operation, development and prosperity in the region and the world, she said.\nThe speech by NA Chairwoman Ngân was broadcast live on the TV channel of the Federation Council (vmeste-rf.tv). — VNS'	'politics-laws'

Second is the cost for water transfer. Third is the administrative expense. Fourth is 5 per cent of (loan’s) interest rate. And fifth is 25 per cent for potential water loss,” he said.\nHe said city authorities strictly followed\xa0prevailing regulations and no changes were made in the way the city calculated the price of tap water.\nChung said the increased\xa0water price of the Đuống River plant\xa0was only an "estimated price" agreed by the city and the investor so the project could be established and carried out.\nHà Nội also made such an agreement with the investor of the Hồng River surface water plant with the estimated water price of VNĐ10,365 per cu.m, he added.\n“They were just prices to set up the projects,” the chairman said, implying the current water price of the Đuống River plant was yet to be fixed.\nThe Đuống River water plant – the largest of its kind in the northern region –\xa0 began operation in September 2019 with total capacity reaching 300,000 cu.m\xa0daily.\nRural clean water\nThe Hà Nội chairman on Wednesday also discussed municipal authorities’s efforts to supply clean water to residents in suburban areas.\nAccording to Chung, Hà Nội until 2015 had set up 109 projects under the management of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to bring clean water to rural areas. They mainly involved digging wells and so far only six were working well, he said. Many others could only supply unfiltered water.\nThe city had called for investment from the private sector which later resulted in 38 clean water projects being carried out by 23 investors, he said.\n“With (the city’s) great determination, we haven’t encountered a clean water shortage this year,” he said.\n“In fact, up to 75 per cent of rural residents have been supplied with urban water in 2019. A Hà Nội Party\xa0resolution, meanwhile, only set the goal of 50 per cent of rural residents having\xa0access to water at urban standards by 2020.”\nThe official said\xa0city authorities hastened the rural clean water programme due to their wish to provide quality water to residents for the sake of their health.\xa0— VNS'	'politics-laws'
