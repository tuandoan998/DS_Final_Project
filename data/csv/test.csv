Research on the new species was conducted during field trips in Quảng Bình’s\nSon\nRiver basin\nstarting in 2014.\n“Speolabeo hokhanhi, a new species, can be distinguished from\xa0Speolabeo musaei\xa0by having no papillae on the lower lip, no hump immediately behind the head, a duckbilled snout and a shorter caudal peduncle,” said the report.\nIt also added that only six species of subterranean fishes have been reported from karst regions lying between Việt\nNam\nand\nLaos\n.\nAccording to Tạo, the newly-found cavefish has a white to pinkish coloured body and all of its fins are transparent.\nThe fish species,\xa0Speolabeo hokhanhi,\xa0is named after Hồ Khanh, a local guide who discovered many caves in\nPhong\nNha-Kẻ\nBàng\nNational Park\n, including the entrance of\nSơn\nĐoòng\nCave\n. Khanh accompanied and assisted the researchers in caving during the field trips to study the cavefish.\nThe researchers also suggested the use of the phrase “hokhanh’s blind cavefish” in English and ‘cá mù hang va hồ khanh’ in Vietnamese to describe the cavefish species.\nHang Va Cave is located 900m behind the Sơn Đoòng. Nguyễn Châu Á, a member of the British Cave Research Association and director of a local travel company providing sole adventurous tours to Sơn Đoòng, said he found similar cavefish in the world’s biggest cave and is waiting for confirmation by experts.\nÁ suspected dark water in the cave is the evolutional cause to the no-eye condition on the newly-found fish species. He also believed there is a tiny underground stream connecting the Sơn Đoòng and Hang Va, facilitating the moving of the fish between the two caves.\nExperts expected to find more new cavefish species in these karst caves once the research activities are fostered in the area.\xa0— VNS\nView of part of the Hang Va Cave in the ’kingdom of karst cave’ Quảng Bình Province. — Photo courtesy of Oxalis'",4

1509,"'Digitisation of healthcare sector, a double-edged sword'","'Digitisation of the healthcare sector is important to better serve patients, but hacking by cybercriminals is a grave risk, and great efforts are needed to keep patient information secure. — Photo tuyengiao.vn\nHCM CITY — The development of technologies such as 4G, 5G, internet of things and artificial intelligence has rapidly changed the healthcare sector’s landscape globally, including in Việt Nam, with more organisations adopting digitisation, according to experts.\nThe goal is to have multiple affiliated organisations sharing patients’ digitised medical records to provide more holistic healthcare.\nMany healthcare institutions are also using smart equipment to carry out conventional tasks. For example, various devices measuring vital signs today are directly connected to the hospital’s systems. Once measurements are taken, the data is incorporated directly in the patient’s medical records without the need for manual intervention.\nNew technologies have enabled the healthcare industry to carry out remote operations. For instance, earlier this year, a surgeon in China successfully carried out an operation remotely.\nDigitisation across the healthcare industry has helped service providers improve the quality of care and accelerate medical breakthroughs for better patient outcomes and mitigate the rising cost of healthcare.\nThe Vietnamese Government is also supporting the digitalisation of healthcare, launching projects to encourage and enable digital health solutions to be adopted around the country.\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, all healthcare establishments will complete digitisation of medical records by 2030.\nAccording to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade) Việt Nam, Việt Nam’s economic growth, health-conscious population and fast-developing 4G and 5G infrastructure provide the perfect environment for digital health solutions.\nThere is strong interest in telemedicine and advanced technologies and systems that can improve decision making, improve operational efficiency and enhance patient care and experience, it said.\nYeo Siang Tiong, general manager of Kaspersky Lab Southeast Asia, said most hospitals were in the first stage of digital transformation, digitising simple data such as patient records, personal information, past diagnosis, and medicine.\nBut the digitisation of the healthcare industry had led to a massive increase in the number of targeted attacks against the sector, he said.\n“The healthcare sector tracks a person’s medical history, personal information, sometimes they also track who their parents are, and genetic conditions that pass down from parents to child.\n“Some of this information is actually worth more than a bank card.”\nIn addition, ""the sector is less protected than sectors such as banking and finance,"" he said.\nIn the healthcare industry, cyber security should not be taken slightly because any issue could be a matter of “life and death,” he warned.\n“What would happen when you need to treat a patient in an emergency room, but the information is suddenly not available. It is a life and death situation. It is actually very dangerous.”\nAt a recent conference on cybersecurity in the healthcare sector, experts said the consequences of a breach could be quite detrimental since healthcare records are highly personal and sensitive in nature.\nIf patients’ records were stolen, their private data could be traded on the dark web to be exploited by cybercriminals for scams and frauds, and worse still it could cause tremendous trauma to the patients, they said.\nYeo said to protect the healthcare industry from cybercrimes, it was very important to “raise security awareness not just among IT workers but also users of the equipment, doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers.”\n""A lot of hospitals do not have chief security information officers,"" he said, suggesting that they should focus on developing human resources to ensure cyber security, he said.\nThe healthcare sector is a critical one, and therefore hospitals, public and private, should start drafting regulations to address the rising threats, according to Yeo. — VNS'",1

VNA/VNS Photo Mạnh Linh\nHÀ NỘI — Government inspectors have found leaders of the Health Ministry\xa0responsible for wrongdoings at the ministry which led to the import of thousands of fake cancer medications by the pharmaceutical company VN Pharma.\nThe Government Inspectorate on Monday announced their conclusion over the responsibilities of the Ministry of Health and the Drug Administration in granting drug import licences for VN Pharma and a business licence for the foreign drug producer Helix.\nAccording to the inspectors, leaders of the ministry and the drug administration must take the blame for several loopholes in Circular No 22 issued in 2009 regulating drug register and Circular No 47 in 2010 offering guidance for drug imports and exports.\nCircular No 22 was “one of the management failures that resulted in untimely detection of forged papers in (VN Pharma’s) drug registry applications,” the inspection found.\nVN Pharma managed to register seven medicines with the authorities using counterfeit documents.\nThen-ministerial leaders and officials of the drug administration in 2009 were responsible for drafting and issuing the circular while those in office between 2011 and 2014 who failed to fix the loopholes of the circular must be called to account for negligence, the Government Inspectorate said.\nCircular No 47 of the ministry, meanwhile, was concluded to be not in line with Prime Minister’s Decision No 151 in 2007 which demanded a foreign company to have a business licence in drug and drug materials in Việt Nam so that its medicines could be imported into the country.\nAs a result, the ministry granted a total of 607 import licences for three kinds of medicines reportedly manufactured by Canada’s Helix Pharmaceuticals Company. No copies of the company’s business licence in Việt Nam was included in the import applications.\nUp to 200,000 boxes of H-Capita 500mg Caplet – branded as a cancer medicine – received the needed licences to be imported into Việt Nam and about 9,300 packages managed to get into the country before they were stopped by the authorities.\nAccording to Circular No 47, a foreign pharmaceutical company which wanted to apply for a business licence in Việt Nam was also spared of a thorough assessment of its medicine manufacturing facilities. Such lax regulation led to the issuance of an official business licence to Helix in 2014 – the company which was later found to be non-existent.\nHealth ministry scrutinised\nThe scandal broke in 2014 when suspicions were raised over the origin of the H-Capita 500mg medicine and authorities launched an investigation.\nNguyễn Mạnh Hùng, VN Pharma’s former general director, was the mastermind behind a plan to buy cancer medicines overseas and supply them to Vietnamese hospitals.\nHe ordered underlings to forge papers for the Helix company in order to get licences to bring the medicine into Việt Nam.\nTests by the health ministry concluded that 97 per cent of the H-Capita drug consisted of capecitabine – a chemotherapy medication used to treat breast, gastric and colorectal cancer.\nHowever, the medicine was of unknown origin, subpar quality and its packaging failed to prove the drugs were safe to treat human diseases.\nUp to 12 people have been prosecuted in the case so far while the authorities started looking into the responsibilities of the health ministry.\nThe Government Inspectorate said that the health minister as the highest official in charge of medicine management should be held accountable for the scandal along with the head of the Drug Administration who offered assistance to the minister in the field.\nThe ministry’s consultancy council and drug appraisers must take responsibility in approving VN Pharma’s seven drug registries and import licences for three types of medicines and a business licence in Việt Nam for Helix company.\nThe inspection’s conclusion was transferred to the Central Inspection Committee to scrutinise and decide on the penalties for any high-level officials under the jurisdiction of the Politburo and the Party Secretariat. — VNS'",1

1008,'Increasing retirement age a sticky wicket',"Vice Chairman for the National Assembly Committee of Social Affairs Bùi Sỹ Lợi. — Photo hanoimoi.com\nBùi Sỹ Lợi, Vice Chairman for the National Assembly Committee of Social Affairs, speaks to Hà Nội mới (New Hà Nội) newspaper on increasing the retirement age in Việt Nam\nAccording to the latest revised Labour Law, what is the retirement age for Vietnamese working people?\nArticle 169 of the Labour Code says men\xa0will retire at the age of 62\xa0and women at 60. However, from\xa02021, a male employee who works in normal conditions will retire at the age of 60 and three months. Meanwhile, a female employee will retire at the age of 55 and four\xa0months. From then on, each year a working male will have to work an additional three months and a female will have to work for four more months. However, for any person with weak\xa0health\xa0or who works in a hazardous environment, they can retire years earlier.\nHighly skilled workers\xa0can\xa0remain in their position for a maximum of another five\xa0years after reaching their retirement age if they so choose.\nAccording to this roadmap, by 2028 Việt Nam will have the first male worker retire at the age of 62 and then by 2035, the first female worker will retire at\xa060.\nMany working people have expressed concern that they won't be able to work before they reach\xa0retirement. How do you respond to this issue?\nAny change\xa0in a policy, be it small or big, will have impacts on many people. Of course, the impacts will come from different perspectives. The increase in retirement age will impact both working people and their families. So their worries are\xa0understandable. All working people want to work less and pay social insurance for a short period of time, yet when they retire, they\xa0want to enjoy a large pension. However, the social insurance fund has to follow the principle of\xa0contribution and entitlement. In other words, the more you pay the larger pension you will receive when you retire. This is a good welfare policy for elderly people.\nFor Vietnamese people, the average lifespan for a man nowadays is 72.1 years old and 81.3 years old for a woman. However, the average retirement age for the Vietnamese working people is 54.2 (men at 55.6 years old and women\xa054.2 years old). This retirement age is much lower than\xa0many countries in the region and the world. From this perspective, I could say the majority of Vietnamese working people have good health to work until 62\xa0for a man and 60 for a woman.\nOf course, in certain circumstances, working people are able to retire early. At present, Việt Nam has about 3 million people working in hazardous conditions and these people, under Vietnamese law, could retire earlier.\nHow will employers and the labour market be affected by the changes in retirement age policy?\nMost employers or enterprises want to employ young workers. However, as I have mentioned above, both the physical and spiritual wellbeing of Vietnamese workers have improved considerably. As a result, they are fit for work for a few years more. Adding to that we’re now living in a world with more old people than young people. So when we increase retirement age, we’ll help solve the problem of having a shortage of workers. Of course, the roadmap to increase retirement age will be rational to avoid causing shocks to the labour market. Further, it is also a workable solution to maintain balanced development of the social insurance fund toward the ultimate goal of gender equality.\nWhat’s the best roadmap to increase retirement age which will bring benefits to all parties?\nIn my opinion, first of all the Government should issue as soon as possible a decree on the increase in the retirement age for the working people. In the meantime, we have to revise the Social Insurance Law, yet any changes in the Social Insurance Law must be compatible with\xa0the latest Labour Code (the revised version).\nIn the meantime, the media should raise the awareness of both employers and employees on adjusting the retirement age for all working people.\xa0— VNS",1
1789,'State revenue unlikely to fall despite numerous FTAs',"'Containers loaded up at Đình Vũ Port in nothern Hải Phòng City. — VNA Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Reduced revenue from cutting taxes on imported goods\xa0in accordance with various free trade agreements (FTA) Việt Nam had\xa0signed was unlikely to affect State revenue, said the finance ministry in a conference held on Thursday in Hà Nội.\nRevenue from tariffs and taxes has decreased by VNĐ13 trillion\xa0(US$475 million) compared to the same period last year. However, the ministry said earlier forecasts for net revenue to reach VNĐ340 trillion by the end of the year remained unchanged.\nLê Mạnh Hùng, deputy head of Vietnam Customs’s tax department, said import/export taxes were not the only revenue source\xa0as goods were also subject to other regimes including special consumption taxes, value-added taxes, anti-dumping duties and environmental protections taxes, among others.\n“FTAs only require the removal of import taxes. For goods subject to multiple tax regimes, only import taxes will be lifted,” said Hùng.\nThere had\xa0been a steady decrease in revenue from import taxes in recent years, according to a report by the customs authority, which resulted in smaller contribution to State revenue. Import tax\xa0revenue in 2018 dropped by VNĐ29 trillion and contributions to the State revenue ratio shrank by 4.4 per cent in comparison to the previous year.\nNet revenue from\xa0customs agencies, however, has\xa0been steadily rising with last year’s total figure reaching\xa0VNĐ314 trillion\xa0and this year’s forecast at VNĐ340 trillion.

The vegetable is\xa0usually picked all year round, but from January to May, we will have the best harvest because of the cool weather that helps the vegetable grow well,""\xa0Anh said.\n“I select the best peanuts, and roast and grind them into tiny pieces.\xa0The carrots have to be carefully peeled and grated.\n“Everything has to be perfect, from chopping the thinnest slices of lemongrass to removing every single seed from\xa0the crushed chili. If you want to cook the best food, you have to graft.” Anh said.\nAfter boiling, the vegetable is poured into a colander and lightly squeezed.\nWith simple ingredients like sesame, peanut, carrot, chili, a delicious dish of ""Nhót"" salad can satisfy the most discerning diners.\n“This\xa0helps to dry the\xa0vegetable and makes it less salty. Mix it with peanuts, sprouts, carrots, lime leaves, chilies, lime juice, with a little sugar.

In fact, it’s also a really tasty side dish.\nIt can be eaten with rice cakes\xa0and vermicelli.\n“Another specialty in Nghệ An is vermicelli served with shrimp paste\xa0with nhót, simple as that. The aroma of shrimp paste blended with fresh, crispy nhót creates a whole new sensation – strong and light.”\nDelicious food naturally gains\xa0a wide reputation. More and more people have been ordering this unique vegetable.\nAnd higher demand leads to larger-scale harvests.\nLê Thị Phú in the same district took advantage of the fact that her gardens were contaminated with saltwater from shrimp farms to grow nhót.\nNhót\xa0is a wild vegetable famous in Quỳnh Lưu District, growing along salt fields, brackish marshes and shrimp ponds.\nAfter nearly two years of experimenting, the garden is looking good and\xa0the vegetable has been developing really well.\n“It all started in March 2017, after spending hours harvesting\xa0nhót.\xa0I thought that if this vegetable could\xa0survive in saltwater, why not bring them home to test, so I started growing them in my small garden. After two months, the vegetable grew beyond my expectations.”\nPhú makes nearly VNĐ1 million a day from\xa0selling nhót to traders who then deliver it\xa0to markets around the country.\n“This is like a treasure for\xa0the people of Quỳnh Lưu District, so I really hope that my model can help promote\xa0nhót so that everyone can enjoy this wonderful gift of nature,” she added. — VNS'",5

They are decentralised solid waste management model in semi-urban\xa0Việt Nam, community-based organic waste treatment model and policy advocacy in Đà Nẵng, waste management model in market in Magway (Myanmar), recycling and recovery in Battambang (Cambodia) and solid waste management in Phitsanulok (Thailand).\nNguyễn Hữu Ninh, from Gret Việt Nam,\xa0said the increase of waste was a\xa0problem.\nResearch has shown\xa0that about one per cent of urban population earn their income from waste.\nRepresentatives at the conference also emphasised\xa0that local authorities should be better aware of treating organic waste, and strengthen coordination between concerned organisations to run the work more effectively. — VNS",4

Those included asking for permission to remove containers considered harmful to the environment, including those containing radioactive waste, to be shipped out of the territory within a 30-day period after giving notice to shipping companies.\nFailure to comply would result in the revocation of shipping privileges at all Vietnamese ports until the Ministry of Transport was able to verify all those containers had been shipped out of the country. Stricter inspections and standards for incoming containers will also be carried out by a joint task force from the customs department, transport ministry and finance ministry.\nIn a recent meeting, deputy chief of the Customs General Department Mai Xuân Thành said it had been working closely with local customs departments to document, categorise and process waste containers, which according to the task force, were mostly concentrated in seaports along Việt Nam's coast such as Hải Phòng, Đà Nẵng, TP HCM, Bình Định and Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu.\nDuring the first six months of the year, more than 500 waste containers were denied entry into Vietnamese ports for failing to meet the country's import regulations. Of which, 289 contained plastic waste, 106 paper waste and 98 metal waste.\nSince China banned the import of waste in 2018.

It imported around five million fry a year, he said.\nThe country still lacks zoning and advanced farming techniques, resulting in low efficiency and environmental pollution, according to Khôi.\nWith more than 3,200 km of coastline and more than 3,000 islands, the country has around 500,000ha of ocean surface with potential for aquaculture, according to the Directorate of Fisheries.\nThe country has 20 million people living in coastal areas and islands.\nThe alluvial grounds of estuaries in the Mekong and Hồng (Red) River deltas have the water salinity and food resources required for farming bivalve molluscs.\nTo sustainably develop aquaculture, many localities have adopted advanced techniques using Norwegian technologies.\nTrần Hữu Thế, deputy chairman of the Phú Yên Province People’s Committee, said the Norwegian technologies helped curb environmental problems related to coastal aquaculture.\nOne of them, used on farms on land, works by not releasing wastewater into the environment.\n“This technology can be used to breed lobsters,” Thế said.\nAnother, which involves farming fish far away from the shore at sea, ensures the safety and cleanliness of the water.\nPhú Yên and Khánh Hòa are the two largest lobster producers in the central region.\nDeputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phùng Đức Tiến said the Government had rolled out a number of policies and programmes to promote marine aquaculture.\nInfrastructure for aquatic species seed breeding, concentrated marine aquaculture and supporting and processing industries for marine species had been created, he said.\nBut coastal aquaculture is still in a fledgeling phase, according to the Research Institute for Aquaculture No. 1.\nMarine aquaculture is small in scale and lacks infrastructure, and faces many challenges related to seeds, feed, diseases, and pollution.\nMost marine aquaculture farms are close to shore and face problems like pollution.\nThere are a few companies that farm fish at seas on an industrial scale. Bình Định, Phú Yên and Khánh Hòa provinces, for instance, have one such company each focused on exports.\nIn July this year Kiên Giang Province gave approval to Mavin Group to invest in a 2,000ha export-focused farm off the coast of Kiên Hải District.\nThe US$30 million project is scheduled to begin operating in 2021, producing 30,000 tonnes of fish a year.\nDevelopment\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has drafted a sustainable marine aquaculture strategy for the period up to 2030 and submitted to the Government for approval.\nIt targets having 270,000ha of marine farms, including 6,000ha offshore, by next year and an annual output of 710,000 tonnes.\nBy 2030 it aims to expand to 300,000ha, 30,000ha and 1.75 million tonnes. By then exports will be worth US$4 - 6 billion.\nTiến said the country would shift from traditional farming to an industrial scale and adopt advanced techniques.\nIt would promote sustainable aquaculture and fishing and adopting advanced techniques in breeding, fishing, preserving, and processing seafood to produce high-value products, he said.\nIt would focus on green technologies to develop all areas of marine aquaculture like breeding, fish health, feed, farming techniques, and post-harvest handling and processing, he added. – VNS'",2

SoEs with fewer shares held by the State tend to have made more progress than others.\nNotably, private enterprises, who possess less computing power or the number of computers, tend to utilise them a lot more often than SoEs in most fields.

Despite SoE\'s high expectation to perform, they have not been placed among the country\'s innovation ecosystem and desperately need support to access new technologies, especially small-to-medium enterprises.\nSoEs also have a hard time attracting and retain IT talents due to their much less lucrative compensation policies, which are often regulated by State\'s labour code, compared to the private sector.\n""It\'s difficult for SoEs to compete with the private sector to keep IT professionals. As it stands, we are losing them to private companies,""\xa0Đăng from EVN said.\nA representative from Petro Vietnam said another reason for slow digitalisation\xa0among SoEs was\xa0their risk-averse nature.

On the economic development front, Vietnamese entrepreneurs are playing perhaps the most important role today, especially in realising the objective to transform Việt Nam into a modern industrial country by 2030 and a developed country by 2045.\nVietnamese entrepreneurs, as a major economic driver, must work together with the Party and the State to improve the country's\xa0business environment, policy-making capacity and national competitiveness. In order to make it happen,\xa0the Central Economic Committee has started an initiative\xa0to encourage\xa0Vietnamese entrepreneurs to participate in the\xa0policy-making process.\nI strongly urge each and every business to join the initiative as policy reform and business improvements are two crucial objectives that often go hand in hand.

The next step is for Vietnamese businesses to aim for greater innovation, to achieve sustainable development and to meet social responsibilities.\nWhat are Vietnamese businesses' shortcomings and limitations?\nI think our economy has a sufficient number of businesses compared to other economies in the Southeast Asian region. Our problem is quality. Top Vietnamese entrepreneurs, who can effectively compete\xa0on a global level, are few.\nA report on business management capacity among ASEAN listed companies ranked\xa0Việt Nam in 6th place.

This points to limited productivity, even among ASEAN countries, and numerous issues yet to be resolved in order to provide our businesses with much-needed support for growth.\nHow can Việt Nam approach the mentioned\xa0issues?\nThe most pressing issue at the moment is how to strengthen and improve Vietnamese businesses in a comprehensive manner. The\xa0focus of Việt Nam's national programme on business development must make a shift to increase\xa0quality, rather than just increase the number of businesses.\xa0Sustainable development and digitalisation are two important objectives for business development and must be integrated into each business’s growth strategy.\nViệt Nam's draft\xa0Law on Enterprises, which is to be submitted to the National Assembly for review this month, prioritises business management improvement and increasing transparency, especially in micro-businesses and business households.— VNS",2

Waves are rising higher and stronger and damaging barriers,” Hiền said. “Sandbags and protective measures had been set up to ease erosion, but they can only help a little.”\nMeanwhile, a pristine stretch of sand spanning from An Bàng Beach to Cửa Đại Beach – a favourite beach of foreign tourists in Hội An – has gradually disappeared with each passing day.\n“I had to walk 100m down the beach to get to the water last year, but now waves are splashing on my feet and uprooted the casuarina forest. Every thing went down to water, while waves carried in rubbish to cover the beach,” said Nguyễn Văn Tài, a resident of Cửa Đại Ward. “Big waves with hard rain and strong wind in recent days approached closer to the coastal Cửa Đại road during the high tide at night.”\nHe said an area of beach 2km long and 200m wide has eroded in three months during an unusually severe rainy season.\nA section of an 1,100m Geotube sandbag dyke on Cửa Đại Beach, between Palm Garden Resort and Agribank Hội An Resort, was broken by rising sea water and waves since early this week (from October 28th).\nRising sea water and tidal waves damage a small casuarina forest near Vinpearl Hội An Resort and Villa on Cửa Đại Beach near Hội An City. — VNS Photo Công Thành\nAccording to the latest report from Hội An City, more than 20ha beach washed away between 2009-14.\nLast year, an area of 4,000sq.m of Cửa Đại Beach, 5km from Hội An City’s ancient town, disappeared after a series of tropical low pressure storms and heavy downpours hit the central coastal region.\nDespite the construction of a 1,100m Geotube sandbag dyke, positioned under the water 60m off the beach, big waves still crash onto the beach and wash the sand away between November and April.\nNearly VNĐ200 billion (US$8 million) was used to build sea dykes or temporary embankments with bamboo and sandbags, as well as the Geotube sandbag in protection of the beach.\nThe city and the Agency for Development of France (AFD) agreed to conduct a survey of beach nourishment as a sustainable and effective protection of Cửa Đại Beach with an investment of 136,000 euro ($327,000), but it will not begin until 2018.\nAn expert from Hội An City blamed the erosion on the construction of resorts on the beach and the lack of proper environmental assessments before dredging the estuary. Construction of hydropower plants on the upstream Thu Bồn River and the over-exploitation of sand were believed to have caused the shortage of muddy sand.\nThe city has been calling for investment in replanting 140ha of nipa palm (a species of palm native to the coastlines) along the Thu Bồn River to reduce sand erosion in Cửa Đại Beach.\nFrench-Vietnamese architect Bùi Kiến Quốc, who lives in Hội An, predicted erosion would hit An Bàng Beach, 2km away from Cửa Đại Beach, within the next few years.\nThe Cửa Đại Beach area witnesses sea encroachment of 50-200m annually. — VNS'",4

The figure was 6.98 per cent in the first nine months, said\xa0Phạm Thế Anh,\xa0VEPR's chief economist.\nIn the first nine months of 2019, the service sector grew by 6.85 per cent,\xa0agriculture, forestry and fishery increased\xa0by 2.02 per cent, while industry and construction climbed by 9.56 per cent. The Industrial Production Index (IPI) rose\xa0by 9.6 per cent, the\xa0consumption index\xa0of the\xa0manufacturing\xa0and\xa0processing sector increased by 9.5 per cent, he said.\nRegarding enterprises, in Q3, there were 35,316 newly registered enterprises with total registered capital of VNĐ430.6 trillion (US$18.4 billion), up 37 per cent year-on-year. The number of enterprises suspending operations continued to decrease to 12,505.\nCPI in Q3 increased by 2.23 per cent year-on-year, the figure for nine months was 2.5 per cent, but there is a high risk of rising inflation with increases in food prices due to epidemics, as well as increasing education fees and energy prices, Thành said.\nThe VNĐ/USD exchange rate at commercial banks fluctuated while the central exchange rate increased slightly. The exchange rate at commercial banks fluctuated around VNĐ23,275 per USD.\nTotal State budget revenue in the first six months was estimated at VNĐ1.1 trillion, equalling 77.5 per cent of the yearly estimate and up 10.1 per cent over the same period in 2018.\nIn six months, total budget expenditure was estimated at VNĐ1 trillion, equalling 63.1 per cent of the yearly estimate, up 3.8 per cent year-on-year.\nAccording to Thế Anh, Việt Nam’s GDP growth in the third quarter stood in contrast to the global trend.\nDuring Q3, the growth rates slowed down in many economies.\nThe US economy decelerated so the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its interest rate twice in Q3. European economies enervated, thus the ECB also had to reduce\xa0interest rates. Meanwhile, Japanese government\xa0has been attracting foreign workers to compensate their labour shortages.\nThere are increasing concerns about China’s economy due to\xa0its slower\xa0economic growth and the reducing power of the yuan. Besides, China’s PMI was under 50 while growth-enhancing packages were no longer effective.\nIn addition, oil prices fluctuated unpredictably owing to trade tension between US-China, Japan-Korea and a recent attack on the world’s largest oil refinery in Saudi Arabia.\nThe economic growth in ASEAN countries decelerated.

However, the ministry has not evaluated the three complexes\xa0individually due to a lack of\xa0regulations.\nThis has harmed the environment during and after the limestone mining process, he said.\nHưng said there were 10 quarries in Phước Tân quarry complex in Biên Hoà City, along the two sides of the Buông River. All of the quarries are legal and were evaluated the environmental impact assessment.\nThese quarries were licensed to operate between four and 25 years on\xa0403ha. The total amount of exploited limestone was estimated to be 130 million cu.m to a depth of up to 80m.\nHưng said five out of 10 quarries were only 50m\xa0from the river and each quarry was hundreds of metres long.

Photo coutersy of Goethe Institute\nThe exhibition A Girl Named K... is a reflection of your personal approach to the epic Truyện Kiều (The Tale of Kiều). What challenges did you encounter as you processed the literary work?\nThe text immediately spoke to me. Its visual language was very much in tune with my own:\xa0metaphor-heavy imagery.\nBut that was also exactly the challenge. I carry strong, very intense images inside of me, some of which have been with me since childhood.\nIt is not always easy for me to open this distinct inner world of mine to alien, external influences. But fortunately, there is some overlap with my world, such as the prophetic dream motif at the beginning, or the conflict between fate and personal freedom, between duty and true love.\nAs you conceived your artwork, how did you create a synthesis between the enchanting language of Nguyễn Du and the gloom of its plot?\nI actually didn’t find the text gloomy, but rather – what should I call it –“realistic”? Kiều experiences awful things.\nSometimes you think it can’t get any worse, but then it does. But there are always moments of hope, of improvement, and in the end, she even returns home to her family and her lover.\nIt seems as if her life is destroyed and her soul broken. But she lives, and her dignity remains unscathed,\xa0despite, or rather, because of her dire fate, even despite the desperation to which she surrendered herself to.\nThe book does not sugarcoat anything. Life is hard, often cruel, but yet small islands of happiness are always possible.\nThis“realism”, which is what I call it for lack of a better term, is in stark contrast with artful language, which sounds even “florid” to the European reader.\nBut this contradiction is precisely what makes the epic so appealing to me - beautiful language to talk about ugliness. Overcoming, sublimating the bad with beauty. This is perhaps the goal, the ideal of all art: to transform evil into beauty.\nThe medium of woodblock printing is at the center of your artistic work. To what extent does this medium lend itself to the lyrical language of Kiều?\nI have already touched on the basic idea. I find contradictions artistically appealing. The point where notions start “grinding” against one another is the point where things get interesting. There is something collage-like about disparities colliding, and I generally like that. It creates a tension that opens the mind and sharpens the senses.\nWhich works/figures did you enjoy the most - and which have taken the most time\xa0and effort?\nIt is difficult to say. In retrospect, I find that I enjoyed all of it. I like to work. There is no other place where I feel safer and more at ease with myself than at work.\nThe biggest challenge for me was and still is the long journey, because I have a deep fear of flying.\nWhat relationship do you see between Kiều and the reality women face today in a social or artistic context?\nThis question triggers a veritable cascade of thoughts in me, which I’m afraid is too much to discuss in this context.\nUndoubtedly, times have changed - in Asia as well as in the European western world. No woman today must apathetically be subordinate to her parents or husband. For Kiều, that was a matter of course.\nOn the other hand, unfortunately, there are still enough situations where women are much worse off than men.\nLeadership positions are still mainly filled by men. Works by female artists are statistically worth less than those of their male colleagues. Neither reverse discrimination nor gender-support programmes will change that. Perhaps they are even counterproductive because they institutionalise the “small difference”.\nWhat were your first impressions of\xa0Truyện Kiều?\nAt first, it takes 21st-century European reader a little while to get used to the style. It is a verse epic, very artificial, and the metaphor-rich language seems almost “florid”.\nBut the content is not. The woman’s fate is difficult, full of unpredictable twists. It is an exciting read from the first to the last line. And it is precisely the remarkable linguistic imagery that triggered something in me and that found its way into my work.\nWhich aspect of the epic did you focus on in your work?\nThat is difficult to say, because when I absorb books or pictures, I always tend to let the totality of them\xa0sink in and I don’t focus on any specific aspects.\nI’m concerned with moods, with feelings – in this case, primarily with the coexistence of despair and devotion, of duty and love.\nKiều may submit to her fate and it almost breaks her, but there are always moments when she improves her situation thanks to her poetic and musical talent.\nRescue, even salvation, through art, creativity and invention is a beautiful and comforting thought that really hit home with me.

No, it’s more than just \'something\', it’s an art. I eat at least one bowl of phở\xa0a day or else I would feel like I\'m missing something.\n“You want tasty and delicious phở, you will have to respect the food first. When it comes to phở, it’s like a national pride and Vietnamese can sometimes be super picky.""\nApart from phở bò and phở gà, phở cuốn (rolled noodle) in Hà Nội\'s Ngũ Xã Street is also well known far and wide in the country. — VNS Photo Trương Vị\nWhether you agree or not, whose voice has more weight than Vũ Bằng, one of the most famous Vietnamese gastronomes? And he agreed with Trí.\n“A picky connoisseur mustn’t take it easy when choosing a phở shop, especially random shops”, Bằng wrote in his famous book\xa0The Delicious Dishes of Hà Nội.\nThere were three kinds of phở store at that time:\xa0vendors, restaurants\xa0and phở made on mobile trolleys.\nBằng believed it’s not about how beautiful or modern the shop is, the only thing diners care about is phở.\n“To be honest, the only thing connoisseurs care about is the noodles, no matter how the space is, if the rice noodles are thin and pliable, the beef is soft and the broth is truly rich in flavour, which is sweet from the bone. That bowl of phở is really worth trying”.\n“At that time, there was a rumors the broth in those fancy stores couldn’t compete against other\xa0ordinary old stores in the sweetness, the rich in flavour. If it is sweet, it can only due to MSG rather than the bone of ox. Not to mention some of them even add sugar inside.\n“Eating a bowl of phở like that not only makes you regret spending money, but also wastes your time and effort,""\xa0Bằng asserted.\nAccording to Bằng, there’s no other food that makes people “suffer” just to have a delicious bowl.\nThere used to be hundreds of customers waiting outside a small lane on Hàng Khay Street just to try a couple bowls of phở in a really old and simple vendor shop.\nIn the morning, people used to queue all over Hàm Long Street junction to try tàu bay\xa0phở - one of the most famous examples of the dish at that time.\n“Phở is not just a dish, not just an enjoyment of senses, but also a \'problem\'\xa0when discussing savouring and making it,""\xa0Bằng wrote.\nFor me, there isn’t any better way to solve that problem than by depicting my grandfather’s story.\n“In 1952, on Hàng Khay Street, there was one of the most famous phở stores at that time – Phở Tráng (Tráng is the name of the chef). Many people loved eating there, in an uplifting mood, some people called him \'The king of phở 1952\',” he recalled.\nThe atmosphere of Tráng making phở and customers waiting in a really long queue is still vivid in my grandfather\'s memory.\n“Tráng was one of the most bizarre people I’ve ever seen. It was like he didn’t care about any of his customers, he just stayed completely silent, chopping beef and making broth at a very relaxed speed despite countless customers surrounding, yelling, screaming, even swearing at him.\n“I saw all classes of people eating there, from people stepping out of\xa0cars, beautiful and classy women to workers. Despite that, he didn’t seem to care about them at all, many of them felt really uncomfortable when meeting him.""\nBut they had no other choices, because his phở was one a\xa0kind.\n“We knew it was going to be delicious even before eating. A little bit of noodles, some fresh fragrant herbs, a few yellow and red slices of ginger and chilli, etc. It was just like a colourful painting.\n“After that, Tráng would serve customers with different beef\xa0according to their\xa0orders. From eye round steak, flank, tendon, tripe, and fatty flank. After that, adding some pepper, lemon or vinegar.

The average income of people living in rural areas in 2010 was just VNĐ13 million (US$580) per annum. There was also a big gap in income and quality of life between people living in rural areas and those living in urban areas.\nAt its municipal Party Congress, the Hà Nội Party Committee adopted a programme titled ‘Agricultural development – building new rural areas and improving farmers’ living conditions’. This would be a major programme for the period from 2010 to 2020.\nAfter almost 10 years of implementing the programme, Hà Nội has witnessed many successes in the field of agriculture, particularly in building new rural areas. Now six outlying districts have been awarded the title ‘New Rural Area’. In the city, 325 of 386 communes, or 84 per cent\xa0of all communes, have completed the new rural area programme, and three communes of Đan Phượng, Song Phượng and Liên Trung from Đan Phượng District won the title of 2018 New Rural Areas.\nWhat are some notable changes experienced by people living in Hà Nội’s rural areas?\nThe programme has had a strong impact on people living in Hà Nội’s rural areas as well as in the socio-economic development of Hà Nội.\nTheir living conditions, including their spiritual lives, have improved considerably. The value of agricultural production increased from VNĐ133 million per hectare per year (in 2010) to VNĐ259 million in 2018; the average income per capita in rural areas was VNĐ13 million in 2010, yet by 2018 the sum jumped to VNĐ46.5 million.\nWhat has Hà Nội done in the 10 years from 2010-20, and what are the city’s plans for the future?\nAs mentioned above, in the last 10 years we have seen many remarkable successes in the course of implementing the programme of the Party Central Committee. However, I acknowledge there remain some limitations. The process has not reached its potential, while the resources for the programme of building new rural areas still mainly come from the State budget. Additionally, the number of poor households remains rather high in the districts of Ba Vì, Mỹ Đức and Chương Mỹ.\nThat’s why the Steering Committee of the Programme 02-CTr/TU of the Hà Nội Party Committee has set a goal that by late 2020, 85 per cent of communes will be awarded the title ‘New Rural Area’ – an increase of 5 per cent against the set target.\nAccording to the plan, by 2025, income per capita of people living in rural areas of Hà Nội will be at least VNĐ60 million. Some 95 per cent of working people will have regular jobs and the percentage of poor households will drop to less than 1 per cent. 100 per cent of people living in rural areas will have access to clean water while 90 per cent will have signed up for the health insurance scheme. —\xa0VNS'",1

In the photo Vingroup's Landmark 81 in HCM City,\xa0the highest building in Vietnam. — Photo courtesy of Vingroup\nHCM CITY —\xa0Despite the slowdown in global deal-making due to ongoing worldwide economic uncertainty, Việt Nam remains active in M&A in 2020, according to a new report by Baker McKenzie.\nThe firm’s fifth annual\xa0Global Transactions Forecast, jointly released with Oxford Economics, projects that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) will decline globally from US$2.8 trillion in 2019 to $2.1 trillion in 2020. The forecast also predicts a downward trend in IPO proceeds from an estimated $152 billion in 2019 to $116 billion, a 23 per cent drop.\nFor Việt Nam, the forecast expects GDP growth may ease over the next 18 months, due to export growth trends declining amid lower Chinese import demand and increased global protectionism. Currently, Việt Nam’s average annual GDP growth of 6.2 per cent is higher than the global average of 2.8 per cent.\nBaker McKenzie expects cross-border acquisitions to dominate M&A deals in the coming years, as the country’s solid social economic fundamentals continue to attract overseas investors.\xa0“Việt Nam remains active in M&A right now, due to positive market factors and confidence that help create business opportunities, as well as multilateral agreements that continue to prompt regulatory reform,”\xa0said Seck Yee Chung, who heads Baker McKenzie’s M&A practice in Việt Nam.\nViệt Nam, Thailand and Indonesia were identified in the report as Asian countries that saw strong inbound activity in 2019. This year’s largest cross-border signed inbound deal in the country was South Korea's chips-to-energy conglomerate SK Group's US$1 billion investment in Vingroup – Việt Nam's largest firm. This was followed shortly by South Korea-headquartered Hana Bank’s purchase of a 15 per cent stake in the Bank for Investment and Development of Việt Nam (BIDV) worth US$850 million. South Korea is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Việt Nam, as the latter has become a production base for major Korean multinationals such as Samsung and LG.\nDespite continued interest from investors, Việt Nam may experience a decline in M&A, as total transactions will dip from $2.6 billion in 2019 to $1.7 billion in 2020, a 35 per cent decrease. In IPOs, the report did not post any estimates for 2019-2020.\nLooking ahead, the report predicts that activity will pick up again post-2020, as Việt Nam remains an attractive market.\nAsia Pacific sees more declines in 2020\nIn Asia Pacific, the report predicts M&A activity declining 18 per cent from $634 billion in 2019 to $529 billion in 2020, and IPO activity will likely continue its slower trend from this year, which is expected to amount to $36 billion, a 43 per cent decline from 2018. IPO proceeds are predicted to dip even further to $33 billion in 2020.\nThe region’s weaker performance in 2019 can be attributed to a reduction in Chinese outbound deals due to government restrictions on outward investment. On a broader scale, this in turn may dampen economic momentum across Asia Pacific.\n“Make no mistake — deals are getting done, but the current slowdown is inevitable, considering the continuing uncertainty around trade and regulation,” said Ai Ai Wong, chair of Baker McKenzie’s Global Transactional Group. “We know that around the world, there are many investors and companies with capital on the sidelines, waiting to move forward with domestic and cross-border deals.”\nA range of upside and downside risks could impact the global economy and lead to a rise or drop in deal values and volumes that differ from the central transactions forecast presented in this report. To explore both upside and downside risks, the report looks at five different economic scenarios: Trade War Escalation, Protracted Eurozone Slowdown, US Recession Hits the Global Economy, No-deal Brexit, and Trade War Fears Fade.\xa0To understand how these hypothetical outcomes might impact the global economy and the implications for deal making, you may view the interactive Global Transactions Forecast tool\xa0http://interactive.globaltransactionsforecast.com. \xa0VNS",2

A horrible odour filling his nostrils, more so when the rains came.\nTân said he also worried because the number of waste discharged into the canal seems to become bigger day by day.\nAnd to add to his worries was the location of two primary schools, close enough to the canal for the pupils to be disgusted by the smell.\nFamily supports\nNow four decades later, Tân’s arms still bear the scares of his labour, caused by broken glass or other sharp objects he’s picked up over the years.\nBut he’s not bothered, claiming everything is okay as his skin heals quickly.\nTân’s wife said she at first did not know his job. She only knew when neighbours told her and disapproved of his line of work.\n“I tell him it’s nonsense and I don’t agree,” she said.\nTân takes waste from the canal. — Photo danviet.vn\nHowever, Tân did not change his mind due to her words. Despite her opposition, he still gradually carried on with his job.\nOne time, when Tân woke up at a midnight because it was raining, he quickly grabbed his stick to go to the canal’s section near his house to pick waste.\nSoaking wet through, Tân returned his house with a smile on his face, knowing he’d picked up the waste before morning came and saving his neighbours waking up to a repulsive smell.\nAt that moment, Tân’s wife changed her mind and decided to support him.\nTân said, “My wife’s support is the biggest motivation for me to continue doing the voluntary job.”\n“I think the happy moment for me is when I hear the bubbling sound from the water flowing over the canal without being blocked by waste,” he said.\nTân, was once given a certificate of the People’s Committee of HCM City for setting a good example for others.\nHe doesn’t do it for awards.

4684,Poland's 101st anniversary comes from Warsaw with love,"'Founded in 1364 by Casimir III the Great, the Jagiellonian University in Kraków is the oldest university in Poland, the second oldest in Central Europe, and one of the oldest functioning universities in the world. Photo courtesy of the embassy\nOn the occasion of the 101st anniversary of regaining independence (November 11), ambassador of the Republic of Poland Wojciech Gerwel sends a message reflecting on some of Poland’s achievements that may serve to forge even closer co-operation with Việt Nam.\nPoland and Việt Nam share a close and multifaceted relationship that builds on the exceptional dynamism of the two countries as well as on the traditional friendship that has been forged between our peoples over three generations. There are many reasons I would encourage friends in Việt Nam to explore Poland, but in this brief article I will mention only a few.\nThe Polish economy has developed at one of the fastest rates in the West over the past thirty years. In 2018, its GDP growth rate surpassed 5 per cent\xa0and the country officially joined the club of developed economies.\nRemarkably, this economic dynamism has not come at a cost of rising inequality, environmental degradation\xa0and growing debt. On the contrary, Poland’s public debt has been steadily falling and so has social inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. Despite record economic growth, Poland has significantly reduced its domestic greenhouse gas emissions.\nAccording to a survey done by the Pew Research Center this October, Poles are among the most satisfied people in Europe with the way things are going in their country today, second only to the Netherlands. They are also the greatest EU-enthusiasts, with 84 per cent\xa0of Polish citizens expressing support for the EU.\nPoland’s strong economic performance is coupled with remarkable cultural vibrancy. Some Vietnamese audiences may be already familiar with Poland’s accomplishments in classical music, jazz, film, and literature. Next year, Warsaw will host the International Chopin Piano Competition – much as it did a generation ago, when Đặng Thái Sơn won the competition as the first Asian artist ever. In October, Poland’s author Olga Tokarczuk was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature – the fifth such recognition for literature in the Polish language.\nPoland’s culture has been enriched by the presence of a vibrant Vietnamese community, which is one of the largest in Europe. Some of its members have been remarkably successful and the example of Ola Nguyen is a case in point. She recently became one of the country’s most celebrated cooks after winning the highly popular and nationally televised MasterChef Poland competition. This week, the Embassy of Poland and the Metropole Hotel are holding the Polish Gastronomy Week in Hà Nội in collaboration with MasterChef Ola Nguyen to showcase Poland’s rich culinary heritage. I expect such initiatives will raise awareness in Việt Nam of what Poland has to offer in this tasty domain.\nOver the past seven decades, thousands of Vietnamese students have chosen Poland as the destination for their academic pursuits. I hope that this trend continues. Today, Polish universities are better than ever. They offer European quality education – and a European experience – at exceptionally affordable prices. Yearly tuition at Polish universities amounts on average to approximately 3,000 EUR (VND76 million), while living costs are among the lowest in Europe. In Poland, there are some 850 university programmes taught fully in English. Prospective Vietnamese students who wish to learn Polish can take advantage of language training courses offered, for instance, at the University of Hà Nội and in Poland.\nThe year 2020 will mark the 70th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between Poland and Việt Nam. It has been a very close and fruitful relationship so far. Given the two countries’ dynamic development, one can remain confident the relationship will bear much fruit in the years to come. VNS'",5

That equates to approximately 370 million tonnes carbon dioxide.\n“The Vietnamese authorities can rely on the report in realising a green and cost-effective energy transition, whilst reducing dependency on imported fossil fuels.”\nEarlier, the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Việt Nam in collaboration with the Embassy of Denmark in Việt Nam and the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities organised the announcement of the Việt Nam Energy Outlook Report 2019 in Hà Nội on Monday.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Hoàng Quốc Vượng emphasised that ""Việt Nam is a country that has a relatively fast and high growth rate compared to other countries in the region and world"".\nThe growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) was 7.26 per cent on average in the 2001-10 period, then down to 5.91 per cent in the 2011-15 period and gradually recovered to 6.14 per cent per year between 2011-18.\nIn parallel with economic growth, energy that met the economic demand increased accordingly, the deputy minister said.\nEnergy demand increased by about 10 per cent in the period of 2001-10, electricity demand increased by 13 per cent per year same period and about 11 per cent between 2011-18.\nIn addition, the deputy minister reviewed and presented research results on power and energy development scenarios and policy recommendations on key issues related to the development of the country’s electricity and energy system in the long term.\nHe also provided information for the building of the eighth Power Development Plan as well as the national energy development plan.\nThe Việt Nam Energy Outlook Report 2019 is developed by the Electricity and Renewable Energy Authority under the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade in close collaboration with the Danish Energy Agency and supported by the Danish Embassy in Hà Nội.\nThis report is a central milestone in the Energy Partnership Program between Việt Nam and Denmark’s long-term scenario modelling activities and supports the development of Việt Nam’s energy system in a more sustainable way through implementation of cost-optimised policy and planning.\nIn 2013, Việt Nam and Denmark entered into a long-term co-operation agreement for the purpose of strengthening Việt Nam’s transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe Danish Energy Agency co-operated with the Ministry of Industry and Trade in Việt Nam through the joint Energy Partnership Programme between the two countries (DEPP).\nThe programme is currently in its second phase and covers long-term scenario modelling of the energy sector, the integration of renewable energy in the power grid and energy efficiency in the industrial sector.\nThe first edition of the Việt Nam Energy Outlook Report was published in 2017. This year’s report has been taken to a new level, with an updated and enriched modelling and strengthened scenario analysis.\nIt is expected the Energy Outlook Report will continue to be published once every two years, ensuring that the newest data and model improvements are used to back up decisions and discussions on long-term energy planning in Việt Nam. — VNS'",2

It also provides reassurances for the publishing industry and the author.\nViệt Nam is not yet a party to the treaty, so people who can't read normal documents have difficulties in accessing literature works that were made public, he said.\nAccording to Catherine Phuong, Assistant Resident Representative of United Nations Development Programme Việt Nam, less than 1 per cent of published books in developing countries are accessible to people with print disabilities, a situation often referred to as a “book famine” which causes serious consequences.\nThe book famine can exclude persons with disabilities from access to education, employment, health care, culture and participation in political, economic and social activities. These factors contribute to the high rate of poverty among them.\nThe Marrakesh Treaty would help end book famine and realise the principle of “leaving no one behind” of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, she said.\nImproving access to published works in accessible formats would increasingly become a critical issue in Việt Nam, said Phạm Thi Hải Hà, deputy head of Department of Social Assistance under the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs.\nAccording to the latest census announced by the General Statistics Office of Việt Nam, 6.2 million people aged 2 years and above live with disability. Vision disabilities were found to be the most prevalent types of disability, accounting for 1.03 million.\nViệt Nam’s population is ageing very fast, which is likely to increase the number of the elderly with vision impairments and print disabilities.\nImproving accessibility for persons with disabilities, including with regards to information and knowledge, is an essential element for disability-inclusive societies and fulfilling the basic rights spelt out in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that Việt Nam is a party to, according to Hà.\nIn addition, improved access to knowledge could reduce the high poverty rate among the 73,000 members of the Viet Nam Blind Association, which is almost four times the national poverty rate of 5.8 per cent.\n“We believe that the Government of Việt Nam is committed to ratifying the Marrakesh Treaty within the next few years. We believe that the Government should put more efforts into discussing with the different ministries on how to push for this process and make sure that it happens as soon as possible,” Phuong told\xa0Việt Nam News.\nNguyễn Thanh Tâm, director of Hướng Dương Audio Books for the Blind, said braille books were essential for the blind.\n“The implementation of the Marrakesh Treaty doesn’t affect the right of authors but helps persons with print disabilities access knowledge and better integrate into the community,” he said.\nRegarding advantages when the country joined the treaty, Phạm Thanh Tùng from the Copyright Office of Việt Nam said Việt Nam’s Law on Intellectual Property already provided a specific exception for “transcription” of works into braille.\nHowever, he said, it was necessary to have experience sharing and technical support from foreign experts and organisations to ensure print disabled people could access published works. — VNS",1

Doctors told her that the job was suitable for her health condition.\nBut Khởi had had enough. She wanted to stop wasting her time and start pursuing her desire to do something for the environment while also earning a living.\nKhởi sold the 70sq.m of land her family owned to raise money to build a workshop in her hometown of\xa0Hưng Mỹ Commune.\nAnd that was that. For A Better World Development Investment JSC was born thanks to her passion for helping disabled people and love for the environment.\nFor A Better World focuses on using waste paper and old canisters to make eco-friendly handmade books for children aged between two and ten.\nLê Thị Khởi, founder of For A Better World, poses with a foreign delegate at an event to promote her handmade books. — Photos courtesy of Lê Thị Khởi\nKhởi and her team collect waste paper and canisters from neighbourhoods and schools. The paper is then transformed into eye-catching and durable handmade books.\nThe workers – mostly disadvantaged people - are in charge of classifying and recycling the paper. Khởi, together with two education experts, is in charge of the content, focusing on teaching kids the alphabet, the time, numbers, shapes and tips to keep the environment clean.\nIn just two years, the enterprise has produced 1,000 handmade books and created jobs for eight disabled people with a monthly income of between VNĐ 1-3.5 million (US$43-150).\nThe project was among the top ten start-up initiatives among 250 enterprises from across the country to participate in the Startup Incubation Programme organised by the Foreign Trade University this month. The project aimed to connect start-ups with potential investors.\nFrom trash to treasure\nKhởi said the world was facing more environmental challenges than ever, and the 21st century had already been dubbed the era of trash. Regardless, people had continued to litter.\n“I got in the habit of collecting waste for recycling in my hometown. They took plastic and metal waste, but ignored waste paper and old canisters they could have sold.”\nA child holds the first versions of handmade recycled books at the launch of For A Better World in 2017.\n“I know it takes a lot of investment to recycle waste paper and the profit is quite low. That’s why there are only a few companies operating in this area.”\nKhởi said many people shared her idea. Some produced toys from paper, but they quickly broke and had no value.\nHaving worked for two years as a part-time nanny for a British couple in Hà Nội, Khởi said she believed books would work.\n“Children can read books over and over again without getting bored like toys.”\nExplaining why she hired disabled people for her project, Khởi said her mother was disabled, but always trusted her and encouraged her to follow her dreams.\n“I believe I can make a change for the better with my business, and that I’m capable of finding solutions to improve the environment while making profit, and creating jobs for disadvantaged people.” — VNS\nPublic comments about books\nLê Hà Phương, a teacher at Phan Bội Châu Gifted High School in Nghệ An Province, said she bought four handmade books when she visited the workshop a year ago.\n“They were the first handmade versions produced by the workshop. When I saw disabled people making the books despite their problems, I decided to buy them.”\nPhương said her five-year-old daughter loved the books.\nAs a teacher, Phương said she was quite choosy about selecting books for her children. The handmade books brought her more than a book.\n“They are not like many mass-produced products on the market. They teach my daughter about the need to recycle paper and keep the environment clean, the skills to make a book, and empathy for disabled people who strive to make their lives better.”\nNguyễn Hồng Trang, general manager of Edubelife Finance Training JSC and a consultant for many start-up programmes, said: For a Better World was a humanitarian mission that had been recognised by NGOs, the US Embassy and the British Council.\nHowever, given the economic benefits, the model was not effective.\n“The project hires disabled people whose productivity is limited, and doesn’t apply technology, which leads to higher production costs.”\nTrang said the project was currently calling for investment.\n“This step is difficult. However, investment is not all about making a profit. There’re groups of investors who focus on the society and community.”\nTrần Quốc Thành, director of Nghệ An Province’s Department of Science and Technology, said the products were new on the market, but they should be handmade. — VNS'",4

Therefore, all textbooks in circulation must meet national standards, he said.\nYesterday, the NA deputies also discussed the Law on Architecture which aims to help the Government’s management work while orienting conservation efforts for national cultural values.\nMost deputies agreed there should be regulations which promoted Vietnamese culture, minimising the adoption of architecture from foreign countries, breaking the architectural landscape of the current history, culture and environment. However, the compiling committee should make it clear on characteristic culture of the country.\nRegarding to the granting of professional licence, the deputies reached a consensus on the need to authorise social and professional organisations to do the work.\nThey also urged further consideration for strengthening the state management in term of architecture, overcoming shortcomings in the administration of architecture, particularly in urban and rural areas. — VNS'",0

Senegalese Omar again received a ball from national defender Trần Văn Kiên and made no mistake to complete his double.\nFrench Kebe who signed his contract with Hà Nội last month marked his name on board one minute before the end of official time.\nQuyết, after much effort, found goals for himself in the 81st and 90th minutes.\nQuyết’s outstanding performance was under the eyes of national coach Park Hang-seo who is hunting players for his squads at the World Cup qualification and SEA Games later this year.\nIt was Quyết’s fourth goal in three matches.\nEarlier, Lâm Ti Phông’s corner kick was the only goal of the match between Sanna Khánh Hoà and SHB Đà Nẵng on Saturday.\nAt the 30th minute, Phông took charge of the kick from the left wing. His finish sent the ball curving past Đà Nẵng’s defenders and goalkeeper Thanh Bình to enter the net.\nFormer champions Đà Nẵng tried to find an equaliser but failed to beat Khánh Hoà’s concrete defence.\nIt was the hosts’ second win in a row and they renewed their hope of staying in the V.League 1 this season.\nKhánh Hoà are still bottom with 20 points, but they narrowed the gap to three points from their nearest rival, Hải Phòng FC, who tied with former winners Sông Lam Nghệ An 0-0 yesterday at the Vinh Stadium.\nAlso on Saturday, hosts Quảng Ninh and Nam Định shared one point each after their match ended goalless.\nTen-man Quảng Nam defeated HCM City 2-0 in a match where the referee gave the hosts a controversial penalty.\nPlaying without midfielder Văn Thuận, HCM City faced difficulties although managed to maintain balance against the hosts.\nThings changed in the added time of the first half.\nQuảng Nam’s Gabriel dos Santos broke through HCM City’s line-up. He was fouled by defender Ngô Tùng Quốc around the penalty area.\nReferee Nguyễn Đình Thái pointed to the spot and gave a penalty for Quảng Nam under strong objection of HCM City coaches and players who believed that the fault was made out of the box.\nHoàng Vũ Samson converted the penalty into the opener.\nQuảng Nam slowed down the pace of the match in the second half. But their defenders worked well to prevent HCM City from scoring even when midfielder Đức Lộc was sent off after his second yellow card at the 77th minute.\nHCM City conceded the second goal when Samson escaped from all eyes to take Hồng Sơn’s perfect pass and send it home.\nCoach Chung Hae Seong of HCM City through an interpreter said “it was not football” referring to the penalty that was the main cause of his team’s defeat.\nHowever, head of the Việt Nam Football Federation’s Referee Council Dương Văn Hiền said the penalty was the right decision. Santos made a mistake out of the box but he made another afterwards and deserved to be penalised.\nHCM City are still in second place on 35 points but the gap between leaders Hà Nội has been extended to five points.

Việt Nam’s fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2038.\n“Việt Nam has experienced strong aviation growth in the past five years, with air passengers increasing three-fold and a doubling of the airline fleet,” Hulst said.\n“Việt Nam is top in Southeast Asia in economic growth. Over the next six years, it’s forecast to gain annual GDP of more than 6 per cent, exceeding other countries in the region. With a middle-class growing faster than anywhere else in Southeast Asia, coupled with a strong international and domestic tourism sector, Viet Nam has become one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets,” he added.\nHe said Việt Nam received over 12 million foreign visitors in 2018 – this figure is expected to double in the next six years.\nThe GDP growth, a rapid expansion of the middle-class and a strong travel and tourism sector have expanded the size of the domestic Vietnamese aviation market four times from 800,000 monthly seats in 2009 to 3.3 million in 2019.\nHulst said single-aisle airplanes are expected to remain the foundation of domestic and regional fleets in the country, with monthly domestic flights within Việt Nam increasing 3.5 times in the last decade, growing from 5,340 monthly flights in 2009 to 18,680 monthly flights in 2019.\nDemand for wide-body airplanes is also driven by new long-haul expansion opportunities in Việt Nam. In 2018, there were about 50 new international city routes opened from Việt Nam with new wide-body aircraft, which will enable Vietnamese carriers in the future to fulfil two of the largest underserved markets from Việt Nam to North America such as HCM City to Los Angeles, and HCM City to San Francisco.\nHe said the country’s aviation sector is developing, so Boeing can provide long-term forecasting to help the industry set up corresponding infrastructure development. Boeing will also supply solutions to enhance the efficiency of the industry’s existing infrastructure, including runways.\n“In terms of supporting training in Southeast Asia, we see demand for over 200,000 aviation professionals in the next 20 years, including technicians and pilots,” Hulst said.\nWith the role of a supplier for aviation, Hulst said Boeing is interested in providing training for this industry, especially in science and technology with concrete training programmes for pilots and maintenance technicians, supporting and enhancing the industry’s growth in Việt Nam.\n“We want to partner with the aviation industry in Việt Nam, creating solutions and programmes so the industry can continue to grow. Because without that growth, we cannot grow,” he added.\nWorldwide, Boeing projects the need for 44,040 new commercial airplanes valued at $6.8 trillion and the demand for aftermarket services will total $9.1 trillion over the next 20 years. — VNS'",2

VNA/VNS Photo Dương Giang\nHÀ NỘI — A ceremony to announce the establishment of the National Action Centre for Toxic Chemicals and Environmental Treatment (NACCET) was held yesterday in Hà Nội.\nIn July, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc signed the decision to establish the NACCET.\nThe organisation will be responsible for running tasks to overcome the post war consequences of chemical toxins to environment and humans; handling pollution of toxic chemicals and hazardous substances, overcoming incidents of toxic chemicals and environment nationwide; and building and managing a database on overcoming post war consequences of toxic chemicals.\nHà Văn Cử, General Director of the NACCET, said while the war had ended long ago, its consequences remained.\n“Tackling post-war toxic chemicals and carrying out activities to ensure security and safety of the environment is an urgent and long-term task. It is both a humanitarian task and a task to ensure the sustainable and prosperous development of the country,” Cử said.\nIncidents like the recent mercury pollution and water safety issue in Ha Noi showed the increasing risk of chemical pollution, he said.\n“Threats to environmental security have been increasing in terms of scale and seriousness in the past year,” he said.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam emphasised the importance of establishing the NACCET.\n“There still remains a huge amount of dioxin-contaminated land in Việt Nam, millions of toxic chemicals in the soil, millions of people who suffered from dioxin contamination after the war. That’s a problem we need to deal with,” Đam said.\nHe also said that like many in other countries, environmental protection had been neglected for a while.\n“The need to address pollution and chemicals detoxification is urgent,” he said, adding that the establishment of the NACCET is timely.\nHe asked the centre leaders to focus on human resources and technology investment, while also calling on international organisations to support Việt Nam on the issue.\nSpeaking at the event, Caryn McClelland, deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in Hà Nội, said the US was committed to supporting the development of Việt Nam.\n“Last year, the USAID committed a funding of US$183 million for the initial five years of the dioxin remediation project at Biên Hoà Airport. This is the largest remaining hotspot of dioxin contamination in Việt Nam,” she said.\nWhile it would take Việt Nam and the US 10 years and up to $390 million to clean the Biên Hoà site, McClelland said US commitment was only increasing.\n“There have been zero UXO accidents in the last 20 months in the areas where we concentrate our efforts in Quảng Trị Province,” she said.\nOver the next five years, USAID has committed more than $65 million to work with the Ministry of Defence, Office 701 and the NACCET to implement the next phase of US’s support for persons with disabilities, according to the official.\nThe NACCET will also carry out research and technology transfer to help overcome post war consequences of toxic chemicals, handling pollution of toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, and toxic chemical incidents treatment.\nIt will be responsible for running programmes and working plans on overcoming post war consequences of toxic chemicals, as well as treating toxic chemicals, hazardous substances and overcoming incidents of toxic chemicals.\nThe Prime Minister assigned the Ministry of National Defence to be responsible for NACCET's activities.--VNS",1

VNA/VNS Photo Thống Nhất\nBUCHAREST — Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on Sunday held talks in Bucharest with his host Romanian PM Viorica Dancila during his official visit to the European country from April 14-16.\n\nThe two leaders expressed their joy at the fine development of bilateral relations,\xa0traditional friendship and multifaceted co-operation over the past 70 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1950.\nThe Romanian leader highlighted the importance of her country's\xa0relations with Việt Nam and stressed that the ongoing visit by PM Phúc was an important milestone in their bilateral ties.\nShe also spoke highly of Việt Nam’s socio-economic achievements and rising role in the region and the world.\n\nThe two leaders exchanged ideas on measures to push bilateral relations in fields of great potential like politics, diplomacy, security and national defence, economy, trade, investment, education and training, labour, culture, tourism, agriculture and food processing.\nThey spoke highly of the co-operation between the countries’ localities and said it paved the way for\xa0traditional co-operation between the two sides.\n\nThe PMs agreed to increase the exchange of high-level delegations and effectively implement existing bilateral co-operation mechanisms. The two sides should make active preparations for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations.\n\nThe host PM said the Vietnamese community in Romania was small but trustworthy and integrating well, making contributions to the socio-economic development of the host country. Meanwhile, PM Phúc thanked his host and the Romanian Government for supporting the community.\n\nBesides bilateral issues, the two PMs also exchanged ideas on international and regional issues of mutual concern, sharing a\xa0vision on and commitments to the acceleration of bilateral co-operation at international forums and organisations.\nThey emphasised the importance of the maintenance of peace, security and stability for co-operation and development;\xa0and the solution of differences and disputes by peaceful means in line with the international law, the charter of the United Nations and the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nPM Phúc invited the Romanian PM to pay an official visit to Việt Nam. The invitation was accepted and will be arranged at a convenient time.\n\nFollowing the talks, the two leaders witnessed the signing of a co-operation memorandum of understanding on agriculture, animal health and food safety, and chaired a joint press conference on the outcome of their talks.\nBusiness forum\nAddressing the Việt Nam-Romania business forum in Bucharest the same day, PM Phúc called for a breakthrough in bilateral economic, trade and investment ties.\n\nSpeaking before hundreds of business delegates and investors, the PM said despite annual growth, the two-way trade, which stood at US$218 million last year, remained\xa0modest compared to their potential.\n\nWhile the two governments had\xa0worked to improve the business climate, firms themselves must strive to expand their scale and adopt new ways of doing business, he said.\n\nViệt Nam’s membership in 12 free trade agreements and the European Union-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) in the near future would\xa0open up opportunities for both sides to boost ties, he said.\nHe also took the occasion to urge the two countries’ chambers of commerce and industry to step up ties between firms.\n\nHighlighting Việt Nam’s advantages in foreign direct investment attraction, he particularly underlined socio-political stability, improved competitiveness and innovation, a 100 million population and the goal of attracting 50 million tourists.\n\nThe Government leader asked the Romanian enterprises to\xa0push for the signing and ratification of the EVFTA. He suggested the two sides enhance science-technology collaboration, launch direct flights, and facilitate\xa0imports of quality farm produce and pharmaceuticals.\n\nRomanian business representatives responded by asking\xa0the two governments to\xa0facilitate co-operation opportunities, especially in labour exports, industry, culture and education. They expressed willingness to partner with Vietnamese firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.\nEarlier on Saturday (local time), PM Phúc paid a visit to Prahova, home to the most\xa0dynamic economic development in Romania.\nAt a working session with Prahova’s governor Ioana Madalina Lupea, the Vietnamese PM highlighted the ties forged\xa0between several pairs of localities in\xa0the two countries, such as the memorandum of understanding signed between Hòa Bình and Prahova, Bến Tre and Tulchea, Đà Nẵng and Timisoara, and Lào Cai and Hunedoara.\nPhúc said there was great potential for co-operation between Prahova and Vietnamese provinces, particularly in fields in which the Romanian locality was strong in, such as tourism, education-training, oil and gas, agriculture and forestries, which coincide with the priorities in Việt Nam’s co-operation deal with Romania.\nGovernor Ioana Madalina Lupea welcomed the Vietnamese PM to the county, and informed her guest that the county’s authorities had\xa0co-ordinated with the Chamber of Commerce and the Vietnamese Embassy in Romania to organise business workshops and meetings to introduce Prahova’s strengths and opportunities for economic, tourism\xa0education partnerships, as well as cultural exchanges with\xa0Vietnamese firms and localities.\nShe said Prahova wanted to expand its co-operation with Vietnamese localities.\nAlso on Saturday, Phúc and his entourage had a meeting with representatives from the Vietnamese community in Romania and the staff of the Vietnamese Embassy in Bucharest. — VNS",0

Of which, three are under public investment while eight are up for the PPP model. The transport ministry has estimated the cost for all projects at VNĐ118 trillion (US$5.1 billion). — VNS'",2

The paintings are also inlaid with crushed egg shells, gold, silver and other materials.\nOver the past 80 years, Vietnamese\xa0lacquer\xa0masters have reached milestones in developing traditional crafts towards artistic creativity.\nSơn was a pioneer of the young artist movement in the 1980s, while Chiến does not want to be involved any movement.\n“They met in thought and art is a pure activity decided by their character,” said art critic\xa0Phan Cẩm Thượng.\n“To them, sơn mài is merely a means but a traditional means adept at expressing one’s cultural identity.”\nSơn's Quê Ngoại (Mother Homeland) is a three-piece painting which measures 108cm by 180cm for each piece. The painting is the largest and perhaps most outstanding at the exhibition\nThree-piece painting Quê Ngoại (Mother\xa0Homland) by Lý Trực Sơn. —\xa0Photos Nguyễn Bình\nIt features a peaceful rural scene with a mother and her child,\xa0a buffalo,\xa0a banana tree, a\xa0river and a rainbow.\nAnother painting by Sơn entitled Vô Đề (Untitled) is also a set of five pieces. The pieces are made by traditional lacquer resin.\nUntitled paintings are abstract and coloured\xa0black and blue. The exhibition is a chance for Sơn to debut\xa0the paintings which he created\xa0this year.\n“These paintings are difficult to understand,” said artist Nguyễn Quốc Huy at the exhibition's opening ceremony last Thursday. “Even for\xa0professionals, the paintings are very distinctive in shaping art and composition.\n“Currently, Sơn is creative in space and shape which are irreducible. Untitled is inlaid with only a few crushed egg shells. I think Vietnamese lacquer painting is special because of metal materials such as gold and silver.”\nThe\xa0paintings are focused in terms of the idea and efficiency to limit the process of turning lacquer into crafts, according to Sơn.\nHe thinks lacquer is inherently beautiful, making it easy for an artist to cover their weaknesses, and he wants to turn this situation around to show it naked and save beauty for later.\n“Through my paintings, people will feel my point of view,” said Sơn. “Untitled will take the viewers to gloomy and sombre landscape to experiment by themselves and discover something strange.”\nChiến is one of Sơn’s students at the Việt Nam Fine Arts University. He has 14 paintings displayed at the exhibition.\nHis paintings\xa0such as Cá Đùa Dưới Trăng (Fish Plays Under Moonlight); Bà Mẹ Vĩ Đại (Great Mother) and Đức Phật Ngủ (Sleeping Buddha) honour Buddha, women and beauty.\n“Women sacrifice\xa0their careers and beauty to focus on motherhood,” Chiến said about Bà Mẹ Vĩ Đại.\n“Although life brings many difficulties, challenges and sadness, it is beautiful to me,” he said. “I always try to express the beauty of\xa0life in my paintings.”\nChiến doesn’t want his paintings to become a fine arts handicraft nor does he to repeat traditional lacquer’s glossy, deep and sparkling effects.\nIn his Buddha-themed paintings, he traces and divides the lacquer plate to make miniature paintings within\xa0the whole painting.\nLotus by Trịnh Quốc Chiến.\nHis paintings show that he profoundly changes the traditional way of lacquer but still keeps the ancient beauty in feeling and splendor, rather than form.\nThe exhibition runs until September 25 at 66 Nguyễn Thái Học Street. — VNS",5

The fruits are harvested two or three times a year, and the average annual yield is 40 – 50 tonnes per hectare.\nAt the current price of VNĐ10,000 per kilogramme, the annual income per hectare is VNĐ400 – 500 million (US$17,300 – 21,600), according to farmers.\nNguyễn Thi, who has a 2,000sq.m orchard in Ninh Phước District’s Phước Dân Town, said he harvested nine tonnes in the last crop and earned VNĐ70 million ($3,000).\nTraders came to his farm and bought the fruit at VNĐ8,000 – 12,000 per kilogramme, he said.\nThe initial cost of farming 1,000sq.m of jujubes is around VNĐ25 million ($1,080), including the cost of seedlings and input materials.\nThe province has 1,020ha under the fruit, mostly in Ninh Phước, Ninh Sơn and Ninh Hải districts and Phan Rang – Tháp Chàm City.\nIt plans to increase this to 1,200ha next year and annual output to 54,000 tonnes, according to its Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\nPhạm Dũng, head of the province’s Plant Cultivation and Protection Sub-department, said value chains comprising co-operatives and co-operative groups are being developed.\nThe province is also zoning areas that grow the fruit to Vietnamese good agricultural practices (VietGAP) or organic standards, he said.\nMany farmers use nets to cover their orchards during their fruiting period to protect them from pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly, or Medfly.\nThe insect causes severe damage to jujubes by laying eggs in them. When the eggs develop into larvae, they eat the fruits.\nBesides controlling pests, the nets also protect the fruits from strong winds, rains and sunshine.\nThe quality of jujubes in net-covered orchards is vastly superior since farmers are not afraid of pests and let them ripen properly on the tree before harvesting them.\nThe department in co-operation with localities encourages farmers to adopt this technique and transfers techniques to farmers for growing Táo Bom NT 05, a new jujube variety.\nThe variety, created by the province’s Nha Hố Research Institute for Cotton and Agriculture Development, is green when ripe, crunchy and two to three times larger than other varieties.\nTo diversify jujube products, the province has support policies for businesses producing syrups, jams, wines, and juices.\nIt is developing a tourism model that involves visits to jujube orchards, which will also enable farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers and get extra incomes from providing tourism services.\nThe province has identified the fruit as one of its 12 key products. – VNS'",1

4493,'French photographer tells stories of street tea in Hà Nội',"27-year-old French photographer\xa0Joseph Gobin has been inspired by\xa0modest iced tea stalls on the street of Hà Nội to create his photo collection. — Photo courtesy of Mai Suong\nLương Thu Hương\nVibrant Hà Nội has charmed many foreigners with its various unexpected aspects, and Frenchman Joseph Gobin is just the latest example.\nModest iced tea stalls on the streets of the capital\xa0have become the subjects of his recent project.\nGobin’s photos capture\xa0the similar moments and objects in every iced tea stall in Hà Nội that are normally unnoticed, like an iced tea stall covered with a shabby canvas at night, a pitcher placed by the wall, a close-up of a lighter placed on a plastic chair or the smiling but pensive faces of the customers.\nHis works are on display at the exhibition Another City: Public, Private, Secret at the French cultural institute L’Espace in Hà Nội. The exhibition will last until the end of December.\nA freelance photographer collaborating with local newspapers and enterprises in France, Gobin was selected to participate in the\xa0Monde Académie programme organised by prestigious French newspaper Le Monde in 2012 to conduct photo essays for a year.\xa0His works won the EDF/Le Monde award by the newspaper in 2013.\nGobin’s photographic work focuses mainly on\xa0transmission – how are goods, habits, knowledge and memory are passed from one person to another.\nThe 27-year-old artist has been to so many countries that he has lost count, and Việt Nam was the eighth Asian countrie\xa0that he set foot in. He first visited the country in 2013 and has been living in Hà Nội\xa0since 2016.\nOn his very first day in the capital city, he found something special about the gathering spots\xa0at many street corners.\n“The scene of the tea stalls temporarily set up on the pavements, separated from the bustling life of a fast growing city, aroused much interest and curiosity in me,” Gobin said.\n“No matter how developed and changed Hà Nội has become, iced tea stalls still retain their original features and charms,” he added.\nThe French photographer then decided to come closer to such spaces and became a regular customer\xa0of 15 iced tea stalls in the city. Frequent visits to the stalls and chats with locals there helped him discover why such humble drinks and spaces\xa0charm Hanoians from all walks of life.\nHe discovered\xa0that such spaces without any walls and\xa0located right next to the noisy busy streets\xa0still offer privacy and at the same time, offer bonds between strangers.\nGobin also frequently joined the conversations among the customers who were curious about the appearance of a foreigner in a space that seems\xa0dedicated to Vietnamese only.\n“I was frequently asked similar questions in Vietnamese like 'where do you come from?', 'do you have a wife?'\xa0or 'how much money do you get a month?'\xa0again and again. They are really good places to practice Vietnamese as well,” he recalled.\nGobin didn't aim to take normal photos of iced tea stalls, but to use faded colours to make it seem as if the photos had been taken in the past.\nTherefore, he experimented shooting with five outdated rolls of films, taken with a Hasselbald 500C/M, for the project. The final results are pictures with faded colours, making them look like paintings rather than photos.\nHowever, it took Gobin months to get satisfactory photos with such old film rolls.\n“One of the difficulties was the light. I normally shot in the afternoon when there was much light and few clouds. Sometimes I arrived at 12 when the sun was really high.\n“Sometimes the difficulties came from the stall itself. When I found a stall with a good location, I intended to come back at four when there was good light. The next day I came back at four and the stall was not there anymore,” he recalled. “And drinking too much tea sometimes made my hands shake,” he added with a smile.\nBesides the photos of street tea in Hà Nội, the French photographer has also conducted two other photo essays\xa0in the city – Phố Đi Bộ (The Walking Street) which was made at the beginning of the street, focusing on the kids, and High Value Vegetables, which he took photos of the citizens who plant vegetables on the rooftop of their houses.\n“Documentary (photo essay) is my favourite photographic style. I want to create the information inside the photos to make the audience to find their own story and think more than just look at the picture and feel the obvious,” he said.\nPresently, Gobin is working on a project entitled Vàng Mã (Votive Paper), which he wanted to capture what people send to the other world like motorbikes or fashionable Louis Vuitton items. The project will be finished at the end of the year.\nMore of Gobin’s works can be seen at josephgobin.com. — VNS\nTo create the special colour effect for the photos, Gobin\xa0experimented shooting with five outdated rolls of films, taken by a Hasselbald 500cm.",5

Taking this opportunity, I would like to share my ideas on how to develop Korea-Việt Nam relations during my term.\nSince the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992, Việt Nam and Korea have developed their relationship in a mutually prosperous way to upgrade their ties to a Strategic Cooperative Partnership in 2009.\nAs of 2018, bilateral trade had reached US$68.3 billion, Korea’s investment in Việt Nam totalled US$62.5 billion, and people-to-people exchanges amounted to 4 million, which all demonstrate the close relationship between Việt Nam and Korea.\nUnderpinned by this strong partnership, Việt Nam and Korea will work together to jointly respond to global political and economic uncertainties and seek strategic co-operation in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the areas of science, information and communications technology (ICT), smart cities\xa0and healthcare.\nThe two countries will focus on establishing a win-win co-operative framework to ensure that Việt Nam achieves industrial self-reliance while Korea’s component and material-related industries find new business opportunities in Việt Nam.\nA Consulate General of the Republic of Korea is scheduled to open in Đà Nẵng at end of this year. I would like to consult with relevant stakeholders on how to help Korean businesses advance into the central region of Việt Nam, which will contribute to Việt Nam’s development strategy towards a more balanced nation.\nIn this vein, the Korea-Việt Nam Business Summit to be held on November 9\xa0in Quảng Nam Province will serve as a good starting point for both sides to discuss ways to co-operate in the central region of Việt Nam.\nWith a growing number of exchanges between the two countries, we are witnessing deepening\xa0mutual understanding. More efforts will be made to build a sound and healthy people-to-people exchange atmosphere as part of efforts to minimise any side effects that might occur in the process.\nTo this end, we will exert further efforts to ensure two-way cultural exchange focusing on mutual understanding and continue to improve visa services for the convenience of Vietnamese people travelling to Korea.\nI will also strive to expand and deepen our co-operation in politics, security and defence. I believe this will lay the groundwork for elevating our bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive and Strategic Cooperative Partnership\xa0on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Korea and Việt Nam in 2022.\nIt is expected that Việt Nam will continue to play a valuable and constructive role in facilitating peace on the Korean Peninsula and denuclearisation as it has done by hosting the second Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)-United States Summit in February 2019.\nK-POP LOVERS FESTIVAL: Fans try to catch a glimpse of the annual K-POP dance competition winners.\nViệt Nam will serve as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year as well as a non-permanent United Nations Security Council member from 2020 to 2021. This participation will raise Việt Nam’s status in the international community, and Korea will support Việt Nam’s efforts by working closely\xa0in regional and international arenas.\nThe 2019 ASEAN-Republic of KOREA Commemorative Summit and the 1st Mekong-ROK Summit, which will take place in Busan from November 25-27,\xa0will\xa0provide a great opportunity to that end.\nThe ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit will mark the largest international conference since Korean President Moon Jae-in took office. All the leaders of the ten ASEAN nations are expected to attend. — VNS",5

Everyday, they publish around 200 news stories, photos and video clips on the OANA website at http://www.oananews.org\n\nThe annual OANA Executive Board Meeting is held rotationally by Executive Board members. It offers a chance for delegates to share experience in organisation and development of news agencies, get updated on global press development trends, and discuss measures to consolidate cooperation between the agencies.\n\nSince joining the OANA in 1969, the VNA has proven itself as one of the active members of the organisation. The agency was elected to the OANA Executive Board for two consecutive terms, with each lasting for three years.\n\nThe VNA hosted the OANA Executive Board Meeting in 1989, 1999 and 2005, actively contributing to completing the organisation’s targets.\n\nFrom June 17-18, 1989, the agency organised the 10th OANA Executive Board Meeting, the 10th Technical Group Meeting and the sixth Editorial Workshop.\n\nOpening the 10th OANA Executive Board Meeting, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nguyễn Khánh highlighted the important role of information and communication in relations between individuals and collectives in each country, as well as in the development of friendship and cooperation between countries.\n\nThe delegates adopted a review report of the meeting and an action programme for the OANA in 1990. The programme aimed at enhancing cooperation between regional news agencies, improving OANA news quality on the ANN in terms of both content and technology, expanding the exchange of news and training, and establishing international order in information and communication.\n\nThe 20th OANA Executive Board Meeting in Hà Nội on October 26-27, 1999, saw the participation of 29 delegates representing nine out of the 11 members of the OANA Executive Board.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Deputy Prime Minister Phạm Gia Khiêm said the coming into being and existence of the OANA has signaled efforts by journalists to contribute to equal integration, cooperation and friendship between countries, for regional peace, friendship, security and development.\n\nThe Vietnamese Government highly values the support and endeavours of the OANA member agencies, he said.\n\nThe delegates agreed on the need to reform the news agencies to raise their competiveness in the new context and improve the efficiency of collaboration between the agencies, especially in professionalism and technical skills.\n\nThe 27th OANA Executive Board Meeting and the 21st meeting of the Editorial and Technical Experts Group took place in Hà Nội on October 3, 2005.\n\nAddressing the event, Deputy PM Khiêm stressed the importance of information and of the OANA member news agencies, explaining that information is a tool that serves the governance and management of each nation, an effective equipment to expand exchanges and increase mutual understanding between countries, a source of knowledge for the public and resources for socio-economic development.\n\nParticipants agreed on the necessity of studying measures to spread information quickly to the public when natural disasters occur while applying advanced technology to diversify services.\n\nThey also touched upon challenges posed by the mushrooming of websites and increasing number of internet users. Given that, news agencies need to maintain the speed, accuracy and reliability of information.\n\nWith the role of a “State news bank”, the VNA performs its function as the State news agency and provides official and mainstream news for its partners at home and abroad via 15 news departments of domestic and foreign service.\n\nBoasting a network of 63 bureaus in all the cities and provinces nationwide and 30 overseas bureaus across the five continents, the VNA has a strong contingent of reporters and editors working all over the country and in most of the key locations around the world, which creates a unique advantage for it.\n\nWith more than 60 media products by more than 1,300 reporters and editors out of its 2,500-strong staff, the VNA is now the media office having the largest number of products and forms in the country: bulletins, photos, television programmes, dailies, weeklies, monthlies, magazines, pictorials, books, TV channel, e-newspapers and information programmes on mobile platforms.\n\nThe agency also delivers news in the largest number of languages. In addition to official Vietnamese-language news provided for domestic and foreign media outlets, stories for foreign services are written in English, Chinese, French and Spanish, not to mention print and e-newspapers in 10 languages: Vietnamese, Lao, Khmer, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, English, French and Spanish.\n\nThe VNA has bilateral and multilateral partnership with more than 40 international news agencies and press organisations in the world and is a member of the Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA).\n\nThe agency’s official news is widely published on communication channels of its partners, contributing to improving the effectiveness of disseminating Việt Nam’s external information to international friends.\nKeeping up with journalism trend\nDeputy General Director of Vietnam News Agency (VNA) Vũ Việt Trang said during OANA’s annual executive board meetings and triennial General Assembly meetings, delegates will discuss experience in dealing with issues faced by contemporary press, the possibility of cooperation with press organisations in other regions, and the establishment of new cooperation mechanisms.\n\nFor example, the issue of artificial intelligence (AI) has been tabled for discussion since the 40th executive board’s meeting and will be looked into during the 44th meeting.\n\nAnother item on the upcoming meeting is fake news, which has been mentioned for several recent meetings. At the 44th meeting, leaders of news agencies will look into measures and tools to verify information amid the prevalence of fake news at present, she said, adding that it was proposed by VNA and VNA Deputy General Director Lê Quốc Minh will chair a session on the issue.\n\nAnother session on strategies to adapt to the switch amongst media consumers to videos and YouTube clips will be also held.\n\nTrang said with over 4 billion Internet users out of a 7.7 billion world population, the majority of the public now access information through the internet, and at the same time, they are also suppliers of news online so there will be a competition between news agencies and their traditional clients.\n\nIn order to win the race, news agencies need to maintain professionalism with timely coverage of correct and objective news verified by competent authorities, which is a difference between genuine press products and unverified information and personal opinions online.\nMeanwhile, an innovative journalism will attract the public. News agencies, including VNA recently adopted technology to produce new media products such as long-form articles that combine text, photos, audio and video clips.\xa0 — VNS'",0

People can and must do more to prevent plastics from polluting the oceans,” she said.\nShe called on everyone to play a role by reusing plastic bags, separating food waste from other garbage, and rejecting the use of plastic cups and straws at restaurants and plastic bags at supermarkets.\nChallenges\nViệt Nam\xa0dumps 1.8 million tonnes of\xa0plastic waste into\xa0the\xa0ocean\xa0each year, according to Quách Thị Xuân, director of the Đà Nẵng Consultancy on Sustainable Development Centre and a co-founder of Vietnam Zero Waste Alliance (VZWA).\nChina, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Việt Nam are the main sources of about 60 per cent of plastic waste entering the oceans, according to research.\nThe waste piles up on beaches and is taken into the ocean by tides, resulting in between 4.8 million and 12.7 million metric tons of plastic floating in the ocean in 2010.\n“Everyone uses several plastic products so we need efforts from the entire community to address the problem,” Xuân said.\nVZWA’s solutions focus on a “zero waste movement”, which calls for eliminating waste sent to dumps, minimizing waste that needs to be recycled, and turning waste into a useful product such as compost for fertilizer.\nShe emphasised the five Rs: refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and redesign.\nReports have documented that more than 180 animal species have eaten or absorbed plastic in their bodies, mostly birds, fish, turtles and marine animals, according to Nguyễn Thị Hoài Linh, the country manager for Environmental Development Action in the Third World (ENDA) Việt Nam.\nPlastic waste, which also occurs in canals and sewers, causes foul odours and emits methane gas. It can also act as a disease vector.\nLinh said that the public must be better educated about the need for waste separation at source and the harm of plastic waste.\nShe urged the government to work with independent waste collectors as well as the private sector on plastic recycling solutions.\n“However, waste sorting at source is the biggest challenge because it needs a change of thought and behaviour among the public. Behavior change always needs a long time,” she said.\nViệt Nam still lacks sufficient regulations on plastic waste and policies that call for investment in plastic recycling companies, she said.\nLinh said policymakers should revise or issue rules on solid waste collection systems from the national to community level.\nHCM City dumps about 250,000 tonnes of plastic waste each year, including 48,000 tonnes at landfills, while other kinds of waste are either recycled or released into the environment, according to a report of the city’s Department of Natural Resources and Environment.\nIf 48,000 tonnes of plastic were recycled each year, the city could save about VNĐ15 billion (US$658,640), it said.\nThanks to prodding from NGOs, some governments in Asia are taking action.\nFor example, Indonesia has committed to reduce plastic waste to a certain level, while Sri Lanka has banned the use of single-use plastic\xa0items like shopping bags.\nAt the workshop, Dr David Saiia, CEO of the US-based Reuse Everything Institution Inc. (REII), described the use of ultra-high technology used in a REII-developed machine that solidifies standard 500ml plastic bottles into composite plastic building bricks.\nHe said that the technology would give reuse entrepreneurs another product to sell and help them become more efficient in what they collect. — VNS'",4

4234,'VN seeks to boost environmentally friendly brick production',"'Conventional brickyards in Hàm Yên District in the northern province of Tuyên Quang. — VNA/VNS Photo Quang Đán\nHÀ NỘI — Province and city authorities have been told to stop investment in fired clay brick production and to prioritise investment in other environmentally friendly construction materials.\nThe order was one of the highlights of a recent official paper issued by the Deputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng. The paper followed a month of study and the consideration of feedback at a national conference on the development of construction materials held in mid-December.\nIt is estimated that in 2020, Việt\nNam\ncould need as many as 42 billion bricks for construction works. In the next 10 years, the total output could reach 330 billion clay bricks, requiring up to 40 million tonnes of coal to process. The brick production will release into the atmosphere 148 tonnes of green house gases amongst other pollutants. The unfired counterpart, however, don’t have such a large environmental footprint, as they don’t require the use of natural clay or\xa0burning of fossil fuels.\nViệt\nNam\n’s rapid economic growth continues to generate enormous demands for infrastructure. The cost of construction materials alone takes up 30-50 per cent of the total budget for infrastructure investment. There are also the hidden costs stemming from the environmental impacts at every step of the materials’ ‘life cycle’: mineral mining, manufacturing, construction, use and demolition.\nTherefore, “developing sustainable material construction will bring beneficial contributions to socio-economic development,” the paper says.\nThe new order to contain the expansion of conventional fired bricks comes seven years after a programme (Decision No 567/QĐ-TTg) aiming at encouraging the production and use of unfired materials was launched in 2010 with a vision towards 2020.\nThe programme aimed to substitute at least 20-25 per cent of fired clay materials with unfired variants by 2015 and 30-40 per cent by 2020. The construction ministry’s data showed that in 2017, the country produced some seven billion standardised unfired bricks, or 28 per cent of the total bricks produced.\nWhile the first-phase target was achieved, construction authorities said the latter target might be elusive for several reasons. The unfired bricks are relatively more expensive, the public retains a cautious attitude towards new products and enforcement is weak, the\xa0Vietnam News Agency\xa0reported.\nPhạm Văn Bắc, head of construction materials department under the Ministry of Construction, said that the raw materials to produce unfired bricks are ash, slag, plaster, stones and other industrial and construction wastes, which are all easily accessible due to the country’s ongoing modernisation and industrialisation process.\nTowards the end of 2017, 40 million tonnes of ash and flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD), a byproduct of the desulphurization process in coal burning plants, remain unhandled in the country. Another 15 million tonnes are expected to be added to this figure annually. But expanding unfired brick production could chip away at the waste.\n“If this enormous amount of waste is not properly handled, it will be a burden on the environment as vast tracts of land would be needed to store [it]. However, this waste would be a boon to the production of unfired bricks. Two birds with one stone,” Nguyễn Minh Tuấn, deputy general director of Viglacera, a State-controlled construction materials company that has received praise from the government for its efforts in pioneering unfired materials, told\xa0Thời báo tài chính Việt Nam online newspaper.\nDeputy PM Trịnh Đình Dũng has asked all relevant ministries and State agencies to thoroughly review the implementation of the 2010 programme and to make appropriate amendments to State management regulations to help the programme achieve its targets.\nThe Ministry of Construction has been told to work with the Ministry of Science and Technology in develop new building materials that are affordable, high quality and “green, consistent with climate change adaptation policies.”\nDeputy PM Dũng also ordered environment agencies to boost inspection and monitoring of mineral extraction, especially sand mining near estuaries, an activity that has drawn public criticism over its environmental impacts.\nThe report also asks for the quick completion of several plans to be submitted to the Prime Minister. The plans include one on developing the cement production industry in Việt Nam, an accompanying master plan on surveying, processing and using mineral natural resources to produce cement, and a project to develop construction materials for use in coastal and island areas.\nThe Ministry of Finance shall review and amend policies on natural resource taxes, export taxes and environment protection fees to ensure the sustainable development of construction materials; to craft incentives to encourage businesses to reduce the use of mineral resources and instead use materials from waste and new green materials. — VNS'",4

VNS Photo Gia Lộc\nHCM CITY— Housing development is of paramount importance to HCM City as the city is expected to see an increase of one million people every five years in the 2021-35 period, according to Võ Văn Hoan, vice chairman of the city People’s Committee.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a conference on housing solutions held yesterday in HCM City, Hoan said that housing development should correspond with economic growth and transport infrastructure development in the southern economic zone and southwestern and eastern regions.\n“More attention should be paid to low-income people,” he said, adding that many commercially housing projects had been carried out.\n""The city needs more apartment buildings with parks and entertainment areas that are important for residents’ life,"" he said.\n“Housing quality should be high for low-income people also,” Hoan said.\nCity authorities plan to call on the private sector to invest in low-income housing, according to Hoan.\nThe committee is also working with the city’s Department of Construction to review and amend policies to create favourable conditions for enterprises to invest in such housing and for residents to be able to buy them.\nThe city has 1.9 million units of housing (including apartments) covering 182 million square metres.\nWithin the 2016-2020 period, the city aims to build an additional 40 million sq m of floor space, raising the average housing area per person to 19.8 sq m by 2020 from 17.32 sq m per person in 2015.\nAs of June, the average housing area per person was 19.9 square metres.\nCommercial housing projects, social housing, and buildings for workers and dormitories for students are all part of the city’s housing stock.\nThe department forecasts that the city will need 45 million square metres of floor space between 2021 and 2025.\nLê Hoàng Châu, chairman of the HCM City Real Estate Association, said: “The city’s biggest and most difficult problem is to solve housing needs for a large number of low-income and middle-income people, including state officials, students, workers, and migrants, to ensure social welfare and sustainable development.”\nThe city has nearly 476,000 households who do not own their own homes and live with relatives, accounting for 25 per cent of its total. Of the 476,000 households, more than 20,000 live on and near canals and 35,000 in old apartment buildings that need to be improved.\nMany of them buy apartments in social housing projects which they can buy on hire-purchase or buy units in commercial housing valued up to VNĐ1 billion (US$43,049). They also need to rent apartments at inexpensive prices.\nLê Hữu Nghĩa, general director of Lê Thành Real Estate Company, said that red tape was the barrier for real estate companies to invest in social housing projects.\nHis company, for instance, applied for approval for a new social housing project in Bình Chánh District in March, but the application has not been submitted to the city’s People’s Committee.\n“It could take five years to complete legal procedures for the implementation of the project,” Nghĩa said.\nThe Government should develop separate policies for approval of\xa0social housing projects and commercial housing projects, he said.\nYap Kioe Sheng of the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand said that cities in developing countries were growing rapidly as a result of natural growth due to relatively young populations and of rural-urban migration triggered by urban economic growth and rise of economic opportunities in cities.\n“The challenge for those cities is to see that the growing population is adequately housed,” Sheng said.\nAn urban housing policy needs to deal with the housing demand of both the local population, particularly low- and middle-income, and migrants, and the demand for both homeownership and rental housing, according to Sheng.\n“Given the diversity in demand from the low-income population, it is necessary to diversify the supply of affordable housing in terms of house type, location, tenure, adaptability and financing,” he said.\nEach of the locations should offer one or more housing types, Sheng said.\n“Such a diverse low-income housing programme is a complex operation which cannot be implemented by the public sector or the private sector on its own,” he added.

AFP Photo\nPaul Kennedy\nIf you blinked\xa0last week you may well have missed something pretty shocking that happened to former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge.\nThe 29-year-old was banned from football for six weeks and fined a little over US$90,000 after he was found guilty of two charges of breaching FA betting rules.\nHe was convicted of passing on information to help his brother to make bets.\nSturridge told his brother to place large sums of money on the club he would be moving to.\nHe originally faced nine other similar charges, but was only found guilty of two.\nAs for his sentence, I’ve no doubt the former Chelsea and Manchester City forward breathed a huge sigh of relief when it was passed.\nYes, he\'s been banned from playing football for six weeks, but four of those were suspended.\nAnd as the season doesn’t start for two weeks, Sturridge won’t miss a single minute of action, should he find himself a new club before the end of the current transfer window.\nHe was fined as well, a pretty large amount, but for a man of his wealth it was the type of cash he wouldn’t really notice disappearing from his bank account.\nSince the sentence was passed, other people in football have come out, and rightly in my opinion, said his punishment was far too lenient.\nI find Sturridge a strange character.\nFrom a football point of view, he is, or rather was, undoubtedly very talented, but Liverpool supporters, myself included, never really warmed to him.\nOn the pitch, he formed a devastating partnership with Luis Suarez, but it was always the Uruguayan who got the love.\nThis could have been something to do with the fact he played many times for Chelsea, Liverpool’s bitterest of rivals, and to a lesser extent, City.\nOr maybe it was more because he always seemed very fragile and spent far too much time on the treatment table instead of the pitch.\nLast season when he needed to step up he never really delivered, except on one occasion when he scored a late equiliser for the Reds against, of all teams, Chelsea.\nHe had chances in cup competitions but did little and I got the distinct impression he found himself with his nose pushed out of joint because he had dropped so far down the pecking order in Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool team.\nBut for me that is Sturridge all over.\nHe seems aloof, almost to the point of being sulky, reminding me of a teenage boy who gets miffed when he doesn’t get his own way.\nHe\'s maybe a little arrogant as well, and him leaving Liverpool at the end of this season is no great loss.\nAfter he was sentenced for breaching gambling rules Sturridge issued a statement in which he said the past 15 months have been ""extremely tough"".\nMaybe that’s why his performances dipped on the pitch, but what I can’t work out for the life of me is why on Earth did he do what he did?\nHe must have known that if he was caught, he would be in trouble. It’s just something you can’t do.\nAnd to send messages via WhatApp to his brother telling him to put money on his potential transfers leaves a digital paper trail.\nHe was either really, really stupid or just thought he wouldn’t be found out.\nWell sorry Dan, you were.\nAnd now the Football Association is planning on appealing his sentence because they too think he got off too lightly.\nCould he end up getting his ban increased? I wouldn’t bet against it.'",3

The investigation was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Foreign Trade Management, the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement and related regulations.\n“There are sufficient grounds to issue a decision on the application of anti-dumping measures.

1989,'Law on Public Private Partnerships - a breakthrough in investment',"Professor Trần Chủng\nProfessor Trần Chủng, Chairman of the Việt Nam Association of Financial Investors, talks to Hải Quan newspaper about advantages the Law on Public Private Partnerships will offer investors.\nWhat will be the main\xa0advantages of the Law on\xa0Public Private Partnerships when it comes into force?\nInvestors hope\xa0the Law on Public Private Partnership\xa0(PPP Law) will provide a level playing field for all investors, regardless of their social status.\nThey also hope the law will reduce risks that might occur for\xa0project investors. The\xa0nature of a PPP project is\xa0shared\xa0risks between the State and the private sector.\nIt is common knowledge that most of our investment projects in road construction have faced many risks, as the projects' returns\xa0budget depend\xa0on the volume of vehicles using the road – a \xa0factor which has always been subject\xa0to change. Another risk I want to mention is\xa0changes in\xa0Government policies.\xa0The Đèo Cả (Cả Pass)\xa0in central Việt Nam\xa0is an example. According to the original plan, the Vân Phong area would\xa0become a Special Economic Zone,\xa0while Vũng Rô would\xa0become a concentrated economic zone. But now things have changed and the traffic volume through the Cả Pass has dropped to 40 per cent of the original projection target. Coupled with\xa0that, there are many other risks hanging over\xa0investors.\nThe other point I want to mention is that when the PPP Law comes into force, people expect\xa0the general public will feel more confident in investing in a PPP project – their investments may account for up to 60 per cent of a\xa0project's total,\xa0while the share from the investor would be\xa0about 20 per cent.\nBesides, when the PPP Law comes to life, its mechanism on investment mobilization will be much more liberal than the old mechanism.\nWill you please explain\xa0about the investors' roles in a PPP project?\nIn a PPP project all investors are key players. They are also the project’s implementers. That’s why Government agencies and\xa0private investors\xa0both have the same rights and responsibilities. This is an economic contract, so all players must be equal before the law.\nIt's common international practice for infrastructure projects not to depend on bank\xa0capital but on the issuance of Government bonds. Should Việt Nam apply this method for PPP\xa0projects?\nMany countries have experienced many lessons from PPP projects, particularly when they have leaned too much on credit\xa0from banks. It is a common practice for\xa0commercial banks to\xa0mobilise\xa0money through short term deposits while the money they lend to their customers is based on long term contracts. This means the banks have accepted the risks on their side. In many countries, for example in Great Britain, banks have joined an alliance for\xa0their lending activities to share the risks together.\xa0In South Korea, they mobilise\xa0capital from society through\xa0 various funds, like the Fund for the Development of Transport Infrastructure, and they have successfully mobilised quite a lot of money. I hope\xa0Vietnamese investors in PPP projects will learn\xa0from other countries.\xa0VNS",2

""But he is getting better and better.""\nValladolid were perhaps unfortunate the 32-year-old was fresh after the postponed Clasico on Saturday meant Barcelona and Real Madrid were given the weekend off.\nIt meant this was the first game at Camp Nou since violent protests broke out across Catalonia after nine pro-independence leaders were sentenced to imprisonment on October 21.\nGiant yellow banners with \'Independencia\' and \'Llibertat\' written across them were unfurled before kick-off but there was no sign of unrest. Instead, the mood turned celebratory as Messi got to work.\nIt was his free-kick that Valladolid made a mess of clearing, as Sergi Guardiola lashed the ball against Joaquin Fernandez and Lenglet reacted fastest, his shot deflecting in before two minutes were on the clock.\nMessi runs the show\nThe procession was briefly halted when Ter Stegen, perhaps unsighted, slapped a cross straight into the shin of Olivas but the remaining 30 minutes of the first half belonged to Messi.\nHe switched the ball for Frenkie de Jong to slightly overhit a pass for Arturo Vidal and then replicated the Dutchman\'s effort but did it better, this time picking out Vidal perfectly to score at the back post.\nFive minutes later he sent a free-kick curling away from Jordi Masip, who scuttled across his line but could never reach the ball as it nestled in the top right-hand corner.\nMessi flicked one through the legs of Oscar Plano, who threw his head back and for a moment stopped dead in frustration. Then it was Guardiola\'s turn, only this time the nutmeg doubled up as a pass.\nAfter half-time, Ansu Fati, making his last appearance before turning 17, should have tucked away a Messi pass before two goals in the 75th and 77th minutes put Valladolid out of sight.\nMessi cushioned Ivan Rakitic\'s cute pass on his thigh and drove it into the corner and then slid in Suarez, who finished for his eighth goal of the season.\nIn injury time, Messi should have had his hat-trick but curled wide of the left post when he seemed certain to score. It might have been his first mistake all night.\nAtletico Madrid could have done with a drop of Messi\'s attacking inspiration as they were held to a disappointing draw by Alaves.\nAlvaro Morata came off the bench to score his third goal in as many games but Lucas Perez hit a stunning late equaliser at Menizorrotza to ensure a tight contest between two of La Liga\'s most stubborn defences ended all square.\nAtletico sit third, two points behind Barcelona and level with Granada, having played one game more. — AFP'",3

4377,'Fishermen carp about ban on catching baby fish',"'Many fishermen in the Mekong Delta region have complained that the ban on catching baby fish in local rivers during the rainy season has been implemented ineffectively, failing to protect marine life and seriously affecting their income. — Photo tuoitre.vn\nAN GIANG – Many fishermen in the Mekong Delta region have complained that the ban on catching baby fish in local rivers during the rainy season has been implemented ineffectively, failing to protect marine life and seriously affecting their income.\nNguyễn Hữu Hải, a fisherman in An Giang Province’s Vĩnh Hội Đông Commune, told Tuổi trẻ (Youth) newspaper that the provincial authority has banned all fishing activities on the Tiền and Hậu rivers between early June and late August. The ban aims to protect species, such as blue-legged shrimps and cyprinid fish from being eradicated during the rainy season.\nSince early June, Vĩnh Hội Đông Commune’s People’s Committee has seized three fishing nets installed illegally by local fishermen. However, Hải said, the authority’s ban until the end of August is too long and unnecessary.\nHải said he had been fishing for seven years, and the best time to catch fish is from mid-July when water levels at local rivers rise significantly due to heavy downpours. This year, local fishermen will only be allowed to install their fishing nets in September. By that time, cyprinid fish which have gotten old will fetch VNĐ6,000 less per kilo than the high-season prices of VNĐ40,000 -50,000.\nHải said the local authority should allow fishermen to use nets with a mesh size that enables small and young fish to escape, instead of banning fishing entirely for such a long period. This would help ensure fishermen’s income and protect biodiversity.\nMai Phước Hùng, another fisherman in Phú Hội Commune’s An Phú District, said local residents had abandoned their fishing nets and tools to obey the ban. He himself left nets and tools worth VNĐ100 million ($4,400) in storage.\nNonetheless, Hùng said, small blue-legged shrimps and cyprinid fish are found in the markets in abundance because authorized agencies ignore violations of the fishing ban by other fishing households.\nBiodiversity protection\nResponding to the complaints, Lâm Quang Thi, vice chairman of An Giang Province’s People’s Committee, said the ban had been imposed every year and this year it stipulated specific sizes of fish and ban time. ""The ban is only aimed at curbing overfishing and protecting the livelihood of local fishermen,"" he said.\nThe provincial committee has urged local authorities to strictly inspect compliance with the ban and fine violators.\nAddressing claims of the ban’s ineffectiveness, Trần Anh Thư, director of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said inspection teams mainly focused on large-scale fishing activities because of their impact on marine biodiversity. Inspectors would tighten control of small-scale fishermen to ensure the compliance with the ban, he promised. So far, six people have been fined for using small-sized nets to catch baby fish.\nThư said he agreed that fishermen could suffer loss due to the imposed pause of their fishing activities, but added that most households earn their living by doing other seasonal jobs.– VNS'",4

I have spent more time with manual clearing work on grass and pests,” Tùng said.\n“Formerly, we had to have at least 15-days off after spraying herbicide, but now we work every day in the field by reducing chemical-based pesticide,” she said.\nThe old farmer said she had to do more manual work, but suffered less exposure to toxic pesticides and weed-killer.\nShe said the quality of vegetables has improved since urea was not used by farmers in the village now.\nHuỳnh Tấn Hoàng, 67, said using less chemical fertilier also helped cut 30 per cent of production costs.\n“Our safe vegetables are sold at the price\xa0two times as much as that of farm produce from other chemical-using\xa0farms. We also fill information into a daily field book before products are sealed and branded. It’s easy to track the source of products after sale\xa0through strict procedures and paperwork,” he said.\n“Only qualified vegetables will be collected by the Túy Loan co-operative on orders from supermarkets and shopping centres in the city.”\nHoàng, however, said manual work occupied 80 per cent of production costs, so they needed machinery and innovation to cut\xa0labour costs.\nĐặng Thị Thanh Sang, a member of the co-operative, said at least 200kg of herbs and vegetables are harvested and packaged for delivery to big shopping centres in the city’s downtown daily.\n“We have connected with big trade centres – Big C, VinMart and international schools – in supplying qualified safe farm produce,” Sang said.\n“The co-operative helps farmers deliver their products to the market with a negotiated stable price. This means farmers do not need bring vegetable to the market themselves, while the co-operative helps them link up with\xa0trusted suppliers of seed and bio-fertiliser,” she said.\nLê Mỹ, an official from the city’s Plant Protection sub-department, said useful bugs were bred to kill worm larvae at farms, while solar-powered pest catching lamps were installed to deal with caterpillars.\nNguyễn Thanh Quang, from the city’s science and technology associations, said Túy Loan farmers have built links with 14 shopping centres and weekly farmers'\xa0fairs in the city to sell their produce.\nHe said farmers did cross-check procedures for fertiliser and bio-pest spraying to ensure farm products are fresh and safe.\nQuang said the city has assigned seven safe farm zones to meet 30 per cent of the city’s vegetable demand.\nNguyễn Quang Dũng, head of the Túy Loan Co-operative, said the farmers also plant flowers\xa0to attract bees and ants, while powdered lime was used to fight pest larvae.\nDũng suggested hi-tech solutions such as drip irrigation, bio-pest automatic sprayers and agri-motors are needed to reduce manual work on farms.\nThe Túy Loan Co-operative has\xa0also received supports from Rikcolto-funded project from Belgium to boost supply of safe vegetables.\nHoàng Thanh Hải, co-ordinator of the RIKOLTO project, said it helped build a PGS system for farmers in the two farm zones as well as retail market links.\nThe\xa01.1 million population in Đà\xa0Nẵng City\xa0consumes 145,000 tonnes of seafood and 140,000 tonnes of vegetables per year, but 70 per cent is supplied by neighbouring provinces of Lâm Đồng, Gia Lai, Kon Tum and Quảng Nam. — VNS",1

But recently, the number of unexpected calls is much greater, especially from automatic switchboards.”\n“The calls came from morning until late evening,” Thành said.\n“Recently, I got calls aggressively\xa0asking me to repay some loans which I did not borrow,” he said.\nIn\xa02016, the MIC set up a hotline to receive reports on spam messages and calls but the move has had little impact.\nTelecoms firms MobiFone\xa0said that in October alone, it had barred a total 885,000 spam text messages from its 17,800 subscribers, 2.2 million messages from Vinaphone, 275,000 from Viettel and 36,200 from Vietnamobile.\nStrict sanctions, network providers’ responsibility\nThe draft decree mentions solutions to prevent the distribution of\xa0spam messages, forcing\xa0advertisers\xa0to send a copy of each text message purposely sent to targeted\xa0customers to a system overseen by the MIC.\nUsers can also forward spam messages to this system.\nThe draft also regulates that no organisation, business or individual can contact the phone number of a person or body that has opted out.\nViolators\xa0can be fined VNĐ80-100 million (US$3,500-4,400).\nUnder the draft, those making telemarketing calls before 9am and after 10pm could be fined VNĐ20-40 million ($860-1,720) while businesses which charge subscribers for receiving telemarketing calls can be fined VNĐ10-20 million ($430-860).\nBusinesses that engage in telemarketing without informing the ministry will be fined VNĐ60-80 million ($2,600-3,450).\nHowever, some experts said\xa0only fining spam distributors wouldn\'t solve the problem.\nStrict management of subscribers’ information from telecoms network providers was needed to tackle the issue, they said.\n“Although telecoms service providers announced efforts to reduce\xa0spam messages and calls, they are always beneficiaries regardless of who makes the messages and calls,"" said Vũ Quang Đức, a lawyer in HCM City.\nTherefore, telecoms service providers must take responsibility for the situation.\nIf the distributors of spam messages or calls couldn\'t be found, the network providers should be penalised, he said.\nThe large fines in the draft were welcomed by experts.\n“For years, this problem which has not been solved thoroughly, made people upset. I think the draft decree provides\xa0solutions and mechanisms that could basically solve this issue,” said lawyer Trương Anh Tú.\nHowever, some telecoms businesses said they struggled to block spam messages and calls due to an incomplete legal framework and the lack of a definition of spam messages and calls.\nMobiFone’s representative told the newspaper that the draft decree should regulate fines for businesses and individuals who distribute spam messages and calls instead of placing\xa0responsibility on telecoms service providers.\n“It\'s because telecoms providers can\'t define which message and calls are fraudulent or cheating,” he said.\nNgô Vi Đồng, vice chairman of Việt Nam Information Safety Association, said although the definition of spam messages and calls was not clear, telecoms providers obviously had to take responsibility for the situation.\n“If they really want\xa0to protect their customers, they have to take many measures to prevent spam messages and calls as well as sanctions to spam distributors,” said Đồng. —\xa0VNS'",1

Hakimi hit the winner for Dortmund with 13 minutes to go.\n""It feels brutally good,"" goal-scorer Julian Brandt told broadcaster DAZN.\n""We all knew how important the game was for us to win, but the (second-half) reaction was absolutely crazy.\n""I think that we are in the development phase and that not everything quite fits yet.\n""If everything was perfect, it would also be a bit boring,"" he added with a grin.\nThe result leaves Dortmund second in Group F, a point behind leaders Barcelona, who they face at the Camp Nou in three weeks.\nInter are now third in the group, three points behind Dortmund, before their next game at Slavia Prague.\nAfter a 2-0 loss in Milan a fortnight ago, Dortmund had rebuilt confidence with back-to-back wins over Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg but were dominated in the first half here.\nMartinez struck early on with a superb solo effort after mistakes by both Dortmund centre-backs.\nA long ball through the middle evaded Manuel Akanji with its bounce, leaving Mats Hummels isolated on the edge of the penalty area.\nHummels lost the one-on-one and could only watch as Martinez drilled his shot past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki.\nMartinez, who also scored against Dortmund in the reverse fixture, became the first Inter player to score in three consecutive Champions League appearances since Samuel Eto\'o scored in four in a row in 2010.\nDortmund captain Marco Reus failed a fitness test on a foot injury before kick-off and the Germany forward was missed as Mario Goetze missed two clear chances at the other end.\nInter\'s second goal was a cracker as midfielder Vecino finished a brilliant team move.\nMarcelo Brozovic won the ball from Brandt and his pass found Martinez whose raking cross-field pass landed at the feet of Vecino, who beat the defence to double Inter\'s lead on 40 minutes.\nDortmund came out firing for the second half and pulled a goal back when Hakimi managed to connect with Goetze\'s cross as the hosts attacked with regularity.\nGoetze then made way for Paco Alcacer, whose first touch of the ball was to flick it to Brandt from an Inter throw, the Germany winger sweeping home the equaliser on 64 minutes.\nAxel Witsel headed wide as Dortmund hunted the crucial third goal. It soon arrived as Hakimi completed the fightback on 77 minutes when he again used his pace to tuck home Jadon Sancho\'s pass and put Dortmund back on course for the knockout stages. – AFP'",3

The 20km urban railway has faced several delays and costs overruns since construction started in 2012.\xa0— VNA/VNS Photo Hoàng Hải\nHÀ NỘI On Tuesday, the seventh session of the 14th\xa0National Assembly (NA) received split opinions on whether the NA or the Government should have the authority to set the amount of capital allocated to each State budget-invested project in the mid-term plan.\nThe current Law on Public Investment, which took effect in 2014, says the NA is in charge of approving the total amount of public investment capital to be disbursed over a period of five years.\nThe Government is responsible for submitting a list of key national projects to be funded with the State budget and setting the amount of investment capital to be given to each project, with the total not to exceed the limit set by the NA.\nThe draft revised law on public investment discussed by the NA gathering proposes transferring the power to set funding for individual public projects from the Government to the NA, while still allowing the legislative body to set the total amount of funding for all projects in the five-year term.\nThe Government would no longer be allowed to approve funding levels for each project.\nDeputy Lê Thanh Vân from Cà Mau Province supported the draft. Vân said making decisions on how to fund public investment projects was one of the NA’s key responsibilities.\nDeputy Tôn Ngọc Hạnh from Bình Phước Province said that with the NA’s heavy workload, it would be unrealistic to expect the legislative body to approve and adjust specific funding for as many as 9,000 projects in five years.\nOther lawmakers disagreed, saying the NA’s approval process would not take too much time if the Government makes careful preparations before submitting investment plans.\nUnfocused investment\nDeputy Lê Thanh Vân said the implementation of the mid-term public investment plan had faced difficulties, including a failure to follow public investment law regulations because the Government’s advisory team had not completed all of the tasks assigned by the NA.\nDeputy Nguyễn Thị Quyết Tâm from HCM City proposed the Government attempt to determine whether slow disbursement of public investment funds for key national projects was due to structural problems with the Law on Public Investment or poor implementation of its regulations.\nSpeaking with Vietnam News Agency reporters on the sidelines of the meeting on Tuesday, deputy Nguyễn Đức Kiên from Sóc Trăng Province said the cost overrun of Bến Thành-Suối Tiên metro project in HCM City and the slow disbursement of funds to hospitals in Hà Nội and HCM City showed that the problems lie in unfocused and ineffective implementation of the law rather than any flaw with the law itself.\nAccording to deputy Hoàng Văn Cường from Hà Nội, the Law on Public Investment must prioritise urgent and realistic projects to address transportation problems, support people in mountainous areas and help stabilise lives.\nHe proposed the Government issue a set of quality standards for State budget–invested projects after the revised law is passed. Localities which meet the criteria would be selected to receive public investment.\nThe criteria would help avoid wasteful spending, select suitable projects and assess their efficacy after they are complete, he said.

5035,'Understanding pharyngitis among children',"'Dr. Sheila. — Photo courtesy of Family Medical Practice\nby Dr. Sheila*\nWhat is pharyngitis? What is tonsillitis?\nThe tonsils are lymph nodes found on both sides of the oral cavity. They lead to the pharynx or back of the throat, which in turn connects the nose and mouth to the airway and stomach. A “sore” throat is due to inflammation and or infection of these 2 areas.\nWhat causes pharyngitis and tonsillitis?\nAdenovirus, Enterovirus, Herpes simplex and Epstein Barr virus cause 95% of sore throats in children below 5 and 70% of sore throats in children after 5 years old. Hence a bacterial cause is less common but if so the most likely agent is Group A Streptococcus, hence the name “Strep throat”. Viruses are transmitted from an infected person’s secretions or through contaminated surfaces and objects whereas group A strep is mostly transmitted directly from people or carriers; crowded spaces also facilitate spread of these organisms.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nAside from throat pain viral pharyngitis gradually presents with watery eyes, a runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness and diarrhea over a few days. Children are usually themselves until symptoms disappear in 3-5 days’ time. Bacterial pharyngitis or Strep throat on the other hand presents with sudden onset high fever, chills, headache, and abdominal pain; there may be pus on the tonsils, swollen neck nodes or a skin rash, in which case it is called Scarlet fever. A throat swab and sometimes culture may be necessary to differentiate between virus and bacteria.\nWhat can I do at home? When should I bring to doctor?\nFor children who are otherwise active and eating well warm saline gargles, soft, cool foods and drinks (yogurt, plain vanilla ice cream, milkshakes and smoothies) relieve the pain and ensure adequate energy intake. Quick showers and as-needed fever medicines lower the temperature and also make the child comfortable. If you notice they are more irritable than not, prefer to sleep than play, refuse fluids and solids or develop symptoms outside those described above it is best to bring to your pediatrician for further assessment.\nAre there any serious complications?\nMost viral pharyngitis cases resolve without sequelae. And as long as antibiotics were judiciously used in the past, bacterial pharyngitis can be simply treated as well. Recurrent and improperly treated Strep throat sometimes lead to peritonsillar abscess, rheumatic fever and nephritis. To avoid this bring your child to the clinic on the 3rd to the 5th day of illness for an appropriate doctor-prescribed treatment regimen. — Family Medical Practice\nREFERENCES\n1.

Photo courtesy of sqqp.org.vn\nHCM CITY – Eleven months after its launch, the Appraisal and Exhibition Centre of Art and Photography\xa0under the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism has carried out its responsibility inefficiently, according to experts.\nAuthentication of artwork and photographs in many countries is done by\xa0organisation and individuals with authentication certificates, but Việt Nam might be the only country where the appraisal centre is managed by the government.\nThe director of the ministry\'s Fine Arts, Photography and Exhibition Department, Vi Kiến Thành,\xa0explained that the centre was launched because of\xa0customers’ lack of trust in the\xa0authentication process.\nWith the growth of the local art market, collectors, museums and photographers need to have their artwork examined and authenticated.\nAccording to photography critic Nguyễn Thành, as copyright infringement\xa0in Việt Nam remains a problem,\xa0it has become\xa0even more important to have an authentication unit conducting artwork examination.\n“An authenticator is not only a good art creator but also\xa0one who\xa0regularly updates the market, understands\xa0the\xa0art and photography world, and has\xa0in-depth knowledge about the field,” Thành said.\nPainting collector Lê Hải Phong said that assessments increased the value of an artwork.\xa0Since collectors will be more confident about\xa0showing their artwork, the trading process will also\xa0become\xa0easier with authentication, he said.\nThough some people are uncomfortable about handing over their work to\xa0authentication experts, it is still necessary to have a team of examiners standing by.\nBùi Thị Thanh Mai, deputy director of the Việt Nam Fine Arts Museum, agreed that the success of the art market would depend\xa0on the\xa0authenticity of the art.\nControversies\nMai recalled the\xa0incident in which 17 fake paintings were shown in the\xa0exhibition\xa0“Những bức tranh trở về từ châu Âu” (Paintings Return from Europe), in\xa02016 in HCM City at the Fine Arts Museum.\nThese painting’s fake status was determined by a\xa0management team and art experts, but\xa0the collector and owner of the paintings,\xa0Vũ Xuân Chung, did not agree with their assessment.\nSimilar\xa0controversies have occurred,\xa0but they were not\xa0resolved\xa0because the\xa0artwork had not been\xa0authenticated.\n“What makes\xa0it difficult for appraisal to be carried out in Việt Nam is that it is\xa0a completely new job, and it requires certain kinds of technical\xa0equipment,” director Vi Kiến Thành said.\nDương Thu Hằng from the Hà Nội Studio Gallery said that\xa0two big galleries from South Korea had purchased\xa0many\xa0paintings of famed artist Bùi Xuân Phái years ago, and since then,\xa0paintings allegedly by Phái had\xa0been\xa0sold in Việt Nam.\nHowever, no one has been\xa0willing to\xa0appraise Phái’s paintings for\xa0auctions.\nMai\xa0added that two\xa0of the more common tricks in art fraud is forging the name of an artist or\xa0attaching the name of high-value artists.\nThere are numerous cases of fake\xa0signatures or unlawful usage\xa0of work\xa0by\xa0other artists, but collecting enough evidence to authenticate artworks can be difficult.\nMany works\xa0of Vietnamese artists do not have proof that they are originals, thus increasing\xa0the risk of buying fake artworks, according to experts.\nMai suggested building a record of artists to help identify the origin\xa0of their works.\n""Vietnamese artists usually do not care about how to protect their artwork\'s value and reduce art fraud. Building artists\' records is crucial to\xa0protect\xa0intellectual property and one\'s image in a professional manner,"" Mai said.\nDirector Thành said the Department of Fine Arts, Photography and Exhibition would\xa0maintain the activities of the Art and Photography Appraisal and Exhibition Centre until the work is\xa0taken over by an organisation in the private sector.

In addition to the fine, the company must destroy the film version screened at the festival.\nHKFilm asked for a distribution licence for Ròm on September 4. On September 11, its content was assessed by a panel of judges, but before that, the company had registered and submitted the film to the Busan Film Festival.\nAccording to the revised Cinema Law in 2009, films participating in film festivals must have either distribution licence issued by the State management agency or a broadcasting decision by the head of the television or radio station.\nPreviously, producer HKFilm announced they had withdrawn from the Busan Film Festival; however, the organisation board still screened the film and allowed it to compete. It was premiered at the festival without the presence of its director Trần Dũng Thanh Huy and main actor Trần Anh Khoa.\nHowever, the film still won the top award in the New Currents section of the film festival, together with Iran-Qatar co-production Haifa Street.\nIt was also the first time a Vietnamese film won the top award in one of the most prestigious Asian film festivals.\nIn Variety, the New Currents jury, headed by British director Mike Figgis, said that “the use of real, live locations” in Ròm “impressed the jury greatly and that the ending was very satisfying”.\nThe drama portrays the life in a poor labourers’ residential area in HCM City in which the main character, a homeless teenager called Ròm, has to survive through constant battles on the street.\nThe Busan International Film Festival took place from October 3-12.\nBesides Ròm, other Vietnamese films like Bắc Kim Thang (Home Sweet Home), Thưa Mẹ Con Đi (Goodbye, Mother), Bí Mật Của Gió (Secret of the Wind) and Anh Trai Yêu Quái (My Annoying Brother) also received positive feedback after being screened as part of the ‘A Window on Asian Cinema’ category of the film festival. — VNS'",5

Then, my brother and sister-in-law were also affected. I am the fourth person in my family to get the disease,” she said.\nThe four patients received treatment at the virus and parasitology department of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.\nThe Department of Infectious Diseases of Việt Nam National Children’s Hospital has recorded many cases of transmission from children who had chicken pox to their mothers.\nNguyễn Văn Lâm, director of the department, said most chickenpox cases are benign but the disease is highly contagious and can have life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis.\nSomeone with chickenpox can spread the virus through droplets in the air by coughing or sneezing as well as contact with fluid from the blisters, making it important to monitor and isolate infected patients, avoiding spreading the disease among the community.\nAlong with chickenpox, rubella and mumps also have mechanisms of transmission through the respiratory tract or mucus that has viruses.\nIn the first months of this year, the number of rubella and mumps cases increased in some countries around the world. The US’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a warning about a hike in mumps as more than 700 cases were recorded in the country.\nHoàng Đức Hạnh, deputy director of Hà Nội’s Health Department, said conditions were ripe for a lot of epidemics from other localities to enter Hà Nội.\nPreventive measures\nPhu, the director of Preventive Health Department, said the ministry has learned from previous disease prevention and combat efforts.\nPriority has been given to early detection of infections from international border gates and at community and health care centres.\nOnce a suspicious case was detected, the infected people must be isolated for immediate treatment, he said.\nNguyễn Nhật Cảm, director of Hà Nội Disease Control Centre said the city had five mobile teams for disease prevention and combat and each district had its own teams.\nUpon receiving information about suspected cases of infection, the team would arrive at the scene and employ appropriate measures, he said.\nThe city also monitors passengers entering through Nội Bài airport, especially those coming from disease-affected areas.\nTo prevent the epidemic from spreading, localities should launch campaigns to raise knowledge for enterprises and people on the diseases, Cảm said.\nWhen infections were detected among students, teachers and school employees, hygienic disinfection is a must to minimise the spread of germs, he said.\n""Strict punishment will be imposed on any individuals or units who are found hiding epidemics or failing to comply with supervision measures and isolation,” Cảm said. — VNS'",1

He understood the importance of the country’s cultural identity to the movement for independence and freedom, and so he established the country’s first legal instrument for safeguarding cultural heritage, knowing that culture constituted the essential foundation and strength of the nation,” he said.\n“The Government and the Vietnamese people have continued to respect his vision and the result of their efforts, is what celebrate today. The beautiful Sanctuary of Mỹ Sơn, which once lay in ruin, has become one of the best examples in monument restoration in Southeast Asia, providing us a fascinating glimpse into the political and cultural history of the region. And we find this same sense of shared history expressed in the international collaboration to restore the site, in the close cooperation between Việt Nam and friendly countries like France, India, Italy and Poland and many other partners. UNESCO is proud to have been part of this process, and highlight it as best practice.”\nQuảng Nam hosted 6.5 million tourists, of which Hội An was a favourite destination of 5 million visitors, last year.

The Canadian firms see Việt Nam as a good business opportunity.\nViệt Nam is also a very competitive destination in terms of market access and the ability to participate in manufacturing activities in the world.

However, Việt Nam has only about 300 enterprises that can produce quality parts and accessories to participate in the global value chain.\nThis workshop was expected to create favourable conditions for Canadian and Vietnamese businesses to meet and seek opportunities on expanding markets and improving production ability.\nViệt Nam is assessed by experts to have many good conditions on development of supporting industries. With an increasingly improved business environment, Việt Nam becomes an attractive destination for many businesses in the industrial sector.\nThe comprehensive partnership between Việt Nam and Canada under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) opens more opportunities on extensive cooperation for businesses of the two countries.\nIn the first seven months of this year, Việt Nam's export turnover to the Canadian market increased by 32.7 per cent year on year to US$2.2 billion. \xa0VNS",2

1912,'Why finance can be a real force for good',"'Brian Spence\nBrian Spence*\nBrian Spence explains why the financial services sector needs more recognition as a force for good this Christmas.\nBack in the UK, every winter brings louder calls against the further commercialisation of Christmas – a trend which is hard to deny when decorations start to appear earlier and earlier each year. Now beginning well before Advent (and even as early as September by some measures!), the festive season can seem like a months-long frenzy of consumerism that is very far from the Christian origins of this sacred festival.\nThis juxtaposition of the temporal and the holy may make people uncomfortable as they contemplate the story of Jesus born in a humble manger contrasted to the ringing of the cash registers up and down the land. However, we do wrong to try to somehow hold the economic realities of life apart from our spirituality. Not only is money a huge part of what makes “the world go around”, it can also be a huge power for good.\nThe excesses of capitalism certainly do sit ill with Christian – and Christmas – values. The proper use of capital certainly does not. The rapid evolution of the investment sector is a case in point.\nA force for good\nThe media back home loves to portray the financial services sector quite negatively at times, and as a committed Christian who is also a lifelong financial advisor, I am only too aware how often people mistakenly quote the Bible in saying that “money is the root of all evil”. Of course, the good book in fact denounces the love of money. That is a very important distinction.\nMoney, we are urged to recognise, is nothing worth loving in and of itself. The fluctuation of its intrinsic value over the millennia should mean we need no reminder, however. Money has taken the form of everything from shells and precious metals to paper, linen and now code. Fiat currencies are just fictions we all subscribe to and the miser who loves money for its own sake will soon only be able to dote on numbers on a screen.\nIt goes without saying then that we are wisest when we think of money as a tool to be put to use and that this should also be true in the investment space. This is not just a case of money making money, although that is true. Rather, it is the fact that how we deploy our wealth is one of the most important methods of self-expression there is.\nDoing well and doing good\nPeople tend to enjoy investing in their “home turfs” and it is always gratifying to see successful entrepreneurs acting as “investing angels” for those that come behind, for instance. But precisely aligning broader portfolios with our values is getting easier by the year now too.\nAll around the world, responsible/ESG and impact investing are on the rise. Investors are choosing not to invest in firms that contribute to the world’s ill and are channelling funding instead to those generating positive results for society or the environment, alongside financial returns for their backers. Investors have come to realise that there is not necessarily a distinction to be made between doing well for financially and doing good in a broader sense.\nPutting wealth to work\nPerformance figures keep underscoring that point and as institutions jostle for the attention of the next generation, responsible investment products are proliferating all the time. All this makes me proud to be an investment advisor and someone who is part of putting wealth to work in the best possible way.\nMy work in Vietnam is highly varied, ranging from advising High Net Worth Individuals on holistic investment plans to brokering the M&A deals that help entrepreneurs realise their wealth. But during the festive season I’m trying harder than ever to recognise the positive impact, “on the ground”, that comes from putting capital to work.\nIt’s easy to become slightly distanced from what one does, but I think it pays to take a closer look at a time of year when “the money men” tend to come in for additional flak. Living, education and health standards have all been raised the world over by the investments – large scale and small – that the financial services sector brings into being, and that work needs to be ramped up right around the globe.\nInvestors are realising that they are real change-makers. As a new year approaches, I hope that we can all be a little more mindful of how we deploy our wealth – and of the immense good it can do.\n* Brian Spence is managing partner of S&P Investments.

5266,'Ancient painting in Ninh Bình in need of restoration',"'Ancient painting believed to feature monk Nguyễn Minh Không. Photos thanhnien.vn\nNINH BÌNH Cultural experts have sounded the alarm over the deterioration of a rare and ancient painting.\nThe painting\xa0is believed to feature a portrait of monk Nguyễn Minh Không (Lý Quốc Sư) (1065-1141) and has been kept\xa0in Thánh Nguyễn Temple in Ninh Bình Province.\nAccording to painter Phạm Bá Ngọc, the painting has been folded too small to fit into a storage box.\n""The box and the painting surely don\'t fit one another"" he said. ""Folding too small has resulted in many cracks on the painting due to pleats over a long time.""\nLý Quốc Sư (National Monk of the Lý dynasty) was the title the Lý kings gave to Monk Nguyễn Minh Không, who led Buddhism under the Lý reign. He was considered\xa0the initiator of many pagodas in Việt Nam and the ancestor of bronze casting handicraft.\nHaving made great contributions to curing\xa0illnesses for royal families and people, the monk\xa0and General Trần Hưng Đạo (1228-1300) have been praised as Saint Nguyễn and Saint Trần and are worshipped\xa0at many temples and pagodas throughout the country.\nThe painting, which is guessed to date\xa0back 400-500 years,\xa0is only\xa0exhibited at the temple for important events, while the rest of the time it is been kept in the\xa0box.\nResearcher Trần Hậu Yên Thế expressed\xa0his admiration for the techniques used in the painting.\n“It was made with a very difficult technique of gilding gold on a silk background while all drawing lines were painted with gold,” he told Việt Nam News.\nHe revealed he had seen some similar paintings outside\xa0Việt Nam.\n“They ground gold, then make the drawing lines,” he guessed. “They may have made the background with paint, then put gold powder on the surface and drew the lines.”\n“That’s why the costume of the monk in the picture looks very special,” Thế said. “The inner sweater the monk wears looks beautiful. It is as smooth as if it were covered with gold powder.”\nThế said he found the painting similar to worship paintings of Vajrayana Buddhism,\xa0called thangka paintings.\nHe said a typical technique thangka paintings apply is using many thin pieces of gold on the painting to depict glamourous costumes.\n“Using thin gold pieces on a silk painting is unique,” he said. “The gold was gilded on the costume in a complex way. Gold may be gilded in the position of the coat’s edge, on rosary beads, on the head of dragon pattern on the monk’s coat.”\nThế said he had seen the same way of gilding gold in Tibet, where after gilding gold, decorative patterns are drawn on the same place in a painting.\n“The drawing capability of the monk painting’s drawer must be of master level,” Thế said. “As I know in order to draw on the surface of gold, the colours should be special. It might have been paint or some kind of glue made from plants, with which drawing thin lines is not simple at all.”\nThế also said the use of\xa0Vajrayana Buddhism features in the painting is consistent with Buddhism during the Lý reign.\nIn the monk’s coat, there are images of dragons with five claws, which concerned the king, royal family and mandarins. Normal people would not have this kind of pattern on their clothes.\n“The way that the painter featured the monk in such a royal coat implied the monk was a national leading monk of the Lý dynaty, who has once rescued King Lý Thần Tông (1116-1138),” Thế guessed.\nJournalist Nguyễn Quốc Phong, who helped examine the\xa0painting recently,\xa0could not hide his concern over the present situation of the painting.\nThe painting is folded small to fit the small box that contains it.\n“I hope Ninh Bình Culture, Sports and Tourism Department will soon have a plan to preserve the painting to avoid it becoming more worn out,” Phong told Thanh Niên News.\nHe suggested the National Fine Arts Museum buy the painting to restore it properly.\nThế has asked artisan Nguyễn Đăng Giáp, who has restored many ancient paintings, to get involved, but\xa0Giáp said he has not ever restored such a painting.\n“The gold gilded area is very bright, so I think the gold might have been imported from Tibet,” Thế said. “We may transfer the painting to other countries to better restore it like to South Korea or Japan, where there are many more experienced experts in the field.”\nNguyễn Thu Hòa, director of Ceramic Museum, also a collector of ancient paintings, said the painting should be restored and then given back to the temple.\n“If the painting is so special, there are only two experts that can restore it in Hà Nội,” she said.\nHòa\xa0was referring to\xa0Nguyễn Văn\xa0Đức, who specialises in silk, gold and silver techniques\xa0in Bát Tràng Village, and\xa0Lê\xa0Quốc Việt, a painter who researches royal promotion decrees and calligraphy.\nĐặng Văn Bài, deputy chairman of the Việt Nam Heritage Association, said the locality should restore the painting soon.\n“It’s most important to figure to a careful, thorough and scientific method of restoration,” he said.\nHe warned failure to do so could lead to an incident similar to what happened to the national treasure lacquer painting Vườn Xuân Trung Nam Bắc (Spring Garden of North, Central and South) by painter Nguyễn Gia Trí (1908-1993) at HCM City Fine Arts Museum last year.\nAfter 30 years being kept at the museum, the lacquer painting had some damage on the surface, so museum\xa0cleaners used\xa0kitchen soap, sandpaper and powdered cinnabarite to clean it.\nThe improper cleaning scraping some of the outer paint off and removed the intricacies in Trí\'s work.\nThe painting is the largest lacquer work in the country, which took Trí 20 years to finish and is considered one of his greatest works.\nThe masterpiece depicts a spring festival with revelers wearing different traditional costumes from localities across Việt Nam.

992,"'HCM City has new\xa0plan to eliminate\xa0homelessness, begging on streets'","Beggars and the homeless on HCM City's main\xa0streets\xa0often fabricate stories about\xa0their personal circumstances. Photo courtesy of sggp.org.vn\nHCM CITY — Though HCM City has tried to take care of beggars and the homeless for years, many people continue to beg for money, saying they have had goods or cash stolen, or need to find their lost relatives, among other explanations.\nFor example, a middle-aged woman regularly stands near a gas station on the corner of Nguyễn Văn Cừ and Nguyễn Trãi streets in District 5 to look for handouts, according to a report in Sài Gòn Giải Phóng (Liberated Sài Gòn) newspaper.\nWhen a driver stops at the gas station, the woman helps them open up the gas tank cover and waits for the bike owner to make the next move. After the driver pays for the gas, the woman then immediately asks for money. If she doesn't receive any, she argues that she deserves it because she helped open the tank cover.\nSince most bike owners want to avoid problems and not be told that they are selfish, they give the woman VNĐ5,000 or VNĐ10,000. Within a fairly short period, the woman is able to earn hundreds of thousands\xa0of đồng.\nA similar circumstance can be seen at a gas station on Lý Thường Kiệt Street in District 5 where a middle-aged man is “in charge”. In addition to opening and closing the gas tank lids in exchange for money, many other scams have been recognised.\nIn particular, a woman holding a sick-looking child usually sits on the pavement of District 11’s Âu Cơ Street. Many people give her money but others volunteer to take the child to the hospital. But the woman refuses, explaining that she just wants money to take care of the child herself.\nOther beggars tell people they need money because they have missed their train home or their motorbike needs repair.\nThe city's hotspots for begging include: the Nguyễn Thái Học – Trần Hưng Đạo Intersection in District 1; Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa – Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai Intersection and Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai – Cách Mạng Tháng 8 Intersection in District 3; Nguyễn Trãi – Nguyễn Văn Cừ Intersection and Nguyễn Trãi – Châu Văn Liêm Intersection in District 5; and Cộng Hoà – Út Tịch Intersection and Bảy Hiền Intersection in Tân Bình District; among others.\nIneffective plans\nTo address the situation, the city's Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs has submitted a report to the city's People’s Committee on a draft plan dealing with the homeless situation through 2020. The department's goal is to end the situation by the end of 2020.\nHowever, experts are concerned that this new draft plan is similar to former ineffective plans.\nIn 2010, the city's Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs aimed to eliminate begging by the end of 2010. Then a year later. The department submitted another plan that focused on getting rid of begging in several central districts by 2013 and citywide by 2015.\nAt the end of 2014, the city began encouraging beggars and the homeless to visit or stay at social protection centres. A similar goal was set in early 2015, with the aim of solving the problem by the end of April, 2016. However, the problem persisted.\nAccording to the city's Department of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, the homeless and beggars who stay at social protection centres receive general education and vocational training, with the aim of eliminating literacy and offering them access to primary school education.\nThe flexible training period allows them to quickly return to their localities, find proper jobs, and have stable lives. The centres also work with businesses to find jobs for former beggars or the homeless.\nTo provide the best conditions for them to reintegrate into the community, the Department of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs sends a notification to its counterparts in neighbouring provinces, asking them to offer support to beggars and the homeless.\nFor those who continue to stay in HCM City, the People’s Committees of districts and wards are responsible for connecting the homeless or beggars with their families who are asked to promise that their relatives stop begging or living on the streets. Authorities consider each problem case by case, and then offer support to the former beggars and the homeless. VNS",1

There has not been anyone tackling the Tô Lịch issue who dared to make such a claim before,” Bái said.\nA nano air blower installed on Tô Lịch River that aims to increase oxygen\xa0levels\xa0in the water. — VNA/VNS Photo Huy Hùng\nTime needed\nHowever, not everyone is convinced and some have voiced concerns about the long-term viability over the project, especially over the possibility that the river might need constant pumping of air to avoid pollution.\nĐào Trọng Tứ, director of Việt Nam River Network, an organisation which aims to protect\xa0rivers\xa0in the country, said the Japanese technology is not anything novel and many methods have been tested on polluted lakes and rivers across the country, including the Tô Lịch River, but the results failed to live up to the high expectations.\n“If the technology’s endgame is to improve the smell or the colour of the river’s water, then it is nothing new. Everyone knows how a pond or a lake’s water can be cleared up significantly if treated with alum,” Tứ said.\nHe also noted how it would be more complicated as the Tô Lịch is no longer a true\xa0river, given that the freshwater supply that goes into the lake is dwarfed by other sources, namely wastewater and rainwater.\nTứ remarked that if the issue of wastewater discharges\xa0into the river is not dealt with, any solution would just be temporary.\nIn the short-term, Hanoians might no longer have to turn up their nose at the rancid smell, especially\xa0during the hot summer, but testing is needed before declaring\xa0the project successful, he added.\nPhạm Văn Cường, former director of Hà Nội’s water discharge project management unit, said the city is building the 4,800ha Yên Xá wastewater treatment factory with daily capacity of 270,000cu.m.\nOnce operational, the facility would collect and handle all wastewater discharged from households alongside the Tô Lịch River, which means the river would no longer have to bear the polluted water, Cường said.\nCity\xa0authorities are also considering pumping water from West Lake to flush out the pollution from the Tô Lịch River.\nPreviously, Lê Công Thành, deputy minister of environment and natural resources, said the Japanese\xa0technology being piloted at Tô Lịch River is merely a test\xa0and the results remain to be seen.\n“The ministry has assigned relevant units to constantly monitor the water’s quality and assess the efficiency as well as the practicality of the technology,” Thành said.\nAccording to the environment ministry, the pilot project will go on for two months with expenses borne by the Japanese side. — VNS\nThe stretch of Tô Lịch River near Hoàng Quốc Việt Street was choosen as the\xa0site for the cleanup operation project by Japan. — VNA/VNS Photo Huy Hùng",4

Almost two\xa0in three\xa0children between six months and two years of age are not given food that supports their rapidly growing bodies and brains. This puts them at risk of poor brain development, weak learning, low immunity, increased infections and, in many cases, death.\nThe report warns that poor eating and feeding practices start from the earliest days of a child’s life. This finding is highlighted by a landscape analysis on complementary feeding and maternal nutrition as part of the Regional Initiative for Sustained Improvements in Nutrition and Growth (RISING) and carried out by the Việt Nam National Institute of Nutrition in 2019. The analysis showed that complementary feeding practices and maternal nutrition in Việt Nam are largely inadequate and inappropriate, contributing to the burden of malnutrition.\nFrom the very start of life, many children in Việt Nam are not getting proper nutrition. Inadequate maternal diets result in underweight and overweight women who are more likely to have low birth weight babies.\nFurther, inadequate diets during the complementary feeding phase when the first foods are introduced between six months and two years are common in the country.\n“While Việt Nam has made good progress in reducing its rate of undernutrition in recent decades, chronic malnutrition or stunting remains unacceptably high and there is a risk that rates of overweight will rise,” said Rana Flowers, UNICEF Representative in Việt Nam.\n“The costs of not addressing malnutrition in its all forms including stunting, underweight, wasting, hidden hunger, overweight in children are rising – a better investment is to provide nutrition services through multiple systems including a strengthened food and primary health care system,” she added.\nTo address this growing malnutrition crisis in all its forms, UNICEF recommended empowering families, children and young people to improve nutrition education.\nBesides, people should encourage supportive systems – health, water and sanitation, education and social protection – to scale up nutrition results for all children.\nSpeaking at the report launching ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam said that malnutrition in Vietnamese people and children remained high.\nAs many as 57 per cent of residents lack vegetables, vitamins and have too much salt and starch in their daily meals.\nThe unreasonable nutrition led to different diseases in adults, he said.\nEmphasising the importance of proper nutrition for people’s health, Deputy PM Đam said reducing children’s malnutrition was not only the health sector’s work, but also the work of the political system as a whole.\nĐam asked the Ministry of Health and concerned organisations to urge supportive measures in the provinces with alarming nutrition conditions, for instance, in Central Highlands provinces.\nProgrammes to improve nutrition for pregnant women and children should be conducted, he said. — VNS'",1

Policies should not aim at forcing them to work until they are\xa0exhausted.\n""If\xa0employers need employees to work overtime to meet deadlines, they should discuss payment with them,"" she said.\nDeputy Nguyễn Quang Tuấn from Hà Nội said workers in some professions should\xa0not be allowed to work overtime such as pilots and drivers.\nHe also mentioned the\xa0fact that many healthcare workers have to work too much overtime, even up to 1,000 hours per year.\n“There is a proposal from NA deputies that medical workers should work on Saturday and Sunday. If so, each person would have\xa0to work 800 hours per year on average while overtime pay for them remains\xa0low,” he said.\nThe draft revised Labour Code proposes adding one more national holiday - July 27, War Invalids and\xa0Martyrs\xa0Day. It is an occasion for the whole nation to pay tribute to those who sacrificed and made contributions to the country.\nHowever, the majority of deputies were not in favour of the proposal, saying it\xa0should be open for public feedback and needed\xa0further consideration.\nAfter receiving deputies’ opinions, Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affair Đào Ngọc Dung said the Government would scrap the proposal from\xa0the draft.\nE-passports\nNA deputies agreed the issuance of biometric passports or e-passports would\xa0ensure secure border crossings for\xa0Vietnamese citizens while they were discussing the draft law on the entry and exit of Vietnamese citizens yesterday.\nThe new point proposed in the draft law is to replace the current paper passports with e-passports embedded with microchips which carry personal information such as name, nationality, date of birth, gender and biometric data.\nE-passports with microchips can be used for facial and fingerprint recognition.\nAll personal information and biometric data will be coded in the e-passport for authentication and security purposes, following International Civil Aviation Organisation standards.\nDeputy Phạm Tất Thắng from Vĩnh Long Province said e-passports attached with microchips and auto-security checks followed a global trend.\nDeputy Hà Thị Lan from Bắc Giang Province said more than 120 countries had\xa0issued e-passports, including\xa0all\xa0countries in Southeast Asia except Việt Nam and Myanmar.\nThe application of technology in immigration control aimed\xa0to avoid counterfeit\xa0passports, she said, giving examples of fake\xa0passports being used in many countries for smuggling and illegal migration.\n“E-passports make immigration control at border gates faster and more accurate. Controlling immigration through auto-security gates shortens waiting times and reduces congestion,” she said.\nIt was also more convenient for those who run out of pages for immigration stamps.

2065,'Việt Nam attracts world leading hotel management brands',"A view of Cocobay Complex in Đà Nẵng. —Photo viettimes\nCompiled by Thiên Lý\nJapan’s Watabe Wedding Corporate recently signed an agreement with Empire Group Việt Nam to organise wedding ceremonies for 1,000 Japanese couples in the latter’s Cocobay Complex in Đà Nẵng in the next three years, and the figure is expected to increase to 16,000 in the next 10 years.\nThis year, Watabe has already organised 120 weddings at Empire Group’s properties.\nWhy is one of Japan’s leading providers of marriage services tying up with Empire Group?\nThe latter’s properties like Coco Ocean Resort with Park Regis and Leisure Inn hotels, and Coco Skyline Resort with Golden Tulip and Coco Ocean Spa Resort offer a number of advantages.\nThe Empire Group’s properties are mostly situated between Hội An and Đà Nẵng along private and pristine beaches that also offer guests direct access to a dining and retail strip.\nMajor tourist attractions there include the cities of Hội An and Đà\xa0Nẵng, the Marble Mountains and Bà\xa0Nà\xa0Hills.\nBut arguably an even more important reason Empire Group has been able to attract Watabe Group is that its properties are managed by world leading hotel management groups.\nEmpire has an agreement with Japan’s Seibu Holdings which allows its Coco Ocean Resort and three GB buildings to carry the Park Regis and Leisure Inn brands.\nIt has got France’s hotel leading group Lourve to manage its Coco Skyline Resort under the Golden TulipBrand and two other buildings under the Campanile Brand.\nLouvre Hotels Group is a major player in the global hospitality industry, with a portfolio that now includes more than 1,500 hotels in 54 countries.\nRobert Mcintosh, executive director responsible for CBRE Hotels in Asia Pacific told Đầu tư Chứng khoán (Investment & Securities) newspaper that in recent years, Việt Nam has witnessed the expansion of many famous hotel brands like Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Wyndham Hotel Group, InterContinental Hotels Group and Accor Hotels in addition to Seibu's\xa0Staywell and Louvre.\nThe trend is expected to continue, he said.\nĐà Nẵng and then Hạ Long cities are considered the most attractive destinations for foreign hotel management groups, he said.\nThe investment potential of Việt Nam’s hospitality and tourism sector remains great, especially for investors seeking long-term growth, he said.\nOther analysts concurred, pointing out the country’s tourism industry has recently seen rapid growth, and the development of the hospitality sector is a concomitant.\nIn the first nine months of this year, international visitor numbers reached nearly 13 million, a 28.2 per cent increase year-on-year, and tourism revenues were estimated at VNĐ384 billion (US$16.3 million), a 31 per cent increase.\nThe tourism services sector has also registered strong growth.\nThe hotel industry has seen a boom in supply since 2015, with the five-star segment achieving the highest growth as the number of rooms doubled from 24,212 to 52,213 now.\nThe number of four-star rooms also increased sharply from 27,379 to 39,023.\nBy June 2018, nearly 2,000 international travel agencies and over 25,600 accommodation facilities with a total of 508,000 rooms were available across the country. Three- to five-star hotels offered 101,400 rooms. Over 21,000 tour guides have been licensed, and tourism provides an income to some 2.5 million people.\nThe rapid expansion of the high-end hotel segment but without the availability of management experience in the country means international hotel management companies are the only option, and most hotel and resort investors prefer to have leading names.\nNguyễn Việt Thung, vice chairman of TMS Group, said that tie-ups with foreign hotel management brands offer a lot of benefits like prestige, global brands and management skills.\nForeign hotel managers and operators are in turn partial to Việt Nam and like to work in the country because of its culture, beautiful landscapes and comfortable geographic location.\nBut in fact, it is not easy to invite those professional hotel managers to participate in management of hotel projects.\nThat is a good thing since, professionally, famous brands have stringent requirements of tourism properties in terms of location, construction quality, services, and legal and environmental factors, as Empire Group chairman Nguyễn Đức Thành pointed out.\nThey fiercely protect their prestige, he said.\nSome analysts pointed to the fact that foreign hotel management companies often refuse to accept offers from Vietnamese hotels claiming the market is not attractive, owners are inexperienced and hotel designs are unsuitable for their brands’ requirements.\nIs it a good time to buy gold?\nOn November 10, the buying and selling prices of SJC gold were VNĐ41.26 million and VNĐ41.56 million per tael of 37.5 grammes.\nAt Doji, they were VNĐ41.35 and 41.55 million.\nMarket observers said prices dropped by almost VNĐ600,000 on November 7 and have remained there though the fall was not as sharp as in the global market.\nThe corresponding global fall was $60 per ounce, or 3 per cent, to $1,440, the biggest single-day drop in the last two years.\nThe sharp decrease in prices could see individual investors buy gold in the hope to making a quick profit since prices always goes up at the end of the year.\nWhat do experts think?\nThey attributed the price fall to positive information about the China-US trade war.\nOn November 7, the two countries agreed to remove the additional tariffs imposed recently in phases once their leaders sign an interim deal towards ending the costly trade war.\nBritish broadsheet The Guardian said the prospect of an agreement sent stock markets soaring to all-time highs and prompted the International Monetary Fund to say a deal easing trade tensions between the US and China could persuade its officials to revise upward forecasts for global growth next year.\nBut some experts said that it is not easy to make short-term profits on gold now because the trade war is unpredictable and would not cease immediately.\nDr Phan Dũng Khánh of Bizlight Business School said gold prices would possibly fall further to $1,400 by the year end, which would push down Vietnamese prices to VNĐ39-40 million.\nShort-term gold traders should be cautious, he warned. — VNS",2

In 2017, the country had a serious outbreak with 17,000 infected cases and 38 deaths,” Tấn said at a workshop reviewing the project co-held on Monday by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Việt Nam’s Ministry of Health (MoH).\n“The information shared by countries contributed to coping with the borderless dengue fever epidemic in the region in the context of climate change,” he said.\nSpeaking at the workshop, the UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Sitara Syed said: “As climate was changing rapidly, dengue would tend to change dramatically as it is highly sensitive to temperature, humidity and rainfall.”\n“Water availability directly impacted dengue epidemics due to mosquito breeding sites. However, water availability or water resource management was rarely accounted for in dengue prediction models,” she said.\nThe fight against dengue required co-operation among countries and regions to ensure the best information, experiences and creative tools were shared in time, she said.\nFor any country, existing tools needed to be supplemented with innovative ones to help control and minimise the disease spread, she added.\nRepresentatives of Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka attended the workshop to share experiences of their fights against the disease.\nOn Monday, the MoH also held a meeting on preventive measures for the winter-spring epidemic.\nWinter and spring is a favourable time for many infectious diseases to develop, said Đặng Quang Tấn, deputy head of the Preventive Medicine General Department.\n“The epidemics would spread easily and widely if there are no drastic preventive measures,” Tấn warned.\nThe rising number of dengue fever cases in Quảng Bình Province in central Việt Nam has resulted in a serious shortage of hospital beds in local hospitals. — VNA/VNS Photo\nThe common infectious diseases in the season are flu, measles, pertussis, swine streptococcus, acute diarrhoea, avian flu, dengue fever, foot and mouth disease, rubella, encephalitis and diphtheria.\nNotably, as of this month, there were more than 250,000 cases of dengue fever, tripling the same period last year, causing 49 deaths.\nThe main reason for the increase of infectious diseases in winter and spring was due to prolonged humid weather and increase of poultry product consumption.\nThe low rate of vaccination, especially in remote areas, also worsened the spread of disease.\nDoctor Trần Minh Điển, deputy head of the Central Paediatrics Hospital, said that the hospital had received many children infected with measles.\nThe unvaccinated patients suffered serious complications, the doctor said.\nTherefore, many solutions had been proposed such as strict and effective surveillance of the diseases, timely detection and prevention, and increasing the vaccination rates, Tấn said. — VNS\nĐà Nẵng Hospital faces an overload of dengue fever patients in October. — VNA/VNS Photo'",1

Photo courtesy of Dr Lan\nGia Lộc\nHCM CITY — Dr Hồ Phạm Thục Lan began her medical career in an unconventional way.\n“When I was in high school, my younger sister became severely ill and had to be hospitalised. An attending doctor told my parents to take her home because my parents couldn\'t afford the cost of treatment,"" Lan recalls.\n""I was shocked to see such a cold-hearted attitude from a doctor. Right at that moment, I became determined to become a doctor one day. I promised myself that I would never say the same thing to my patients.""\nToday, as a teacher at Phạm Ngọc Thạch University of Medicine, Lan has won local recognition as well as international acclaim.\nAfter graduating from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of HCM City, Lan worked at People’s Hospital 115 where she met patients with all sorts of diagnoses. Many of the cases were not curable, but some were preventable.\n“I regard the elimination of suffering as an important role. We doctors can eliminate or reduce suffering by using affordable treatments. We can also help reduce patients\' pain by showing empathy. I found that the behaviours of touching, listening, talking and smiling can positively contribute to patients\' well-being,” she said.\nOsteoporosis research\nDuring her career, Lan has treated many patients with severe complications caused by osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.\n“That\'s why I have focused my research on these disorders,” she says, adding that more than 1,000 volunteers have been involved in her research efforts.\n“I start with simple questions, like finding out how many people have osteoporosis, and how and why the disease began, and then move on to more advanced questions such as the criteria used in diagnosis or whether diabetes is related to bone health.”\nHer research has attempted to address these questions, many of which are based on real-world observations. “I asked myself, for example, whether vegans have a higher risk of osteoporosis than non-vegans.”\nLan\'s research on veganism and its possible relation to osteoporosis and vertebral fracture showed that veganism does not adversely affect bone health.\nShe presented her research at the 2nd Congress of the Strong Bone Asia Conference in 2008, and subsequently published her findings in a prestigious journal, the\xa0American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n""My paper has received more than 160 citations from colleagues worldwide,"" she says.\nSince no organisation would fund her study, Lan had to pay for it herself. But her research results and international recognition led authorities to fund subsequent projects.\nAt the time she conducted her research on osteoporosis, only a few studies on the topic had been done in Việt Nam. There was little information about the risk factors for osteoporosis or the magnitude of the problem in the country.\n“My colleagues and I carried out a large-scale study to fill the gaps in knowledge. We also examined the effects of genes and environmental factors on osteoporosis,” she says.\nHer studies showed that the prevalence of osteoporosis in Vietnamese aged 50 years and older was 28 per cent for women and 11 per cent for men.\nMany of her studies, which were the first done in Việt Nam, contributed to insights into the diseases, leading to better practice and diagnoses.\nOne of her studies involved research on genes that affect the bone size of Vietnamese. The collaborative research was published in the prestigious scientific journal\xa0Nature Communications.\nAnother research study, on the association between diabetes and bone density, showed that diabetic patients had high trabecular (sponge-like) bone density but lower cortical (hard) bone density. The study was published in the journal\xa0Osteoporosis International\xa0last year.\nLifelong learner\nLan is also keen to improve the presence of the work of Vietnamese scientists in the international arena, and has done her part to present her work at international scientific conferences and fora.\n""Compared to other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, Việt Nam has had a modest presence in the medical literature and in international scientific fora,” Lan says.\nBesides doing research, she has shared her research findings with the general community. Four years ago, she launched a community health programme to provide free counselling and health examination on the weekends to people in District 7.\nShe also set up the website\xa0www.suckhoexuong.vn\xa0to provide useful and science-based information about osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.\nAs a lifelong learner, Lan always enjoys learning something new as part of her research. “Research is very useful because it provides an opportunity to learn the latest knowledge, and it\'s wonderful to see students get involved in research.""\nAsked about her challenges, she says that funding is the major problem.\nBecause she does not have a PhD, Lan was not eligible to apply for funding from the\xa0National Foundation for Science and Technology Development. Tôn Đức Thắng University and the city\'s Department of Science and Technology have funded her research projects over the past 10 years.\nCancer research\nCurrently, she is turning her attention to cancer. In Việt Nam, most cancer patients admitted to hospitals for treatment are in the late stages of the disease. Lan and her colleagues at Phạm Ngọc Thạch University of Medicine are conducting a major research project to improve early diagnosis of cancer.\nThe project involves the collaboration of the Oncology Hospital of HCM City, Bình Dân Hospital, University Medical Centre, Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia, and Johns Hopkins University’s Centre for Genetics and Oncology Treatment in the US.\nLan has received many awards for her research. This year, she was recognised with the 2019 Vietnamese Women Award. Previously, she was awarded the L’Oreal - Unesco 2015 Prize, the Alexandre Yersin Award for Outstanding Publication, and the HCM City Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Association Prize for Excellence in Medical Research.

4930,'Being pregnant after age 35: challenges and risks',"'Dr.\xa0Elisabeth Blanchi. — Photo courtesy of Family Medical Practice\nBy Dr. Elisabeth Blanchi*\nThe decision to have a child is probably the most important in our life! More and more frequently, a woman plans to have her first baby after 35 years old because of economic or professional reasons, even sometimes simply for fear of changes in her body. Why would it be more complicated at this age?\nThe maximum of fertility is between 25 and 29 years old. Getting pregnant after 35 takes more time (probability to be pregnant is 25 per cent per cycle at 25 years old; 12 per cent per cycle at 35 years old\xa0and 6 per cent per cycle at 40\xa0years old). From age 35 the anovulatory cycles are more frequent: it means that the woman can have menstruation without producing an egg. The number of oocytes (eggs) is decreasing during female lifespan – 400,000 at birth becomes 35,000 at age 35 – and their quality is fading. If the attempt to have a baby is not successful after 6 months of trials, it is advisable to see a gynaecologist because if IVF (in vitro fecundation) is necessary, it must not be done too late. In fact, despite the progress of Assisted Reproduction Techniques, we cannot overcome the ovarian aging. Before considering IVF, it is necessary to have a specific blood test (AMH) which evaluates the number of oocytes still likely to mature. Such a test avoids expensive and time-consuming treatments without any chance of success.\nRelated to the mother’s age, some complications during pregnancy and childbirth could be expected. The main problem that occurs often with advanced age is the presence of fibroids in the uterine wall which could trigger contractions and thus premature labour. They can also be responsible for placental detachment, as well as abnormal position of the foetus in the uterus during the last month. Maternal pathologies more frequently noted, especially during the third trimester, are diabetes and high blood pressure with the risk of pre-eclampsia. During labour, the dilatation stage is longer because the tissues are less soft. As a result, expulsion might be slower with higher risk of foetal distress. Therefore, there is more chance to have a C-section.\nThe risks for the foetus are linked to what is explained above. The consequence of ovaries getting older is more genetic abnormalities, therefore more chances of miscarriage. It is accordingly recommended to perform between the 9th\xa0to 12th\xa0week of pregnancy some tests (Bi-test or NIPPT) to rule out embryo chromosomes anomalies. After age 35 there are statistically more cases of foetal intra-uterine growth retardation leading to anticipation of the date of birth by the obstetrician.\nEven if you are in good health, for gynaecologists a pregnancy after 35 is considered a high-risk pregnancy. For this reason, women should be aware of the risks associated and should be followed by trained ob-gyn specialists. The follow up will be the same as for a 25 year old\xa0woman (7 prenatal visits and 3 ultra-sounds) except that the medical checks must be slightly more exhaustive, particularly for blood pressure, diabetes tests, maternal weight gain and foetal growth. The future mothers should attend regular pre-natal exams without missing a single one and must be more rigorous when following their doctor’s instructions. Starting pregnancy with a healthy weight (neither overweight nor underweight) and stopping smoking are essential. Before and during the first trimester of pregnancy, taking daily folic acid because it prevents neural tube defect is advisable.\nThese few considerations will help you to live this wonderful experience with a maximum of security. Don’t forget that, when we want to be totally ready to give birth to a child in a perfect and ideal environment, we take the risk to wait too long! Anyway, more and more mothers are pregnant after age 35 and they and their baby are perfectly healthy and happy!\xa0Family Medical Practice Vietnam\n*Dr.\xa0Elisabeth Blanchi is an experienced Gynecologist/Obstetrician at Family Medical Practice Hanoi.

The statement cast out new doubts about the trade deal progress.\nHưng warned the last three months of the year would lack news for\xa0the stock market and the domestic market had already claimed to the new high, so a short-term correction was likely.\nThe growth of local stocks doesn’t match the growth of the VN-Index as attention was mostly paid to large-cap stocks while mid-cap and small-cap stocks had been ignored, according to Hưng.\nSince October end, 43.5 per cent of all HoSE-listed stocks advanced and 49.5 per cent of them declined. Only a fifth of the gainers beat the gain of the VN-Index.\nIn the VN30 basket, only a third of the 30 largest stocks were able to beat the VN-Index in the same period.\nKhánh said blue-chip stocks were still strong enough and they would still take the main role to drive the market up.\nHowever, the large-caps may need some rest before returning to the action, he added. — VNS'",2

This is undoubtedly one of the most prominent platforms for Indian engineering exporters and manufacturers to display their engineering brilliance before leading global purchasers.”\nPhạm Thiết Hòa, chairman of the Investment and Trade Promotion Centre of HCM City (ITPC), said HCM City would continue to focus on developing supporting industries and seek\xa0to raise the proportion of locally made parts used in its four key industrial sectors and two traditional sectors to 66 per cent by 2020.\nThe key sectors are mechanical engineering, electronics and IT, rubber and plastics, and food and foodstuff processing, and the traditional sectors are garment and textile and footwear.\n“Việt Nam‘s supporting industries, especially HCM City’s have limitations. The competitive capacity of enterprises in the sector remains weak and there is a lack of linkages within the production chain.”\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution offers enterprises a development opportunity but also a challenge if they don’t make appropriate changes, Hòa said.\nThe exhibitions would provide the city’s supporting industry firms a chance to exchange information with local and foreign partners to explore business opportunities and expand their markets and transfer advanced technologies, he said.\nBesides showcasing advanced technologies and equipment, METALEX Vietnam will also feature activities such as an Engineer Master Class, Industry 4.0, on-site virtual welding training, seminars, and Koma Taisen competition.\nThe exhibitions, on at the Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, will run until October 12. — VNS'",2
773,'OANA members commit to fight fake news with modern technology',"From June 17-18, 1989, the Vietnam News Agency organised the 10th OANA Executive Board Meeting, the 10th Technical Group Meeting and the sixth Editorial Workshop. VNA/VNS File Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Members of the Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA) agreed that it’s time to use every advantage to develop mechanisms in the fight against fake news, and all media outlets should not compromise truth, accuracy and accountability for speed.\nGiven the context that fake news is spreading and harming nations, the Bahrain News Agency (BNA) affirmed that it does not compromise in its quest for honest reporting of the events in the country and around the world.\n\nAs local, regional, and international events require regular and prompt coverage in the news, the BNA assumes the responsibility of contributing effectively to keeping the international community well-informed on events and conferences, as well as on contexts and outcomes.\n\nThe agency shared its experience in keeping to the golden rule of not falling for fake news stories, no matter how genuine they are made to look or sound.\n\nIt also has created win-win situations to exchange credible news with other agencies in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe, and signed agreements with some universities and research centres in order to boost chances of dealing with only factual news and analyses.\n\nThe BNA has also trained its staff on the best practices to verify all news that it receives via email, fax, phone calls, and messages or that its monitoring team spots on websites.\nFirst Deputy Director General of Russia’s TASS news agency Mikhail Gusman\xa0said that the first step\xa0would\xa0be forming close ties among news agencies, possibly in a traditional alliance like the OANA, he suggested, stressing on the need to give a clear definition of “fake news”, along with legal arguments and regulations.\n\nAccording to Gusman, the OANA is not only a venue for news agencies to share experience, but also to make important decisions affecting the stability of the global information space.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republic of Korea (RoK)’s Yonhap news agency shared that the country’s media outlets are strengthening their fact-checking mechanisms to prevent damage from spreading fake news and to allow the readers to decide what the facts are when there are conflicting versions of stories.\n\nYonhap, the RoK’s premier newswire service, set up a fact-checking committee and has since made it a permanent team in an effort to contribute to a virtuous cycle in the local media market and to provide news that is fast, precise, and balanced.\n\nYonhap’s fact-checking team was officially launched in April 2018 as part of the newsroom. Foreign correspondents and reporters can pitch in by writing articles tagged with “fact check” to highlight issues that require the separation of facts from untruths. The aim is not to limit fact-checking to specific sections or issues.\n\nFact-checking has now become one of the most important concerns for Korean media. Broadcasters and newspapers have separate teams of people focused directly on this issue.\n\nYonhap’s fact-checking team filed 140 articles over the one-year period following its launch, identifying the facts in the coverage of politics, business, society, culture, science, and other areas of news. To deal with fake news on YouTube, Yonhap launched a video fact-check service named “Weekly Fact Check” on March 8 this year, it said.\nNurini Kasssim, CEO of Bernama News Agency from Malaysia, said it was important for the mainstream media, which is slowly losing out to social media as the main source of news and information, to regain the trust of the public, especially the younger generation.\n“It is not an easy task for the mainstream media to regain the trust of the public.\n“Nevertheless, it is not a battle that cannot be won. We have to innovate and\xa0come up with the right strategies,” she said.\nDespite the transformation in the field of information dissemination, many people still yearn for truth in the news they digest.\n“News agencies must engage in constructive journalism and not just harp on\xa0negative issues that can turn away consumers,” she said.\nSharing measures to win global public trust, Director General of Turkey’s Anadolu Agency Senol Kazanci said that news agencies should grow continuously, increase production and keep up the quality of its services.\n\nHe shared that AA is the dominating primary news source for the Turkish media, which proves that the agency has won the public trust as the mainstream news source in Turkey.\n\nTo that end, AA has increased its broadcast languages up to 13, positioned itself in a global photo distribution network with its high quality photos, increased the number of its worldwide offices to 41 and representatives to 100, signed cooperation agreements with 70 leading news agencies and gained subscribers from 76 countries.\n\nPresently, the agency is providing news services with the staff from 124 different nationalities, he added\nThe D-Watch\nAs part of efforts to verify information circulating on the internet and make it useful for news coverage, Kyodo News created the “D-Watch” team in the summer of 2012. Since then, the team has been monitoring various websites and social media, like Facebook and Twitter, every day from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. and regularly reports to the News Department’s nerve centre, called the News Center, about newsworthy information. The D-Watch team is operated independently from the newsroom by young people familiar with social media, including part-time university students.\nIf the News Center judges that it is better to cover something, based on information from the D-Watch team, it instructs news sections to send reporters to the spot where the news is happening. Reporters verify the information on the spot, and write news articles and take photos as well as videos if necessary. Kyodo reporters directly contact witnesses or information providers via social media and obtain more details, photos and videos. On the other hand, news sections may ask the D-Watch team to closely monitor information on websites and social media when a big accident or a huge natural disaster happens.\nInformation from the D-Watch team has sometimes resulted in breaking news stories. For example, the team detected information in June last year that a man with a knife was attacking passengers on a “shinkansen” bullet train. Based on the information from the D-Watch team, the City News Section and the Yokohama Bureau dispatched reporters and they were able to report news stories about the incident earlier than other media outlets. When a man rammed his car into pedestrians on Takeshita Street in Harajuku, a popular tourist destination in Tokyo, in January this year, injuring eight people, reporters from the City News Section were able to contact some witnesses with the help of the D-Watch team.\nIn addition to monitoring information on websites and social media by itself, the D-Watch team is now using an AI-assisted system called “FASTALERT”. The system, developed by JX Press Corp., detects accidents, disasters and other newsworthy things at an early date, collecting information posted by witnesses on social media.\nTwitter and Facebook platforms\nMeanwhile, the Montsame News Agency of Mongolia said to cope with the shift of new content consumption behaviour, focusing on video content and YouTube platform, the agency has successfully broadcasted news content through Twitter and Facebook platforms from September 2017.\nNoting that the main criterion for broadcasting information using YouTube is speed, especially in breaking news, and quality issues, the agency stressed the importance of increasing breaking news and video news. Video news is taken from the original source and there will be no chance for it to be fake. And it would help to solve such issues as fake news and verified news, and how to win back trust of costumers who often trust basic information, the agency said.\nTo consolidate the position of the OANA member agencies in the global news network, the agency suggested improving the usage of the OANA’s website, increasing the supply of video news to OANA websites, and paying attention to developing Facebook and Twitter pages.\nFact checking\nThe Australian Associated Press (AAP), meanwhile,\xa0is using its strong culture of innovation to create new opportunities and new products.\nAAP's news diaries and planning platform reduce unnecessary duplication of work for its subscribers.\nTo ensure the newswire is relevant, AAP has developed strong usage analytics for its content to understand who takes its stories, how they are used and how deeply the subscribers’ audiences are engaged in AAP content. This information can influences decisions on news coverage.\nAAP has grown in photographic business and generated strong income.\nAAP also launched\xa0initiatives such as\xa0Fact Checking, which holds political figures to account as it highlights false claims make in public statements.\nMobile, visual, intelligent and digital products\nSun Yong, President of Xinhua’s Asia-Pacific Bureau, said the agency has been working hard to innovate their news products, changing from mainly serving traditional media to various types of users and their different needs.\nIt has rolled out different services for new media and short video media, and increased mobile, visual, intelligent and digital products and so on. Currently, Xinhua produces an average of 100 short videos every day.\nThe agency builds technological construction as its core competitive power, and now has a technology team of nearly 1,000 people.\nIt has established an all-media reporting, editing and releasing platform, combining multiple functions together including planning, news gathering, manufacturing, feedback analysis, and data statistics. The platform is now being used throughout the agency.\nXinhua has also built an open news live broadcast “Cloud Platform”. Now more than 3,100 Chinese media organizations have joined the platform, and the agency conducts nearly 400 live broadcasts of various kinds every day.\nSun Yong said the agency has cooperated with China’s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba and set up a new media technology company, and launched a “Media Brain” platform, the first-of-its-kind in China, that brings cloud computing, the Internet of Things, Big Data and AI technology into news production.\nOn the platform, the news gathering, production and distribution of a video are completely undertaken by machines, and the whole process only takes a few seconds, he said.\nMultimedia services\nAccording to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) of Iran, in response to the latest trends among the audience and taking technological developments into consideration, IRNA has increased its active engagement in the web and social networks through its multimedia services.\nFrom April 2018 to March 2019, over a period of 11 months, the agency has published 125,208 photo frames, including both photo reports and images that are attached to news articles.\nIRNA published 2,881 videos in the same period. The videos have been posted both on IRNA official website and on Aparat—an Iranian video sharing site like YouTube.\nDuring that period of time, IRNA also published 294 infographics and 574 audio reports.\nIRNA Persian page on Instagram has 155,000 followers. This number is remarkable since Associate Press and AFP have 342,000 and 439,000 followers on Instagram, respectively.\nFurthermore, IRNA releases the latest news through Twitter and the Iranian network of Soroush.\nAt the same time, IRNA produces long reports, essays and news bulletins for its specific audience groups. In short, IRNA tries to address the needs of different groups of society via a vast range of products.\xa0 —\xa0VNS",0

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI Việt Nam has recorded gender equality achievements in political and economic sectors since the Law on Gender Equality took effect.\nThe percentage of female parliamentarians in Việt Nam has reached 27.1 per cent, higher than the global average (23.4 per cent) and Asian average of 18.6 per cent.\nIn the economic sector, the percentage of enterprises with female leaders increased from 4 per cent in 2009 to 27.8 per cent in 2017, the highest rate in Southeast Asia.\nIn the scientific sector, Vietnamese women have also gained achievements. Dr Nguyễn Thị Hiệp, a female Vietnamese scientist in the biomedical research sector at the HCM City International University, was ranked among 100 outstanding Asian scientists in 2019. Việt Nam grants the Kovalevskaya Award named after a Russian mathematician to outstanding female scientists every year\nThe Law on Gender Equality was approved by the Vietnamese National Assembly in 2006 and took effect in 2007. This marked a progressive step towards ensuring gender equality in Việt Nam.\nMinister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Đào Ngọc Dung said over ten years since the law was enforced, the State management agencies had combined gender quality with legal documents to “promote women’s participation in politics and empower them”.\n“Empowering women, especially the right to engage in politics, must be ensured.\n“It is compulsory to have women taking a role in local Party committees and People’s councils,” he said.\nAccording to the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, the percentage of women members of the Politburo and Central Party Committee has increased over three consecutive tenures.\nIn ten years, for the first time, Việt Nam has a chairwoman of National Assembly and three female Politburo members.\n“Over the past ten years, an important change has been made. That is the change in awareness of men towards women and girls. The changes are present in every family,” Dung said.\nThe achievement has been made not by any single individual but contributions of agencies specialising in gender equality work, according to Dung.\nAlthough more and more Vietnamese participate in political and economic sectors, the percentage of women in these sectors has not met the potential. Different retirement ages between men and women (60 for men and 55 for women) had hindered women from engagement, Nguyễn Thị Hà, deputy minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs said.\nViolence towards women and girls were still pressing issues in society. The preconception towards the roles of men and women had created pressure on both men and women. The preference for boys over girls resulted in gender imbalance and abortions, Hà said.\nWomen in rural areas and from ethnic minority groups had limited access to reproductive healthcare services. The quality of jobs for women remained low and unsustainable with lower wages than men.\nDeputy Minister Hà said the ministry aimed to complete policies on gender equality and offer public services on gender equality nationwide.\nViệt Nam ranked 77th out of 149 countries in terms of progress towards gender parity in the Global Gender Gap Report 2018 of the World Economic Forum.\nThe report measured countries in four categories – economic participation and opportunity; educational attainment; health survival; and political empowerment.\nOf these four, Việt Nam ranked highest in economic participation and opportunity, with a score of 0.74, 33rd globally.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Việt Nam experienced a decrease in gender parity for women in ministerial positions and fully closed the gender gap among its technical and professional workers. Likewise, equal opportunities were recorded for enrolment in tertiary education sectors. VNS'",1

This has also contributed to increased flooding in many areas.\nAbout 70 per cent of the greenhouses have not met technical standards, contributing to the spread of disease and viruses, according to a spokesman from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Division of Plant Protection in Lâm Đồng Province.\nLại Thế Hưng, head of the Division of Plant Protection, said the province’s Agriculture Department had asked the Lâm Đồng People’s Committee to set specific criteria on where greenhouses and nethouses could be located.\nUnder the proposal, greenhouses would be permitted on 80 per cent of\xa0areas (for building greenhouses) in Lâm Đồng Province and the remaining 20 per cent for planting trees and building inner roads.\nWhen building greenhouses, residents have been asked to take into account the facilities' slope and drainage networks,\xa0and estimate the volume of water that will flow out and where the water will flow, especially from glasshouses covering 5 hectares, according to Hưng.\nTo minimise the environmental impact of greenhouse expansion, the Agriculture Department should identify areas that can drain rainfall from the upper section of Đà Lạt, he added.\nDr Nguyễn Mộng Sinh, ex-chairman of the province's Union of Science and Engineering Technology Associations, said that areas for agricultural production and vegetable cultivation should be re-located to suitable zones.\nTo reduce flooding and environmental impact, Sinh said greenhouses in the central areas of Đà Lạt must be moved to suburban areas and replaced with trees and other greenery.\nState agencies should work with the owners of these houses and create favourable conditions by offering job opportunities for residents who agree to move their facilities to the suburban areas of Đà Lạt, he added.\nLâm Đồng Province has 4,500 ha of greenhouses and 1,222 ha of nethouses. Đà Lạt has about 2,800ha of greenhouses, including 1,244ha for growing vegetables, and 1,590ha for planting flowers, according to the Lâm Đồng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development .-- VNS.",4

It causes flood in the regional provinces.\xa0VNA/VNS Photo by Kim Xá\nCẦN THƠ — Land subsidence in HCM City and the Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta has ranged from 0.1 to 81 centimetres in the last 10 years, according to the Water Resources Management Department at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.\nThe figure was reported at a conference on land subsidence in Mekong Delta, co-organised by the Ministry of Construction and the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ) in Cần Thơ City on Friday.\nNguyễn Minh Khuyến, deputy director of the\xa0Water Resources Management Department, said the department had set up 339 monitoring points for recording land subsidence in HCM City and the Mekong Delta in the last 10 years. Of these, 306 points saw land subsidence.\nAn Lạc Ward of Bình Tân District in HCM City saw land subsidence of up to 81cm, Bạc Liêu Province 62.6cm, Sóc Trăng 53.1cm, and Cần Thơ 52.4cm.\nExperts at the conference said that overexploitation of underground water, rising sea levels, and substandard drainage systems were the main causes of land subsidence.\nData from the department showed that about 1 million cubic metres of underground water are exploited every day in the region.\nDr Philip Minderhoud of Utrecht University in the Netherlands said that land subsidence would improve if local authorities dealt with the overexploitation of underground water. He said that underground water in the Netherlands was used only for emergency situations like serious drought caused by climate change, not for daily use.\nSepehr Eslami Arab of Utrecht University said that land subsidence also caused serious flooding and tides in the rainy season, as well as salinity in the dry season.\nIn an attempt to curb water overexploitation, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has submitted to the Prime Minister a draft decree to tighten control over construction activities.\nThe ministry will restrict new construction that would exploit underground water, and review and make adjustments for current works.\nThe ministry will also build new water systems to provide clean water to rural areas.\nThe Mekong Delta is home to nearly 18 million people, and is the most important rice and fishing region in the country.

Textile and garment has been identified as a key industry to drive growth in Việt Nam's industrial sector in the future.\xa0— VNA Photo\nHÀ NỘI — In spite of strong growth over the last decade, Việt Nam’s industrial sector must start investing in R&D, finding ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and transforming into one capable of producing high-value-added products.\nThese were recommendations, among others, made in the Vietnam Industry Whitepaper 2019, which was released, for the first time, yesterday in Hà Nội by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT). The paper is the result of a co-operation project between the ministry and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) with support from the South Korean government.\n“Việt Nam’s manufacturing and processing industries have played an important part in economic development, contributing up to 80 per cent of the country’s export value per year and created millions of jobs,” said MOIT’s deputy minister Đỗ Thắng Hải.\nViệt Nam’s impressive industrial growth has seen the country moving up the Competitive Industrial Performance Index (CIPI) to 6th\xa0place among the ten ASEAN economies during the 2006-16 period, according to a UNIDO’s CIPI released in May. The country is also projected to become one of the most competitive countries as manufacturing bases, ranking 12 among the top 25, by 2020.\nThis is in line with recently issued Resolution No.23-NQ/TW by the Party’s Central Committee on the country’s industrial development by 2030 with a vision to 2045, which defines a set of objectives to increase the share of GDP of industry and manufacturing value to at least 45 per cent, the growth rate for industrial value added to 8.5 per cent and for manufacturing industries 10 per cent annually.\n“This paper provides policymakers, researchers and businesses with essential information on Việt Nam’s industries and helps produce accurate analysis and sound policies.”\nIt advised the country to focus on the development of industries such as food processing, textile and garment, leather and footwear, electronics and vehicles in the pursuit of mentioned-above objectives.\nViệt Nam has great potential for growth thanks to its geological advantages, political stability and young population. The country can serve as a manufacturing hub in the global economy as well as a major consumer market with an expanding population of 96 million, said UNIDO country representative Lê Thị Thanh Thảo.\nViệt Nam’s manufacturing value added (MVA), a key indicator to measure a country’s industrialisation level, however, remains low even in comparison to that of ASEAN countries. While showing impressive growth by increasing from US$15.15 billion in 2006 to US$26.61 in 2016, the country’s share of MVA in GDP remains under 20 per cent, whereas such a figure is usually over 20 per cent in advanced industrialised economies. This is a hurdle that must be overcome if Việt Nam is to meet objectives in developing its industrial sector. — VNS",2

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI – The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Wednesday\xa0agreed the current Law on Enterprises needed to be revised\xa0to improve the business and investment environment and raise the efficiency and effectiveness of State management.\nIn a discussion session on Wednesday in Hà Nội about the draft Law on Enterprises (revised), members of the Standing Committee paid much attention to the new regulation on household businesses.\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng said the revised law acknowledged the existence of household business\xa0just as other types of business, including private enterprise; partnership; limited liability company; and joint stock company. Investors are free to\xa0establish and operate in one of these forms. On the other hand, household businesses are not obliged to become\xa0a company.\nPreviously, the Enterprise Law of 2014 and its guiding documents required household businesses to employ\xa0more than 10 people to register as businesses.\nThe revised law has tackled shortcomings of current regulations regarding this matter, such as unclear legal status and civil responsibility of household businesses, limited rights\xa0within the district level and regulations stopping a household business hiring more\xa0than 10 employees or opening branches and representative offices.\nSuch shortcomings were preventing the businesses from taking advantage of opportunities, said Vũ Hồng Thanh, head of the NA Economic Committee.\nHowever, he said many people said there should be a separate law for household businesses.\nA member of the NA Standing Committee Trần Văn Tuý said it was important that thorough consideration be conducted when combining “household business” into the Law on Enterprises.\nIn the revised law, apart from the annulment of the requirement that a household business was only allowed to hire less than 10 employees and can't open branches, Tuý said there were nothing more to encourage the development of this business type.\nThe country has\xa0an estimated\xa0more than 5.1 million household businesses.\nThey employ some eight million people nationwide and contribute nearly 30 per cent of the country’s\xa0GDP. However, they only contribute\xa01.6 per cent of the State budget.\nOn the same day, the Standing Committee also talked about the Law on Investment. — VNS",0

Việt Nam needs to build its own online map to manage data source and meet the need of searching for information and addresses of Vietnamese users that existing platforms have not met yet.\nVmap was developed by the Việt Nam Post Corporation (VietnamPost) in collaboration with the Central Committee of Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union and the Hà Nội National University.\nTo collect map data, more than 120,000 post office staffs and union members and youths across the country travelled to each street corner and village to collect information. The data will be integrated and posted on Việt Nam\'s digital map at https://map.itrithuc.vn/ and\xa0https://vmap.vn.\nVmap now has more than 23.4 million address data points across the country. In addition to basic features such as address search and directions, Vmap will display a separate map layer of all areas of life and display detailed addresses for each house number, whether in urban or rural, mountains and remote areas.\nVmap includes a background map database system like map layer on border, administration, traffic, rivers, co-ordinates information, support information of objects like landmarks, schools, hospitals, pharmacies, hotels and residential addresses but also provides the electronic humanitarian address maps, iNhandao, to support the implementation of humanitarian activities.\nThe iNhandao system, https://nhandao.itrithuc.vn, will display information about humanitarian addresses proposed by the user community across the country such as lonely elderly people, people with serious diseases, and people in areas affected by natural disasters.\niNhandao was developed by the Việt Nam Red Cross Society in collaboration with FPT Corporation to create an open access channel and to connect people in need of relief with donors.\nThe iNhandao system has developed humanitarian address data. Since its operation, the Red Cross societies at 63 provinces and cities have surveyed nearly 60,000 humanitarian addresses, of which 17,000 were updated to iNhandao system. It will contribute to improving the efficiency and quality of humanitarian assistance activities of the Vietnam Red Cross through digital map system and electronic applications.\nMinister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng said iNhandao would help unite Vietnamese people to build a good and sustainable society.\nLaunched in January 2018, the Vietnamese Digital Knowledge system project aims to develop a data and knowledge platform relating to all social life fields. To date, the project has formed a platform system with functions and tools that allow the collection, processing and sharing of shared data for a number of fields.\n“The project on developing Vietnamese Digital Knowledge system is a long-term and important programme of the Government that is built basing on latest technologies such as AI and BigData. With collaboration of big companies, groups and startups, the project’s results will be applied to create applications that connects and shares data and knowledge with community,” said Minister of Science and Technology Chu Ngọc Anh. — VNS'",1

It comprises minimum capital requirements, supervisory review and market discipline to enhance competition and transparency in the banking system and make banks more resistant to market changes.\nBasel II requires banks to have a capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of at least 8 per cent.\nHowever, the SBV has allowed 10 banks to adopt Basel II standards earlier than the 2020 deadline. They are Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Việt Nam (Vietcombank), Military Bank, Việt Nam Technological and Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Techcombank), Asia Commercial Bank, Việt Nam International Bank, Maritime Bank, and Việt Nam Prosperity Bank, TPBank, OCB, and HDBank.\nThe last three did not go through a pilot process.\nState-owned BIDV and Vietinbank are under pressure to increase their charter capital to meet Basel II standards. Their CAR is now below 10 per cent.\nVietinbank seems to be facing the biggest obstacle since it has already reached its foreign ownership cap of 19.7 per cent.\nIts other options now are to retain earnings and capitalise them if the central bank permits it or be capitalised by the Government.\nBut experts say the Government has yet to agree to give up its dividends and cannot prioritise funds from the State budget to add to the lender’s capital.\nBIDV seems to be in a more comfortable situation. In July it wrapped up a 15 per cent stake sale to KEB Hana Bank, a subsidiary of South Korea’s Hana Financial Group. It sold 603 million shares for VNĐ20.3 trillion (US$882.6 million).\nThe deal has helped BIDV increase its CAR to 11.3 per cent, which allows it to increase its assets by 13 per cent.\nViệt Nam has been quite late in adopting Basel II standards compared to other countries.\nBanks with a relatively good performance and financial situation can easily adopt Basel II standards whereas it is difficult for those facing financial difficulties.\nMost banks have plans to increase capital, but only a few medium-sized and large banks have managed to do so.\nAccording to experts, it is a struggle for small banks to increase capital because of disadvantages like low profits, lack of transparent information and low stock prices.\nSo many banks would not be able to meet the Basel II requirements before the SBV’s deadline, they warned.\nWith just a couple of months to go for the deadline, it is hard to envisage the SBV not giving laggards more time.\nIn fact, it is in the process of drafting a new circular that will allow banks to delay the adoption of Basel II, Thời báo Tài Chính (Financial Times) newspaper reported recently.\nThe experts said it is a fait accompli since penalising laggards would hamstring the entire banking sector and in turn the economy.\nSome others warn however that this would erode the authority and credibility of the central bank and the importance of Basel II.\nThe central bank should throw the book at laggards, curtailing their credit growth quotas or even placing them under special supervision.\nForeign investors covet Vietnamese fashion brands\nIn September Japanese casual clothing brand Stripe International acquired a 70 per cent stake in Vietnamese fashion retailer Global Fashion, owner of women’s accessories brand Vascara, marking its second acquisition in the country in two years.\nFollowing the deal, Stripe International has taken over Global Fashion’s 134 Vascara outlets across the country.\nGlobal Fashion, established in 2007, makes shoes and bags.\nVascara said last year it had more than 1.5 million customers.\nStripe currently owns 20 brands, largely in fashion but also recently diversifying into restaurants and hotels.\nThe Tokyo-based company had acquired clothing retailer Nem Group in 2017. The Hà Nội-based Nem had 80 stores across the country at that time.\nIn 2018 after building the Knoss fashion brand for over 10 years, CEO Cố Huệ Anh decided to sell it to Vietnamese retail-management company Seedcom, which has nine brands currently under its umbrella, with The Coffee House being the best known.\nIndustry insiders said most medium-sized Vietnamese fashion brands, many of whom have dozens of shops, face many difficulties including lack of space.\nThey lament that rentals in major cities like Hà Nội and HCM City have doubled or tripled in the last two years due to the fierce competition for prime space from convenience stores and banks.\nThis has made it very hard for fashion brands to expand, which is considered indispensable in the industry.\nLê Viết Thanh, director of K&K fashion brand, rents have doubled since 2017 while brand marketing and advertising costs are rising relentlessly, and now account for 7-8 per cent of turnover compared to just 1 per cent four or five years ago.\nBut fashion companies cannot increase their prices if they are to remain competitive especially with foreign brands now flooding the market.\nMoreover, consumers’ shopping habits and behaviours have changed because of having too many options. Their brand loyalty has decreased, and many prefer to be led by advertisements and promotions.\nMany renowned fashion brands like Ninomaxx, N&M, Blue Exchange, PT 200, Việt Thu, Ha Gattini, and Senorita have now been forced to reduce their number of shops, while some have even changed their business models.\n“We see the potential of the Vietnamese fashion market, especially the footwear and bag industry…..,” Harigae Tsutomu, general director and CEO of Stripe SaiGon, told DealStreetAsia.\nAnalysts agreed with him, saying Việt Nam is a highly lucrative fashion market with a population of nearly 100 million and the market is growing at 20 per cent annually.\nThey also expressed regret at the fact Vietnamese fashion brands seem to have missed the bus.

1622,'The State needs do more to attract private investment in railway infrastructure',"A view of the North-South high-speed railway. The railway sector has step by step lost its role in the economy with the market share reduced from 30 per cent to 1 per cent. — VNA/VNS Photo Minh Sơn\nHÀ NỘI — The State must play a key role in investing in the national railway infrastructure to boost development and attract more private investment, experts have said.\nSpeaking at the seminar on promoting the railway infrastructure development held on Wednesday, Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyễn Ngọc Đông said the cost of investment in a kilometre of railway infrastructure is usually three to four times higher than that of roadway.\nIn addition, the sector had a slow pay-back ability making it tough to call for investment from private sectors.\nĐông said the sector has improved with the investment in the North-South high-speed railway, which helped to maximise the capacity of the transport system in Việt Nam.\nHowever, the aging and backward infrastructure system has posed many challenges.\nMost of the trains operated on the one metre gauge, which accounted for 85 per cent of the national railways.\nThere were 297 terminals in the whole country, but most were small and downgraded. Half of 1,850 railway bridges were in dire need of being upgraded. At least 22 out of 39 railway tunnels also need renovation.\nMore than 4,000 railway crossing were illegally built across the country, where up to 70 per cent of railway accidents occurred.\nVũ Anh Minh, chairman of the Vietnam Railways Corporation said the capital demand for railway development was huge, but the investment for the sector was modest - only two per cent of the State budget.\nThe annual funding for maintenance allocated by the Government could only satisfy about 30 per cent of the actual needs.\nOut-of-date technology and ill-quality services weakened the competitiveness of the sector, he said.\nLê Thanh Vân, Standing Member of the National Assembly's Finance and Budget Committee said the railway sector has lost its role in the economy with the market share decreased from 30 per cent to 1 per cent.\nThis was totally contradictory to the development of roads and airways, he said.\nDiscussing on the causes of the issue, Vân said the State has not had a strategic vision of railway planning and paid little attention to investment.\nOn the other hand, the railway industry itself still depended on the State’s investment and was not active in restructuring its organisation to adapt to fierce competition.\nThat’s why it was very difficult to attract investment from the private sectors.\nLê Thành Quân, director of the Ministry of Planning and Investment’s Department of Infrastructure and Urban Development said the funding raised from 4 per cent in the period of 2011-2015 to 11.9 per cent in the period of 2016-2020.\nHowever, it has remained insufficient to the actual demand.\nDue to limited investment, the development strategy of the national railway industry by 2020 with a vision to 2050 only targeted that the market share of the industry would be 1-2 per cent of passenger transport and 1-3 per cent of freight transport.\nAt the meeting, experts said it was vital the State invest in key infrastructure.\nA policy to attract investment from private enterprises should be built.\nThe transport sector must focus on technology to lengthen station tracks, build new stations, synchronise\xa0axle load on the entire route and modernise signalling and telecom systems to improve the operation capacity. — VNS",1

VNS Photo Minh Thu\nAn exhibition featuring Indochinese fine arts and applied art of the first half of the 20th\xa0century also opened at the Hà Nội Museum on the same day.\nThe exhibition, showcasing 200 paintings, sculptures, and architectural works in different media owned by the museum or private collectors\xa0and organisations, provides a brief introduction to the modern development of Việt Nam’s fine arts and the establishment of the Indochina Fine Arts School, the foundation of the current Việt Nam Fine Arts University.\nThe school was established on October 27, 1924, following the decision of Governor General of Indochina Martial Merlin. French artist Victor Tadieu and Vietnamese artist Nam Sơn laid the foundations for the school. This was an important turning point in national art history.\nIn November 1925, the first course opened with two main subjects: painting and sculpture. One year later, architecture was opened as another subject, followed by lacquer, silver carving, pottery and wooden furniture. Since 1931, works of artists trained from the school were displayed in many countries such as Japan, France, Italy and Belgium.\nThe exhibition recalls the golden period of Vietnamese fine arts, which happened during the transition from traditional art to modern Western art while retaining traditional elements. During 25 years of operation, many artists have been trained at the Indochina Fine Arts School and therefore are able to contribute to the country’s fine arts.\nOn display are images of the mural at Indochina University (former name of the Việt Nam National University, located at 19 Lê Thánh Tông Street, Hà Nội).\nTadieu (1870-1937) created the 77sq.m-piece in 1921. The painting shows more than 200 characters in Vietnamese society. It took six years to complete the painting, marking Tadieu’s last of such a large scale.\nThe exhibition also presents the application of art in fashion, architecture and design. Hence visitors have a chance to contemplate architecture of houses in Hà Nội in the 20th century, stamps and newspapers, áo dài (traditional long dress), decorative objects and public art.\n“Fine arts with its own language spoken through lines, shapes, lights, layouts and colours, are expressed by Vietnamese artists, sculptors and architects through their ingenuity,” director Đà said.\n“Due to the limited time and space, the exhibition has not yet introduced the creative achievements of the fine arts from this period. We try to introduce the highlighted artworks.”\nThe exhibition will last until March 15, next year at the Hà Nội Museum, 2 Phạm Hùng Street, Hà Nội. VNS",5

That saw Việt Nam’s exports to China in July drop 44 per cent year on year.\nThe industry in recent years has experienced a strong growth, but most of the exports were raw vegetables and fruits.\nLack of capital, technology and raw material areas are the reasons that have made the post-harvest processing field not develop, Nguyên said. In addition, the investment in this industry must be long-term while payback of the investment is slow, so many businesses are not interested in investing.\nViệt Nam has 71 processing facilities in the South, but most of them are short of raw materials and operate 50 per cent of designed capacity. Meanwhile, the country has an output of 27 million tonnes of vegetables and fruits per year, but the factories only use 1 million tonnes per year meeting standards for processing.\nƯng Thế Lãm, an experienced fruit exporter, said the demand for processed fruits and vegetables is increasing and consumers demand quality products.\nTherefore, Việt Nam’s farmers should develop organically according to international standards such as Global Gap to meet demand on fresh fruit as well as processed fruit products on the world market, he said.\nViệt Nam saw a 4.3-per-cent decline in vegetable and fruit export value during the first nine months of this year to US$2.84 billion. — Photo saigondautu.vn\nWhen they meet international standards, the farmers could get planting area codes, according to the association.\nThe Vietnamese authorities will continue to negotiate with China to expand the list of fruits allowed to export under commercial contracts into this market, Nguyên said.\nIn 2017, Việt Nam's vegetable industry recorded a total export turnover at more than $3 billion, up 42.5 per cent year on year, being one of the top four agricultural, forestry and fishery products gaining the highest export value.\nThe Chinese market still accounted for more than 70 per cent of Việt Nam's total vegetable and fruit export value with $2.65 billion, up 52.4 per cent. This was also the year, Vietnamese fruit products entered many fastidious markets such as Japan, US and Australia. So, the export value was expected to have impressive growth, reaching $10 billion in 2025.\nThe growth was also expected to continue in 2018. However, last year’s export value of vegetables and fruits increased by only 10.8 per cent year on year to $3.5 billion.\nDespite this, exports were still much higher than many commodities such as tea, pepper and rice.

VNA/VNS Photo Hồ Cầu\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam has made good progress in human development, with an average annual Human Development Index (HDI) growth of 1.36 per cent during the 1990-2018 period.\nThis places Việt Nam among the group of countries with the highest HDI growth rates in the world.\nThis is one of the key finding of the 2019 Human Development Report, released on Monday by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) entitled “Beyond income, beyond averages, beyond today: Inequalities in human development in the 21st Century.”\nAddressing the report launch in Hà Nội, UNDP Resident Representative Caitlin Wiesen said the 2019 Human Development Report disclosed the next generation of inequalities emerging around digital technology, education, and the climate crisis and proposes new ways of measuring and approaching inequalities.\nWiesen praised Việt Nam for having firmly embarked on people-centered development and equality in its current socio-economic development strategies and plans.\n“Việt Nam’s significant Human Development progress since 1990 has been achieved with relatively low increases in inequality,” she said.\n“Taking into account the Inequality Adjusted HDI, Việt Nam is eight places higher than its HDI ranking in 2018.”\n“Việt Nam is at a critical juncture as it designs its next Socio-Economic Development Strategy, with decisions made today determining whether the country will continue its current pattern of growth with relatively low inequality or whether new forms of emerging inequalities will be further entrenched and deepened with unsustainable growth pathways.”\nAccording to the report, Việt Nam’s 2018 HDI of 0.693 is above the average of 0.634 for countries in the Medium Human Development group.\nViệt Nam ranks 118th out of 189 countries, and needs only an additional 0.007 points to join the High Human Development group. Việt Nam’s HDI rank in 2018 is higher than India’s, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Cambodia.\nMeanwhile, Việt Nam’s loss of HDI value due to inequality in 2018 is 16.3 per cent, its loss of income due to inequality is 18.1 per cent and, its GINI coefficient – a statistical measure of economic inequality in a population – at 35.3 – are among the lowest in the East Asia and Pacific region.\nViệt Nam has also been performing well in terms of gender equality. The Gender Development Index value of 1.003 puts the country in the top five groups of 166 countries in the world, with Việt Nam ranking 68th out of 162 countries in Gender Inequality Index. Particularly commendable is the share of seats in parliament which places Việt Nam among the top third of countries globally.\nHowever, Caitlin said, there were important areas for improvement. Việt Nam ranks among the bottom third of countries globally in terms of sex ratio at birth (1.12), violence against women by non-intimate partners (34.4 per cent) and women with accounts in financial institutions or with mobile money service provider (30.4 per cent).\nAlthough Việt Nam’s forest coverage as among the top third of countries globally, the country is among the bottom third of countries in terms of carbon emission per capita.\nAddressing these would be a key challenge to ensure the sustainability of Việt Nam’s growth, she said.\nCaitlin suggested that Việt Nam should raise people’s awareness on sex-selection issue.\n“If it is not addressed, they will create lots of destruction for Việt Nam in the future,” she told Việt Nam News.\nNguyễn Tiến Phong, Assistant Resident Representative of UNDP, said regarding to socio-economic sustainability, a lot of jobs generated by small and medium enterprises did not require skills, meaning Việt Nam ranks low in skilled labour force and vulnerable employment.\nVũ Đại Thắng, Vice Minister of Ministry of Planning and Investment said Việt Nam has issued an action plan on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.\nThe Vietnamese Government’s determination was represented by the Nation Assembly's\xa0approval of the master plan on socio-economic development for ethnic minority people with the goal of ensure equality in human development. It was in accordance with the spirit “Don’t leave any one behind” upheld by the government, he said. — VNS",1

A partnership was created in 2016 that made Family responsible for administering community-based HIV testing for high-risk groups, including men having sex with men (MSM), finding cases of infection and persuading them to have antiretroviral (ARV) treatment with the support of Thái Nguyên CDC and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nSince then, the group of 20 members has provided free HIV screening tests for 700 people and accompanied 200 HIV-infected people on their ARV treatment journeys.\nMost of them are students and workers, aged from 18 to 25.\n“It is not simple to convince MSM to take HIV tests as they have to face enormous social stigma and always tend to hide their own identity,” Hoàng said.\n“Over the past four years, we have approached a thousand MSM. In conversations, we avoid mentioning sexual orientations and HIV, instead, we introduce our services of providing free condoms and lubricants. The process has to be repeated over and over again to build trust until they are comfortable enough to expose themselves and are ready to take tests,” he added.\nSo far, this year, the group has uncovered 37 cases of new HIV infections. All of them were sent to Thái Nguyên CDC for treatment.\n“We face huge challenges dealing with clients’ emotions while waiting for their test results,” said Hoàng. “Administering a test is easy, you only need to follow certain steps but no one has ever told us how to psychologically support people while they are waiting for the results.”\nOne of Family’s earliest clients committed suicide. The tragic incident has haunted Hoàng for years.\n“It used to take a week for test results to come back. It was hell for our clients. Sucidal thoughts came up at night when they were all alone. We had to follow them, and talk to them about self-harming,” he said.\n“Now, test results are ready within a day, and we tell them being HIV-positive is not a death sentence as long as they follow ARV treatment. That is really a relief.”\nThere is a bookshelf filled with dozens of Japanese\xa0manga\xa0comics in Hoàng’s tiny bedsit, which also serves as a meeting place and test centre.\n“Clients can read a couple pages of the comics while waiting for their test results. It stops them from thinking too much, even for 20 minutes,” he said.\n\n\nFamily’s bookshelf is filled with comics and brochures for clients to read while waiting for their results. —\xa0VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nPaying back\nLê Thanh Hậu used to be a drug user before witnessing his family break into pieces.\nReturning from a local drug rehab centre in 2016, he started revamping his life by becoming a volunteer at Thái Nguyên Province Outpatient Clinic, supporting ARV patients and searching for new cases of HIV infections.\n“It was strange how health workers at Thái Nguyên CDC treated me dearly like a family member,” Hậu said. “Their kindness motivated me to do something good in order to pay back for the sinful past I left behind.”\nAlong with four friends, Hậu wanders into countless alleys in Thái Nguyên City and nearby localities in search of drug users to convince them to take HIV tests.\n“There used to be some infamous spots where hundreds of needles used to hang out of banana trees,” Hậu said.\n“The situation has changed a lot now. Drug users are getting younger. They prefer amphetamine-type stimulants like ecstasy which make them lose control and become more vulnerable to HIV due to unsafe sex,” he added.\nSome of Hậu’s friends, who were unable to quit the habit, show him where addicts gather.\n“People say I will fall back into my old ways if I keep on visiting drug dens. But no way, I have paid enough,” said Hậu.\nThis year, Hậu’s group has found 18 cases of HIV infections and helped 120 patients to undergo ARV treatment.\n“I receive a monthly allowance of only VNĐ300,000 (US$13) but I never want to quit this job.”\nMore than anyone, Hậu understands the discrimination HIV-infected people have to tolerate.\n“Compared with removing a scar from my arm, fighting against stigma is so difficult. People with HIV need social acceptance and tolerance to step out of their dark zones and undergo treatment. The mission would be impossible without the community’s participation,” he said.\nCommunities make the difference\n“They are our trusted partners,” said CDC Thái Nguyên Deputy Director Lê Ái Kim Anh about Hoàng and Hậu.\nThái Nguyên Province is ranked fourth nationwide in terms of the number of people suffering from HIV, following Hà Nội, HCM City and Hải Phòng, and sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise.\nWith nine colleges and two industrial zones, the province has a high population, making it hard to estimate the number of HIV-positive cases.\nThanks to restless efforts of community groups, more than 79 per cent of people living with HIV know their status, nearly 73 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV receive sustained ARV therapy, and over 95 per cent of them have viral suppression treatment.\n“Communities make the difference in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” said Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control.\n“However, the withdrawal of foreign resources has posed several challenges to these groups as they do not have legal status or financing. We are working with them to overcome these difficulties,” he added.\nTo Hoàng, funding cuts do not bother him much.\n“We estimate there are 5,000 HIV-infected people who have no idea about their status. Our journey has not come to an end yet,” he said.\nAnd to Hậu, “being an event planner helps to sustain my social service. Why stop when I still feel content doing this job?” — VNS\nLê Thanh Hậu plays guitar at home where also serves as his group’s meeting place. — VNS Photo Khoa Thư",1

When their\xa0dustbins are full, they just need open the mGreen app on their smartphones and call our waste collectors,” Thoa said.\nThe waste is\xa0transported to junk shops or recycling factories that buy recyclable waste for treatment.\n“People receive\xa0points depending on the amount of waste that can\xa0be redeemed for goods and services such as entertainment and dining,” she said.\nNguyễn Thị Trà My, a resident of\xa0Hà Đông District, who lives in one of the first buildings that mGreen trialled the project,\xa0said the app provided a good solution to better protect the environment.\n“I have been registered with\xa0mGreen for nearly a\xa0year and find it really effective and easy,” she said.\n“I can now easily classify waste at home and just wait for the collectors\xa0to take it\xa0away,” she added.\n“Many residents in my building use the app. It requires at least the participation of 60 households per building to implement the programme,” My said.\nApart from raising public awareness of waste sorting, mGreen is also aimed at creating jobs and a better working environment for waste collectors who are considered among the vulnerable groups of workers in society, Thoa said.\nHowever, the road was not as smooth as Thảo had imagined.\n“At first, it was not easy to get residents to use the app because most Vietnamese people are not in the habit of sorting their\xa0waste,” she said.\nCapital shortage is the biggest challenge, she said. The project chiefly depends on funds from individuals, organisations and businesses.\nThe lack of space for processing the\xa0waste after it's collected also needs to be handled, she said.\nInitial achievements\nThe project, however, has yielded positive results. It has so far encouraged the involvement of nearly 3,000 households and\xa02,000 pupils and teachers in Hà Nội and HCM City.\nStarting operations in May\xa02018, mGreen helped to classify and collect three\xa0tonnes of recyclable waste that year.\nThe company plans to co-ordinate with the Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union Central Committee to implement waste classification models to other localities next year after it has been\xa0successfully deployed on a trial basis in Hà Nội and HCM City.\nTrần Thị Thoa, co-founder of mGreen, is awarded the second prize at the Start-up and Innovative Competition with the theme\xa0“Women and the future of the green economy”, which was\xa0launched by the Ministry of Science and Technology, World Bank and the Việt Nam Women’s Union in June. — VNA/VNS Photo Anh Tuấn\nThe project was named among the top three creative and innovative technology projects in\xa0Hà Nội and in the top five at Start-up Journey 2017.\nIn June 2019, Thoa won second prize for the Start-up and Innovative Competition “Women and the future of the green economy” launched by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Việt Nam Women’s Union.\nTheir biggest achievement was teaching people to classify\xa0waste at source\xa0– one of the key problems in handling urban waste, which helped reduce waste treatment costs\xa0and increased efficiency at\xa0waste treatment facilities, according to Thoa.\nChallenges remain but Thoa said she could foresee the\xa0long-term impact of the project was to gradually raise public awareness and change\xa0their habits\xa0for a greener Việt Nam. — VNS",5

According to a survey conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO), Việt Nam is among the countries having the longest working hours – 48 hours per week among the 194 countries and territories in the world.\nRegarding the annual leave, according to a survey conducted in 155 countries, Việt Nam is among the countries having the least annual leave per year - 12 days.\nRegarding the working days in a year, Việt Nam is in the group having the highest working hours in the world. According to a survey on the working hours conducted in 2014, Việt Nam ranks 3rd among the group of nations having the highest working hours internationally with average from 2,339.55 hours per annum- only after Cambodia and Bangladesh.\nAmong the 11 member countries in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ((CPTPP), Việt Nam is a country having the highest working hours. Among ASEAN, Việt Nam ranks 2nd after Cambodia.\nRegarding the extra working hours, compared with other countries, Việt Nam is at a medium level, yet violations of the extra working hours in Việt Nam is rather common. According to a report from labour inspectors in the textile sector, in 2015, 39.5 per cent of enterprises have failed to comply with the working hours written in the Labor Code. It is reported that quite many Vietnamese workers have to work many extra hours to fulfil\xa0their assigned labour norm without extra payment.\nWill you please explain a bit further about the proposal on the extra-working hours written in the revised Labor Code?\nUnder the current law, 12 hours is the top working hours permitted for a worker in a day; no more than 30 hours in a month; and no more than 200 hours in a year. However, in a special circumstance, a worker can work up to 300 hours a year. Yet, during the implementation of the law, many enterprises have complained that such restriction on the working hours has some negative impacts on them, particularly in processing contracts; import-export processing factories. As a result, many enterprises have proposed to get rid of the extra-working hours quotas, particularly for enterprises specialized in import-export processing. Meanwhile, quite many enterprises have proposed the lifting of the working hour cap per week/month while still maintaining the cap on the annual over-time working hours.\nI support the idea to increase the working hours, yet the overtime working hours should be paid more than the official working hours. Yet, the decision to ask the workers to work overtime should only be applied in the case of emergency – without planning before.\nDo you support the proposal to cut down the official working hours from 48 hours to 44 hours per week?\nMore recently, prolonged working hours has become an acute problem for many factories’ owners.\nSurveys and investigations on the living conditions of Vietnamese workers which were jointly conducted by the Institute for Workers and Trade Unions, under the Việt Nam Trade Union Federation and some other organizations have indicated that the prolonged working\xa0hours has some how having negative impacts on the employees/workers and their family members, particularly those who have small children.\nFurther more, the earning from extra work, for the majority of people, particularly for parents with small children. For most of the Vietnamese workers, the money earned from extra work is just used to compensate for the money they have to pay for their baby sitters after the kindergarten closure and others. That’s why the Việt Nam General Confederation of Labour has come up with a proposal to cut down the working hours from 48 hours/week to 44 hour/week._VNS'",1

Initially, each toll booth will have both ETC system-integrated lane and cash-collecting lane for vehicles which do not use the service,” said MoT.\nAccording to VETC Chairman of the Board Phạm Văn Lượng, the company has signed contracts with only 11 of 44 booths as BOT investors are reluctant to hand over lanes to make room for the installation of ETC toll plazas.\nOthers, however, have not paid fees although the stations were completed and handed over.\nMeanwhile, agreements on profit sharing rates have not been settled between VETC and BOT investors, delaying the whole project.\nThese obstacles would affect the deadline that would see non-stop toll collection systems operational at all booths nationwide, originally\xa0set for December 12, MoT said.\nBy the end of\xa0September, VETC was estimated to have incurred a loss of VNĐ300 billion ($12 million) due to low fee collections.\nTasco, an investor of the\xa0VETC, also spent the same amount of money to maintain station operation.\nIf the 36 booths come into operation by the end of 2020, the company is predicted to suffer an accumulated loss of up to VNĐ580 million ($25 million).\nThe loss discouraged shareholders from further investment\xa0into the project as they would not get dividends within five years, Lượng said.\nTherefore, the VETC urged the MoT to seek other investors or ask\xa0the Government to take over.\nThe ministry said the number of vehicles using e-tags which allow free flow through ETC\xa0toll booths remained too low compared to the initial plan, accounting for under 30 per cent as drivers still preferred using cash, while the processes of topping-up and managing accounts were not user-friendly.\nAfter considering the VETC’s request, the MoT refused to halt the project or hand it over to the Government.\nThe ministry asked the company to keep the signed contract and promised to work with it and other related agencies to resolve difficulties.\nThe MoT will implement traffic separation at toll booths on National Highway no.1 and gateways of big cities to encourage car drivers to use the service.\nThe ministry will also re-evaluate the project’s financial plan to determine the sharing rate for the ETC system’s operation expenses on highways managed by Việt Nam Expressway Corporation as a basis for early signing of service contracts.\nFor the project’s second phase, the MoT asked investors to work with agencies to establish a joint venture and carry on with the plan. — VNS",1

1986,'Exchange efficiency key to exhibition success',"'Visitors at the\xa0Việt Nam International Trade Fair 2018 held in HCM City. Photo courtesy of Vinexad\nExchange efficiency is a crucial constituent element of the success of an exhibition, enhancing trade promotion and encouraging\xa0businesses to participate more and more in exhibition activities. Nguyễn Hồng Nhung, Deputy General Director of Việt Nam National Trade Fair & Advertising Company (VINEXAD) share insights of exhibition organisation with Việt Nam News.\nViệt Nam now has about 100 international exhibitions in Hà Nội and HCM City. Exhibitions in HCM City are attracting more businesses than those in Hà Nội. Why is this?\nThe Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre in HCM City, where most of the largest exhibitions are held, meets all the standards in technical and area for expansion. The fair organisers attach great importance to exchange efficiency between exhibitors, visitors and passive customers, strongly focusing on their needs and market requirements. Efficient exchanges and successful transactions during and after each exhibition help increase the size of the next event.\nAccording to our statistics, the scale of an exhibition in HCM City is usually 25-30 per cent higher than those held in Hà Nội. For example, the Việt Nam Expo, to be held in HCM City on December 4-7, expects participating businesses to increase by 20 per cent and the number of visitors to rise by 30 per cent.\nSome argue the number of visitors attending an exhibition is not as important as the quality of visitors, what is your opinion?\nGenerally, the increase of scale refers to the enhancement of quality, but the most decisive element of the success of an exhibition is the “efficiency of exchanges” as this brings in more value than the number of visitors, especially for cases of specialised exhibitions, such as Việt Nam Hardware and Hand Tools Expo, Việt Nam Garden & Landscape Expo, Việt Nam MediPharm Expo and The VietFood, Beverage and Professional Packing Machines.\nTo attract exhibitors who are large, multinational corporations, the organisers must have a wide data file and good relationships with domestic and foreign trade promotion organisations, enhanced identification system and updated technology.\nLast but not least, the organisers must emphasise the “spirit” of an exhibition career, which refers to the prioritisation of business interests. As a member of the Global Association of the Exhibition Industry (UFI), Vinexad has linked a number of our exhibitions to the network, organised UFI Approved International Events and a series of meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) tour programmes. These efforts help connect the domestic and international business community.\nYou mentioned the “spirit” of the exhibition career, can you elaborate on this concept?\nCurrently, many domestic and foreign enterprises participate in the exhibition industry. There are now some 53 exhibitions held annually at the Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre (SECC) in HCM City, meaning that exhibitions are held once a week.\nThis figure creates a lot of pressure on the event organisers, forcing them to try their best to attract more and more businesses to participate in the expos. From the perspective of Vinexad, one of the flagship organisers in the exhibition industry, we are proud to be the holder of the oldest fair events in Việt Nam, such as Việt Nam Expo Hà Nội 2020, which is 30 years old.\nWe are also pioneers in specialised exhibitions such as the Việt Nam Hardware and Hand Tools Expo, with the fastest growth rate among the specialised exhibitions (30 per cent).\nThe “spirit” of exhibition career is the promotion and prioritisation of business benefits and\xa0the determination to contribute to the development of the industry through each exhibition.'",2

However, the registration and protection of intellectual property rights had gone largely ignored\xa0by domestic enterprises.\nAccording to PwC Vietnam, the average proportion of the value of intangible assets in total enterprise value worldwide in 2016 was 53 per cent, but this proportion among\xa0Vietnamese enterprises was only 26 per cent.\nIP registration of intangible assets aims to ensure they are exclusively used to promote the enterprises. Importantly, it is weapon to proactively combat counterfeit and pirated goods, and protect market shares for\xa0goods and services domestically and internationally.\nStatistics show that the number of applications for trademark protection filed at the Intellectual Property Office of Việt Nam (Ministry of Science and Technology) is increasing. Before 1990, only about 300 to 2,000 applications for trademark protection were made each year. From 1990 to 2005, an average of 4,500 applications were filed annually. Since 2010, that figure has risen to 32,000-50,000.\nHowever, Quang said: “These numbers are still too low, especially compared to the number of enterprises in the country.”\nAccording to the newly published White Book on Vietnamese Enterprises, at the end of 2018, the number of operating enterprises was 714,755, with the number of newly-established enterprises rising sharply. In the first nine months of this year, the Government Statistics Office counted more than 100,000 newly-established enterprises nationwide.\nParticipants at a recent conference on IP in Hà\xa0Nội found that enterprises were slow to register for IP both at home and overseas, although Việt Nam's export turnover had continuously increased in recent years.\nFor example, since 2015, the rate of filing for registration of designs in Japan has increased thanks to the Lahay Agreement on international registration of industrial designs, managed by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). Since then, 50 per cent of applications filed in Japan have been from foreign companies. Having joined the agreement a month ago, not many Vietnamese enterprises have bothered to take advantage of it.\nThe Intellectual Property Office said the number of industrial design registration applications of Vietnamese enterprises in foreign countries accounted for a very small portion. For example, there are only 10 registered designs in the United States and 166 in the European Union.\nQuang urged: “Enterprises should register to protect their IP. At the same time, they should build and follow an IP strategy, and set up an IP data system to track updates with competitors so they can prevent infringements.”\nCurrent IP enforcement was mostly done by State agencies, without active participation of businesses and consumers. He told businesses not to avoid or be afraid to sue when there was an IP infringement.\nTrần Giang Khuê, in charge of the southern branch of the Intellectual Property Office, said enterprises needed special teams to deal with the issue. “It is either register now or lose your trademark,” Khuê said. — VNS",2

Standard & Poor’s (S&P) has assigned Nutifood preliminary ‘B’ long-term isuer credit rating with stable outlook. -- Photo news.zing.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Standard & Poor’s (S&P) has assigned preliminary ‘B’ long-term issuer credit rating with stable outlook for Vietnamese Nutifood Nutrition Food Joint Stock Company.\nIts rating was based on the expectation that Nutifood would successfully issue the proposed US-dollar senior unsecured notes and use the proceeds of the bond to repay debt of about US$115 million to fund product development, upgrade and expansion of production facilities, the global rating company said.\nNutifood has a small scale and market share in Việt Nam’s dairy market with 8 per cent market share, far behind the biggest player Vietnam Dairy Products JSC (Vinamilk) with 40 per cent and FrieslndCampina Vietnam Co Ltd with 17 per cent market\xa0 share, according to Euromonitor.\nNutifood’s small scale will constrain the company’s earnings predictability for at least the next three years. S&P expect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to average VNĐ1.7 trillion ($73 million) between 2019 and 2021. Vinamilk’s EBITDA is nearly eight times that of Nutiood.\nThe company, however, has a well-established brand in the niche segment of specialty milk with its ‘GrowPlus+’ brand increasing to become the second-largest brand in the milk formula segment with nearly 14 per cent of market share.\nS&P expects it to remain focused on its core dairy business, which will still account for more than 90 per cent of its net revenue over the next two years.\nThe proposed note issuance will ensure liquidity for the next 24 months but also expose Nutifood to foreign currency fluctuations, given its revenues are substantially denominated in Vietnamese đồng, S&P said.\nCompetition in Việt Nam’s dairy market will likely stay high, especially after the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) removed import tariffs on dairy products from New Zealand, Singapore and Japan.\nHowever, the stable outlook reflects S&P’s expectation that Nutifood will largely preserve its market share in the Vietnamese dairy industry over the next 24 months with its significant brand equity as the company continues to expand its operations. – VNS",2
4506,'Busan – stunning beaches and seafood',"Fishcakes, a specialty\xa0of Busan.\nThu Giang\nBUSAN — Busan, a beautiful port city in South Korea, has many reasons for you to visit – stunning beaches with sightseeing cruises, hidden pagodas, the colourful Gamcheon Cultural Village, and, of course, the delicious seafood.\nWith plenty of local specialties, Busan is the place for seafood lovers to\xa0discover a glimpse of daily life through lively markets and street food.\nMy colleagues and I were lucky enough to be invited on\xa0a special media tour of\xa0Busan during which we discovered the local culture and lifestyle.\nWith winter temperatures dropping to 1-4 degrees Celsius, the warm atmosphere at Jagalchi Market was the perfect place to spend our first day in city. On the first floor we found a veritable sea world with octopus, oysters, cockles, Korean rockfish, crabs and prawns on\xa0display.\nWe were welcomed by the warm smiles of the vendors who despite having limited English, enticed us in and explained the prices using calculators. The idea is to buy the fresh seafood on the first floor and then take it upstairs to be cooked at a restaurant.\nOne woman told Việt Nam News with help from an interpreter that the market started to get busy at 5am when the fishermen arrived back from their trips, loaded with that night's catch. After that the loud voice of an auctioneer welcomes the morning as the market and vendors open up with signs displaying what's on offer that day.\n“Lunch and dinner are the most exciting times of\xa0the day when visitors come to the market to enjoy local seafood. We invite them to buy our fresh\xa0seafood and guide them to the restaurant on the second floor to enjoy,” she said.\n“The market quietens down after\xa010pm when the last visitors leave the restaurants. Some people finish for the day while others are just starting. Jagalchi is busy and full of life all day long,” she added.\nJagalchi is seen as a symbol of Busan because it still operates\xa0in a traditional manner\xa0and people use the local language to make transactions. With seafood bought from this market, local people make famous traditional dishes for their families, such as soups, sausages and fishcakes.\nAs a port city, Busan is famous for its eomuk, or fishcakes, a popular street food. They are\xa0made from\xa0ground white fish and other ingredients such as potato starch, vegetables and sugar. Eomuk is also used for soup, side dishes and kimbap. Eomuk-tang is served on a skewer in broth, making it a very popular form of street food in Busan.\nAnother fun thing to do in Busan is take\xa0a tour combined with a\xa0cooking class. During the tour, we learned more about the origins of eomuk and the different varieties, before getting down to action in the kitchen.\nThe traditional Korean eomuk is thin and rectangular, but visitors can visit several restaurants to learn how to make eomuk with\xa0rice, rolls and skewers.\nChef Eom Jaehyeon at\xa0Goraesa Eomuk restaurant teaches visitors how to make\xa0eomuk dishes, and told Việt Nam News that freshly ground\xa0fish is\xa0mixed with a small volume of wheat flour and other ingredients before being made into fishcakes of\xa0various shapes and fried.\nVisitors are welcome to sample the fruits of their labour there and then or take it home with them.\n“We welcome both Korean and foreign visitors, especially children, and teach them about the origins of eomuk as well as how to make various dishes,” Jajhyeon said.\nFrom farm to table\nA ‘From farm to table’ tour in Tongyeong was an exciting day for us as it was reserved for the\xa0media only.\nTaking about 15 minutes by\xa0cable car to reach Tongyeong, a southern coastal city in\xa0Gyeongsang Nam Province, it gave us the chance to enjoy great views across the southern coast with its many islands.\nFrom the cable car, we could\xa0see oyster farms\xa0in Tongyeong that produce\xa0about 80 per cent of South Korea’s oyster catch.\nAn oyster processing line at\xa0Dai One Food Company in Tongyeong.\nIn Korea, oysters are known as the “milk of the sea” as Koreans believe they contain twice as much protein as milk.\xa0The best season for oysters is mid-winter to early spring.\nWe started the tour at an oyster processing line at\xa0Dai One Food Company. The line has\xa0about 150 workers who focus solely on shelling the\xa0oysters using shucks.\nMost of the workers are female, and many are\xa0Vietnamese.\nNguyễn Thị Uyên, 32, whose hands were constantly at work, said\xa0she had\xa0married a Korean man\xa0ten years ago, and they\xa0have two children.\n“I have worked here for six years. I am one of the most skillful workers at\xa0shelling\xa0oysters here. The most important thing is to locate where to open the shell before scraping the flesh out,” Uyên said.\n“The company welcomes ‘Vietnamese brides’ to work here. This job helps me earn about US$2,000-3,000 per month,” she added.\nThe shucked oyster are then taken to another\xa0processing line where they are cleaned in\xa0seawater to remove any impurities. The workers then select them by\xa0size and\xa0pack them in\xa0ice and clean water before they're taken to trucks waiting outside the factory.\nThe leftover\xa0shells are taken to\xa0a big grinder outside the factory where they are pulverised to be used with other materials to make\xa0fertiliser for cultivation.\nSouth Korea’s southern waters are home to\xa0small coastal bays with shallow water, making them ideal to farm oysters.\xa0The prized shellfish are rich in nutrients and characterised by their size. Local farmers can harvest oysters when they are one year old, but oldest ones at\xa0five years old are about the size of a human hand.\nThis oyster grounds are clean and\xa0certified by the US Food and Drug Administration.\nA meal full of oyster dishes, from raw oysters in Korean chili paste with vinegar to pan-fried oysters, oyster salad, and rice soup with oysters at a restaurant in Tongyeong City. Photos Thu Giang\nOysters are among the best of all Tongyeong’s specialties. My day came to the perfect end enjoying a series of dishes at a restaurant in the city.\nIt’s the first time in my life I've enjoyed a\xa0meal based solely on oysters, from dipping raw oysters in Korean chili paste with vinegar to pan-fried oysters, oyster salad, and rice soup with oysters.\nThe chef showed us different ways to enjoy the dishes while explaining that oysters are low in fat and calories, making them great for people on a diet.\nDelicious seafood dishes, stunning beaches and a yellow autumn all make me believe I will return to\xa0Busan with my family in the future. — VNS",5

We need the whole society’s engagement in detecting HIV infections, offering appropriate treatments and ensuring privacy of HIV-infected people at healthcare stations to push back against AIDS,” said Đam.\nWorkers at industrial parks in the northern province of Thái Nguyên are given instructions on how to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission. — VNA/VNS Photo Dương Ngọc\nChanges and challenges\nEamonn Murphy, Regional Director of UNAIDS, Asia and the Pacific, stressed upon Việt Nam’s significant achievements towards the 90-90-90 target set by the United Nations.\nIt aims to have 90 per cent of infected people knowing their status, 90 per cent of that group accessing sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and 90 per cent of those treated patients having the virus suppressed.\nAccording to Murphy, from 2010 to 2018, Việt Nam managed to reduce new HIV infections by 65 per cent, recording the greatest leap in the Asia-Pacific region in controlling virus transmission.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the ARV treatment programme in Việt Nam.\nOver the past two decades, the programme has continuously expanded its coverage to save many HIV-infected people.\nSince March 2019, Vietnamese people living with HIV have switched to receiving ARV covered by social healthcare insurance, making Việt Nam one of few countries allocating the social insurance fund to pay for the treatment.\nMany innovative approaches have been adopted to introduce a wide range of treatment options and prevention choices including community led and self-testing, PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and opioid substitution therapy (OST).\n“Acting together, Việt Nam can remain at the forefront of the HIV response in the region, sharing how to leave no one behind and share its experience with the world. This is such a tremendous force for change for HIV but also to demonstrate what is possible for Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.\nSince 2018, Việt Nam has worked restlessly to promote the Undetectable=Untransmittable or U=U (K=K in Vietnamese) – a campaign which encourages people living with HIV to have continual ARV treatment to have their viral load suppressed and stop the virus from being passed on.\n“U=U is a spiritual message of hope which tells HIV-infected people they can have a normal family and normal lifespan because of advances and if you stay adherent to the treatment,” Murphy added.\nMeanwhile, the gap in access among regions, existing social stigma, new types of drugs putting people at multiple risks of HIV as well as the rise of new infections among vulnerable groups including men having sex with men (MSM) are still setting barriers, hindering Việt Nam from realising the goal of putting an end to AIDS by 2030.\n“HIV/AIDS has dropped out of the headlines thanks to significant improvements in disease prevention and control,” said Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control under the Ministry of Health.\n“On the other hand, the less attention is dangerous because if we do not pay enough care, the epidemic may rise again.”\nAccording to Long, about 40 per cent of people living with HIV in Viet Nam do not benefit from ARV. To accomplish the ambitious goal by 2030, the number of annual new infections in Việt Nam has to not surpass 1,000. However, at present, each year, 10,000 new cases are reported.\n“There is a huge gap which needs the collaboration of the whole society to close,” he added. —\xa0VNS\nDoctor Lê Thanh Lâm (middle) takes care of a patient with HIV at HCM City-based Nhân Ái Hospital. — VNA/VNS Photo Xuân Khu'",1

An excellent chef must have his own nuances and opinions, always protecting the dishes he creates. When working with colleagues, I often select good words to contribute food ideas and share experiences with them. I developed a clear but gentle and harmonious discipline so that everyone listens to each other.\nThe biggest difficulty for me is to control the input materials to ensure quality. To solve this problem, my colleagues and I usually discuss and make choices before negotiating with suppliers. The main goal is to ensure the correct menu as well as nutritional ingredients, while keeping the price affordable. With my creation and experience, I will create attractive and valuable dishes with delicious flavours to satisfy customers.\nTo convey the Vietnamese culinary soul to both domestic and international guests, I create frugal, high-fiber and low-fat dishes. Spicy flavours should not be mixed into dishes, but separated so that diners can add to their taste. The soul of Vietnamese food often lies in various types of sauces. Thailand also uses fish sauce, but Vietnamese fish sauce has a lot of flavours, from North to South, each area has different ways of mixing, each style has its own unique taste.\nChefs are like artists. Chefs need to have emotions when cooking.

It was all I had wanted to be, so when the job offer came I jumped at the chance.\nI spent three years as a first officer moving up to captain.\nI have spent more than 2,000 hours flying and each day I make six trips between Hà Nội and Hạ Long.\nTo the passengers, I’m sure they don’t really see that big a difference between flying a seaplane opposed to a regular plane, but for me, the difference is huge.\nLanding on the water feels more free. There is no one there to prepare the landing site for you. Often you could come across boats, or even small canoes.\nAt that point you have to make split second decisions to change your landing spot.\nRunways are made of concrete, they are stable, secure, but when you land on the water it is a whole different ball game. Conditions can change at the drop of a hat, winds, waves, all have to be taken into consideration.\nIt is challenging but rewarded.\nHa Long Bay is regarded the world over as one of the most beautiful places on the planet, and for me, I am blessed to be able to call this spectacular place my office.\nEach day when I come in to land and I look out of the cockpit window, I just know that following my dreams was the best decision I ever made. —\xa0VNS'",2

There is also a shortage of establishments that produce marine fish fry.\nAs of this month, the province has 3,464 floating cages that breed various kinds of marine fish species, up 27 per cent against the same period last year.\nThe marine fish species include cobia, grouper, black banded trevally and white pomfret.\nLast year, the province bred nearly 21,800ha of bivalve mollusks with a total output of 66,000 tonnes.\nThe bivalve mollusks, mostly mud clam, blood cockles and green mussels, are bred in alluvial grounds, shrimp ponds and mangrove forests.\nThe province estimates that it will be breeding bivalve mollusks on an area of 22,700ha with total output of 78,100 tonnes this year, according to the department.\nThe province also has about 50ha of oyster farming area for harvesting pearls in Phú Quốc District. Private enterprise Ngọc Hiền Pearl has invested in the area that produced about 250,000 pearls last year. The district’s pearl farming has contributed to tourism.\nIn recent years, the province has called on companies to invest in farming marine fish with advanced techniques.\nThe Trấn Phú Trading and Import-Export Co Ltd in Phú Quốc District is breeding white pomfret and red drum in floating cages with Norwegian techniques.\nIn the 2016-18 period, the company had four such floating cages with a total output of 100 tonnes a year. This year, the company added eight floating cages.\nIn July, the province gave approval to the Mavin Group to invest in breeding marine fish in Kiên Hải District for export. The project will cover 2,000ha of surface water off the coast of Kiên Hải and cost US$30 million.\nThe project is scheduled to operate in 2021 and will produce 30,000 tonnes of marine fish a year.\nThe province has nearly 200km of coast and favourable natural conditions for breeding fish in floating cages. — VNS",1

Its after-tax profit was down 73 per cent to VNĐ152 billion ($6.6 million).\nA report from Viet Capital Securities Company said DPM’s profit target in 2019 would likely decrease by 17.3 per cent.\nBình Điền Fertiliser Company (BFC) reported a similar situation with turnover and profit declining by 8.8 and 72.7 per cent.\nThe Southern Fertiliser Group made a loss of VNĐ8.9 billion with the third quarter alone accounting for VNĐ4.3 billion.\nA company spokesperson said sales fell sharply in the third quarter.\nWhy is this happening to fertiliser companies?\nThe DPM management said the bad weather was one of the main reasons the company found it difficult to sell products in the third quarter.\nA BFC spokesperson concurred with this, adding that the agricultural sector also faced a deep drop in prices meaning many localities had to reduce their production targets.\nImports of foreign fertilisers remain at a very high level, which also causes difficulties for the domestic industry.\nAccording to the General Customs Department, in the first five months of this year Việt Nam imported more than 1.7 million tonnes of fertilisers for US$488 million.\nA DPM spokesperson said besides the market difficulties they also had to cope with a sharp increase in fuel prices.\nBut analysts said the biggest problem for fertiliser producers was the value added tax (VAT) policy, which significantly eroded their profits.\nFertilisers are not subject to VAT, and this means producers are not entitled to VAT refunds on inputs including machinery and equipment and other fixed assets, which increases cost by 5-8 per cent.\nMany fertiliser companies have repeatedly petitioned lawmakers to amend Law No.71/2014/QH13 that waives VAT on fertilisers to help them in their current plight.\nThey explained that this waiver badly hit\xa0companies, especially those that had invested in modern technology.\nPVFCCo, for instance, should have got VAT returns of VNĐ1 trillion between 2015 and 2017.\nAnalysts said lawmakers should add fertilisers to the list of products that are subject to VAT. —VNS'",2

More than 1,000 South Korean investment projects in Việt Nam were the result of tireless efforts made by both sides to\xa0work\xa0together for a common goal.\nThe Vietnamese leader called for Korean enterprises to invest in Việt Nam’s processing and manufacturing sector, auxiliary\xa0industry, renewable energy and fintech, as well as in industries that Korean firms held\xa0competitive advantages such as logistics and shipbuilding.\nIn addition, he urged the two sides to strengthen co-operation in the fields of education and healthcare with the objective of\xa0building state-of-the-art medical facilities in Việt Nam.\nThe PM asked Korea to open its market even more for Vietnamese products\xa0to help realise a goal to increase two-way trade to US$100 billion in 2020.\nDuring the forum, both sides signed 33 memoranda\xa0of understanding for projects worth nearly $20 billion, bringing Korean investment in Việt Nam close to $80 billion to date from current $67 billion.\nMeanwhile, Deputy PM and Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki stressed the significance of the forum, while saying that Korean investment in Việt Nam has expanded over the years, making the RoK the biggest foreign investor of the country with a rise of 37 per cent each year. Việt Nam is also the biggest investment recipient among ASEAN countries.\nHe suggested that Korean firms grasp opportunities to invest in Việt Nam as the two countries’ relationship is on a flourishing period.\nWith their strengths, Korean businesses have great cooperation and investment chances in various areas such as construction, infrastructure development, high technology and insurance, while helping Việt Nam promote the potential of the private sector, developing start-ups, taking advantages of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, he asserted.\nHong also expressed his hope that the two governments will work more closely together to deal with difficulties hindering bilateral partnership amidst the changing world situation and trade tensions.\nHe said he expects the forum will open up new investment opportunities for both sides in the future.\nHong said PM Phúc’s visit strengthened\xa0two-way co-operation between the two governments and businesses, and signalled the\xa0importance of the\xa0South Korea-Việt Nam relationship.\nHong urged South Korean companies to take advantage of close ties to invest in Việt Nam, namely in infrastructure development, start-ups and technologies.\nChairman of the Federation of\xa0Korean\xa0Industries (FKI) Huh Chang-soo said Việt Nam had\xa0proven to be a fast-growing and stable economy with huge potential for development. Since the establishment of the two countries’ diplomatic ties, two-way trade between Việt Nam and South Korea had\xa0increased more than a hundredfold.\nThere were over 5,000 South Korean companies operating in Việt Nam, employing more than a million workers, he said.\nIn the future, the FKI would\xa0coordinate with a number of training facilities in Việt Nam in training and sharing the country’s successful stories.\nPM Phúc said people-to-people and cultural exchanges were also important parts of the bilateral relationship. Similarities in culture, value and history between the two peoples were the foundation for even greater co-operation.\nHe said despite\xa0ongoing tensions threatening global commerce, Việt Nam had\xa0maintained robust economic development with GDP growth in 2018 at 6.8 per cent, with\xa0inflation stable at 3.5 per cent. Such factors had\xa0made the Vietnamese\xa0currency\xa0one of the most stable\xa0in Asia and on the global exchange market.\nCoupled with improved national competitiveness – Việt Nam moved up 10 spots to rank 67 in the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report – and an exploding scene of start-ups, Việt Nam had\xa0become one of the world’s top destinations for global investors.\nThe country was also part of numerous trade deals such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), and the pending Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\nViệt Nam and its fast-expanding middle-class and a population of 100 million with an internet penetration rate of 67 per cent had\xa0great potential to develop the digital economy and take full advantage of the coming industrial revolution.\nAt the forum, Vietnamese budget airlines Vietjet unveiled plans to operate direct flights between Seoul and major Vietnamese cities including Đà Lạt, Cần Thơ, Nha Trang and Phú Quốc at the forum. Vietjet said starting from January next year, passengers could\xa0take\xa0flights from Seoul\xa0to the southern province of Cần Thơ three times a week, as well as four flights\xa0per week to the resort town of Đà Lạt. There would also\xa0be more flights from Seoul to resort towns such as Nha Trang and Phú Quốc to meet the increasing demand for air travel.\nInvestment talks\nThe same day, the PM held a discussion with leaders of over 20 leading RoK businesses and investors in various fields such as heavy industry, construction, finance, banking, automobiles, and electronics in Seoul as part of his official visit to the RoK.\nPM Phúc said South Korean businesses and brands had\xa0become widely popular in Việt Nam with a majority of households using at least one South Korean products. Some of South Korea's\xa0largest businesses were thriving in Việt Nam such as Samsung, LG, Huyndai, KIA and Lotte.\nThe South Korean community living in Việt Nam has increased to over 140,000\xa0and is one of the largest to be\xa0found in Asian countries. On the other hand, more than 150,000 Vietnamese are working and living in South Korea.\nHe said the most important advantage South Korean investors could\xa0count on when investing in Việt Nam was the fondness and trust Vietnamese people had\xa0for South Korean brands. Another major advantage for investors was the many similarities in values and preferences between Vietnamese and Koreans.\nHe also wished that RoK investors would\xa0focus more on the medical sector to become major providers of health care services in the Southeast Asian country.\xa0— VNS",2

VNS Photo Bồ Xuân Hiệp\nBồ Xuân Hiệp\nHONG KONG — Vietnamese manufacturers need “integrated marketing solutions” comprising both online and offline platforms to gain access to buyers in both traditional and emerging markets, experts have said.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the Global Sources Lifestyle and Fashion show last week in Hong Kong, Ronald Ng, general manager of Global Sources Lifestyle Group, said Việt Nam had become a manufacturing hub in the Southeast Asian region.\nVietnamese exporters, mostly SMEs, who benefit from operating in one of the world’s fastest growing economies with stable governance and ease of doing business, are very likely to succeed in joining global trade.\nTo build their corporate image, generate sales leads and win orders from global buyers, Vietnamese suppliers should engage in more trade promotion platforms to strengthen linkages with global buyers.\n“In addition to trade shows, online platforms are considered one of the most effective [ways] for them to boost exports to global markets,” he said.\nSince China has moved up the manufacturing value chain, a significant number of international buyers now consider Việt Nam an alternative supply market.\nThe number of orders shifting from China to Việt Nam has increased remarkably.\n“The price advantage is becoming less obvious while the gap in export communication between global buyers and suppliers is growing.”\nOnline platforms are the most convenient channel, providing year-round exposure for buyers to check and learn about suppliers’ capability and then submit online inquiries.\nMeanwhile, offline platforms enable suppliers and buyers to meet face-to-face and gain credibility.\n“Combined, online-to-offline (O2O) is the most comprehensive marketing mix for Vietnamese suppliers to win more business.”\nA recent survey by Global Sources, the event organiser, found that 80 per cent of global buyers preview product and supplier information online before they decide to go to the show\xa0to meet with targeted suppliers.\nSwandi Wikassa, a buyer from Indonesia, said: “Before coming to the show for sourcing, we spent a great deal of time learning about the product and supplier online.”\nAccording to Phạm Thị Hương, former managing director of Việt Nam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex), many Vietnamese products have\xa0good quality and\xa0competitive prices, but global buyers are not even aware of them since they are not available online.\n“Participation in exhibitions helps Vietnamese suppliers promote their products, but it is not enough. They should also look to promote their products via online platforms to reach more global buyers.”\nManufacturers should also study prices, consumer tastes and trends in potential markets, and have labels and packaging in English and the local language, she said.\nTo meet the requirements of global buyers, Vietnamese manufactures should also focus on building brands, using technology in production and improving designs, she added.\nExperts said in choosy markets like the US, the EU, Japan, and South Korea, exporters should be prepared to face technical barriers that could change unexpectedly.\nA number of Vietnamese SMEs have little experience in digital or online marketing and lack\xa0information about the\xa0field and quality human resources, according to the experts.\nMore than 35 leading Vietnamese manufacturers of garments, textiles and fashion accessories and garment-related industries, many members of\xa0the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association and Vinatex, participated in the show.\nLast year Việt Nam’s textile and apparel exports were worth US$36 billion, up 16 per cent year-on-year, making the country one of the world’s three largest exporters.\nThe sector has set itself a target of $40 billion for this year and more than $60 billion by 2025.\nThe country’s economic growth is forecast to be 7.05 per cent for this year on the back of robust FDI and manufacturing exports, according to the Việt Nam Institute for\xa0Economic\xa0and Policy Research.\nThe Hong Kong expo was organised by Global Sources, a B2B platform that connects buyers and suppliers online and offline.\nThe platform includes more than 1.5 million global buyers, including 94 of the world’s top 100 retailers, in\xa0more than\xa0190 countries. — VNS'",2
5316,'Creative centre promotes development',"'Hanoi Creative City is the largest creative complex in Hà Nội. Launched in September 2015, it brings together organisations, businesses, individuals, products and services as well as creative activities.\nBảo Khánh, reporter from Hà Nội Mới’s Weekend,\xa0interviews architect Đoàn Kỳ Thanh, who is one of Hanoi Creative City’s founders.\nArchitect Đoàn Kỳ Thanh\nHow do you assess the creative industry in Việt Nam?\nThe creative industry has prevailed in the world for a long time, while in Việt Nam this concept is still quite new. In fact, the creative industry is not something that is far away. What people imagine is turned into a product through their hands. It is creative industry.\nBut to be creative it is necessary to create an environment for creativity to grow and develop. That environment requires transparency in intellectual property rights. Certain creators must be protected for the products they create. That is the motivation to encourage and acknowledge the efforts and talent of creative people.\nThe creative industry has been showing its great contribution to the GDP of nations. In developed countries, the creative industry even accounts for the largest proportion. Innovative industries in countries such as Japan or Singapore contribute greatly and have high growth rates.\nThe creative industry only appeared\xa0in Việt Nam recently. Compared to other countries in the region, we have been delayed by one step.\nRecently, the Hà Nội Committee\'s Commission\'s for Publicity and\xa0Education organised a workshop to assess and re-examine the benefits of creative spaces in urban areas and the role of creative activities in socio-economic development.\nThis recognition shows the changing perception of managers about the role of creative spaces in socio-economic development and their contribution to the creative industry.\nHowever, there needs to be specific policies and missions.\nWhat is the most important thing for creators?\nIt is tolerance. In the office of Hanoi Creative City, we put the word ""tolerant"" at the highest level to remind our colleagues that to be creative, there must be tolerance to accept the ‘new’. Only tolerance makes people accept the difference of others. Then the difference and tolerance will be the cornerstone of creativity.\nSo where should we start?\nThe first thing that can be done right now is to create hubs that connect resources together.\nThe Vietnamese game Flappy Bird was very successful. To be like that people need to create, write music, graphics, sales and marketing, communications, etc. There must be a lot of capacity to be together to create a product that can convince the market.\nFor that, first, there must be creative hubs, infrastructure, which are hubs for people to share with each other.\nThis is very suitable for the knowledge economy that our country and the world are pursuing. Sharing resources, opportunities or legal issues and governance will create an entrepreneurial ecosystem.\nA business that starts will cost a lot but if it joins hubs it can reduce costs and spend resources investing in innovation and development.\nHà Nội should create creative hubs. It can be seen that the benefits of innovative hubs are to connect the resources that inspire society and those who inspire creativity, attract tourism, and promote trade and production.\nAll these are socially beneficial when people; tourists and the youth in particular enjoy and consume innovative products. It also contributes to the economy. These hubs will create many other opportunities.\nWhat role does traditional cultural heritage play in creative hub development?\nIn fact, creators always consider cultural heritage as an asset, an inspiration, and a material to create from.\nSelling products is just a normal business. We need to sell cultural products and sell ""joy"". To sell cultural products people must know how to exploit and use culture appropriately.\nCultural and creative heritage need each other because creators need these materials. In particular, the more the original elements are kept, the more people benefit economically and commercially.\nSo what role does the creative hub play in developing the creative industry?\nThe art district is a place where young people have a place to play, enjoy art and interact with artists. Hà Nội does not have such art districts.\nArt districts are where artists show, experiment and commercialise their art products and bring them to the public faster and more efficiently.\nHoàn Kiếm District seems to form a creative hub with cultural heritage spaces such as book streets, walking streets or mural streets.\nIn addition to creating creative spaces and cultural spaces, these creative hubs also contribute to preserving heritage spaces and developing tourism.\nHà Nội used to have Zone 9. It once attracted many tourists. Tourists could watch, drinking coffee, buying some items and painting and watching artists work.\nIn your opinion how should we connect traditional culture to youth?\nMany artists around the world and in Việt Nam have done that. There needs to be creative hubs or art districts to have space for the creators show their artworks.\nYoung people today do not have or have very few opportunities to access and transform traditional values. They don’t see and they are not inspired to get to know and like traditional culture.\nI believe that if there are spaces for artists to perform surely young people will love traditional culture.

Photo vneconomy.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Đà Nẵng authorities need to carefully review the offer to convert the\xa0Cocobay Đà Nẵng condotel project into apartments as it could harm the city’s economic development plan,\xa0experts have said.\nThe project developer, Thành Đô Investment Development and Construction JSC (Empire Group), had guaranteed\xa0to pay 12 per cent profit on the value of investors' condotel purchases\xa0from\xa0January 1, 2020, but has since announced it cannot fulfil this commitment\xa0due to financial woes.\nCondotels are often sold to investors and then leased back to the developer or an operating firm to manage rentals to holidaymakers, which is where the 12 per cent profit was supposed to come from.\nA lack of regulations on condotel development and ownership has also harmed the project. The project's developer has said it can only pay condotel owners until December 31, 2019.\nCondotel owners who want to convert their properties to condominiums must register before December 20, with a conversion fee of about 15 per cent of their investment value paid to Empire Group. The fees will fund the construction of garages, schools, parks, healthcare stations and community houses.\nAbout 1,016 of the 1,856 available condotels in three buildings and 554 units out of 1,657 condotels under construction at Cocobay Tower could be converted from condotels into apartments.\nLê Hoàng Châu, Chairman of the HCM City Real Estate Association (HoREA), said the\xa0change would reduce the land area for tourism development and increase residential land.\nHe said having a residential area in a tourism property region will harm the development of the locality and\xa0reduce the value of the complex as well as investment attraction in tourism.\nChâu said land use and construction planning are very important for socio-economic development.\nThe law allows the\xa0adjustment of tourism land use planning if\xa0the planning is not feasible\xa0or no\xa0longer suitable to\xa0the socio-economic development plan. Planning should be not adjusted to benefit investors and harm the community.\nExperts said in fact, condotels are located on\xa0commercial services land but not used as a residential buildings. Therefore, when condotels are converted into apartments, there will be many problems, including security and infrastructure ones.\nVice Chairman of Đà Nẵng Real Estate Association Võ Văn Cường said local authorities should review the planning and capacity of\xa0infrastructure to determine areas that can be converted from condotels to apartments.\nĐà Nẵng has a lot of condotel projects but it has not allowed conversion to apartments because to do so would run contrary to\xa0municipal planning.\nCường said when adjusting planning, State agencies must strictly supervise the change to meet standards of an urban area and ask the investor of the project to build education, health and parking facilities as well as other services.\nAccording to the experts, many firms have developed tourism apartments, known as condotels, while most of their buyers have little knowledge about this segment and have not carefully read the terms of their contracts.\nThe Ministry of Construction has identified three major issues surrounding this segment, including its land use regime, lack of regulations on condotel ownership rights, and operational management, according to Nguyễn Mạnh Khởi, deputy head of the Housing and Real Estate Market Management Agency.\nHe said the Ministry of Construction is devising criteria to define the\xa0condotel and officetel segments, and more importantly, condotel and officetel management regulations. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is tasked with enforcing regulations on the land use regime in this segment.\nCurrently, there are no regulations governing the condotel segment even though condotel projects have been mushrooming in many parts of the country, especially in seaside areas such as Đà Nẵng, Nha Trang and Phú Quốc.\nCondotel buyers face great risk of losing their money if developers do not honour their commitments. Moreover, authorities do not issue condotel ownership certificates.\nCocobay Đà Nẵng is a 51ha hospitality and entertainment complex in Ngũ Hành Sơn District, Đà Nẵng City. Construction began in 2016 at a cost of over US$5 billion to build some 10,000 condotels plus villas, hotels and houses. The project has so far built 3,000 condotels and sold 1,700 units. - VNS",2

With the spirit “nothing will be left behind after the show”, Lộn Xộn chose eco-friendly materials for the tickets and water cups that can be recycled.\n“That’s why the main colour of Sudden is the green of nature, to integrate into the flow of a green and fresh life,” Rica said.\nSudden is also the first show that Lộn Xộn will perform with other bands which are popular like Mew Amazing, Huỳnh James & Pjnboys and Kick Off band. It will be divided into three parts including about 20 songs composed by the bands themselves.\nThe name of the live show originates from a song by the group which is also the inspiration for their efforts to get closer to the audience over the past three years.\n“Sudden is Lộn Xộn’s aspiration to create a musical night with professional investment in terms of techniques, stages and scales,” Rica said.\n“That puts pressure on our band because we have not been trained professionally; however, it would be a challenge for Lộn Xộn to conquer and we believe that we will not disappoint the audience,” he continued.\n“As someone said: ‘If we find it easy, it means we are going downwards. If we find it difficult – like how Lộn Xộn prepares for the show recently – it means we are going upwards.”\nThe band leader also revealed that security, safety, fire regulations and stimulant use would be tightened according to law.\n“Lộn Xộn believe that music should always be associated with serious disciplines and civilised attitudes of both artists and audience in order to create a complete programme,” he said.\nAccording to Rica, Sudden will limit the audience to 1,000. Children under five are recommended not to attend the live show as the sound volume might affect their hearing; meanwhile, children under 14 have to be accompanied by adults. There are also other regulations like no lighters or smoking allowed in the venue.\nExplaining why the ticket prices are odd numbers – VNĐ215,000 (US$9), VNĐ254,000 ($11) and VNĐ286,000 ($12), Lộn Xộn revealed that those figures are meaningful to them, representing the birthdays of its three members.\nAfter Sudden, Lộn Xộn will introduce a new song which they wrote with Mew Amazing – a singer and songwriter who won three awards at the 2016 Cống Hiến (Devotion) Music Awards.\nTickets can be purchased via Ticketbox.vn or at Boo fashion stores.\nLộn Xộn were established in September 2016 with three members – Trần Quỳnh, Nguyễn Việt Hưng and Phan Thanh Nhàn. Their songs are inspired by life and social issues such as traffic congestion.

She was the first Vietnamese woman to turn professional and remains the only non-amateur female golfer in the nation.\nNow, as the recently appointed coaching professional at the club on Việt Nam’s glorious south central coastline, Nhung is ready to pass on her wisdom to the next generation of Vietnamese golfers,\xa0both male and female.\nIn joining The Bluffs, Nhung becomes the first woman to hold a professional coaching position at any of Việt Nam’s 40-plus clubs.\nHaving started the new job in early June, Nhung is excited at the prospect of passing on tips and knowledge gleaned from years of experience competing on the Ladies Asian Golf Tour (LAGT) and at top tournaments around the world.\nNot only that, she is hopeful that her role as a mentor at a club ranked among the best in the world will help encourage more Vietnamese women to take up the game.\n“Women’s golf has made huge strides over the years,” said Nhung. “Players like Annika Sorenstam and Karrie Webb became household names thanks to their achievements and they’ve been succeeded by great players like Jin-Young Ko and Lexi Thompson.\n“All over the world, young girls have been spurred to take up golf. Here in Việt Nam, the game has been seen as something of a male-dominated preserve in the past. But I’m confident that my presence at a great club like The Bluffs will influence more young girls to take up golf.”\nSince turning professional in 2007, Nhung has achieved a number of significant milestones in her career. Playing mostly in Thailand, she recorded a number of strong finishes in high profile tournaments. After deciding to move into tuition, she earned certification as a Golf Teaching Professional from the United States Golf Teacher Federation (USGTF) -\xa0one of the most respected bodies in the world.\nGiven her outstanding track record\xa0and her passion for sharing her knowledge of the game with others, it’s no surprise that the management team at The Bluffs is delighted at the arrival of Nhung.\n“She’s a great person to have around,” agreed Gary Dixon, The Bluffs general manager. “She has played all around the world and has spent a lot of time in Australia and the US, so there’s no issue with how she interacts with our foreign members. But she’s Vietnamese so she’s got a real drive to help grow the game in her home country. We are positive that our members and our guests will really benefit from her presence here.” — VNS'",3

He thought it was a desperate situation and he nearly gave up.\nNot longer after, when he lay down at a rock in the mountain, he suddenly saw about 10 langurs playing with each other among the tree branches, Dân Việt online newspaper reported.\nThe retired border solider immediately realised that were actually Hatinh langurs (Trachypithecus hatinhensis) – named as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list.\nBefore retiring, Tú attended training courses for border soldiers to identify endangered and endemic species, he said.\nVoluntary protection\nThe story actually began when Tú decided to voluntarily protect the langurs from being hunted by poachers.\nDuring days of watching and protecting the langurs, Tú found Nguyễn Văn Hồng, a resident of Đồng Hoá Commune and a skilled hunter, who could kill the langurs at any time.\nTú tried to meet Hồng.\nHe explained to Hồng that the langur was an endangered species, named to both international and Vietnamese red lists. The langur is protected by law so that hunting them is illegal.\nAt first, Hồng rejected those words. Hồng argued that he earns his living by hunting.\nBut Tú still clung to a fragile hope and tried to persuade Hồng to stop hunting.\nThen, one day, Hồng went to the mountain to hunt the langurs. Two langurs, one female and one male were trapped. When the female langur died, the male langur hugged the dead animal with his sorrowful eyes.\n“The moment still haunts me,” he said.\nA Hatinh langur.— Photo Tuan GreenViet\n\nThe moment and the words of Tú made Hồng change his mind. He quit hunting and participated in protecting the langurs with Tú. Hồng’s family income now mainly depends on farming.\nThe pair teamed up to not only protect the langurs but also to take care of them. On dry days, Tú and Hồng also took water to the mountain for the langurs.\nHồng said many people told him that he already performed a thankless task because no-one hired or paid them.\nBut Hồng said, “Tú and I voluntarily really want to do the job.” They wanted to contribute a small thing to endangered-species protection.\nThanks to the protection of Tú and Hồng, the number of langurs in the commune is now much higher than in 2012.\nTú said that since the number of langurs was increasing, many langur protectionists in the world came and see him in his house. They came to see and record images of the langurs for documentaries.\nHowever, Tú still has great concern for the safety of the langurs.\nAccording to Tú, people are still allowed to freely visit the area where the langurs live. It poses risks to the langurs.\n“Recently, I found a person taking his gun with the aim to hunt langurs,” he said.\nThe people only stopped when Tú informed local police.\nTherefore, Tú said he really hoped the local administration quickly rezoned the area where the langurs were living in order to set up a small conservation area for the species in the coming time.\nIn March 2016, Tú was awarded the certificate of merit from the Government for his untired contributions to langur protection in the province.\nIn May 2018, the provincial Forest Management Department gave a certificate of merit to Hồng for his protection of the langurs. —VNS'",4

Four years ago it was an injury-time own goal that cost them against Japan, and this time they are left wondering what might have been had Houghton converted a spot-kick which the Americans in any case may say should never have been awarded, so minimal was the contact on White as she failed to connect with a Demi Stokes centre.\nRapinoe absence not felt\nPerhaps Nikita Parris should have been given the chance to make up for her penalty misses against Argentina and Norway earlier in the competition? Jill Ellis's side will not be too worried about that, as fortune favoured them.\nThat England could not take advantage of Rapinoe's absence said everything about the strength in depth available to the USA, with the excellent Press taking her place.\nThere were surprises in the England team too, as goalkeeper Karen Bardsley dropped out due to a reported hamstring problem, with Carly Telford coming in.\nIt was the Americans, however, whose changes paid off as they came flying out of the blocks like they have in every match at this tournament.\nThey had scored no later than the 12th minute in all of their previous five matches, and here they required only 10 minutes to take the lead here, Heath finding Kelley O'Hara whose cross was headed in by Press at the far post.\nEngland were stunned, but they were back level on 19 minutes as Mead'spinpoint delivery picked out White and she steered the ball in off the frame of the goal for her sixth of the tournament.\nYet it was the holders who went back in front just after the half-hour, Morgan stealing in front of Stokes and heading home Horan's delivery. She celebrated by miming sipping on a cup of tea.\nAs the USA tried to soak up pressure in the second half, England thought they were level on the 68th minute when Jill Scott's flick picked out White to score, but VAR denied them the equaliser and her a seventh goal of the World Cup.\nYet even when VAR came to their rescue, England failed to capitalise, and Bright's late sending-off for a second yellow card as she scythed down Morgansummed up their frustration. — AFP",3

Photo laodong.vn\nHÀ NỘI — The FAO-EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Programme will allocate US$273,000 for a project aimed at assisting Việt Nam in developing and implementing a communication programme on the Timber Legality Assurance and Agreement (VNTLAS) for stakeholders in an appropriate and effective manner.\nThis was a legally binding trade agreement aimed at improving forest governance, promoting the legal trade of timber and timber products exported from Việt Nam to the EU market.\nPhạm Văn Điển, deputy head of Viet Nam Administration of Forestry (VNFOREST), made the statement at the workshop entitled “Public disclosure of information and communications for implementation of the Việt Nam-EU Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA)/FLEGT”,\xa0 organised by VNFOREST\xa0and the Food Agriculture Organisation on Wednesday in Hà Nội.\nĐiển, the project’s manager, said the project would help Việt Nam implement its commitments on disclosure to stakeholders, including access to information as committed by the agreement. Accordingly, appropriate communication materials, information and access channels for relevant units on the content of VPA / FLEGT Agreement and VNTLAS System will be developed.\nAfter VPA/FLEGT between Việt Nam and EU was signed in October 2018, the two sides worked together to prepare the necessary conditions for the official agreement to be ratified and implemented.\n“The project has important implications in the context of VPA/FLEGT Agreement between Việt Nam and the EU. The project will contribute to addressing essential issues of information, communication and information disclosure under the VPA/FLEGT Agreement for effective implementation,” Điển said.\nNguyễn Tường Vân, deputy director of the Department of Science and Technology and International Cooperation under VNFOREST, said the project focused on assessing information needs of stakeholders on VPA/FLEGT, evaluating the availability of information published in accordance with Annex VII of the VPA. The project involved providing and disseminating information to domestic wood processing enterprises, foreign-direct investment enterprises and communication agencies.\nThe FAO-EU- Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Programme is part of a global network of actors supported by the EU to implement the\xa0FLEGT Action Plan, adopted in 2003 by EU Member States in response to the global environmental, economic and social consequences of the illegal timber trade.

Water in raising ponds in the town recently turned red with Xuân Phương Commune suffering the most serious consequences.\nMore than 2,100 lobsters weighing 0.4-0.6kg and 10,800 small lobsters of 27 households in the commune died. Lobsters in neighbouring communes also died, but in smaller quantities.\nResearch by the Centre for Monitoring Aquaculture Environment and Diseases showed that the amount of poisonous air in the water was high whereas the amount of oxygen was low.\nThe issue was blamed on the hot weather with sudden rain and strong winds.\nNguyễn Văn Mười is one of the farmers who suffered serious losses.\nHe said that 400 out of 460 lobsters died and he suffered losses of more than VNĐ110 million (US$4,700).\nThe Phú Yên Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said that lobsters had died before in Xuân Đài Bay in 2016 and 2017. These instances were blamed on the rapid growth of seaweed.\nIt is forecast hot weather will continue with heavy rains, thus seaweed will also grow quickly. Local residents should be vigilant to cope with abnormal weather.\nNguyễn Trọng Hùng, director of the department, said that before the lobsters died en masse, the department had reported the poor quality of the water to the provincial people’s committee.\nHowever, several local farmers did not take preventive measures and suffered losses.\nThe department asked concerned organisations to give local farmers guidance on preventive measures and move their cages to safer areas, said Hùng.\nA training course will begin tomorrow to provide more skills to local farmers. — VNS'",4

Each year, the volume of plastic waste released by humans, including 13 million tonnes dumped at sea, is enough to cover Earth’s surface four times.\n\nReports from international environmental organisations revealed Việt Nam throws away about 1.8 million tonnes of plastic every year, standing 17th among 109 countries in terms of plastic waste volume released. Of that amount, some 730,000 tonnes is released to the oceans, accounting for 6 per cent of the world’s plastic volume dumped at sea. That has made the country the fourth biggest polluter of ocean plastic waste.\nHùng noted it is very easy to see such key words like “plastic waste” and “fight plastic waste” in the media at present, showing\xa0public awareness of plastic waste in Việt Nam has been improved.\n\nMany anti-plastic movements and initiatives have been launched. Several supermarkets have replaced plastic bags\xa0with environmentally friendly materials, while some\xa0restaurants and coffee shops have eliminated single-use plastic products.\n\nHowever, the official said, there remains much that needs to be done in terms of plastic waste management policies. Plastic is currently managed like\xa0other types of waste, and there aren't specific regulations on plastic waste management, except for some on taxes for plastic bags.\n\n”Existing policies and laws on plastic waste management have yet to be on par with its impacts on the environment and human health, as well as public attention to this issue. Therefore, it is necessary to step up making policies and laws in this field,” according to Hùng.\n\nHe said these policies and laws should take into account the life cycle of plastic, from design, production, packaging and consumption to emission, collection, treatment and recycling.\n\nAside from economic tools like taxes and fees on plastic products, it is also a need to set technical standards, support\xa0the recycling of environmentally friendly plastic products\xa0and promote\xa0producers and importers’ sense of responsibility, he added. — VNS",4

Italy is one of the world’s leading countries in exporting technology, especially machinery production lines, because it has invested in thorough research on production technology to provide the best technological solutions for customers and minimising production costs.\nAmbassador Alessandro told Việt Nam News\xa0that the Italian Government attached great importance to Việt Nam's market, adding that the Việt Nam - EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) would open many opportunities for businesses of the two countries, including opportunities for small and medium enterprises of Italy.\nIn the years to come, many Italian businesses would head to Việt Nam to open investment facilities, provide equipment and technological lines for Vietnamese enterprises in many localities in the country, he said.\nIn 2018, the export of agricultural products of Việt Nam hit a record of US$40.02 billion. This was also the year with the highest growth rate in the past seven\xa0years and this attracted many big foreign companies to invest in agriculture in Việt Nam. — VNS",2

Construction of the system, however, has lagged behind schedule and won't be ready\xa0until 2021.\nThe other solution was to treat the water chemically using Redoxy-3C,\xa0a strong oxidizer which can degrade almost all inorganic and organic impurities in water.\xa0It\xa0has already been used in 87 lakes in Hà Nội since 2016.\nThe Redoxy-3C treatment, however, was being inspected following complaints over a\xa0lack of\xa0transparency in Hà Nội's\xa0purchase\xa0of the chemical. The city\xa0Inspectorate was due to release the inspection report on July 15 but so far nothing has been published.\nThe city inspector chief Nguyễn An Huy told the reporters on Wednesday morning that the inspectors were still in the middle of the work and would announce the conclusion as soon as it was available.

How does it feel to\xa0bring this performance to Việt Nam?\nThis work was created in 2016 with the theme ""The Root"". It is about where we are born, family, the starting point of the evolution and development of each individual on this earth.\nLoop is about the life cycle and the repetition of life.\nMy team and I are pleased to attend the Hanoi Dance Festival 2019. The feeling of being able to perform in the homeland is great, especially with a very personal topic like Loop. I feel like giving a gift to my loved ones.\nHave you made any changes to the performance you brought to\xa0Việt Nam?\nThe work is improvisational on stage so it is never fixed. It will be transformed to suit the stage conditions and\xa0interact with the audience.\nI intend to make a longer work on this topic and Loop is just the beginning. I want to talk about collective and community factors.\nThe question I always ask in my works is where we come from, what our ancestors were like and\xa0how an individual can grow in such a complicated and conflicted life.\nAccording to the reincarnation theory life is like a cycle. People are born and reborn.\nXuân Lê performs Loop at Hanoi Dance Festival 2019. Photo baodansinh.vn\nDo most contemporary dance artists pursue\xa0improvisation?\nEveryone has their own methods, but\xa0I want to talk about structure of the work. Improvisation is takes place within the framework and emotional flow of the work.\nThe choreographer gives dancers the theme and the characteristics they want to emphasise and the dancers improvise.\nAudiences have enjoyed the\xa0dancing, circus acts and roller-skating in your performance. How\xa0did\xa0you settle on\xa0this combination?\nI started to learn roller-skating when I was five years old. I gradually started to love it and began\xa0attending competitions.\nThe competitions give me the opportunity to return to Việt Nam for the first time. I also placed\xa0sixth in the world roller-skating championships in 2009.\nOne day, when I was practising\xa0on the street, a choreographer saw\xa0me and asked me to join his show. It was the first time I had a\xa0chance to get close to dance. After that I attend\xa0dance courses and tried to figure out how to combine\xa0contemporary dance and roller-skating.\nOne of my most valuable experiences was working in\xa0Tuấn Lê\'s\xa0contemporary circus show. There, I met many friends\xa0from different backgrounds that continue\xa0to nurture my exploration and\xa0study of different arts.\nWhen combining circus acts and roller-skating I aim to create a contemporary dance, not to make viewers see someone who is roller-skating. Maybe at first audiences will be distracted by the roller-skates, but then they will forget it and just be charmed by the dance.\nI intend to make three works with this theme. The second will be titled\xa0Reflection and will be launched this September. I will focus on the relationship between people and the environment.\nDo you have your own dance troupe?\nMy company can be considered a family. We are a small dance company and do not have much money so everyone must take on extra work. I also take more\xa0responsibility.\nAt first we only performed on\xa0small stages in Paris but gradually we have gotten the chance\xa0to perform at various festivals in other countries. VNS'",5

The fruits should be big and taste good to make the drinks appealing.\n“We have our own way of cooking lotus seeds. Our lotus seeds are always soft and juicy and have a nutty taste.

3701,'Sustainable water management a solution for drought',"'Châu Trần Vĩnh, deputy head of the Department of Water Resources Management under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. Photo courtesy of the Department of Water Resources Management\nChâu Trần Vĩnh, deputy head of the Department of Water Resources Management under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment talks to Vietnam News Agency about how to sustainably manage water resources while climate change has triggered drought and salinity intrusion for coastal plains as well as seriously affected the daily lives of local people\nCould you tell us about the recent hot weather in the central region?\nThe central region has suffered heat waves since April. Many places reportedly had record temperatures (some localities had temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius). Accordingly, the flow in the basins is 35-60 per cent lower than the average amount of many previous years. In the face of prolonged hot weather, reservoirs are forced to increase the amount of water for electricity generation to ensure power supply to the national grid. This causes the water level in the reservoirs to drop, with several reservoirs falling below the dead storage, including reservoirs of Trung Sơn, Hủa Na, Sông Tranh 2, Sông Ba Hạ and Ka Nak.\nAdditionally, the flow in most major rivers in the central and central highlands is 15-50 per cent lower than the average of the same period over previous years. The number is 55-80 per cent in rivers in provinces of Nghệ An, Hà Tĩnh, Thừa Thiên Huế and Phú Yên. The water level of large reservoirs in the regions has also been at a low level.\nIn response to the water shortage, reservoirs have to reduce their water discharge and actively store water to ensure the water supply for downstream areas according to the regulations of inter-reservoir operation procedures.\nIn a related movement, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has ordered localities to actively store water; efficiently use water and make plans to regulate water for the downstream areas of river basins. The ministry has also directed operators of hydroelectric reservoirs to closely work with local administrations to ensure water supply for the downstream areas until the end of the dry season in localities of Nghệ An, Quảng Nam, Đà Nẵng, Gia Lai and Phú Yên. The ministry requires some reservoirs to prepare for providing water for local residents if severe drought occurs.\nThe dry season usually starts in January and ends in July in the central region, and starts in November and ends in April in the regions of south and central highlands.\nHow is the department running reservoirs under the inter-reservoir operation process to ensure water supply for lowland areas this year?\nTo ensure water supply for the lowland areas in this year’s dry season, the ministry urged the People’s Committees of localities to ask sectors and relevant agencies to store enough water. For the river basin of Vu Gia – Thu Bồn, the ministry told Đà Nẵng Water Supply Joint Stock Company to properly regulate water and fully exploit water from An Trạch dam, especially when water in the Cầu Đỏ River suffers salinity, in order to ensure water supply for residents of Đà Nẵng City.\nMoreover, the ministry required authorised agencies to closely monitor the process of inter-reservoir operation in the central region. The agencies had to carefully calculate and balance the amount of water to reasonably discharge in reservoirs of river basins of Cả, Ba, Trà Khúc, especially Vu Gia –Thu Bồn river basin which often suffers drought and salinity intrusion.\nAdditionally, the department also approved a project of the People’s Committee of Đà Nẵng to use water in local hydroelectric reservoirs to supply local residents in the dry season.\nThe department has planned to provide maps and documents about underground water as well as technical assistance, manpower and equipment for localities to dig more wells and find water sources to prevent drought in affected areas.\nWhat can the ministry do to better manage water resources?\nThe ministry has submitted to the Government 11 processes of inter-reservoir operation in major river basins, encompassing rivers of Hồng (Red), Mã, Cả, Hương, Vu Gia – Thu Bồn, Trà Khúc, Kôn, Ba, Sê San, Sê-rê-pôc and Đồng Nai. The processes have been applied promptly, playing a key role in improving the effectiveness of water regulation in reservoirs. It helps minimise floods affecting people living in downstream of the reservoirs and gives them a chance to access water supply for daily life and crop production.\nThe department is co-operating with relevant sectors to develop a master plan for water-resource survey and a project to research water sources for people in remote and mountainous areas. It is expected to help better manage water resources in the country.\nThe department will\xa0finish the online automatic monitoring system to track activities of exploiting and using water in localities soon.

Việt Nam was lacking a manual labour force, and a lot of companies were struggling to recruit labourers and were tuning to ethnic minority groups and mountainous areas. This had led to migration from mountainous areas to urban areas.\n“If labour migration is not controlled, we will be unable to ensure labourers’ rights,” he said.\nQuân said he was concerned about the low level of skilful ethnic labourers. Among the 8 million ethnic labourers nationwide, only 6 per cent had been trained. Short-term training and risk-prone jobs left them with unstable careers.\nLabour migration leads to unequal distribution. Some areas are lacking workers while others have a surplus.\n“To reduce poverty, we must create jobs in these localities and move people out of poor areas so that young people can find jobs and earn incomes. When one person in a family has a good income, the family can escape poverty,” Quân said.\nHe proposed apprenticeships for young ethnic minority people should be an important part of the project.\nNA deputies agreed that developing the socio-economy of ethnic minorities and mountainous areas should not only ensure stable livelihoods and land but also focus on improving human resource quality.\nDeputy Nguyễn Thị Mai Hoa from Đồng Tháp Province said the project’s target of increasing the number of skilled labourers to 50 per cent in ethnic minority and mountainous areas would be difficult to achieve and needed adjusting because the current percentage was only 6.2 per cent. In some ethnic groups that figure is even 0 per cent.\nĐỗ Văn Chiến, Minister, Chairman of Ethnic Minority Affairs, argued that only 10 to 15 per cent of labourers were required to have certificates of qualification, according to the project’s target. Others would be instructed on the job and would receive no formal qualification, so the target of 50 per cent was feasible.\n“This is a new approach to introduce apprentice training for ethnic minority people,” he said.\nAccording to Thảo from Nghệ An Province, women from ethnic minority groups lacked access to healthcare services, especially reproductive healthcare.\nDespite 81 per cent of ethnic minority people owning health insurance cards, only 50 per cent used them, she said. Limited quality of healthcare services, and a shortage of medical workers and infrastructure were the main problems, she added.\nThe project sets the target of 95 per cent of ethnic people having health insurance cards. Thảo proposed focusing the target on the percentage of health insurance users rather than the number of card holders.\n“The policy should prioritise recruiting doctors and nurses, especially attracting doctors from ethnic minority groups who know dialects to work in mountainous areas,” she said.\nConstituents’ feedback\nThe NA project has drawn attention from constituents in ethnic minority groups and mountainous areas.\nLò Văn Khúi from Thanh Xương Commune in the northern mountainous province of Điện Biên said a lot of ethnic minorities and mountainous areas in Điện Biên Province lacked access to electricity, clean water and land for production. The unemployment rate and number of poor households remained high.\nHe said he hoped the NA would approve the project and focus investment on infrastructure and employment.\nĐiểu Mưu, deputy head of the Department of Locality II, Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs, said the project should prioritise its budget in the most disadvantaged provinces first and then other areas to avoid lax disbursement.\nAlong with socio-economic targets, the project should focus on preserving the cultural identities of ethnic minority groups, he said, proposing the allocation of funding to revive traditional products, create jobs for the local community and develop the economy.\nConstituent Vũ Minh Công, chief of staff in Nậm Pồ District, Điện Biên Province, said a lot of unemployed people had left the province over the past few years to work illegally abroad. If authorities offered jobs or vocational training, the number of cases would fall.\nHe proposed offering preferential conditions to attract investment from enterprises in the sectors where poor provinces held advantages like agriculture and forestries in order to create more jobs for local labourers.\nAccording to a Government report, Việt Nam has more than 14 million people from 53 ethnic minority groups living in 51 cities and provinces nationwide, mostly in the northwest, Central Highlands, southwest and central coastal areas.\nDespite having favourable natural conditions and rich mineral resources, as well as holding an important location to protecting the nation’s defence and security, these areas were still the most disadvantaged.\nThey have the lowest quality human resources and worst access to basic social services in the country, hence they have the slowest socio-economic growth and highest percentage of poor households.\nThe project sets a target of doubling local people’s incomes in 2025 compared to 2020 and decreasing the percentage of poor households by 3-5 per cent every year.\nThe NA will vote on the project’s resolution on November 18. — VNS",1

2026,'Unlicensed moneylending must be managed or\xa0just scrapped: NA discussion',"'Posters on a electrical board show details of unlicensed moneylenders. - Photo cafef.vn\nHÀ NỘI – National Assembly (NA) deputies on Wednesday suggested the Government should tighten the management of loan collections.\nDeputy Bùi Thị Quỳnh Thơ from Hà Tĩnh said this was a normal because borrowers must pay back loans.\nBut a number of people who have defaulted on their loans had found themselves being threatening by unscrupulous lenders.\nShe said in many cases, this was the only way for people to collect the cash, because taking the case to court would be costly, and if borrowers don’t pay, they end up with criminal convictions, leaving the lender out of pocket.\n“The policymakers should come up with a solution to manage the activity, not to forbid it, and local authorities should do better to prevent illegal debt collecting actions,” Thơ said.\nDeputy Phạm Trọng Nhân from Bình Dương said many individuals and organisations had to take out loans but often struggled to make repayments.\nAnd when they found themselves unable to pay, they would look at borrowing more cash and find themselves slipping into an ever increasing spiral of debt, he added.\nThe Government should raise the bar for the operation of lenders and collectors while disallowing them from abusing and taking advantage of borrowers, Nhân said.\nOther deputies suggested regulating debt collection companies and individuals, monitoring their activities closely.\nOn the opposite side, deputy Phạm Huyền Ngọc from Ninh Thuận said illegal debt collection should be completely forbidden as it posed too many problems for the society.\nCollection of debts was a hard task for any lenders even if the two sides had a legal contract, he said, adding those that avoided paying back loans would create trouble for the society.\nCollectors often had illegal lending and had illegal activities to seek payback from debtors, he said. Some of them even threatened the lives of relatives if the person refused to pay what they owed.\n“Their activities are troublesome for the people and the society but it is difficult for the police to handle the cases,” Ngọc said.\n“Debt collection is regulated and seen as a conditional business activity but the fact is we lack clear, tight standards for the action, making it easier for moneylenders turn into ‘black creditors’.\n“If the amended Law of Investment regulates debt collection as one of the forbidden items, it will help authorities prevent loan shark lending and all relevant activities will be handled,” he said.\nDeputy Trương Trọng Nghĩa from HCM City said it was useless for both lenders and borrowers to bring the case to the court because no rules allow an unlicensed entity to make loans to other people.\nThe Government needed an arbitration system to help resolve the situation, Nghĩa added.\nSocial enterprises\nMeanwhile in the afternoon session, deputy Nguyễn Thị Thu Hà from Bắc Giang, raised the issue of social enterprises, suggesting legal frameworks should be improved and the Government should offer more incentives.\nShe said there are only 80 social enterprises out of 2,000 that have impacted social development, adding this was a very small amount.\nSocial enterprises had proven necessary for the socio-economic development in the world as they created jobs and improve the living conditions for people in harsh conditions, Hà said.\nOne social enterprise employed 42 workers and offered indirect jobs for others, she said.\nIn 80 existing social enterprises, 27 per cent of them employ handicapped people and the same number employ long-term jobless people. Meanwhile, 78 per cent of all social enterprises have low profits but their social responsibility is too heavy. Leaders of social enterprises age from 25 to 44 years old and nearly half of them are female.\nSocial enterprises still faced problems when trying to adapt and benefit from the policies, Hà said.\nShe suggested the Government add at least one item in the amended Law on Enterprises about the definition, obligations, rights and registration of a social enterprise and incentives they may obtain. – VNS'",2

Another of his documentaries,\xa0Hai Đứa Trẻ (Two Children), won Best Documentary and\xa0Best Director at the Golden Kite Awards in 2017.\nNguyễn Trang, a VTV\xa0online reporter, interviews the filmmaker.\nFilmmaker Tạ Quỳnh Tư. Photo congluan.vn\nWhat motivated you and your team to make the film on finding a martyr\'s tomb?\nI have a relative\xa0who died in war but their remains have not been found.\nSo, I understand it is an\xa0irreplaceable hurt that war martyrs\' family\xa0encounters. They\xa0want a miracle\xa0to help them to find the remains.\nAt first, my crew and I planned to make a film to celebrate the 72nd anniversary of War Invalids and Martyrs Day. We shot footage and collected data for more than two years.\nThe script was to be a lot of different stories\xa0about\xa0trying to find the remains of martyrs.\nThere are few Vietnamese Heroic Mothers\xa0who are still alive. Many of them have been lucky enough to find their children\'s remains but there are also many others who have not. They desperately want to find their children\' remains before they die.\nWhile making the film\xa0we found a\xa0complex situation. Two mothers found their children\'s remains by mistake because of a misunderstanding from the archives of the Heroic Martyrs.\nI think finding a martyr\'s remains is like a jigsaw puzzle. If a piece is missing, even a small one, we can\'t complete the picture.\nThis topic is not new, did that make creating the film more difficult?\nWe were not\xa0pressured to find something new in the old topic. But I wanted to tell a story that was very personal.\nThe biggest difficulty was choosing\xa0a story which wouldn\'t\xa0overlap with other documentaries.\nWe chose a real story that was going on to film. We followed the story\'s development.\nDocumentaries on history or science need intensive research to learn the roots of the issue. The most important thing about making a documentary on human life is that the filmmakers follows, or even lives with\xa0the characters.\nIt is difficult for the crew to get closer to the characters and make them feel comfortable.\nWhen they know us well they will not hesitate to tell us their story and\xa0express\xa0their feelings.\nTime is very\xa0important for us to travel with the characters\'\xa0family. Every time I went back to my hometown in northern province of Nam Định I passed\xa0by Ninh Bình Province where the characters lived and\xa0visited them.\nAt first, there were misunderstandings that we were hired by one of the two families\xa0to make the search difficult for the other family.\nWhat message do you want to convey to the audience?\nThe journey to find martyrs\' remains is a real\xa0challenge.\xa0According to the Ministry of Labour,\xa0War Invalids and Social Affairs\' statistics, there are more than 200,000 martyrs whose remains have not been found and more than\xa0300,000\xa0graves that lack information.\nAt the end of the movie, the discussions\xa0about finding the remains will surely be unforgettable for each viewer. They feature different emotions of\xa0anxiety, torment and\xa0uncertainty.\nEach family knows how to think for each other, live for each other and sacrifice for a common goal.\nI still think about the words of one\xa0mother who told the other\xa0that ""You must keep calm, as not only your\xa0children and my children sacrificed, but there are many children in this country devoting their lives for the national independence today.""\nThat is the message the film conveys to families who have not been able to find martyrs\' remains.\nWe hope\xa0Đường Về will show the strong bonds and spiritual affection of Vietnamese families.\nAt the same time, through the film we want all people to\xa0join hands in finding the remains of the martyrs aiming at making \'the way home\'\xa0less arduous.

4744,'To-your-health: Time to Get Your Shots',"By Dr. Ekaterina (Kate) Naumova*\nMost people have had the flu, but not everyone knows that the word “influenza” refers to a very specific group of viruses that are a dangerous subset of the various common colds and flus we’re familiar with. In Việt Nam, you can get it at any time of the year.\nInfluenza is a serious respiratory infection that can result in hospitalisation and even death. The most common complication of influenza is bacterial pneumonia, but it can also aggravate chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic rhinitis\xa0and diabetes. It’s a highly contagious viral infection transmitted by coughing, sneezing\xa0or contact with someone who is infected, and it can also be transmitted if you touch surfaces on which infected influenza droplets have landed.\nAfter being exposed, it usually takes an average of two days to develop symptoms, but it can range from one to four days. Typical influenza disease causes the onset of fever, headache, a runny or stuffy nose, eye pain\xa0and sensitivity to light. Kids may also suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.\nThe fact that it spreads so easily is what makes it such an important health problem. People become contagious from the very beginning, one or two days before the onset of symptoms –\xa0even when they don’t yet know they have it. You can still pass on the virus to others for the next four or five days after the onset of symptoms.\nOnce you’re infected, there’s no going back. The virus will collect in the upper respiratory tract, producing phlegm in the airway in response to the inflammation of the surrounding organs. Your immune system (provided it’s functioning normally) will start to detect the presence of the virus multiplying in your body, and get to work on developing an antibody to fight it. The symptoms you experience are a combination of the spread of the virus and your body’s countermeasures, which will cause inflammation, fever and discomfort. Once your body has produced these antibodies, you’ll be protected from reinfection – and if you ever do contact the same virus again, it will be swiftly and invisibly dealt with.\nSo how is it that you can get the flu again and again? It’s because influenza gradually morphs into different forms as it spreads, making it resistant to antibodies that worked against it before. This means that every time the body catches a new strain of influenza, it must start from the beginning.\nHow can people protect themselves from a shape-shifting disease that keeps turning out new forms to infect us again and again? Firstly, we can try our best not to put ourselves and others at risk in the first place. For a start, remember to cover your nose and mouth with your sleeve or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Wash your hands often with soap and water, or at least alcohol-based hand cleansers. Stay away from people who are sick as much as possible. If you already have influenza, stay at home from work or school for at least 24 hours after the fever has ended.\nThe best way to prevent influenza is vaccination. Because the strains of viruses change every year, pharmaceutical companies conduct research to find out which strains will be typical for the coming season worldwide. According to their results, they produce a new vaccine to match the circulating strains. Every year, we receive new vaccines that are different from the older ones and more effective against the forms of influenza that are likely to be ascendant during the following twelve months.\nWe usually receive our annual vaccines in October, which is the best time to get vaccinated. We use an inactivated vaccine (made from killed viruses) produced by Influvac that doesn’t cause the disease. Unlike some vaccines, Influvac does not contain egg, meaning those with egg allergies (including pregnant women) can take it safely. It will protect you only from the more common strains of the influenza virus, however—if you’re unlucky, you could still contract a less prevalent strain.\nPeople aged six months and older should get the influenza vaccine, unless they suffer from an immunodeficiency condition. Kids under six months old should not get vaccinated because they’re too small—usually at that age, however, the mother is breastfeeding, so she can pass on some immunity to the baby if she is vaccinated. It’s recommended that everyone in a family with a baby should get vaccinated while the baby is still too young to receive or develop its own antibodies. It’s also important to note that kids under eight years old who receive their first-ever flu vaccine should get two shots one month apart to fully trigger their immune response.\nThe 2019-20 influenza vaccination contains the following:\nA/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like strain\nA/Kansas/14/2017 (H3N2)-like strain\nB/Colorado/06/2017-like strain. — Family Medical Practice\n*Dr. Ekaterina (Kate) Naumova gravitated toward pediatrics early in her career, drawn by a love for children, moving on to pursue her interest in dietetics and enhancing people's health through nutritional changes.

Could you please tell us how significant your upcoming visit to Việt Nam would be in this context?\n\nAustralia’s relationship with Việt Nam has never been stronger. I am looking forward to meeting again with Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc to discuss ways to drive forward the strategic partnership which we established in 2018. Việt Nam matters greatly to Australia. We are committed to this vital relationship and we want to fulfil its potential. My focus during the visit will be strengthening economic, security and people to people co-operation between our two countries. We share a similar outlook on our region and the world. As countries, we both want open trade and freedom of the high seas. As people, we are pragmatic and straightforward. Over the past few years, trade between us has deepened and strengthened.\n\nAustralia and Việt Nam face uncertain times and global economic headwinds. My government is strongly committed to deepening Australia’s relations with Southeast Asia and with ASEAN, and our engagement with friends and partners, like Việt Nam, is more important than ever to maintaining the security and prosperity of our two peoples.\n\nWhat are the key issues and areas\xa0that you would like to exchange views with leaders of Việt Nam during the visit and how would they contribute to fostering the Australia-Việt Nam Strategic Partnership and to bringing the best benefits to the peoples of the two countries?\n\nI am looking forward to working with Prime Minister Phúc to identify ways in which we can deepen and broaden the trade and investment relationship between our two countries. We are building a true economic partnership. Our two-way trade hit a record A$14.5 billion in 2018 – a doubling since 2012, growing by 11 per cent annually over the past five years. Only our trade with India is growing at a faster rate. Our investment relationship is also expanding, reaching A$3.2 billion in 2018. We are partners in APEC, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA. We are working together to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership this year.\n\nViệt Nam’s strong economic fundamentals – political stability, a network of free trade agreements, competitive labour costs and a favourable geography – position it well for future growth. The Government’s commitment to ongoing economic reform and embrace of trade liberalisation is to be commended.\n\nAustralian commodities, like coal, iron ore and cotton are helping fuel Việt Nam’s economic development and globally significant manufacturing industry. Australian education is training the next generation of Vietnamese workers with the skills for the digital and data age. Australian exports of beef, wheat, wine and horticultural products are increasingly served in restaurants and enjoyed around family dining tables across Việt Nam.\n\nIn 2020, Việt Nam will assume the ASEAN Chair and become a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Could you share with us your views on how this would help enhance bilateral co-operation between Australia and Việt Nam\xa0in sustaining peace, stability and prosperity in the region?\n\nBoth Australia and Việt Nam want to see an Indo-Pacific region that is secure strategically, stable economically and sovereign politically. We have a shared neighbourhood. For over two decades, Australia and Việt Nam have worked together on this vision. Our bilateral co-operation stretches from maritime security (ships visits, exercises and training with a recent highlight being the visit of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2019), to counter terrorism (special forces exchanges and exercises), aviation safety\xa0and military medicine (training and visits).\nASEAN - a grouping of independent, sovereign states committed to promoting stability and prosperity - sits at the centre of Australia’s vision for Southeast Asia. My government is committed to further strengthening Australia’s ties with ASEAN, including during Việt Nam’s Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2020, to build an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region where trade, capital and ideas flow freely, and the rights of all states are respected. We look forward to working with Việt Nam on its agenda for ASEAN next year.\n\nAustralia also looks forward to working with Việt Nam during its term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2020. We have developed an increasingly strong defence relationship over the past 21 years. One practical highlight of our growing defence relationship is our provision of airlift to Việt Nam to help deploy 63 personnel and their equipment to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) on October 1, 2018. We have provided English language and peacekeeping training support to Vietnamese peacekeepers since 2011, and more recently we have provided Việt Nam with a range of equipment and vehicles to support its deployments. The very practical success of our United Nations peacekeeping co-operation was reflected in the Joint Vision Statement on Further Defence Cooperation signed by our defence ministers in November 2018.\nThe Australian Defence Force looks forward to continuing to strengthen engagement with Việt Nam\xa0and assisting the Vietnamese People’s Army to prepare for future UN deployments in response to common security challenges. — VNS'",0

Former Arsenal legend Ian Wright described it best saying the England star was “offside by his armpit”.\nIn the end City spanked the Hammers so the decision didn’t change the outcome and will have no effect whatsoever at the end of the season, bar the highly unlikely event Manchester City lose the league on goal difference.\nIn total, there were about 70 decisions that were checked by VAR with most already spotted by the referee and did not require a hold up in play.\nOnly three decisions were overturned.\nIn 1992 those in charge of football decided to introduce the back pass rule, preventing goalkeepers from handling the ball if it was played to them by one of their teammates.\nThis was done after a pretty boring 1990 World Cup when a number of teams were criticised for unduly time wasting.\nAt the time fans were up in arms, saying it would ruin the game. Today, 27 years after it was brought in, we hardly bat an eyelid.\nSo in time the same thing will be the case with VAR. And at some point in the future it\xa0will just be a natural part of the beautiful game.\nBut for that to happen those in charge do need to hurry things up, which I’m sure given some time\xa0they will.\nWhat we really don’t want to see is long and drawn out decision making that leaves fans both at the game and watching on TV restless.\nBut as officials become more used to the system, things will speed up.\nIt has worked successfully in rugby, cricket and tennis so there is no reason at all why it can’t also work in football.\nSure managers will be miffed, and fans angry when the last-minute winning goal is disallowed because a player’s boot lace had wandered into an offside position, but once the furore\xa0fades and the hysteria cools, VAR will just become normal.

1865,'Coffee sector to expand intensive processing to add value',"'A panel discussion held on the sidelines of Việt Nam Coffee Week in HCM City on December 4. — VNS Photo\nHCM CITY — Việt Nam has set itself a target of increasing the ratio of processed coffee from the current 10 per cent to 30-40 per cent by 2030 to add value, the Việt Nam Coffee Week heard in HCM City yesterday.\nSpeaking at the conference, Dr Nguyễn Đỗ Anh Tuấn, director general of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s international cooperation department, said Việt Nam is the world’s second largest coffee exporter and tops in robusta production and export, with about 1.5 million tonnes of coffee exported each year, fetching a revenue of US$3.5 billion.\nBut the exports remain in the form of unprocessed beans with little value addition, he said.\nTo improve this situation and develop the industry in a sustainable manner, the sector plans comprehensive measures such as expanding processing, building brands for its products and strengthening linkages in the value chain, he said.\nLương Văn Tự, chairman of the Việt Nam Coffee and Cocoa Association, said coffee exports in the 2018/19 crop were 1.7 million tonnes worth US$3 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 2.9 per cent in volume and 14.4 per cent in value.\nExports of roasted, soluble and mixed coffee accounted for 8 per cent, he said.\n“More and more local and foreign firms are investing in roasted and\xa0ground coffee\xa0and soluble coffee,” he said.\nThere are over 620 roasted coffee factories with a capacity of over 73,000 tonnes a year, he said.\nSoluble coffee factories have a capacity of over 47,000 tonnes a year, with some new ones\xa0 being set up by companies like TATA Group (India), Tín Nghĩa Corp and Intimex, he said.\nForeign investors are increasingly investing in processing to take advantage of the plentiful availability of premium coffee, a large domestic market with a population of 97 million, and tax breaks through 40 free trade agreements the country has signed.\n“Processed coffee enjoys preferential tariffs of from\xa00 to\xa05 per cent when exported to markets that have FTAs with Việt Nam,” he said.\nCoffee consumption has increased significantly in the domestic market though per capita consumption remains low compared to the world’s average, he added.\nĐỗ Hà Nam, chairman and general director of Intimex Group, said: “Local and foreign firms continue to invest in soluble coffee plants and coffee shop chains.”\nLocal coffee shops and chains continue to gain its popularity and expand, he said\n“Domestic coffee consumption is expected to increase by 5-10 per cent a year. Exports of instant coffee will continue to grow rapidly.”\nNam said around 200,000 metric tonnes of green bean robusta and arabica are sold in the domestic market, mostly to soluble coffee plants for processing.\nRobusta coffee\nBernard Cremieux, managing director of Bero Coffee Singapore, and country manager of Neumann Gruppe Vietnam Co Ltd, said robusta production has been rising faster than arabica production globally.\n“Of the 45 million extra bags of robusta produced since 1990, 28 million have come from Việt Nam, 15 million from Brazil and 2.5 million from Indonesia.”\n“Global robusta demand has grown faster than arabica in the last 10 years at a compounded annual rate of 3 per cent compared to 1.9 per cent [for the latter].”\nRobusta exports have been growing steadily as also its share of soluble and processed coffee. Over 20 per cent of robusta exports is now in soluble form.\nBrazil is still the largest exporter of soluble coffee (33 per cent), but India (17 per cent) and Việt Nam (14 per cent) are growing their exports rapidly.\nRobusta demand will further expand and productivity is the real farm income. But farmers and firms must pay more attention to sustainability, traceability and food safety, Cremieux said.\nNam said Việt Nam’s robusta production in the 2019-20 crop is expected to be unchanged or increase by 5 per cent.\nThe harvest would be delayed due to the weather and lack of labour and high labour cost, but the coffee would be of good quality, he added. — VNS'",2

We selected the subject and contacted collectors and artists.\xa0Some had passed away so we got in touch with their families to tell them about our idea to\xa0organise\xa0the exhibition.”\n“People may think that nude art is a sensitive subject, but most art students are familiar with the genre. They all take a module at university because the human body is the most wonderful thing on Earth. They learn nude art to understand graphic forms and shapes. The human body, especially the\xa0female form, provides inspiration for industries such as architecture and design.”\nKiêu added that the exhibition had been supported by\xa0the artists, the Việt Nam Fine Arts Association and the Việt Nam Fine Arts University where the exhibition is taking\xa0place.\n“It’s a rare chance to enjoy nude art, from prominent painters like Bùi Xuân Phái (1920-1988), Lê Năng Hiển (1921-2014) and Phùng Dzi Thuần (1936), to famous names in\xa0the contemporary art scene such as Lương Xuân Trình, Lê Trí Dũng, Tô Liên and\xa0Trịnh Minh Hướng,” said Trần Khánh Chương, chairman of the Việt Nam Fine Arts Association.\nVisitors will be able to enjoy artworks in lacquer, oil, gouch, silk and Chinese ink.

1705,'World Knowledge Forum themed prosperity for all to open on Sep.25-27',"'A session of the 19th WKF held in Seoul in 2018. — Photo courtesy of WKF\nSEOUL, REPUBLIC OF KOREA — The 20th World Knowledge Forum (WKF) or WKF 2019, one of Asia’s largest business forums, is scheduled to take place on September\xa025-27 at the Jangchung Arena and Hotel Shilla in RoK’s Seoul with world-class speakers and delegates.\nUnder the theme of “Knowledge Revolution 5.0: Perspicacity Towards Prosperity for All”, the forum consists of 106 sessions classified by seven tracks: Knowledge Revolution 5.0, New Leadership in the Age of Upheaval, Global Economy in Transition, The Future of Technology Innovation, Inside China & One Asia, Rebirth of Finance, Viva la Vida: Ways to Vivify Every Moment.\nAround 240 speakers and 3,500 audiences will gather to discuss various agenda, with some of the keynote speakers having earned global esteem, for example, Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia Prime Minister; Jack Ma, Alibab Group Co-founder; Steve Chen, Co-Founder of Youtube; Ban Ki-moon, The 8th Secretary General of the UN; Bob Woodward, Pulitzer Prize-Winning Journalist; Ben Nelson, Minerva Founder and CEO; Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Co-Founde; Nouriel Roubini, NYU Stern School of Business Professor; Justin Yifu Lin, Peking University Professor; Tony Fernandes, AirAsia Group CEO; Jo Malone, Jo Loves Founder.\nThe first edition of the World Knowledge Forum took place in 2000, and was conceived as part of the Vision Korea Project, a campaign launched by the Maeil Business Newspaper (which is owned by the Maekyung Media Group) in 1997 to propose new vision for development to Korea and to the global community.\nThe following are several sessions to watch among the 100 plus sessions in the programme.\nVitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian programmer co-founder of Ethereum, will step on the podium of this year to share his insights into disruptive technologies. Ethereum is the leader of a new era of smarter and more complex blockchain technology and its open-source nature enables developers to create and publish decentralized apps for value transfer, social media, email, e-voting and other applications with great transparency. Buterin attended the University of Waterloo but dropped out in 2014, and went on to establish Ethereum Foundation, which launched a development project with over 30,000 bitcoins raised from its initial coin offering (ICO).\nThe economic war between the US\xa0and China is getting worse. The tit-for-tat began with a tariff and non-tariff barrier building, expanding into attacks and counterattacks even on individual companies. Now the two economic powers are almost at all-out war in economic fronts. The point is that the G2 war not only negatively impacts the two countries themselves but also threaten the whole global economy. For example, South Korea, which is heavily dependent on international trade, can be a victim of the war.\nThe trade spat will be discussed by two renowned scholars who represent their respective country: Niall Ferguson, senior fellow of Harvard University, and Justin Yifu Lin, professor of National School at Peking University. They will diagnose the nature of the G2 war and outline how it will develop. They are also expected to propose a solution to end the standoff.\nThe World Knowledge Forum this year will also provide a platform for a rich and stimulating political debate and this time will involve a close aide to President Donald Trump and a front-runner in the opposition camp regarding the US presidential election next year. David Urban, Chair of American Battle Monuments Commission, who helped spearhead Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state, and Bob Woodward, WP Associate Editor and author of his new book “Fear: Trump in the White House” will face off in this session.\nDavid Urban who joined the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1982 is Trump’s inner circle along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Mark Esper. Urban who is confident about Trump’s second-term win is expected to lay out the vision and policy direction of the Trump administration for the second term in office. Bob Woodward, an outspoken critic of President Trump, published the non-fiction book last year to reveal in unprecedented detail the harrowing life inside Donald Trump’s White House and how he makes decisions on major policies.\nOne of this year’s key differentiating factors for the World Knowledge Forum lies in shedding light on the K-Pop industry. Lee Soo-man, founder and executive producer of SM Entertainment Group, who is a global cultural figure and one of the who’s who behind K-Pop superstars, will be on the podium at the Jangchung Arena on September 25 to take a look at the past achievements and future opportunities in 2020 and beyond. He will also explain in detail the overseas market strategy for SM Entertainment’s new “Avengers” boy group SuperM. SuperM is a seven-member group consisting of SHINee’s Taemin, EXO members Baekhyun and Kai, and NCT members Taeyong, Mark, Ten, and Lucas. — VNS'",1

1800,'The untold story behind Chu Dau ceramic world record',"'The impressive plate featuring the word “Long” (Dragon) written 1,000 times in calligraphy created by Chu Dau Ceramic JSC, which was awarded a Guinness world record in September, was created from the love for the country as well as national sovereignty, the dream of a flourishing future, and the pride of being Vietnamese.\nMore than 200 days with pottery\nThe ceramic plate\xa0is a unique product from Chu Dau Ceramic JSC under the Hanoi Trade Corporation (Hapro), a member of BRG Group, and is a source of pride not only for the company but also for the Vietnamese ceramic industry. The world record is also a worthy honour for Chu Dau Ceramic’s artisans and potters, who love pottery as much as they love to breathe.\nThe plate has a diameter of 1.2m with the two main colours of blue and yellow. Photo courtersy of BRG Group\nAlmost a decade ago, Hapro received an order from the city of Ha Noi to produce a special product to mark the occasion celebrating the 1,000-year Thang Long-Ha Noi. It was both an honour and a challenge for the company, making it anxious to discover new ideas in order to create a unique artwork representing both Vietnamese culture and Ha Noi’s history.\nVu Thanh Son, Vice Chairman of Chu Dau Ceramic JSC said: “Thang Long-Ha Noi means ‘rising dragon’ and a round ceramic plate symbolises heaven. So, we came up with the idea of making a large ceramic plate with dragon written in calligraphy, representing 1,000 dragons flying in the sky.”\nAll the artists at Chu Dau Ceramic were excited with the idea and the enthusiastic atmosphere of the workplace was like a festival. But to manually craft a ceramic plate of such a size, the largest ceramic plate in Viet Nam at that time, was no small challenge for any worker.\nIn each stage of making the record-breaking plate, every step required the meticulous know-how of the workers. First of all, the moulding for the plate and ceramic bone were created. To produce a giant mould, the workers at Chu Dau Ceramic had to experiment several times to come up with the desired result. Several artisans pondered how to mix white clay and kaolin to make ceramic bones strong enough to withstand the heat of a large kiln.\nAfter tens of batches were created over more than four months, the artists finally came up with the formula to make the toughest piece of the largest ceramic plate in Viet Nam. In total, it took nearly seven months to complete the plate.\nHonouring Vietnamese creativity\nThe special feature of the Chu Dau ceramic plate is the word “Long”, or dragon, written in calligraphy in 1,000 different configurations by famous calligraphy writer Le Thien Ly. He had created two new ways of writing calligraphy, namely “Nhan Dien Thu” and “Vat Dieu Thu”.\nThe plate is a symbol of unique creation and talent of contemporary Vietnamese calligraphy. Combining traditional and new calligraphic forms, the 1,000 symbols create a fascinating continuous picture.\nLe Thien Ly wrote “Long” 1,000 times in calligraphy on the Chu Dau ceramic plate.\nIn “Nhan Dien Thu” calligraphy, each “Long” word describes a human portrait. There is a brave soldier protecting Thang Long citadel; a scholar; a soldier holding a gun to defend the Fatherland; naval soldiers sailing on the sea; students reading a book, and many more.\nMeanwhile in the “Vat Dieu Thu” style, each word describes an object. There are leaves, flowers, fish, books, ceramic pots\xa0and even a guitar. The word is also transformed unpredictably in the shape of varied dragons – hidden, dancing, flying and more. They also portray Viet Nam’s map with the two archipelagos of Hoang Sa and Truong Sa. According to Le Thien Ly, the writing for the plate itself took two months to finish.\n“This is the first time I have teamed with Chu Dau Ceramic, the ancient ceramic group with nearly 600 years of history,” said Ly. “The plate not only represents the intellect and talent of Vietnamese people but also is a meaningful gift for the capital of Ha Noi and its thousand-year-old culture.”\nAfter the painting was complete, the product was covered with a natural enamel layer extracted from rice husk ash. Ultimately, the special plate of great artwork demonstrates the quintessence of Vietnamese culture in both ceramic and calligraphy arts, with strong affirmation of the country\'s sovereignty and national cultural identity.\nDedicated to preserving and promoting the cultural and historical values of Chu Dau Ceramic, Madame Nguyen Thi Nga, Chairman of BRG Group reaffirmed: “This artwork shows the continuous development and creativity of Chu Dau Ceramic in a historical flow of nearly 600 years. BRG Group is proud to be in charge of developing Chu Dau Ceramic, to preserve the quintessence of Vietnamese culture and promote Chu Dau Ceramic to be well-known all over the world.”\nIn September, Chu Dau Ceramic JSC, a member of BRG Group, was honoured to be awarded the Guinness world record for its ceramic plate featuring 1,000-word “Long” in calligraphy – a masterpiece of Vietnamese handicrafts. Previously, in 2013, the plate was awarded a certificate from the Association of Vietnamese Records for the largest plate with ""Long"" written 1,000 times in calligraphy.\nThe plate not only honours the talent of Chu Dau Ceramic artisans, but also glorifies the Vietnamese ceramic industry, which was worthy of the 10 golden words that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc bestowed on the company – “Chu Dau Ceramic - Vietnamese national character, shining over five continents”.'",2

Or is it an olive?\nTruth is, it’s a nut, but trám is often described as the Vietnamese olive. And if you want the best, you better head north, because Cao Bằng truly is nut heaven!\nIn bygone times, trám, or pili nuts, were\xa0a meat substitute because of their\xa0rich flesh and high protein content. But before vegans prepare a mecca to Cao Bằng, today you’ll find the red nut served with many different types of meat.\nPhương Thị Cưu has been cooking pili nuts for more than forty years. She may be a little biased, but Cưu feels the nuts from her province are far superior to those from elsewhere in Việt Nam.\n“Pili have existed for a long time,” said Cưu.\n“From generation to generation, we have witnessed the nuts grow, fall, and then grow again. The villagers picked up the nuts and found them edible, and they're even better when mixed with sticky rice.\nPhương Thị Cưu mixes pili nuts with sticky rice at her restaurant in Cao Bằng City. Pili nut sticky rice is a traditional dish in Cao Bằng. — VNS Photo Bảo Hoa\n“They brought the nuts home to process by boil them all\xa0up or keeping them warm before drying. In the past, the villagers didn’t have meat but only pili nuts to eat with salt.\n“And that has become Cao Bằng's specialty. Now, when they're\xa0fried with meat or cooked with sticky rice, these nuts taste really good.”\nThey are similar in both colour and texture to the olives you would find in Europe, but hey, this is Việt Nam remember, so they taste a lot better.\nFor three decades, Hoàng Kim Vân has been selling pili nuts at a market in Cao Bằng City.\n“Since I started trading at\xa0this market, I have been selling pili nuts,” said Vân.\n“These nuts are from the northern province of Cao Bằng. I buy them to sell to customers all year round.\n“Every year, people sell me pili nuts when they're in season. I have to keep them warm. But before that, I wash the nuts two to three times with clean water.\xa0The nuts are then soaked in 80 degree\xa0water until they become soft, then they are left out to dry.\nHoàng Kim Vân has been selling pili nuts\xa0at local markets for 30 years. — VNS Photo Đoàn Tùng\n“After drying, I cut the nuts in half and add some flavouring.\xa0Then we put them in the freezer to preserve them. This means we can enjoy them\xa0all year round.”\nSo whatever the weather, and whatever the time of year, you will find pili nuts in many dishes served in Cao Bằng.\nVân added: “Pili nuts can be fried with burnt bacon. Or you can make pili nut\xa0sticky rice, it’s a traditional dish for\xa0Vietnamese people. In Cao Bằng Province, people often eat pili nuts, pili nut\xa0sticky rice and stir-fried pili nuts with meat. They are all really delicious!”\nIn the old days pili nuts were used as a substitute for meat. Nowadays they are often fried with pork as a side dish. — VNS Photo Bảo Hoa\nBut there is a golden rule when picking which nut to cook with – and sometimes smelling nice does not necessarily mean it is the right nut to choose.\nChef Cưu said: “There are two types of pili nuts: high-quality and ordinary nuts. The ordinary nuts are sour and don't have a very rich taste, despite their\xa0fragrant smell, and they are not that soft to eat.\n“On the other hand, high-quality nuts are soft and have a rich buttery taste.”\nShe believes what also makes these\xa0nuts so special\xa0is that even in a simple form, they are not only tasty, but also very filling.\nCưu added: “Retaining the national identity and keeping the pili are something really wonderful because among all the traditional food, pili nuts are the best;\xa0edible in all four seasons and can be substituted for other foods. If there is no food, just a few pots of nuts can fill up two to three bowls of rice.”\nSo next time you’re in Cao Bằng, maybe visiting the world famous Bản Giốc waterfalls, you may want to try the region’s other specialty.\nAnd once you do, who knows?

Photo coutersy of\xa0Sumitomo Corporation\nTOKYO —\xa0Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation will spend more than 14 billion yen (US$129.7 million) to expand its Thăng Long Industrial Park II in the northern province of Hưng Yên.\nWith additional area of 181ha, the site which already spans\xa0346ha will be one of the biggest Japanese industrial parks in Việt Nam.\nGround breaking is scheduled for 2021, with lots going on sale in 2022, the company said in a statement.\nViệt Nam’s economy is rapidly growing, with ten-year high GDP growth of 7.1 per cent in 2018, the company said, adding that the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) entering into force for Việt Nam in January 2019 and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) in June are expected to lead to further industrial growth.\n“Thanks to industrial diversification and vigorous domestic demand associated with the population increase, further entry of foreign companies, primarily manufacturers, as well as expansion of foreign companies that already have operations in the country, are anticipated in Việt Nam,” it said.\nSumitomo Corporation has been developing, selling and operating special economic zones and industrial parks in Việt Nam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar and India.\nIn Việt Nam, Sumitomo Corporation has operated industrial parks for over 20 years since opening Thăng Long Industrial Park in 1997.\nProjects funded by Japanese companies in Việt Nam rose 7 per cent last year\xa0to 643, according to the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO).\nSpending has increased for three consecutive years to a new record. Việt Nam's proximity to China and its cheap labour costs have\xa0made it a draw for relocating production capacity.\nAs of August 2018, Japan was the second largest source of Việt Nam’s foreign direct investment with 4,247 projects, worth more than $58.22 billion, statistics from the Foreign Investment Agency revealed. — VNS",2

Photo doanhnghiepthuonghieu.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Free trade agreements (FTAs)\xa0had\xa0created opportunities for food imports and foreign investment in the domestic food industry, according to experts.\nCountries with developed food processing industries\xa0such as Japan, the US and\xa0Australia and the EU have already\xa0promoted exports of their food products to Việt Nam.\nLast week in HCM City, 18 Canadian food companies met with\xa0potential partners.\nKeith Colwell, Nova Scotia’s Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, expressed his hope that the\xa0trip could provide\xa0opportunities for Canadian food companies to export their products to Việt Nam thanks to tariff reductions under\xa0the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\nThe minister told Thời báo Kinh doanh (Business Times) newspaper that Canadian food businesses had shifted their focus to Việt Nam after developments in the Chinese market.\nThese companies want to bring high-end Canadian products like seafood, agricultural products and beverages to new markets like Việt Nam, Colwell\xa0said. Tariff reductions under the CPTPP had helped Canadian products become more competitive in Việt Nam’s market.\nLast year, Canada's agricultural and seafood exports to Việt Nam reached a turnover of CA$ 312.7 million (about US$235 million).\nIn the first nine months of this year, Việt Nam imported more than 14,824 tons of pork with a total value of $29.2 million, much higher than the imports of 14,295 tonnes in volume and $23.6 million in value last year.\nAccording to Lê Hồng Minh, director of Vietrade’s Investment Promotion Centre for Industry and Trade, total FDI poured\xa0into Việt Nam’s food processing sector was estimated at $11.2 billion with 717 projects, excluding foreign investors buying shares or conducting merger and acquisitions.\nForeign capital flows in the food industry were mainly from Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and China. These factories produced food for the domestic market and export.\nMost of FDI\xa0projects in the food processing sector were concentrated in big cities and provinces like Hà Nội, HCM City, Bình Dương, Đồng Nai and Long An.\nHowever, these FDI projects had\xa0little or no investment in developing raw materials, Minh said. Therefore, the industries supporting the food processing industry like cultivation and husbandry had\xa0not been developed according to modern standards.\nHe said domestic raw materials did not meet the production requirements of FDI enterprises in the food processing sector. For example, the domestic dairy industry could only meet the 25 per cent of the domestic market demand, while the nation had to\xa0import 90 per cent of its cooking oil.\nAccording to experts, the State should encourage foreign invested projects in the food industry to transfer technology from\xa0developed countries in the fields of processing, packaging and preserving agricultural and aquatic products. – VNS",2

Only when workers have good spirit and physical strength can we attain high productivity and effective production,” she said.\nHải also said employers would benefit more than employees if the overtime limit was increased.\nNA chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân proposed submitting two options to the NA at its upcoming session this October.\nThe first option is to retain all current regulations. However, it would also require employers to restrict overtime to 40 hours per month instead of 30 hours and supplement regulations on organising overtime work from 200 to 300 hours.\nThe second option was the proposal submitted by the Government, aiming to expand the overtime cap from 300 hours to 400 hours per year for a number of trades and sectors. However, the Government was asked to consider NA deputies’ suggestions, preparing the list of those subjected to expansion of overtime cap as well as the detailed decree on implementation to submit to the NA.\nEntry and exit\nIn the afternoon, the NA Standing Committee gave feedback on the draft revised Law on exit and entry of foreign nationals in Việt Nam.\nThe law contains clauses on institutionalising the e-visa scheme that is being piloted, among other issues.\nThe NA Standing Committee asked the drafting committee carefully consider each item to ensure feasibility and national security and sovereignty, review the current conditions for visa waiving in coastal economic zones, and the proposal to raise temporary residence duration of foreign investors from five to 10 years.\nThe committee also commented the signing of an agreement between the Vietnamese Government and the European Union on establishing a framework for Việt Nam\'s participation in crisis management activities of the EU.\nYesterday was also the last working day of the NA Standing Committee\'s 37th meeting, which had lasted 11 days.\nSpeaking at the closing ceremony, NA Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân said this meeting by the NA Standing Committee had seen discussions on 13 draft law projects and other important items that would be tabled for review by NA deputies in the upcoming month-long eighth plenary session to be held in late October.\nMembers of the committee also opined on the preliminary report on the 5-year implementation of the Constitution, reports of the Government, the Supreme People\'s Court, the Supreme People\'s Procuracy on the settlement of complaints and denunciations in 2019, the State Audit\'s report in 2019 and audit plan for 2020. — VNS'",0

We expect it from us that we fight for everything,"" he said.\n""The boys did really well, they fought really hard. It is completely normal that you come under pressure but we defended well.\n""That is how it is in the top six and in the Premier League. You will never win at Chelsea without putting a proper shift in and we did that today.""\nAfter City\'s astonishing 8-0 demolition of Watford on Saturday, this was the perfect response from Liverpool as they try to dethrone Pep Guardiola\'s champions.\nChasing a first English title since 1990, Liverpool are on a club-record run of 15 successive league wins and have lost just once in 45 top-flight matches, going unbeaten in the last 23.\n""It is exceptional. What can I say? We have to keep on going. It is never looks as easy as it did for City yesterday but we have not had these games yet.\nWe have to work for it,"" Klopp said.\n""We knew how good City were before the game yesterday. I really believe they are the best team in the world.\n""They are brilliant. We are not bad as well. We have to be ready for each opponent. They are want to give us a knock, rightly so.""\n\'Character and spirit\'\nThe only worry for Klopp was an injury to Senegal winger Sadio Mane that forced him off in the second half.\n""It is a knock on the bone around the knee and a dead leg,"" Klopp said.\n""He\'s OK, but we took him off, he wasn\'t limping but I didn\'t like how he was running.""\nChelsea had a greater share of possession, managed 13 shots to Liverpool\'s six and won six corners to their opponents\' four.\nBut those encouraging signs were undermined by poor defending and a lack of cutting edge, leaving Lampard as the first Chelsea manager to remain winless in his first four home matches since Bobby Campbell in 1988.\nLampard claimed Chelsea deserved more from their spirited effort, but he \xa0conceded his young side aren\'t mature enough yet.\n""No home wins, we want to change that and I believe we will if we play like that,"" he said.\n""Performance wise we were the better team. We had more energy in our game, character and spirit. That\'s why the crowd applauded at the end.\n""The difference between us and Liverpool is we aren\'t consistent enough. To work towards those levels is hard. It is a daily thing.\n""That is what we have to aspire to. The reality is younger players have come into the team.""\nChelsea were denied a first-half equaliser when Cesar Azpilicueta\'s effort was ruled out for offside against Mason Mount and Lampard admitted it was a momentum changer as Firmino bagged the second goal moments later.\n""I like to think we might get a couple in our favour. But you can see Mason is a tiny bit offside,"" he said.\n""It changes the atmosphere in the crowd, on the pitch. We are slightly deflated and they get a boost."" — AFP'",3

The four-day conference has been jointly organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government Inspectorate of Việt Nam.\nLiêm said that building and developing infrastructure was deemed the backbone of economic growth, laying the foundations for the Government to provide basic public services for the people.\n“Investment demand for infrastructure in many countries in Asia-Pacific through large-scale projects has shot up dramatically in recent years, but it also brings with it greater risks of corruption,” he said.\n“It is a big challenge that many Asia-Pacific countries and nations around the world are dealing with.”\nDiana Torres, Project Manager, Transparency and Accountability at UNDP in Asia and the Pacific, said that estimations from the Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH) expected as much as US$97 trillion was required for global infrastructure investment by 2040, but there was a shortfall of about $18 trillion.\nThe thirst for infrastructure funding would even be exacerbated as up to 30 per cent of the resources for infrastructure was going to be lost through mismanagement, inefficiency and on corruption, said Torres.\n“Poor governance, lack of transparency and corruption can undermine any efforts (for quality infrastructure development) due to weak human resources, increased operational costs and the selection of unqualified contractors,” she said.\nVCCI Chairman Vũ Tiến Lộc said the conference would offer the country ideas to prevent and combat corruption, especially in the relationship between the Government and the business community.\n“Integrity is the heart of the business community. Integrity means doing business in a fair and square manner, or in other words, abiding by general principles, “ Lộc told the conference.\nHe also said the business community had to be fully aware of the role of integrity while working with the Government in order to eliminate the so-called culture of greasing the wheels. — VNS'",0

4983,'What is paediatric emergency?',"'Dr. Takaaki Mori. — Photo courtesy of Family Medical Practice\nBy Dr. Takaaki Mori*\nPaediatric emergency is all about saving the lives of children. It’s very different from the approach of a general paediatrician, who considers the most likely cause of a child’s illness first. An emergency paediatrician always considers life-threatening conditions before turning to more common explanations.\nThis important field of medicine is new in Việt Nam, although it has been practised in the US\xa0for 30 or 40 years already. In my native Japan, paediatric emergency medical science has a very short history – as a paediatrician with an interest in surgery, I was among the first Japanese doctors to specialise in the field.\nEssentially, emergency paediatrics is very similar to standard emergency medicine, particularly in the way we treat many kinds of emergency and medical conditions. But paediatric emergency differs in that we have to think about the child’s growth and development – we have to adjust the treatment and approach depending on the child’s age (or perhaps other conditions). For example, when we apply stitches, we follow a different procedure with a one-year-old child than with a child of ten. For some paediatric emergencies, we perform sedation in cases where an adult would not need it – for reasons of safety and to lessen their anxiety, and for the comfort of the children as well as the parents.\nThere is also the issue of the size of a child’s body. For paediatric emergency medicine, we have to prepare different medical equipment depending on the child’s age and weight. We usually use different types of equipment of different sizes, from infant to adolescent. An endoscope used on an adult, for example, could not possibly be used on a child. Currently, children who require such procedures in Việt Nam must leave the country to receive treatment.\nOne hot topic in paediatric emergency medicine is the use of X-rays. People are becoming increasingly concerned about radiation exposure in children. In Japan, I was personally involved in promoting the use of ultrasound techniques in children to replace the use of X-ray and CT scans for paediatric emergency conditions. I have successfully detected conditions such as appendicitis as well as critical injuries using ultrasound rather than X-rays, sparing the patients from unnecessary radiation exposure. This is an area that stands primed for development in Việt Nam, as the difference is procedural with the required equipment already available here.\nOne advantage that emergency paediatricians have over regular emergency doctors is that we’re quite used to the ultrasound, because we have to study neonatology during our residency in paediatrics.\nI prefer working in an acute care setting where a quick decision is needed to treat the traumatised patient. If I administer proper treatment, the patient’s condition can change dramatically. Speed is very important in such cases. Quick and accurate analysis and a decision to give appropriate treatment has saved lives – and it is an immensely rewarding experience to save the life of a child.\nSometimes it is not possible to get to a child in those critical moments. This is why it’s very important for people who take care of children – even those already capable of administering first aid to an adult – to familiarise themselves with life-saving techniques that can help sustain the life of a critically injured child. I would advise teachers, parents and other people who work with children in Việt Nam to seek out a first aid course that includes paediatric emergency protocols. As with all emergencies, response time is everything. — Family Medical Practice\n*Dr. Takaaki Mori has a distinguished background in paediatric emergency medicine, and recently completed his MSC in Paediatric Emergency Medicine at The University of Edinburgh (UK).

This is the first time the programme has been\xa0introduced in Hà Nội, after big success in HCM City and Đà Nẵng in June and August, respectively.\nThe cải lương piece Lan và Điệp (Lan and Điệp)\xa0tells a story from the 1930s.\nLan and Điệp had a beautiful love and were to marry when Điệp\xa0finished\xa0his studies. While living and studying in the city, Điệp fell into a trap and had to marry a rich woman, even though she was already pregnant by another man. She took the opportunity to sleep with a drunken Điệp and then\xa0claimed to be pregnant with Điệp's child. The news made Lan shocked and broke her heart. She left the village for a far-away temple where she became a Buddhist nun.\xa0Tragically, when Điệp found Lan,\xa0she breathed her last in his arms.\nWith the plot from a novel written by Nguyễn Công Hoan, the piece was staged for the first time in 1936 by Trần Hữu Trang, a leading scriptwriter of the south.\nIn 1974, choreographer/director Loan Thảo remade it with the participation of Chí Tâm and Thanh Kim Huệ. The recordings of the performance are popular at home and abroad. The roles also brought fame for Tâm and Huệ.\nAfter 45 years, director Gia Bảo once again has two cải lương stars involved. Bảo changed the performance a little to blow new life into the piece and bring more emotions for the audience. The story will be narrated by Meritorious Artist Thanh Thanh Hiền.\nHiền was born to a family of cải lương artists. Since when she was little, she has loved Lan và Điệp, and often listens to it with an\xa0old cassette, the piece recorded in 1974.\n“I listened to the piece during the meals and cried, my mother told me not to cry\xa0while eating, but I still cried whenever I listened to it,” said Hiền.\n“I know all songs, all conversations of the piece, director Bảo knows how much I love it. Maybe it’s\xa0why he gave me\xa0the role of narrator.\n“That role hasn’t appeared in other versions of the piece before. I expect that I can help bring bright colours to the tragedy.”\nPeople’s Artist Minh Vương, who is famous for cải lương performances, and Hoài Lâm, winner of Gương Mặt Thân Quen (Your Face Sounds Familiar) television show in 2014, will also star.\nThe three-hour piece will bring unforgettable emotions for the audiences, said director Bảo.\nBảo is the initiator of Vietnamese Talents series.

Photo courtesy of\xa0Land Saigon\nHÀ NỘI — Investors should make careful decisions when purchasing corporate bonds, especially coming with high yield rates, to avoid risks, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has said.\nThe MoF has issued the warning, saying investors should not be lured by high bond yield rates.\nAccording to the ministry, risks that investors may face include\xa0the firm’s failure to fulfill the terms and conditions of its bond issuance, failure to make full payments when the debt is due, or the issuer may not fulfill its commitment to investors on the redemption of bonds before the maturity date.\nWhether the issuer can repay depends on its financial capacity\xa0and business performance, the MoF said.\nHigh rates\nBond issuance is becoming a popular channel for firms to raise capital due to its efficiency and convenience. To attract investors, some companies have raised bond yield rates higher.\nIn late October, HCM City-based Hồng Hoàng Trading Investment JSC issued more than VNĐ1.4 trillion (US$60.5 million) worth of five-year bonds with a surprisingly high yield rate of 20 per cent per annum.\nThis is the highest level of bond yield a bond issuer has offered so far in Việt Nam. With the rate, Hồng Hoàng has to pay investors VNĐ280 billion in interest annually. The company was established in late 2016 with charter capital of only VNĐ5 billion.\nAlso in October, Sài Gòn Vina Real Estate JSC (Land Saigon) issued VNĐ1.85 trillion worth of three-year bonds with a fixed yield rate of 11 per cent per annum.\nLand Saigon reported no revenue from sales and\xa0only reported revenue from financial activities, both in the third quarter as well as in the first nine months of this year.\nIn Q3 alone, revenue from financial activities reached VNĐ24.4 billion but financial expenses amounted to VNĐ40 billion. This, together with high management expenses, caused Land Saigon to suffer\xa0a loss of VNĐ14.2 billion.\nWhen issuing bonds, the issuers must ensure their total assets are greater than the value of bonds they wish to raise. Otherwise, their operation\xa0will face imbalance and potential risk of bankruptcy, said Trương Hiền Phương, senior director of KIS Việt Nam Securities Corporation.\n“Bond issuing organisations must have a specific plan for the use of the capital flow. Investors will face more risks if they invest in firms who do not have a detailed plan or can not be frank\xa0about their use of the raised capital,” Phương said.\nAccording to a recent report by Saigon Securities Incorporation, total corporate bond issuance in the first 10 months of 2019 reached VNĐ178.7 trillion.\nCommercial banks were the biggest issuers with total issuance value of more than VNĐ79.4 trillion, 44.4 per cent of total value. Real estate businesses accounted for 34.3 per cent with VNĐ61.3 trillion. The rest were infrastructure development companies, securities companies and other businesses.\nIf investors plan to purchase corporate bonds, they should seek information of\xa0bond issuers, issuance\xa0purposes, collateral, issuers' commitment, maturity date and payment methods. They should also check the issuers' financial health and how they\xa0use\xa0proceeds from bond sales, said Lê Hoàng Châu, chairman of HCM City Real Estate Association.\nCredit ratings\nAt an investment conference held in HCM City early this month, Stephanie Betant, head of Corporate Financial Services, HSBC Việt Nam, forecast the corporate bond market in Vệt Nam will thrive and attract investors.\nSome large enterprises in Việt Nam had connected to the international financial market by issuing bonds, she said.\nHowever, Vietnamese firms still need\xa0to simplify procedures, enhance information disclosure and transparency of corporate bond issuance. They also need to attain credit ratings before issuing bonds to the public to gain investors' confidence, especially less experienced\xa0individuals.\nOnly when businesses attain credit ratings, can\xa0investors feel secure when buying their bonds. Enterprises can also determine the offered yield rates based on their ratings because if they get a high level of credit ratings, they still can issue bonds without offering too high yield rates.\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, bonds issued in a private placement are more appropriate for institutional or professional investors than for individual investors who lack analytical or risk assessment skills.\nRetail investors, also known as individual investors, who do not have adequate financial capacity or investment experience should invest\xa0through professional funds, the MoF said. — VNS",2

The US social network has between 60 and 65 million monthly active users, according to the company.\n“Now what we think, say, buy and even whom we love, all can be found on social networks.

4495,'Multimedia concert connects sounds to images',"Multimedia artist\xa0Jean-David Caillouet. Photo courtesy of the artist\nMusician Jean-David Caillouet performed with French and Vietnamese artists to close the European Music Festival on November 30 in Hà Nội.\nThe performance was a multimedia concert entitled Lettres De Hanoi\xa0(Letters from Hà Nội).\nViệt Nam News\xa0reporter Nguyễn Thúy Bình interviews Caillouet about the performance\xa0and multimedia concerts.\nHow did\xa0you represent French musicians\xa0at the European Music Festival?\nAs a French musician based in Thailand and travelling a lot throughout Southeast Asia, I brought\xa0my own European perception and sensibility to this festival but also an overall understanding of some of the history that characterises\xa0the region.\nThere were also two other French musicians participating at\xa0concert bringing their own culture and musical sensibility.\nThis project was initiated by Lương Huệ Trinh and Emmanuel Labrande.\nThey wanted to create an\xa0event which would bring new music to a wide audience.\nLabrande also suggested the theme for the show and gave us the book on which we based our compositions.\nWhat did you perform\xa0at the concert?\nThe performance was based on a series of reflections and observations written by Jean Tardieu in 1928 while he was doing his military service in Việt Nam.\nHe describes in great detail\xa0the impressions Việt Nam had\xa0on him at the time as well as the ambiguous relationships and interconnections happening in the context of French colonial Indochina.\n\nCould you tell us about musical pieces composed\xa0for the concert?\nThere were many types of compositions at the\xa0concert which are all connected together through a\xa0thematic thread.\nThe eight pieces each flow into one another throughout the 60 minutes, combining spoken words, figurative archival videos as well as abstract visuals, acoustic music and electronic music, notated passages and improvisations.\nI collaborated with Vietnamese musicians last July and SơnX and\xa0Lương Huệ Trinh in the last few years.\nWhat is the role of multimedia concert?\nOur lives are multi-sensory\xa0and our life experiences are perceived through not only our ears but our eyes and touch, etc.\nIt makes a lot of sense to combine various media to express artistic ideas. When we go to the cinema we already experience an artistic multimedia experience where sound, music\xa0and images are all combined together to express a narrative and a series of subtly reconstructed experiences.\nIt makes a lot of sense today for music concerts to go beyond the limitations of absolute music when the content or vision is appropriate.\nIn many musical cultures around the world, the idea of music being disconnected from a visual experience didn't really ever exist before. We would always have music as intrinsically connected to a theatrical set, costumes, dance, etc.\nHow was the multimedia concert received by the audience?\nI have been working on many performances combining various modes of perception.\nRecently I have been working on a series of 'performance-documentaries' where the audience is watching a documentary, listening to a concert, learning facts about life, reflecting on philosophical issues and enjoying a mix of musical aesthetics all at the same time.\nI think everyone always perceives a concert slightly differently and that is probably even more the case for a concert which has a wider set of aesthetic\xa0parameters like a 'multimedia' concert.\nWhen I design a multimedia show the content tends to be dictated by the themes chosen.\nConnecting sounds to images gives an artist\xa0many opportunities to\xa0take\xa0the audience through a journey. The subconscious mind can be triggered through the eyes and the ears.\nThrough the possible audio visual juxtapositions that can create metaphors or even poetic meanings. Silence can be very powerful when one uses sound.\nThe absence of image can be very dramatic when you use\xa0film.\xa0Generally\xa0audiences\xa0respond very enthusiastically to these\xa0experiences.\nI also believe that curating a show with many dimensions can help new audiences enjoy musical aesthetics they would normally find difficult to understand.\nWhat does a multimedia artist need to be successful?\nEyes and ears experience life. A multimedia artist needs to be receptive to life experiences. Obviously they\xa0need to learn some techniques and develop their\xa0visual sense as well as their musical/ sonic senses.\nUnderstanding what they are trying to say and how to employ a language which combines both oral and visual experiences.\nIt often is like building a mosaic or a puzzle creating a script where various elements drive the narrative.\nToday, we often use digital tools to edit, process and trigger those elements so it is obviously important to learn how to become fluent with those tools.\nI often improvise purely with images, or painting walls with projectors in response to live music. I make music in response to visual and I learn to express images through sound.\nFor me, those two worlds are always interconnected. VNS",5

But today I decided before the match that I\'m going to focus on myself and on the final of Grand Slam, not on her.\n""That\'s why I was able to play my best, to be relaxed, and to be able to be positive and confident against her.""\nIt was a tactic which worked to perfection for the world number seven who had lost nine of her previous 10 meetings with Williams.\nHer only win had come at the season-ending WTA Finals in Singapore in 2014.\nFor Halep, it was a second Grand Slam title after breaking her duck at the 2018 French Open which had followed three losses in title matches at the Slams.\nOn Saturday, she committed just three unforced errors; Williams was undone by 26.\n""I\'m very sure that was the best match of my life,"" said Halep.\nThe challenge now is for Halep to keep backing it up. She has been a runner-up at the Australian Open, losing the 2018 final to Caroline Wozniacki.\nUntil this year, she had never got beyond the semi-finals at Wimbledon while a last-four run in 2015 remains her best performance at the US Open.\nWhen she won the 2018 French Open, she exited Wimbledon in the third round and the US Open at the first hurdle.\n""The finals I lost in the past helped me for sure to be different when I face this moment.\n""It\'s never easy to play a Grand Slam final. You can get intimidated by the moment. You can get too nervous.\n""I have learned that it\'s a normal match, not thinking that much about the trophy, just going there and try to be the best as you can. So I did that.\n""I said that every time I would play a final of a Grand Slam, I will do exactly the same thing. So today I did it.""\nHalep, who is now looking forward to returning to the All England Club as a life member ""to have dinner, have lunch, play a little bit of tennis"" joked that her victory on Saturday was almost by royal command.\nUp in the Royal Box was Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Halep\'s favourite.\n""It was an honour to play in front of her.

4412,'VN has large wind power potential: experts',"'Wind turbines at the Bạc Liêu Wind Power Plant in the southern province of Bạc Liêu. — VNA/VNS Photo Duy Khương\nViet Nam News\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam has huge potential in terms\xa0of geography and\xa0wind power resources to generate electricity,\xa0experts have said.\nThe western part of the East Sea bordering southern Việt Nam is one of two areas with an average wind speed at sea of 10-11km per hour, according to research from the\xa0Việt Nam Institute of Seas and Islands\xa0under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE).\nThe water from the central province of Bình Thuận to the southernmost province of Cà Mau – especially the area 300km from the shore – has wind speed of 7-11km per hour on average, making it one of the areas with the highest potential of generating electricity from wind energy in the world, according to research.\nAt a height of 80 metres from the surface of the East Sea, the extended area in the northeast-southwest direction from the Taiwan Strait to waters off Việt Nam’s southeastern region has power capacity of 600-800W per square metre per year.\nWaters off the South Central Coast have power density of 400-700W per square metre, and those off the Gulf of Tonkin have power density of 400-500W per square metre.\nForecasts from wind power experts show that wind power from the country’s sea will continue to increase, alongside wind power from mainland, reaching 100GW and higher by 2030.\nLarge areas of sea have potential for developing offshore wind power constructions, according to Dr Dư Văn Toán from the\xa0Việt Nam Institute of Seas and Islands. He cited the 142,000sq.km sea area in the southern region and the 44,000sq.km sea area from the central province of Bình Thuận to the southernmost province of Cà Mau.\nStatistics from 1,500 wind farms in the country (some are in the process of developing further) in the last decade show that the average wind speed of 7-12.5m per second at 100m above sea level generates the most wind power, which is highly effective for consumption and trade.\nProjects exploiting wind power in Việt Nam are developing well, especially two major wind farms in the southern Bạc Liêu Province and southernmost Cà Mau Province, which are expected to generate 1,000 MW of wind power by 2020 and 2025, respectively.\nThe wind farms and wind power plants have been contributing to the provinces’ budgets by selling electricity to the Việt Nam Electricity.\nFor example, the\xa0100 MW Bạc Liêu wind power plant in the southern province of Bạc Liêu\xa0has been contributing some VNĐ76 billion (US$3.3 million) per year to the local budget since 2010. It is expected to increase its capacity to 400 MW and contribute some VNĐ300 billion ($13.2 million) per year to the local budget soon.\nOn January 16 last year, construction the 100MW Khai Long wind power plant began in the southernmost province of Cà Mau. It is expected to generate 300 MW of wind power and some VNĐ200 billion ($8.8 million) per year by 2018.\nWith this high potential Việt Nam should establish a\xa0wind energy development strategy which includes developing wind power construction on the sea, said Dr Dư Văn Toán.\n“We will be able to further develop the economy and prevent landslides and land erosion if we know how to utilise wind power resources together with other sources of power such as solar power, wave power,\xa0ocean thermal energy conversion, as well as biomass energy, aquaculture and aquatic conservation,” he said.\n“On the other hand, offshore wind power constructions not only create new tourism attractions but also help strengthen the protection of national sovereignty on the sea,” he said. —\xa0VNS'",4

More than five\xa0million pigs have been culled.\n“The pathogens have spread rapidly. The virus has existed for a long time in the environment and in pork with diversified methods of transmissions. The management of ASF has faced difficulties due to large numbers of small-scale pig slaughtering and breeding households,” said Đông.\nHe said the only successful measure so far is to ensure biological safety in breeding. All pigsties must be safe and installed with antiseptic measures and nets to isolate pigs from insects which can spread pathogens.\nThe Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have held an ASF training course for first responders in Hà Nội. The course is expected to\xa0end tomorrow.\nThe course is part of capacity building events conducted by the US to share experience and expertise to help Việt Nam combat the transboundary animal disease.\nUS Ambassador to Việt Nam Daniel Kritenbrink said the US received a letter in April 2019 from Vietnamese deputy minister of agriculture and rural development, asking the US to provide assistance to Việt Nam.\nResponding to the request, the US is providing US$800,000 of laboratory diagnostic equipment to help Việt Nam detect ASF and a number of studies, assessments and seminars.\nThe ambassador highlighted the importance of collaboration between the two countries as the US regards Việt Nam as “a regional strategic partner” in combating the disease.\n“Since August 2018, the ASF virus has spread to 10 other countries in the region. We are confident that Việt Nam can play a critical role in helping us develop a regional approach to respond to ASF,” he said.\nCombating ASF is going to be a long-term challenge. The US and VN should continue to look at solutions that the two sides can take together in short, mid and long terms, he said. — VNS'",0

The match ended 1-1 through extra time. Algeria beat Cote d'Ivoire 4-3 in a penalty shootout. — Xinhua Photo\nSUEZ — Africa Cup of Nations title favourites Algeria defeated the Ivory Coast 4-3 on penalties in Suez on Thursday to the relief of Baghdad Bounedjah and set up a semi-final showdown with Nigeria.\nThe quarter-final finished 1-1 after extra time with Sofiane Feghouli giving Algeria a 20th-minute lead that was cancelled by Jonathan Kodjia on 62 minutes.\nIn the shootout, Youcef Belaili struck the woodwork when he had a chance to clinch victory for Algeria, then Ivory Coast captain Serey Die hit the same post and his team were eliminated.\nForward Bounedjah missed a penalty in the second half of regular time and was visibly upset by his failure, fearing it would cost Algeria a first last-four place since 2010.\nAlgeria retained the team that started a last-16 demolition of Guinea, a result which confirmed the belief of many rival coaches that the Desert Foxes are the team to beat.\nIvory Coast coach Ibrahim Kamara changed two of the side that began an unimpressive 1-0 win over Mali in the first knockout round.\nMidfielder Ibrahim Sangare and forward Max-Alain Gradel were selected to start in place of Jean-Philippe Gbamin and off-form Nicolas Pepe.\nThis was the eighth Cup of Nations meeting between the countries with Ivory Coast holding a 3-2 lead and two matches drawn.\nIvory Coast were more impressive in the early exchanges before a modest crowd in a stadium overlooking the Suez canal, a major shipping link between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.\nAlgeria goalkeeper Rais Mbolhi finger-tipped a Gradel shot on to a post and Kodjia wasted a chance from close range after a cutback in 38 celsius (100 fahrenheit) heat.\nSerge Kanon was the next Ivorian to squander an opportunity to put the two-time champions in front, stabbing the ball wide from inside the six-yard area.\nAgainst the run of play, Algeria went ahead when Feghouli connected with a Ramy Bensebaini cross and his snap shot flew past Sylvain Gbohouo.\nAlgeria had a great chance to go further ahead early in the second half when Bounedjah was fouled by Gbohouo, but he blazed the penalty against the crossbar and over.\nThe Ivorian Elephants were playing much better than in previous matches and equalised just past the hour mark, ending a 422-minute run by Mbolhi without conceding a goal in Egypt.\nCrystal Palace flier Wilfried Zaha created the goal with a surging run down the middle from the centre circle before passing to Kodjia, who scored with a shot from just inside the box. — AFP",3
1803,'Securities stocks lose shine for investors',"Inside a Mirae Asset Securities Co's company. With strong financial capability, Korean investors have quickly increased their charter capital and become a formidable competitor to domestic firms. — Photo thebank.vn\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0Shares in\xa0securities companies seem to have lost their shine for investors in the face of\xa0fierce\xa0competition from foreign-invested firms.\nSecurities stocks are favoured by speculative investors thanks to their high liquidity. However, this\xa0group has gone quiet in the latter half of this year despite several tides\xa0on the stock market.\nShares in\xa0big companies such as Saigon Securities Inc (SSI), Hồ\xa0Chí\xa0Minh Securities Corp (HCM), VNDirect Securities Co (VND), Vietinbank Securities Co (CTS) and Sài Gòn-Hà Nội Securities Co (SHS) have lost 20-50 per cent of their value this year.\nSSI, Việt Nam’s biggest brokerage company, plunged 26.5 per cent this year, sliding from nearly VNĐ27,000 (US$1.16) to around VNĐ20,000 this week.\nHCM has also lost more than 50 per cent, closing Tuesday at VNĐ22,800.\nThe securities business is heavily affected by market movements. In an uptrend period, companies can earn big profits from margin lending, brokerage services or self-investment activities. By contrast, they can also incur losses during a\xa0bearish market.\nDespite falling from the 1,000-point landmark in November, Việt Nam’s benchmark VN-Index has increased nearly 8 per cent so far this year. However, cash inflow has been slow and\xa0affected brokerage and margin lending at\xa0securities companies,\xa0dragging on\xa0their business results.\nHSC reported net profit of just VNĐ305 billion ($13 million) in the first nine months of this year, just half recorded\xa0in the same period of last year.\nEnding September, SSI’s post-tax profit had\xa0decreased 44 per cent on-year to VNĐ644 billion. SSI is also seeking shareholders’ approval to adjust its profit and revenue targets down this year to VNĐ1.1 trillion and VNĐ2.95 trillion, respectively, equivalent to decreases of 35.3 per cent and 21.9 per cent.\nProfits of others such as VNDirect, Sài Gòn-Hà Nội and Vietcombank Securities also declined.\nBesides, Vietnamese securities firms must compete with foreign-invested companies, especially those from\xa0 South Korea. There are six Korean-invested securities companies operating in Việt Nam:\xa0including KIS, Mirae Asset, Pinetree (previously known as HFT), KB Securities Vietnam, Shinhan Vietnam and NH Securities VN.\nWith strong financial backing, Korean investors have quickly increased their charter capital and become a formidable competitor for\xa0domestic firms.\nMirae Asset Securities in September approved a\xa0plan to\xa0raise\xa0its charter capital from VNĐ4.3 trillion to VNĐ5.5 trillion ($237 million), which will make it the second biggest securities company in Việt Nam (after SSI which is also planning to increase charter capital to more than VNĐ6 trillion through dividend payments).\nKIS Securities also has a charter capital of nearly VNĐ2 trillion.\nAfter being acquired by Hanwha Investment & Securities Co Ltd, Pinetree Securities also hiked its capital by six times, from VNĐ100 billion to VNĐ600 billion.\nPumped by big money, margin lending at\xa0these companies has\xa0developed strongly. The outstanding value of margin loans at\xa0Mirae Asset Securities has increased to VNĐ6.6 trillion, for the first time surpassing leading domestic securities firms – SSI with VNĐ5.31 trillion and HSC with VNĐ4.67 trillion.\nMargin loans of other Korean companies also increased such as KIS (VNĐ2.64 trillion), KB Securities Vietnam (VNĐ1.8 trillion), not much inferior to large domestic firms such as VNDirect (VNĐ2.95 trillion), Vietcombank Securities (VNĐ2.9 trillion) and MB Securities (VNĐ2.4 trillion).\nThe third-quarter top 10 biggest brokerage firms on the Hồ Chí Minh and Hà Nội stock exchanges also saw the presence of Mirae Asset and KIS.\nSome companies are competing with zero fee policies offered by\xa0Pinetree with free lifetime transactions or Vietnam Cyberspace Securities Technology. Vietnamese companies – AIS Securities and VPBank Securities – have also introduced zero fee transactions for new investors for a certain period of time.\nIn South Korea, deposit interest\xa0rates are currently low at about 1-2\xa0per cent, so margin lending is an effective investment. Meanwhile, local securities companies struggle to\xa0borrow at low-interest rates to race to reduce fees and margin interest. — VNS",2

My father told me that it took my great grandfather five years to collect the timber\xa0for the building, while all the pillars were bought from within the village and Thừa Thiên Huế and Quảng Nam provinces,” the owner said.\nMinh revealed that all the sophisticated designs inside the house, from those on\xa0the altars, girders and\xa0pillars, were created by the skilful hands of artisans from Kim Bồng Carpentry Village, which showcase the original culture of Quảng Nam Province.\nHe also said that keeping the 200-year-old house intact was not an easy task. Tích Thiện Đường has witnessed many ups and downs, as well as suffered from bombardments during the wars and then natural calamities.\nDuring the resistance wars, the house also provided shelter to\xa0revolutionists, many of whom have frequently returned to visit.\n“They consider the house a\xa0second home. Besides its architectural value, the house itself is\xa0a national relic,” Minh said proudly.\nIn its plan to\xa0promote\xa0tourism, Đà Nẵng’s People’s Committee is calling for investment to\xa0construct a river eco-tourism route Cẩm Lệ - Túy Loan - Thái Lai, along which Tích Thiện Đường is located.\nThe city is currently constructing a\xa0port on the Túy Loan River and steps leading to the house.\xa0— VNS'",5

No independent environmental audit was conducted, thus results were not as expected.\nExperts at the conference said that the quick urbanisation and higher living standards increased the nation’s socio-economic development, but also produced a great amount of waste.\nStatistics from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment showed that the country discharged 15.6 million tonnes solid waste annually.\nHà Nội and HCM City, the country’s two biggest cities, discharge about 80 tonnes of plastic and nylon waste per day.\nThe country’s plastics and nylon waste occupies about 8-12 per cent of daily solid waste.\nNguyễn Đình Hòa, acting director of the Audit Training School, said many countries pursuing increases in gross domestic product (GDP) faced unpredictable consequences of environmental pollution and climate change.\nEconomic development but increasing environmental pollution and effects on people’s health is not acceptable, he said.\nEnvironmental audit will force enterprises to calculate expenses related to environmental protection, and then re-calculate products’ prices and GDP values.\nLưu Trường Kháng, deputy chief audit from the SAV, said via the audit, concerned organisations would have the foundation to promulgate, adjust and supplement policies related to waste management and improve work effectiveness.\nThe audit results helped people become more aware of waste management, and since then give warnings to those intending to harm the environment, he said. — VNS",1

However, air quality index changes locally during a day and depends on the location of sensors.\n“If we put monitoring stations at hotspots with high traffic density or near construction sites, indicators are usually bad.

Lieut. Gen. Nguyễn Chí Vịnh thanked international friends, especially the UNDP, for helping Việt Nam overcome war consequences over the years.\nViệt Nam is a symbol for efforts to move on from war to step into a new development period, and a symbol of international cooperation, including countries which made war in Việt Nam, he said.\nVịnh attributed the results to the Vietnamese Government’s endeavours to recognise Việt Nam as a country of peace and safety.\nHowever there are still difficulties ahead, the official stressed, and further support from the international community is crucial, according to the deputy minister.\nAsako Okai, Assistant Secretary General of the UN, UNDP Deputy Director General and Director of the UNDP Crisis Bureau, acknowledged the challenges facing Việt Nam.\nThese challenges might lie in climate change or global financial uncertainties and would affect financial resources for war consequence settlement, she said.\nGiven this, the UNDP planned to support Việt Nam, especially through existing projects coordinated by the UNDP and funded by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), aiming to cope with climate change and clear bombs and mines, she said.\nThe UNDP also deployed projects that support Vietnamese bomb and mine victims, she added.\nCaitlin Wiesen, a representative of UNDP Việt Nam, spoke of cooperation between Việt Nam and the US in war consequence settlement over the years.\nOther international delegates lauded Việt Nam’s efforts in handling war aftermaths and participating in UN peacekeeping, as well as effective collaboration between Việt Nam and the UNDP, foreign countries and international organisations in this regard.\nThey said they were impressed by development in Việt Nam, which emerged from one of the world’s poorest countries to become a middle-income earner in just 25 years and completed most of UN Millennium Development Goals at the national level before the 2015 deadline.\nResults in war consequence settlement in Việt Nam\xa0 significantly contributed to the fulfilment of these goals, they said.\nThey also committed to continuing their assistance to the country to ease plight caused by the war, thus contributing to peace and sustainable development in the world.\nA caretaker feeds children afflicted with disfigurement caused by Agent Orange in the Hoà Bình Peace Village, part of Từ Dũ Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo Dương Ngọc\nIn an interview with Vietnam News Agency, Vịnh said Việt Nam was willing to share its experience and support with the international community in dealing with war aftermaths.\nViệt Nam hadsent military health workers and officers, and would dispatch sappers to UN peacekeeping missions in Africa, he said.\nWar consequence settlement would be combined with issues regarding the environment, development and science so that each related project would benefit national development as well as international relations, he said.\nAccording to Office 701, although the war in Việt Nam ended 44 years ago, its consequences have remained severe as a large amount of toxic chemicals used during the war are still affecting human health and the environment.\nThe work, therefore, has met various difficulties, especially with limited funds.\nIn 2019, the office will continue to implement projects on dioxin remediation at Biên Hoà Airport in the southern region, and expects to treat 35 per cent of the contaminated land and review all people who participated in the war and their children exposed to the chemicals by 2020.\nStatistics released by the Việt Nam Association of Victims of Agent Orange (AO)/dioxin show that there are still more than 3 million Vietnamese people affected.\nDuring 1961-71, some 80 million litres of herbicides were sprayed onto 2.63 million hectares of land in Southern Việt Nam, 60 percent of which were AO/dioxin, the Ministry of National Defence said.\nIt is estimated more than 2 million hectares of forest and some 20,000 villages were affected, with about 2.1-4.8 million people exposed to the deadly chemicals.\nAs of 2018, about 320,000 people fighting in the war and their children who were exposed to the chemicals had benefitted from social policies.\nBetween 1964-75, Việt Nam suffered from more than 16 million tonnes of bombs and mines, four times more than those used during all of World War I.\nAll 63 cities and provinces in the country are contaminated with unexploded devices, with total poisoned area amounting to some 6.1 million ha or 18.71 per cent of national area.\nThe international seminar saw the attendance of Vietnamese Ambassador Đặng Đình Quý, head of the Vietnamese mission to the UN; representatives from relevant Vietnamese ministries and agencies; and delegates from the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the UK, France, Canada, some ASEAN countries, along with those from the EU, the UN and international organisations. — VNS'",0

Tourists, however, can still visit the location to enjoy a view of the famous Tú Sản Canyon.\nAccording to the culture and tourism ministry, the building was located outside the second protection zone of the Mã Pí Lèng national scenery heritage, but was still within the UNESCO-recognised Đồng Văn Karst Plateau Geopark.\nTaking that into account, the Panorama failed to comply with Article 36 of the Law on Cultural Heritage, the ministry concluded. The article demanded constructions of structures lying beyond a heritage’s protection zone that might damage the natural scenery and the surrounding biological environment to be approved first-hand by relevant authorities.\nThe appearance of the Panorama hostel-café was also deemed ‘not suited to the landscape and the traditional culture of the ethnic minorities in the region’, ‘blocking view of the visitors’, and ‘causing harm to the environment’.\nThe ministry affirmed that the construction of the Panorama was a breach of law and must be strictly handled to avoid negative impacts to the local community and society.\nThe ministry, however, did not demand the hostel-café be demolished. It instead asked the Hà Giang People’s Committee to renovate and turn the building into a stop-over for tourists. — VNS'",1

Experts have raised concerns on issues related to water resource mismanagement in the country. VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — According to experts at a\xa0forum on water resource management yesterday, Việt Nam is facing a severe water crisis.\nIn a report by the International Water Association, a country with inland surface water output of less than 4,000 cu.m per head per annum can be considered as lacking water.\nViệt Nam has an average surface water volume of about 830 billion cubic metres per year, but two thirds of that figure comes from other countries. With a population of over 90 million, each Vietnamese citizen receives only 3,370 cu.m of water per year.\nHighlighting the importance of water resources and the role of civil societies in water resource management at a forum held yesterday, experts raised concerns on issues related to water resource reduction, water pollution, misuse and mismanagement.\nĐào Trọng Tứ, vice chairman of Việt Nam Irrigation and Drainage Association and head of Việt Nam Rivers Network, said that the construction of hydropower plants along rivers was blocking the flow, causing water shortages for people living downstream.\nOn the 100-km-long Mã River, there were five hydropower plants, Tứ said.\nIn Hà Nội alone, at least six rivers are polluted, he said, adding that untreated wastewater from households, industrial zones or trade villages was flooding into the rivers and impacting people’s health.\n“Vietnamese people usually used groundwater for drinking, but now, the groundwater resources are polluted and exhausted because of improper management,” he said, adding that efforts were needed to tackle the problem.\n“Việt Nam has a relatively good legal framework on water resources, but the enforcement is not as good as it should be,” he said.\nNguyễn Hồng Khanh, head of the Irrigation Works Management Department under the agriculture ministry said that impacts of climate change and extreme weather were also affecting the country’s water resources.\nThis year, the volume stored in Việt Nam’s reservoirs was comparable to previous years, but still would not stretch for the spring-summer crop season.\n“At least three record heat waves hit the country this year, with the longest lasting from June 3 to July 1. The average temperature rose to 40 degrees Celsius, with low humidity and hot wind from Laos,” he said.\n“Freshwater is a limited resource, playing an important role in life and socio-economic development, but it is very susceptible to changes in weather,” he said.\nTrần Tuấn, Director of Hà Nôi-based Research and Training Centre for Community Development said that water shortages occurred when people did not protect and use water resources properly.\n“It’s necessary to optimise the exploitation and use of water,” he said, adding that the Government’s role in orientation is paramount.\nThe Government has made efforts to protect water resources but some industries hindered results, he said, emphasising that it was important to prevent activities that diminish water resources, by imposing heavier taxes, for example.\nKhanh, from the Irrigation Works Management Department, said it was very important for policy makers to consult people, organisations and civil society so that they could collect diversified points of view, which could help produce effective policies.\n“This goes for water resource policies too,” he said.\nThe forum yesterday was co-organised by Đại biểu nhân dân online newspaper and non-governmental organisations Information Centre under the Việt Nam Union of Science and Technology Associations. — VNS'",4

Finalists also noted the detrimental effect that poaching has on local communities and the necessity of abiding by the law.\n“We aim to empower future traditional medicine practitioners to seek out legal, sustainably sourced products. This work contributes to efforts tackling the global threat posed by the illegal wildlife trade and provides ways for the traditional medicine community to proactively protect endangered species,” said TRAFFIC’s Việt Nam director Sarah Ferguson.\n“We are glad to see students showing a growing interest in the conservation of the environment, biodiversity\xa0and wildlife species through this contest. It is of the utmost importance that we all raise their voices to eliminate the use of endangered wild species in traditional medicine,” said Đào Anh Sơn from HMU’s Training, Research and International Cooperation Department.\nIn 2018, also with funding from WWF Germany, TRAFFIC held a series of workshops for traditional medicine students, offering guidance on sustainable alternatives to illegal wildlife products. At the workshops, 85 per cent of students stated that they would not recommend illegal wildlife products, compared with an initial 68 per cent.\nThe majority of entrants were traditional medicine students, perhaps indicating a shift in attitude towards the acceptability of these products in a sector that still has links to the use of products from endangered species, such as rhino horn, pangolin scales, and tiger bones, despite their use being banned. So far this year, more than 40 tonnes of pangolin scales have been seized either in Việt Nam or en route to the country. — VNS'",4

The film was then banned from being screened in Việt Nam.\nAfter the cartoon’s release in Việt Nam, many parents who took their children to see the film expressed anger when seeing the Chinese\xa0nine-dash line map. The map was in the main character’s bedroom. The image appears in four scenes lasting for four seconds in the hour-and-a-half cartoon.\nThe Director of the Cinema Department, Nguyễn Thu Hà, has admitted her responsibility in the case and would co-ordinate with the distributor to stop screenings.\nIn their press release to local media, film distributor CGV said they immediately stopped screening the cartoon on Sunday\xa0after news it contained the map.\nThe company has also withdrawn all advertising for the cartoon.\n“As the distributor, CGV seriously admits our carelessness in the distribution process,” the press release said.\n“We recognise that this is a serious problem.

The total poultry had reached 409 million, exceeding the plan by 136 per cent.\nDương also pointed out shortcomings of the sector.\nFood safety, hygiene and disease control in livestock had exposed many shortcomings.\nThe recent outbreak of African swine fever occurred in many localities, causing big losses to farmers.\nTreatment of waste from husbandry activities had not yet been solved while it was a key factor causing rural environmental pollution.\nIn fact, if husbandry waste was properly treated, it would be a valuable resource to produce organic fertilisers and biogas worth VNĐ15-20 billion a year.\nTo accelerate the animal husbandry industry, the government should offer incentives to lure investment from all economic sectors, of which tax and land use policies were key factors, said Dương. – VNS'",1

It is said that if the population of the world continues to consume natural resources at the current rate, by 2050 we will need another one and a half worlds to satisfy our appetite.\n“The consequences of such would be equally alarming. As we consume, we would produce wastes in various quantities and forms. When wastes are not properly managed, they can become problems to the environment. And plastics wastes are among them.”\nHe told Việt Nam News:\xa0“We believe the circular economy concept of make-use-return is now the only solution to replace the linear economy of take-make and dispose.”\nThe philosophy behind the circular economy is focused on making the most out of resources throughout their life cycle, from planning and designing, manufacturing and consumption to waste management and reuse or recycling, all with the aim of promoting the sustainability of the economy, society and environment.\nSixty per cent of plastic waste in the ocean can be traced to five countries in Southeast Asia, Yanaranop said.\nJim Seward, vice president, sustainability, technology and joint ventures, of global chemical company LyondellBasell, said: “We believe the time for action is now. Success will require collaboration and a co-ordinated effort across many sectors to create sustainable outcomes and impacts.”\nBrendan Edgerton, director of circular economy at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, said: “Despite the many benefits plastics bring to people around the world, unmanaged plastic waste has become a global challenge.”\nThe alliance at the event highlighted an initial set of collaborative projects that reflect a range of solutions to end plastic waste.\nIn such projects, the alliance partners with cities in the region to design integrated management systems in large urban areas where infrastructure is lacking.\nIt would also promote technologies, business models and entrepreneurs to prevent ocean plastic waste and develop an open-source data platform to provide valuable information about the sources, location and formats of plastic waste to help support waste management projects.\nThe AEPW is a global non-profit organisation that seeks to end plastic waste in the environment, especially in the oceans, in Southeast Asia.\nIt represents 40 companies that are headquartered in North and South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East\xa0and Asia.\nIt has committed almost US$1 billion worth of funds, and has a goal of investing $1.5 billion, in\xa0action-based projects over the next five years, mostly in Southeast Asia, where the need is greatest.\nAs a founding partner with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the alliance focuses its strategy on key areas such as infrastructure, innovation, education and engagement, and cleaning up.\nResearch shows nearly 80 per cent of the plastic waste in the ocean begins as litter on land, and a vast majority travels to the sea through rivers, canals and other waterways.\nAround eight million tonnes of plastic winds up in the ocean each year.\nThe event was held as part of a conference titled “Circular Economy: Collaboration for Action”, hosted by SCG, which closed on Monday. — VNS'",4

3348,'Time to jump on the pre-season bandwagon',"WE WANT YOU BACK: It was three years ago Việt\xa0Nam played Manchester City in a pre-season friendly. Probably best not to mention the score. Photo vietnamplus.vn\nPaul Kennedy\nThe distance between Manchester and Leeds in the north of England is about 70 kilometres.\nOn a good day, without any hold-ups on the motorway, it should take about an hour to drive between the two cities. Maybe less.\nYet last night, Man United and Leeds played each other quite literally on the opposite side of the world. More than 14,600km away at the Optus Stadium in Perth, Western Australia.\nUnited are one of many\xa0top Premier League clubs who choose to warm-up for the season ahead in far flung corners of the globe.\nIt’s a great marketing opportunity to raise awareness, not that much was needed in the first place, of Manchester United around the world.\nLiverpool this weekend embark on a three-match tour of the United States which includes a game at Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox baseball team, which incidentally is owned by the same people who own Liverpool.\nChelsea are playing in Japan, Tottenham in Singapore and China, Manchester City are also playing in China and you’ll find Arsenal pre-seasoning in the US.\nThese are amazing opportunities for supporters the world over to get the chance to see their heroes play live.\nBut from all these venues, there is one place missing, one place that has a fanbase just as, if not more passionate about football, than the United Kingdom, and that’s Viet Nam.\nThere was a rumour a few months ago that Liverpool were going to be playing in Ha Noi this year.\nIt was quite quickly rubbished for a number of reasons. First, the dates suggested were just a week or so after the Champions League Final, so that was a no-no, and secondly, as mentioned above, with Liverpool’s owners being American, that’s were any pre-season matches will be for the foreseeable future.\nBut it is something the powers that be here\xa0should seriously explore.\nIf a Liverpool, Man United or a Chelsea team were to decide to pre-season here in Viet Nam it would be a spectacular event for the country. And really there’s no reason why not.\nA few weeks ago, an Asian-branded beer brought ex-players Rio Ferdinand, Roberto Carlos, Luis Figo, Didier Drogba and Park Ji-Sung to HCM City for a football tournament.\nThe game itself between the former professionals and a local team may not have been much to write home about, and the players were probably paid a small fortune to play, but the fans' reaction to seeing their heroes was amazing.\nAnd that could easily be repeated with more regular pre-season fixtures being arranged across the country.\nManchester City came in 2015 and a few years before Arsenal played here, much to the appreciation of thousands upon thousands of fanatical supporters.\nIt’s no secret that Vietnamese people are crazy about football. While the passion and loyalty to the national team is plain to see, many also have a deep knowledge of the game and would jump at the chance to see the likes of Mohammed Salah, Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford in the flesh.\nEnglish, and indeed other European teams, see pre-season not only as a chance to get match-fit and prepared for the season ahead, but also a massive marketing opportunity.\nAnd Việt Nam needs to get amongst it, jump on board and start speaking to the powers that be to get in on the act.\nIt is four years since City visited, and six since Arsenal came. We need to start writing the invitations, and get them in the post to all the top teams in Europe.\nNext year, Hà\xa0Nội\xa0will host the biggest event in motor racing when a Formula 1 race takes place in April, so arranging a few football games should be child's\xa0play.

Every year, about 300 people die and go missing due to natural disasters, causing economic losses of around 1 to 1.5 per cent of the country’s GDP.\n“The FbF approach aims to optimise the application of technology, data and weather forecast information from the global network into actions and early response before disasters occur to protect lives, assets and livelihoods of vulnerable groups,” said President Thu.\nThu added that FbF was an effective approach to improving the resilience of the community to natural disasters, while also promoting cooperation among scientists, national governments, research institutes and the private sector in improving the effectiveness of forecasting, preparedness and response to increasing natural disaster risks.\nSince 2017, VNRC has applied a new FbF approach by implementing a pilot project on early response to heat waves in Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng and developing an action plan on financial support based on forecasts and supporting 21 provinces and cities to develop a forecast map of the impact of natural disasters.\n“Expanding needs, competing priorities and scarce financial resources globally mean that new tools are needed to ensure smart, effective investments to help attenuate the impact of disasters before they occur,” said FAO Representative in Việt Nam Albert T. Lieberg at the event.\nLieberg suggested that the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority and the Provincial Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control should form the fundamental driving force to move forward FbF implementation.\nDevelopment partners, NGOS and international organisations should adopt the forecast-based financing approach in their strategies and programmes.\n“Households must be well aware of the necessary actions to take for mitigating the anticipated impact of disasters. Therefore, stronger coordination and collaboration between the Việt Nam Disaster Management Authority and the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting\xa0are key to providing actionable early warnings with reliable prediction of likely impacts and recommended early actions,” said Lieberg.\nThe FAO representative also highlighted the role of social assistance as important to establishing effective targeting and delivery mechanisms for disaster preparedness and response, including forecast-based financing.\n“Mass organisations like the Red Cross, Women's Union, Farmers' Union and others, play a vital role in disaster preparedness and response. With networks at the community level, they are well-positioned to support the formulation of early actions, disseminate actionable early warning messages and identify vulnerable groups,” he said.\nThis year, the forum aims to gather and establish a network of agencies, departments, experts, scientists and gain a common understanding of how FbF can contribute to the Government's efforts to improve community resilience to natural disasters. It also provides opportunities for participants to share and exchange experiences on FbF among domestic and international agencies and organisations and develop a roadmap towards the institutionalisation of the FbF approach in Việt Nam. — VNS",1

Short travel distance also helps keep the cost of goods down and China’s appetite for Vietnamese products has been rising in recent years.\nThese advantages, however, account for little if Vietnamese companies can’t handle stricter regulations set by the Chinese side.\nHe advised Vietnamese companies to invest in new technologies in preservation and sanitation, saying technology\xa0not only gives Vietnamese products easier access to Chinese market but also brings added-value. It would also address a major shortcoming of Vietnamese agricultural products as\xa0the country tends to export in large volume but net gains remain\xa0modest as product value is low.\n“Two major barriers Vietnamese products are facing to enter foreign markets are food safety and phytosanitary. Once we are able to overcome the\xa0barriers, our products will have access to a greater number of markets,” Nguyên said.\nFor the time being, the MOIT’s department of import and export urged companies to stay updated on the latest changes and developments in the Chinese market. The department asked companies to work with farmers to help them improve quality and product packaging to satisfy China’s regulations. — VNS'",2

With 13 million tonnes of waste released to the ocean every year, the country ranks 17th in the world for ocean plastic waste pollution.\nAlthough there are no official statistics on the amount and varieties of plastic in the Vietnamese sea and islands, plastic waste is easy to see in Vietnamese waters, with the country’s 112 estuaries the main gateways of plastic to the ocean.\nNumbers from Việt Nam’s Association of Plastic illustrate the scale of the problem. In 1990, each Vietnamese consumed 3.8kg of plastic per year, but 25 years later, the figure hit 41kg.\nAs many as 1,000 plastic bags are used each minute but only 27 per cent of them are treated and recycled.\nThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) estimated that about 80 tonnes of plastic waste and bags are thrown away every day in Hà Nội and HCM City combined.\nOn the positive side, Việt Nam has taken efforts to manage imported plastic scrap and monitor plastic production and consumption.\nDirector General of the sea and islands administration, Tạ Đình Thi, said in 2018, Việt Nam proposed Partnerships in Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia and launched initiatives to foster global co-operation in plastic waste reduction.\nA campaign launched by MONRE last year delivers the message that single actions are not enough to address plastic pollution but a series of actions like plastic recycling, saying no to single plastic use and seeking alternative energy solutions can help.\nNguyễn Thế Tuấn, head of Việt Nam Administration of Seas and Islands, said the first priority was to review legal documents related to plastic waste’s risk management to complete legal framework on Việt Nam’s ocean plastic waste combined with environmentally-friendly ocean growth strategy.\nAs 80 per cent of plastic waste comes from the mainland, management on plastic production and consumption is of importance, according to experts. Việt Nam is trying to make changes, starting with changing public behaviour.\nNguyễn Thượng Hiền, head of solid waste management department of MONRE’s Việt Nam Environmental Administration said that MONRE aimed to reduce 65 per cent of non-biodegradable plastic bags used at supermarkets and shopping malls by 2020 compare to 2010. By 2026, Việt Nam targets zero non-biodegradable plastic bags.\nA resident dries fish right next to a garbage dump in Cần Giờ Beach, HCM City. - Photo courtersy of Hùng Lekima\nWaste-to-energy\nThe majority of solid waste in Việt Nam is treated by burning or dumped in landfills.

The organic carbon soil has been certified to have higher nutrition levels than cow and chicken manure, even two times higher than organic bio-fertiliser.\nNguyễn Gia Long, director of Hydraulic Machine Ltd\xa0Company\xa0and waste-to-energy inventor in Việt Nam said the technology could be applied in the community and follows global green energy trend and has low investment in device and equipment and helps cut spending on hiring staff thanks to automation.\nNew Technology Company employs pyrolysis technology which uses heat to recycle plastic.

A clean and beautiful city with a lot of green spaces is always attractive.”\nMoreover, when it is very hot, people feel tired and their productivity is reduced, she said.\nA system for monitoring and analysing surface temperatures in the city should be set up for authorities and people to realize the changes and seek solutions, she added.\nPhạm Trần Hải, deputy head of the department of urban management studies at the HCM City Institute for Development Studies, said many countries in the world face the problem but have found solutions.\nSingapore, for example, is increasing its open green spaces and planting more trees along high-speed roads and streets to reduce urban temperatures, he said.\nThe green coverage rate in Singapore is 56 per cent while in HCM City it is 18 per cent, he said.\nIn May several public buses with plants installed on their roofs, claimed to be the first in Asia, began plying there.\nGreen roofs and green walls are common in Singapore and these help reduce urban heat islands, Hải said.\nIt has been subsidising the cost of these roofs and walls by 50 per cent since 2009, he said.\nGreen roofs should be installed on buildings in HCM City too because they also help reduce the rain flowing down into the streets, he added. — VNS'",4

The market has solid foundations for growth: it is politically stable, well-located for global supply chains and has a relatively young population.\n\nThe government has built on these foundations, focusing on business reforms and deregulation, investing in human capital and infrastructure, and embracing trade liberalisation, Standard Chartered noted.\n\nIt said the country's growth is likely to continue to be driven by FDI-led manufacturing and export growth. Rising tourism inflows and stronger domestic demand, supported by higher wages, are also likely to sustain strong growth.\n\nThe banking group added amidst the ongoing US-China trade dispute, the country may also be well-placed to benefit if it can absorb demand diverted to other locations as suppliers relocate from China.

Turkey grants university scholarships and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey hosts young Vietnamese diplomats within training programmes with ASEAN.\nTo strengthen common ground and to cater to incremental demand in exchanges, we expect Việt Nam and Turkey to raise public awareness of each other by fostering fertile collaboration in tourism, trade and investment flows, mutual economic endeavours and cultural promotion.\nTo achieve such objectives, an essential step is facilitating visa regime rocedures.\xa0Vietnamese citizens can enter Turkey with fast e-visa. Furthermore, daily flights operated by Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Hà Nội and HCM City provide a fast and efficient way of transportation.\nTurkey attaches particular importance to connecting with other actors at global scale. In this light, Southeast Asia is a focal point for Turkey. This is best explained by the 'Asia Anew' policy announced recently by Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey. The initiative will encompass and highlight Turkey's openings towards Southeast Asia and ASEAN.\nAs 2020 ASEAN Chaircountry and UNSC 2020-21\xa0non-permanent\xa0member, Việt Nam occupies a pivotal position within the new Turkish initiative. Apart from some achievements, plus solidarity demonstrated at regional and international forums,\xa0Turkey-Việt Nam potential has not been fully tapped.\nViệt Nam is on a path to further modernisation through comprehensive and peaceful development whereas Turkey for her part has worked to be able to deepen co-operation with Việt Nam. The two countries can work together to learn and benefit from their best practices.\nGeography and history\xa0have endowed both countries with valuable assets. As an influential member and Chair of ASEAN in 2020, Việt Nam could play a major role in realisation of Turkey’s quest for elevating her ties with ASEAN to new heights. Turkey, in return, could assist Viet Nam in expanding access to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.\nThe Turkish-Vietnamese partnership is expected to yield more results in the not-so-distant future.\xa0Bonds of amity and co-operation between our two countries will grow even stronger in time\xa0and the Embassy is ready to work with Vietnamese authorities and civil society towards this perspective.\nOn this occasion, we greet the readers of Việt Nam News with our earnest sentiments, while wishing well to the friendly people of Việt Nam and their eminent leaders. — VNS",5

There are always 100 to 200 students on the\xa0waiting\xa0list.\n“Starting up is a process of trial and error. SEN School is where I piloted\xa0different models. It offered\xa0me a foundation to fully express my philosophy and expectation of\xa0education,” Trang said.\nEntrepreneurial setting\nViệt Nam, as well as other ASEAN countries, had\xa0an entrepreneurial setting, according to research on future jobs released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in August.\nOver\xa031 per cent of the region’s younger generations are\xa0eager to build their own businesses or work for start-ups.\n“The result has reflected itself in different research\xa0and surveys,” said Santitarn Sathirathai, chief economist of the Singapore-based Sea Group.\n“Instead of working for certain companies, many young people show strong desire to play the role of an operator by themselves.”\nWEF\xa0research has recognised entrepreneurship as the most popular job choice among youths, yet only 25 per cent of respondents wish to become business owners.\nStart-ups\xa0are\xa0a relatively new and exciting concept for Vietnamese youngsters\xa0which have been\xa0promoted through contests, TV shows and even the Government’s assistance policies.\n“The number of start-ups created by students in Việt Nam has witnessed an upward trend recently but\xa0still lags\xa0behind other countries in the region like Indonesia and\xa0Singapore,” said Trang.\nFor her, the earlier you start, the more beneficial it is.\n“You will learn a lot once you roll up your sleeves and give it a try,” said Trang.\n“The business may fall short of your expectations but there is\xa0always room\xa0for mistakes.”\nJustin Wood, WEF head of Asia Pacific, said ASEAN youth had developed a growth mindset and understood\xa0the needy to uphold lifelong learning instead of receiving education and training only in their early years.\nFor a student-entrepreneur like Trang, formal education at school comes\xa0second.\n“I spend an entire day on working, brainstorming, meeting people and discussing with my team. A day ends only when I turn my laptop off and go to sleep. But I have learned a lot through interaction with new ideas, and at the same time, got to know myself better,” she said.\nOnly 14.1 per cent of ASEAN youths say\xa0they have learned important skills through formal on-the-job training, limiting their potential\xa0from being sharpened and unleashed.\n“In order to build a bright future for young people, it is critical for governments and businesses to understand their views, concerns, aspirations and\xa0priorities,” said Wood.\n“I am searching for\xa0a mentor myself,” she said. “In its third year, SEN has an opportunity to accelerate. Advice\xa0and assistance\xa0from someone experienced would really help,” Trang added.\n“It's only\xa0just begun.” —\xa0VNS",1

Some aquaculture farms were developing in the area,” Minh said.\n“No detailed biodiversity studies were given during the environment assessment process,"" he claimed.\nA corner of the threatened nipa palm forest in Bình Sơn District. — VNS Photo Công Thành\nMinh, who is head of the Environment Biological Resource Teach Research Team, said the team, in co-operation with the Centre of Biodiversity Conservation, GreenViet, a NGO, had surveyed the biodiversity of the nipa forests and mangrove swamps and found them extremely rich.\n“Seventy five species of flora and fauna were found on a total 120ha of nipa palm forest. The 100-year-old forest area is also a safe shelter for 26 migrant bird and waterfowl species. Almost 90 per cent of aquatic animals and fish in the coastal area breed in the ecological system of nipa palm forest before moving to the sea,” Minh said.\nMai Văn Ban, 73, a veteran in the commune, said the forest had safely sheltered him and two army troops during the American war in 1966-72.\n“The forest had provided us fish, while prevented us from bombardments and military attacks. It still creates income for local residents from fish farming and crafts in peace, and providing a green shadow with rich oxygen as well as flood and erosion prevention,” Ban said.\n“We protests the destruction of the forest, they (investors) could build a reservoir at another location, not in the nipa palm forest,” he said.\nHồ Duy Diệm, a member of Việt Nam Association for River Basin and Coastal Area Protection, said the forest played an important role in environment protection and development of coastal fish and seafood species.\nHe said the destruction of the forest would result in mass damage for generations.\nVice chairman of Bình Phước Commune’s People’s Committee Nguyễn Vũ said the VNT19 company could ask for land clearance at paddy fields nearby for reservoir construction rather than destroy the forest.\nHe said the forest created a green landscape and shelter for fish, shrimps and oyster, while protecting farming land from erosion and salinity.\nIn a press conference last month, Chairman of VNT 19 paper mill Nguyễn Tiên Phong said work on the plant would stop if an environmental incident occurred.\nHe said the plant had been included in a Master Plan of Việt Nam Paper Industry in 2020-25 with total capacity of 350,000 tonnes of paper each year.\nThe paper plant needs 4.3 million cubic metres each year for production.\nThe 173ha paper mill with an investment of VNĐ10 trillion ($442 million) plans to release 73,000cu.m of waste water each day to the bay of Việt Thanh through a 5.2km pipe line.\nAccording to latest report from the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the province has 197ha of coastal mangrove forest, a drop of nearly 60 per cent since 2002. — VNS'",4

The VN-Index is forecast to continue floating between 980 and 1,000 points. — VNA/VNS Photo Trần Việt\nHÀ NỘI — Concerns about the US-China trade talks have\xa0lifted for now, and investors are turning their attention to third quarter earnings reports and how listed companies will perform in the last three months of the year.\nLocal markets have already factored these events\xa0in, and foreign investors remain\xa0cautious about\xa0ongoing\xa0international disputes, so stocks are not expected to react strongly over\xa0the next few weeks.\nViệt Nam’s benchmark VN-Index on the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange finished last week at 991.84 points, up total 0.43 per cent from the previous one.\nThe minor HNX-Index on the Hà Nội Stock Exchange ended last week at 105.26 points, nearly unchanged from the previous week’s end of 105.16 points.\nBoth indices were weighed down by market caution as investors waited\xa0for statements from\xa0the two-day US-China trade talks\xa0which closed on Friday (local time) in Washington. The two sides reportedly came up with a deal to postpone\xa0their dispute, but analysts and businesses remained uncertain about the feasibility of the\xa0agreement.\nBut positive reactions from the US and China last weekend helped boost\xa0local market sentiment, easing investor\xa0concerns\xa0about the potential for a\xa0global economic recession.\n“The two economies have overcome the most uptight stage of their relationship. They have clearly been willing to sit down and talk to reach an agreement,” Nguyễn Trung Du, director of investment services at VNĐirect Securities Corp,\xa0said.\nThe developments of the US-China trade relations would\xa0definitely have some impact on the Vietnamese market, Ngô Thế Hiển, vice director of the market analysis department at Sài Gòn-Hà Nội Securities Corp (SHS), said.\n“If a deal is struck, both domestic and international markets will be boosted. If not, it wouldn’t be a disaster for the markets as long as the tensions don’t escalate,” Hiển said.\nIn recent months, the Vietnamese stock market had\xa0not been affected that\xa0much by the developments of the US-China trade row, so the VN-Index may hang\xa0between 980\xa0and 1,000 points, he added.\nForeign investors would continue to be\xa0net\xa0sellers in\xa0risky markets and shelter in safe assets such as government bonds and gold, so it’s difficult to expect a strong wave of capital flowing\xa0into the market like the late 2017-early 2018 period, Du from VNĐirect said.\nNet foreign selling last week reached VNĐ265 billion (US$11.4 million) on the Vietnamese stock market. Despite the figure being\xa0down 75 per cent on a weekly basis, it still indicated caution among foreign investors.\nInvestors were still focused on several listed companies whose stocks were highlighted by their earnings such as banks, consumer firms, retailers and tech\xa0companies, he said.\n“But those firms’ stocks have been priced in earlier, so they won’t make a big impact on the market when the news is delivered,” Du said.\nInvestors were eyeing companies’ fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, and those with good nine-month performances were likely to grow in the last quarter, he added.\nThe banking, retail and tech\xa0sectors had provided the momentum in recent weeks. The VN-Index has gained 3.12 per cent since September 11 when investors began looking at\xa0companies’ third-quarter profit reports.\nDuring that\xa0period, Vietcombank\xa0(VCB) has\xa0increased\xa010.5 per cent, tech group FPT Corp (FPT) by\xa07.4 per cent and dairy producer Vinamilk (VNM) by\xa06.6 per cent.\nThe level 1,000-point mark would\xa0remain a “mental” challenge for the VN-Index, Du said.\nThere would\xa0be no big difference on how the VN-Index would\xa0move in the short term because investors were still doubtful about the strength of the Vietnamese stock market, Nguyễn Hoàng Việt, senior market analyst at Vietinbank Securities Co, said.\nIn a bad scenario, the VN-Index may settle at 975 points\xa0if it failed\xa0to conquer the 1,000-point milestone, he forecast. — VNS'",2

4608,'To-your-health: Understanding Dengue fever',"Dr.\xa0Sheila Rodriguez. — Photo courtesy of Family Medical Practice\nby Dr. Sheila Rodriguez*\nWhat Is Dengue fever and what causes it?\nDengue fever is a flu-like illness caused by one of the serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 or DEN-4) from the Flaviviridae family, and is transmitted by a female mosquito from the Aedes aegypti species. Persons who harbour the virus may or may not be symptomatic with most cases being mild and resolving on their own.\nWhere can it be found?\nThe dengue virus is found in countries with rainfall, high humidity and temperate climates because these conditions favour mosquito breeding and survival. As of 2010, 70 per cent of infections came from Asia and 14 per cent came from the Americas. More cases are also seen due to unplanned rapid urbanization which leads to high population density, poverty and poor infrastructure, specifically in water and waste management. Eggs remain viable for several months and hatch when in contact with water.\nHow is Dengue virus transmitted?\nThe virus is not spread directly from person to person, but through a mosquito bite. Once a female Aedes aegypti bites someone with the virus the mosquito transmits by biting and injecting it onto another. Transmission from one person to another begins 2 days before until 2 days after symptoms are seen. Once the virus undergoes incubation inside the mosquito, the mosquito is capable of transmitting it for the rest of its life. The Aedes aegypti has evolved into an intermittent biter (more than one person at a time) such that it is now considered a highly efficient epidemic vector.\nWho gets Dengue? What are the symptoms?\nAccording to one Asian study children between 3-12 years old are mostly affected, although it can occur as young as 1 up to 16 years old. Symptoms of dengue include high fever of 40°C/104°F, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, pain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints, swollen glands and a rash. Mild symptoms usually last 2–7 days; however if the infection doesn't clear when expected or the patient presents with warning signs below, it is imperative to bring to the pediatrician right away.\nWhat are the warning signs?\n3–7 days after the first symptoms appear, dengue fever lyses to below 38°C/100°F. The succeeding 24-48 hours are critical; warning signs include severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, nose or gum bleeding, fatigue, restlessness and blood in vomit or stools.\xa0Note that not all dengue fevers are fatal but if your child has any of the above symptoms along with at least 3 days fever, you need to bring them to a doctor. Early and proper medical care is needed to avoid complications and risk of death.\nHow Is Dengue fever diagnosed?\nPCR is a molecular test recommended by WHO during the first 5-6 days of illness; it is currently the only method which identifies the specific DENV serotype during acute disease.\nDengue NS1 antigen test is another early and rapid method. Ordering a dengue NS1 assay within the first week of illness is one of the initial investigations recommended by the Ministry of Health, Singapore.\nDengue IgM and IgG tests detect antibodies in a person exposed to the virus, but are most accurate when performed 5 days after exposure.\nComplete blood count (CBC) may show an increased hematocrit indicating fluid loss, or a decrease in platelet count which may lead to further blood loss.\nHow is Dengue fever treated?\nParacetamol eases the headaches and pains associated with dengue fever. Aspirin or ibuprofen should be avoided because they decrease the platelet count which makes bleeding more likely.\nMild degnue is managed at home but severe dengue is critical for which hospitalisation and close monitoring are necessary.\nCan one get another episode of Dengue?\nRecovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that particular DENV serotype. However, persons may still be infected by any of the other three, and the risk of severe dengue likewise increases with succeeding episodes.\nIs there a Dengue vaccine?\nThe live attenuated Dengvaxia® proved efficacious and safe when given to persons who had Dengue in the past; however, it carries an increased risk of severe illness in those who have not had a previous infection. Hence only persons with laboratory-confirmed past dengue infections should be vaccinated.\nHow else can Dengue fever be prevented?\nThe Aedes aegypti mosquito lives in urban habitats and breeds in man-made containers. Standing water from rubber tires, buckets, planters, toys, pools, birdbaths, flower pots or saucers should be inspected.

It too has seen handsome results, and plans to further invest in this segment.\nAs of October, it had 23 stores, which made a substantial contribution to the company’s turnover in the first 10 months of the year of VNĐ13.4 trillion ($582.4 million). Its after-tax profit was VNĐ935 billion ($40.7 million).\nSome other watch retailers have also been expanding rapidly in recent years. Đăng Quang Watch, for instance, now has 63 stores in major cities and provinces; Xwatch has 12 showrooms in Hà Nội, HCM City and Quảng Ninh.\nDoji, another Vietnamese jewelry brand, also entered the market last year and is taking baby steps.\nThe clamour to enter the market is because of the great potential that exists.\n“After observing the fashion watch\xa0market, we realised it had real potential,” a PNJ spokesperson told Thời báo Kinh tế Việt Nam (Vietnam Economics Times) newspaper.\nThe newspaper quoted Trần Thái Sơn of Viet\xa0Dragon Securities Corp as saying:\xa0“The watch retail market in Việt Nam is worth around $1 billion, excluding counterfeits and products brought in by hand, which is quite substantial.”\nSSI Securities Corporation\xa0said the market grew by 300 per cent in the first half of this year, and the rapid growth is expected to continue.\nThe market is forecast to reach VNĐ200-300 trillion by 2025, 10 times its current size.\nAn MWG spokesperson said: “The market is very profitable. We don’t see any risks.”\nA PNJ executive said the fact that MWG entered the watch market proved his company’s decision to invest further in it is correct. “It is also a good sign for consumers, because it is difficult to find genuine and prestigious watch sellers.”\nRetailers like PNJ and MWG also entered the market with a clear advantage. The former, for instance, had a large network of jewellery stores, a modern retail management system and huge amount of customer data, all of which help\xa0it save on space and staff costs for selling watches, and selling high-end watches together with expensive jewellery makes commercial sense.\nPNJ has outlined a plan to further expand its store network and develop human resources for online retailing of watches from now through 2021. Its online sales now account for 20-25 per cent of its revenue\xa0and are rising.\n“We believe we are on the right track and will see a breakthrough in terms of revenue and profit in the next couple of years,” PNJ CEO Lê Trí Thông said.\nAt its annual general meeting this year, he said the new plan envisages the watch business contributing VNĐ130 billion a year to revenue.\nThe company’s market share would increase to 50 per cent by next year, with watch sales rising to three million units.\nMWG’s Thegioididong.com accounts for more than half of the country’s mobile phone sales while its Dienmayxanh.com accounts for roughly 45 per cent of consumer electronic sales.\nThe company is thus confident of developing a watch retail chain very quickly based on its existing network of over 2,000 stores.\nTechnology-based management, excellent service and authentic after-sale service are MWG’s advantages besides its large customer base.\nThe company is selling watches through a unique ‘shop-in-shop’ model at its mobile phone and consumer electronics stores.\nAt these stores, watches are displayed like normal retail products so that shoppers can touch and feel them. It is focusing on VNĐ3-5 million ($130-215) watches and brands such as Michael Kors, Fossil and Casio, which are most favoured by Vietnamese.\nAnalysts are confident that this business model will work. — VNS'",2

Viet Nam wants to hit $40 billion in textile export turnover in 2019. VNA/VNS Photo Trần Việt\nHÀ NỘI - The domestic textile and garment industry was still striving to reach its export revenue target of US$40 billion this year despite facing many difficulties, said Vũ Đức Giang, chairman of the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS).\nTo achieve this target, the industry needs export value growth of at least 11-12 per cent for the rest of the year, he said.\nAccording to the association, growth reached only 9.1 per cent in the third quarter, much lower than the same period in 2018. However, it was higher than other textile producers including China, India and Bangladesh.\nThe association is hoping textile enterprises will be able to deliver big orders to push export value up in December.\nThe most important thing is for textile and garment enterprises to search for markets and alternative partners. Currently, the businesses can take advantage of the Vietnam-EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) to promote export expansion to some markets in the EU as well as Canada and Australia.\nCanada holds a lot of potential for Việt Nam with import value of textiles and garments reaching more than $13 billion each year, while Việt Nam's textile and apparel exports to this market reach only about $550 million per year.\nViệt Nam does not have a free trade agreement (FTA) with Canada so the CPTPP opens the door for Việt Nam's textile and apparel products. Businesses need to seize this opportunity and seek partners in Canada.\nThân Đức Việt, general director of Garment 10 Corporation, said to achieve export success, enterprises needed to be aware of requirements on price, quality, quantity and production time. Moreover, they must also ensure production stability.\nAt the same time, enterprises also needed to cooperate with each other through affiliate programmes and support from the association to meet the rules of origin stated in FTAs.\nEnterprises, especially small businesses, should build a production chain to meet the demand of large contracts in terms of quantity, quality and time of delivery, as well as to create a name for themselves.\nIn recent years, the textile and garment industry had developed strongly and exports had grown year by year, according to the association. However, it still faced many challenges in production and business, such as low labour productivity, lack of high quality human resources and mainly processing products rather than manufacturing them.\nIn addition, challenges from export markets had also put pressure on them, including increasing protectionism, higher quality demands, and environment and technical tests.\nAccording to VITAS, local apparel producers were facing falling export orders. Since mid 2019, some businesses had been able to sign export contracts for small quantities each month. Meanwhile, in the same period last year, many large enterprises had export orders stacked up till the end of the year.\nCao Hữu Hiếu, CEO of Việt Nam Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex), said most textile and garment businesses did not have enough orders to keep them operating until the end of the year.\nLarge businesses such as Garment 10 Corporation, Đức Giang Garment Joint Stock Company, Hòa Thọ Textile Garment Joint Stock Corporation, Hà Nội Textile and Garment Joint Stock Corporation (Hanosimex) had export contract to maintain production until November, but only Việt Tiến Garment Joint Stock Company was going to be busy until the year-end.\nHiếu said given the current situation, the industry would find it difficult to reach the export target of $40 billion this year. - VNS",2

He had to check on the phone every night in order to handle any problem emerged at the oil rig quickly.\n“With just a moment of distraction, if a problem suddenly happens and we cannot handle, it would leave severe consequences,” he said.\nDuring the day, it often took Phúc and his colleagues at least two hours to meet and discuss working plans and results every day.\n“That became part of my life,” he said.\nWhen the drilling for the Biển Đông 01 project successfully ended in 2016, that rhythm of life no longer existed but Phúc could not forget that period and was still proud of working during it.\nThe Biển Đông 01 project is considered an important achievement of the oil and gas industry of Việt Nam in the East Sea. The project was developed by the group to exploit two gas and condensate fields – Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh with duration expected to be 25 years and a capacity of 8.5 million cubic metres of natural gas per day. Its success proved the potential of the industry and contributed to partly ensuring the national energy security.\nDrilling at Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh gas and condensate fields was considered as a decisive factor for the success of the Biển Đông 01 project because these areas have special complicated geology.\nIn 2009, there was no rigs in Việt Nam that could meet drilling conditions at Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh gas and condensate fields. As a result, the PV Drilling Company had two options – hiring a drilling rig from abroad or building a new one.\nHowever, at that time, there were only seven TAD drilling rigs in the world but no rigs meeting conditions of high temperature and high pressure at the two gas fields. If these rigs were hired, they needed to be upgraded to meet the drilling requirements. Meanwhile, each rig was leased at a cost of US$500,000 per day.\nThe decision was made to build their own. This was considered a plan with the best economic efficiency.

Many projects have seriously encroached on the environment of many rare animals. However, we can’t negate that many projects have brought benefits to the community. In real life, sometimes we have to calculate the pros and cons and choose the invasive ways to protect wild animals.\nCan you give us examples about\xa0how the habitats of wild animals have been encroached upon?\nWildlife protection is common\xa0in many countries. \xa0However, in Việt Nam, particularly submerged forests that are sanctuaries for migrant\xa0birds, have been destroyed. Another example I want to mention is the Cà Tong giraffe which is only found\xa0in the Central Highlands. But in recent years, due to the fast development of coffee and pepper plantations, the population\xa0has fallen\xa0considerably. Other species have also been hit by hunters and poachers.\nHaving researched wild animals\xa0for many years, what is your assessment of the current situation?\nStudies conducted in Northern Việt Nam before 1976 and then in the Central Highlands found a rich diversity of species. But if you ask me to compare the present population of wild animals and rare\xa0species, I’m very sorry to say there are\xa0two extremes. In the past, we always spotted different species when we went into the forest, but now spotting an animal is a rarity.\nWhat concerns do you have about the future of our animal populations?\nWe are worried about this situation. Legally speaking, our laws that should\xa0protect\xa0endangered\xa0animals are rather comprehensive, but making them work has become a headache for us.\nFor example, in 2010, despite our efforts coupled by strong support from wildlife organisations, the last rhino in Việt Nam was killed.\nIt is regrettable to say that the work of conservation and protection of wild animals in Việt Nam is very poor and in certain cases, there are\xa0violations of\xa0our laws._VNS",4

VNA/VNS Van Diep\nHÀ NỘI — The draft law on public-private-partnership\xa0(PPP) projects, composed by the Ministry of Planning and Investment\n(\nMPI),\nwas submitted\nto the National Assembly Standing Committee for consideration yesterday.\nThe draft proposes PPP projects be unavailable in\xa0sectors that have so far seen no PPP projects, those with ineffective PPP projects, or those lacking appeal to investors, and others where other kinds of investment would be more fitting.\nUnder the draft, tourism; culture and sports; telecommunications infrastructure; infrastructure\nfor science and technology\ndevelopment; infrastructure at industrial parks, economic zones, industrial clusters, and high-tech parks; and infrastructure for rural areas and agriculture would be banned from running PPP projects.\nThere are also changes in the draft law regarding Government guarantees and risk-sharing. Specifically, the draft proposes Government guarantees of foreign exchange balance for PPP projects be determined by the NA and the Prime Minister, with a maximum of 30\nper cent\nof project revenue paid to private investors in VND.\nThe risk-sharing mechanism for revenue\nis also proposed\nin the draft law to\nbe extended\nto key projects decided by the NA and the PM.\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng\xa0said implementation of PPP projects in the past showed the investment in this model of PPP in Việt Nam still had many risks.\nAmong them, there are market risks, but there are also many risks stemming from the Government's decisions, such as decisions to abandon fee collection tools or to waive road fee\nadjustment\nof planning and pricing mechanisms, or changes in foreign currency policy. Such risks would affect\nproject\nrevenue.\nThe Minister of Planning and Investment said a risk-sharing mechanism is necessary.\nAccording to Dũng, the draft law's revenue risk-sharing mechanism\xa0lets investors share a part of the risk when a project has a revenue deficit.\nOn the other hand, the\nGovernment will receive back the shares when the project has revenue higher than the initial targets.\nSpecifically, the Government would have to commit to sharing with investors\xa0not\nmore than\nhalf\xa0of the deficit between actual revenue and committed revenue in the contract, while\xa0investors have to share with the Government not less than half\xa0of the increase in revenue between actual revenue and committed revenue in the contract.\nHead of the NA Judiciary Committee\xa0Lê\xa0Thị\xa0Nga\xa0said the proposal was not rational.\nWhen the Government signs a contract with investors, it should ensure the contract is\nfeasible\n, she said.\nFor instance, when building a build-operate-transfer toll booth, the Government and the investor should make sure the location is rational. It would not be right if the toll booth\nis set\nup at a location where people would object to pay, and then the Government has to share risk costs, she said.\nPhan\nThanh Binh, head of the National Assembly's Committee for Culture, Education, Youth, Adolescents and Children, proposed re-considering the risk-sharing mechanism in the draft law.\n“We are an agricultural country, but for farmers, do we have a\xa0policy to share\nrisk?\nWhy do we raise the problem of risk-sharing\nwhen it comes to\nPPP projects? Every year, when farmers face consumption problems, we\xa0say they have to deal with it because it’s A market problem!” he said.\nViệt Nam has so far attracted 336 PPP projects in transport, technical infrastructure, energy, water supply and drainage, environment, culture, sports AND education and training, among other fields.\nThe draft Law on PPP is expected be completed\nthis month\xa0before being submitted to the National Assembly for discussion in October 2019 and\xa0approval in May 2020.\nThe NA Standing Committee later the same day agreed with the addition of the Irish government’s non-refundable aid worth VNĐ77.49 billion (US$3.36 million) into the State budget estimate for this year.\n\nThe sum will be used for communes in especially disadvantaged circumstances under Programme 135.\n\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng said the aid will be given to the provinces of Hà Giang with VNĐ18 billion, Hoà Bình VNĐ20.9 billion, Quảng Trị VNĐ9.49 billion, Kon Tum VNĐ19.2 billion, and Trà Vinh VNĐ9.9 billion.\n\nUnder the agreement, the Irish government pledged to offer no more than 12 million EUR ($13.2 million) in non-refundable aid to a project on supporting communes in especially difficult situations under Programme 135 during fiscal years from 2017 to 2020.\n\nLast year, the five provinces were assigned to disburse upwards of VNĐ79.8 billion for the project. — VNS",0

The State collects VNĐ50 trillion (about $2.1 billion) from taxes from alcohol sales each year, but spends VNĐ65 trillion ($2.6 billion) on healthcare expenses and other consequences caused by drunk drinking.\nNA deputy Phạm Khánh Phong Lan from HCM City said punishments on drunk drivers\xa0should\xa0be extended to stricter punishments like forcing violators to do community service, increasing the cost of their vehicle insurance, or even temporary detention of drivers in extremely dangerous cases or in cases of repeated violations.\nThe blood alcohol levels of suspected drink-drivers must be tested to ensure equal punishments in each case, deputy Nguyễn Thị Phúc from Bình Thuận Province said.\nDeputies proposed the NA issue a resolution on drunk-driving punishments, adding that solutions to improve public awareness and public campaigns to condemn drunk drivers must be used as well as\xa0laws.\nAlcohol's impact\xa0on children\nLawmakers also expressed concern over how alcohol advertising affects young people.\nDeputy Phạm Thị Minh Hiền from Phú Yên Province pointed out that alcohol consumption can lead to criminal actions.\n“Anyone can become victims of alcohol, or even commit crimes if alcohol’s impacts are not controlled,” she said, raising fears that alcoholic drinks will become even more popular among young people if nothing is done to curb advertising and sales.\nSeveral alcoholic drinks are advertised as\xa0soft drinks or fermented juice, Hiền claimed, without giving any examples.\nHiền proposed limiting\xa0the number of children exposed to alcohol advertisements and controlling advertisement content to ensure children are not encouraged to drink.\nA change to the draft regulation regarding online alcohol sales also caused controversy.\nA previous iteration of the draft proposed banning sales of alcohol stronger than 15 per cent online, however the version discussed yesterday did away with this limitation and would allow sales of all kinds of booze online.\nInternet alcohol sales are currently largely unregulated.\nDeputy Phạm Trọng Nhân from Bình Dương Province said the regulation would pave\xa0the way for more young people to buy drinks online, especially as more and more young\xa0people have access to the internet.\nOther deputies noted that law enforcement is important but must ensure public health and the\xa0benefits of alcohol producers and sellers.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation,\xa0Việt Nam’s beer consumption amounts to billions of litres per year. — VNS",0

M, who asked for anonymity, tried his best for four years to get his hands on a bachelor degree on chemistry from the HCM City Pedagogy University.\nM\xa0remembered he felt the major was not suitable for him since his second year but the pressure from his family and friends was too big for him to speak up for himself.\nHe graduated just as his parents wished, got a job in his field and worked for six months before he gave up. The job mentally exhausted him, so he quit and\xa0enrolled in a vocational course.\n“There are many kinds of job to do if you only want to earn money and raise your station. But it has to be a job\xa0you can have fun in so that you can do it for a long time and your life is meaningful,” M said.\n“There’s nothing more joyful than being able to learn and do what you like and want to do.”\nViệt Giao Vocational School headmaster Trần Phương acknowledged that many students went to university due to their parents’ pressure without being able to choose the school or major themselves. If they did not like their subject, it would be very difficult for them to keep going and even harder when they started working, he said.\nSài Gòn Tourism Vocational School headmaster Ngô Thị Quỳnh Hương said there were families in which parents or even grandparents worked in the same career and wanted the next generation to “keep the family tradition”.\n“But parents are doing well (in a career) doesn’t necessarily mean their children will also do well as each person is different and has their own interests. Parents should only give suggestions and not strip the children of their right to decide their life and what career they want to work in,” she said. — VNS",1
1855,'VN exporters can only take advantage of CPTPP with preparation',"Delegates discuss opportunities and challenges arising from CPTPP for Việt Nam’s garment and textile, footwear, timber products and beverage sectors at a conference held in HCM City on December 5. — VNS Photo\nHCM CITY — With preferential tariffs provided under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Việt Nam has the opportunity to increase exports of garments, footwear, timber products, and beverages to other member countries.\nBut Vietnamese enterprises’ ability to take advantage depends on their preparation, Nguyễn Thị Thu Trang, director of the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s WTO and Integration Centre, said.\nSpeaking at a conference titled 'Opportunities and Challenges from CPTPP for Việt Nam’s Garment and Textile, Footwear, Timber Products and Beverage Sectors' held in HCM City on December 5, she said: “Our exports of footwear, garment and textile, timber products, and beverages to CPTPP member countries account for 12.5 per cent, 16.04 per cent, 20 per cent\xa0and 23.46 per cent of their total exports.\n“We export a lot to CPTPP member countries, but our market share remains modest, for instance at 2-2.9 per cent of their footwear imports and 0-6 per cent of garment and textile imports. Therefore, there is still much more room for Vietnamese firms to boost exports.\n“Canada, Mexico and Peru are countries that Việt Nam does not have free trade agreement with, thus CPTPP offers great opportunities for Vietnamese firms to access these markets through preferential tariffs.”\nBut to capitalise on the opportunities, the products must meet the CPTPP’s rules of origin and conform with sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements and technical barriers to trade (TBT), she said.\n“If we do not meet their requirements, we cannot utilise the preferential tariffs that CPTPP member countries offer to us.”\nJapan, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand\xa0and Chile are countries that Việt Nam has bilateral or multilateral FTAs with.\nThe CPTPP creates another preferential tariff scheme for businesses, who, depending on which FTA offers more advantages, should choose that to export under, she said.\nKhưu Thị Thanh Thủy, general secretary of the HCM City Textile and Garment - Embroidery Association, said Vietnamese garment and textile firms have faced difficulty in meeting the CPTPP’s rules of origin since their raw material imports from countries outside the CPTPP remain high.\nLocal and foreign firms are now investing in the underdeveloped textile, dyeing and fabric segments to increase the local content rate, she said.\nNguyễn Chánh Phương, deputy chairman of the Handicrafts and Wood Industry Association of HCM City, said:\xa0“Meeting the rules of origin is not a difficult task for the wood products sector.”\nBut the sector has not benefited much in terms of tariff duties from the CPTPP because import tariffs on Vietnamese furniture were already very low and even zero in many markets, he said.\n“Most companies in the timber industry make their products in the form of OEM (according to customers’ orders). Firms mainly wait for buyers to come. With the current good market situation, for example, a strong increase in exports to the US, firms may not find new opportunities.”\nHe said local firms should do market research to appropriately target exports, adding that businesses, especially large ones, need to have market research divisions to discover new opportunities brought by FTAs and changes from competitors.\nVõ Tân Thành, director of the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s HCM City branch, said: “Tariff commitments in the CPTPP come with relatively detailed and complex rules of origin, which not all businesses know how to comply with.\n“Therefore, understanding CPTPP commitments, the conditions required to take advantage of the opportunities, their impacts on market prospects and development trends in these sectors are important for Vietnamese enterprises to take advantage of the exciting opportunities arising from the CPTPP.”\nDomestic market\nWhile offering benefits in terms of creating export opportunities and improving incomes for millions of workers, the agreement also creates competitive pressure in the domestic market since Việt Nam has also to lower tariffs on imports from other member countries.\nTheoretically, CPTPP would bring intense competition in the domestic market, Trang told the media on the sidelines of the conference.\n“But our competitiveness in these sectors is relatively strong. In addition, at least seven partners in the CPTPP have FTAs with us and we have already opened the market wide to them. Therefore, there has been competition in these sectors after the CPTPP took effect, but it is not a big shock.\n“We are very successful in exporting\xa0these products and account for rather large market shares in many foreign markets.\n“But firms did not pay much attention to the domestic market. So I hope businesses pay attention to the domestic market since many foreign companies consider our market a delicious piece of cake.”\nCompeting at home would be easier for local firms and so they should tweak their strategy to focus more on the domestic market, she added. — VNS",2

Viet Nam Corporation.\nThe company instructed the farmers in the entire farming process, from building ponds and installing equipment to oxygenating the ponds, breeding density and feeding method.\nThe farmers bred white-legged shrimp on a total of 150ha of ponds and had a yield of 50 – 55 tonnes per hectare per crop. The model offered an income of VNĐ2 billion (US$86,200) per hectare per crop, 10 times the income from the industrial farming model.\nAccording to Phan Văn Hận, who now breeds white-legged shrimp on an area of 3,200sq.m under the model in Cầu Ngang District’s Mỹ Long Nam Commune, his farm has a density of 178 shrimp per square metre.\nThe model requires farmers to have a large breeding area and make a large initial investment in infrastructure of VNĐ3 billion ($130,000) per hectare.\nThe model requires ponds for breeding shrimp and treating wastewater, anti-sunlight nets to cover the ponds and plastic sheets to cover their beds and equipment for pumping oxygen and feeding the shrimp.\nTrịnh Thị Loan, an agricultural expert in Mỹ Long Nam, has bred white-legged shrimp on 1.5ha under the model for two years and earned a large income.\nThe model is sustainable since the ponds are covered with plastic sheets to prevent the spread of disease pathogens from soil, according to Loan.\nThe covering also helps farmers proactively control the quality of water used for raising the shrimp.\nThis year she expects to harvest around 100 tonnes of shrimp in two crops and earn VNĐ5 billion ($216,000).\nPhạm Minh Truyền, director of the province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the model had been expanded to nearly 400ha this year.\nIt would be a basis for the province to develop its shrimp industry and increase exports to high-demand markets like the US and EU, he said.\nThe province has identified shrimp, rice, vegetables, tra fish, and coconuts as its key agricultural produce.\nPotential\nBeing a coastal province, Trà Vinh has large potential for aquaculture with 95,000ha suitable for aquaculture, especially brackish-water and saltwater shrimp farming.\nThe province has 24,000ha of brackish water and saltwater ponds to farm shrimp, including 7,000ha under intensive and semi-intensive farming, and produces 35,000 tonnes annually.\nBut the average income from shrimp farming is only VNĐ100 – 150 million ($4,300 – 6,500) per hectare per year since most farms areas are small and do not use advanced techniques, according to the department.\nUnder a plan to restructure aquaculture in 2017 - 25, the province seeks to expand its shrimp farming area to 27,000ha and annual output to 87,000 tonnes next year.\nIt also plans to expand shrimp output by 5.3 per cent a year in 2021- 25.\nTo meet the targets, the province will expand its shrimp farming area and adopt advanced techniques to produce high-quality shrimp while also safeguarding the environment.\nĐồng Văn Lâm, chairman of the province People’s Committee, said both domestic consumption of and export demand for shrimp were high and steady, and so farmers would not need to worry about selling their produce.\nThe People’s Committee had instructed all relevant agencies to assist shrimp farmers in terms of infrastructure and farming processes, he said.\nThe Department of Agriculture and Rural Development should zone efficient shrimp farming areas and strictly monitor them to adequately support farmers, he said.\nThe province will prioritise implementation of 25 projects at a cost of VNĐ3 trillion ($130 million), including in infrastructure like irrigation, power and transport for breeding brackish and saltwater shrimp, according to the People’s Committee.\nIt will offer incentives to investors to produce and process shrimp. – VNS'",1

The number in rural areas is only 40-55 per cent, he said.\nIn many rural areas, dumps were located far from residential areas, and rubbish trucks found it difficult to reach remote mountainous areas, Thức said.\nAlthough burning waste in\xa0small incinerators has been warned against by MONRE, it is still common in many rural and mountainous areas.\nIn Văn Bàn District in\xa0northern mountainous province of Lào Cai, local residents spend their own money on incinerators to treat their daily waste.\nThere are more than 1,000 small incinerators\xa0in the district.

What needed\xa0to be put in place were facilities\xa0suitable for local conditions.\nWaste treatment budgets were\xa0allocated from provincial budgets. Many poor localities lacked the funds\xa0to invest in advanced technologies, he said.\nAt the workshop,\xa0MONRE deputy minister Võ Tuấn Nhân said Việt Nam should prioritise selecting domestic solid waste treatment technologies in relevance to each locality, for example, garbage sorting, organic fertiliser composting and\xa0incinerators.\nĐồng Phước An, deputy director of Hà Nội’s Construction Department, said the city would call for investment in waste-to-energy factories.

It also accounts for 14.1 per cent of the country’s total foreign investment. The city, however, is still not listed among global financial centres, experts said.\nExperts said the city should receive assistance from the government and should not be expected to shoulder the burden alone.

He also worked as a consultant for the State Department and US Agency for International Development in Rwanda\xa0and Afghanistan.\nYates' first novel was published before he was 30. He has written one novel for adults, and two for young adults. The latest one, How We Became Wicked, came out in July.\nThe American has\xa0won\xa0awards in both fiction and poetry, and his books have been published in more than six countries.\n“While all of the novels are very different from each other, they all deal with culture and identity,” he said.\n“The question of where I am determines who I am and informs all of my books. Family issues, particularly relationships between parents and children, are also central to my work.”\nA photo of a hummingbird\xa0in Costa Rica taken by Alexander Yates.\nSpecial connection to Việt Nam\nYates first came to Việt Nam in 2014 and\xa0soon realised that he had never experienced anything like the country.\n“I felt simultaneously very far from my own comfort zone, but also safe and welcomed. Particularly after my Vietnamese started to improve, I found it so rewarding to make relationships here.\n“Speaking Vietnamese and getting to know the city of Hà Nội and its people has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life,” he said.\nYates professes he has a deep love for Việt Nam and is a fan of how comfortable Vietnamese people are making one-on-one connections.\n“I also love the use of public space in Hà Nội. The fact that Hà Nội is not for me, not for tourists or people with money. Hà Nội is for Hanoians. I am welcomed, but I am not necessary. I adore that.\n“I also love the energy of Hà Nội, and of Việt Nam. There is such a sense of possibility here.”\nYates wants to do his best to adopt the local culture and lifestyle so he speaks Vietnamese every day\xa0in his office.\n“It was naturally difficult to learn, but Hanoians are so willing to engage and correct me,” said Yates.\n“In my early days learning Vietnamese, everyone I met was willing to become a teacher, and correct my word choice or pronunciation, I don’t feel ashamed at all.”\nBird-watching, more than a hobby\nYates' hobby of bird-watching has taken him all across the country and his photos of the avian delights are impressive, as is his passion.\n“Bird-watching is a passion of mine. Do not ask me about it at a party, because I become like an evangelist spreading the gospel,” he said.\nYates has been watching and photographing birds for about 13 years and says he has seen about one fourth\xa0of all the bird species in the world so far.\n“Some days I think I would like to go for the world record, but I doubt I will ever\xa0have the time and money to do all that travel, and also I am not sure I'm crazy enough. I'll settle for seeing half of the world's birds.”\nBird-watching is also a fantastic way to travel. For example, when he was bird-watching in shrimp farms in\xa0the northern province of Nam Định, looking for the endangered Black-Faced Spoonbill, he stopped for tea and spoke with many shrimp farmers.\n“One year, I spent Tết in a stilt house over a lake filled with crocodiles in Cát Tiên National Park (the southern province of Đồng Nai),” he said.\n“The forest rangers still had duty, but their families had brought them all food and beer to celebrate the holiday. So we celebrated together, in the woods, in the dark. It was a wonderful way to bring in the new year.”\nFor Yates, bird-watching is the ultimate meditation. He silently and patiently pays attention to the birds and photographs\xa0them.\n“I take photos as a way to help me identify the birds, I know that my photos can never truly express how beautiful birds are,” he said.\n“When I am in the woods, seeking a rare bird, my self disappears. I don't think at all about the troubles in my life, or stresses related to work. I focus completely on the sights and sounds coming in to me. My mind disappears, and I become nothing but a set of eyes watching, ears listening, and a beating heart, swelling.”\nWhile Yates is a pet-lover, he doesn't keep caged birds as he wants to let them roam free and find their own homes, as he has in Việt Nam. — VNS",5

4694,'Pancakes: East meets West',"'Frying pan: One of many ways to\xa0make\xa0apple pancakes. VNS Photos Đoàn Tùng\nby Nguyễn Mỹ Hà\nWhen the temperature starts to drop to 20 degrees Celsius, little\xa0sidewalk furnaces are fired up to cook winter snacks: pancakes with banana, sweet potatoes, and in recent years, sweet corn.\nThe recipe for pancakes could not be simpler with cheap ingredients used to create crispy, comforting and affordable snacks for the city\'s school children, struggling students and even successful adults longing for their more modest student past.\nWe had a chance to attend a cooking demonstration with Poland\'s Masterchef 2018 Ola Nguyễn recently at the most iconic cooking venue one can think of in the capital: Hà Nội Legend Metropole Hotel.\nShe was teaching how to cook apple crêpe, Polish style. ""This is very easy and the food we have is very warm, comforting and delicious,"" she said as she selected green apples and started to peel them.\nPoland is among the top ten apple exporters in the world, with the majority of the fruit heading to the Middle East. I had a chance to visit an apple farm\xa0a few years back near Warsaw\xa0and was amazed at how local orchards plant their apple trees and join co-operatives to store their produce for sale all year round.\nPicking up some wheat flour to make the batter, Ola said, in Vietnamese: ""When cooking Polish dishes, which I\'m going to demonstrate, you don\'t have to worry too much about the weights. Go by your feeling. Polish dishes are very heart-warming and\xa0comforting, I don\'t know why they have not become more popular around the world!\nFood Ambassador: Poland Masterchef 2018\xa0Ola Nguyễn shows how to make apple pancakes at a\xa0Gastronomy Week in Hà Nội.\n""In Poland, there are\xa0many types of apples. The best you can use are the small red apples, which are crispy and very\xa0flavourful,"" she said.\n""Outside of Poland, you can use Granny Smiths instead,"" Polish chef Mateusz Bujak added.\nThe recipes for making the batter are almost identical: a cup of wheat flour, a couple of eggs, two tablespoons of sugar,\xa0a pinch of salt and a cup of water or milk.\nThere\'re some differences between the Polish and Vietnamese methods of making the batter: If you want to make the mix smoother, add 20g of melted butter and half a teaspoon of baking soda. The baking soda releases bubbles in the mix and makes it fluffy and soft.\n""I don\'t know if you have vanilla sugar in Việt Nam,"" Ola said.\xa0""But it is very popular in Poland. Especially when you heat it up, the vanilla smells so good.""\nIn the Vietnamese version, it\'s rare to use butter or baking soda. The batter is thin, just barely enough to cover the sliced pieces of sweet potato, banana or sweetcorn.\nApple pancake, Polish style.\nThe Vietnamese pancakes should be golden crispy while the banana and potato should be soft.\nSo what makes the perfect apple pancake? A little crispy round the edges, of course, but the cooked dough should also be soft. The use of sour apples balances with the sweet batter.\nYou can serve the pancakes hot with powdered sugar, strawberry jam or vanilla ice cream, and it\'s perfect for dessert.\nThe Vietnamese sisters of apple pancakes are mostly sold on the street as snacks.\nBut the same batter can be used for a Hanoian delicacy, which is still the signature dish of the city\'s West Lake area: bánh tôm Hồ Tây, or Hồ Tây shrimp cakes.\nOriginally served at lake restaurants famous for this delicacy, shops in the Old Quarter also offer the dish now, but a true treat of shrimp cakes should be enjoyed contemplating the lake on an autumn afternoon.\nHà Nội\xa0delicacy: The best shrimp cakes come from West Lake neighbourhoods.\nSweet potatoes are julienned and mixed into the batter, and two fresh shrimp are placed on top before frying. The shrimp used to come from West Lake, but today it\'s illegal to fish in the lake, so the shrimp are sourced from other parts of Hà Nội. They must be small and cooked with the heads and shells intact.\nThe cakes should be served hot with sweet sour dipping sauce and fresh vegetables.\nI happened to have two little apples in my bag I’d bought from the market\xa0during the cooking show. Wanting to see the difference between the two types of apples, we peeled one and made a pancake with a Vietnamese apple.\nThe result was a more nuanced taste of sweet and sour in the Granny Smith pancakes. The Vietnamese apple pancakes mostly tasted sweet.\n""This apple is very good: small, hard and flavourful,"" said Bojak holding the apple I gave him. ""Not exactly like the Polish apples,"" added Ola, ""but you could use them to make cakes."" VNS'",5

The corporate bond market still posted growth of 4.2 per cent year-on-year.\nViệt Nam is one of emerging East Asia\xa0bond markets. Others comprise China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.\nADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada said the ongoing trade dispute between China and the US and a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown in advanced economies and China continue to pose the biggest downside risks to the region’s financial stability.\n“However, monetary policy easing in several advanced economies is helping to keep financial conditions stable,” Yasuyuki said.\nLocal currency bonds outstanding in emerging East Asia reached $15.2 trillion at the end of September, marking 3.1 per cent higher than at the end of June.\nLocal currency government bonds outstanding totaled $9.4 trillion, accounting for 61.8 per cent of the total, while the stock of corporate bonds was $5.8 trillion. A total of $1.5 trillion in local currency bonds were issued in the third quarter, up 0.9 per cent versus the previous three months.\nChina remained emerging East Asia’s largest bond market at $11.5 trillion, accounting for 75.4 per cent of emerging East Asia’s outstanding bonds. Indonesia had the fastest-growing local currency bond market in the region during the third quarter, boosted by large issuance of treasury bills and bonds.\nA special theme chapter examines the relationship between bond market development and the risk-taking behavior of banks. The analysis finds that well-developed bond markets reduce the overall risk of banks and improve their liquidity positions. This suggests bond market development can contribute to the soundness of the banking system. — VNS'",2

VNA/VNS Photo\n\n\nHÀ NÔI – Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc described new-style rural area building in Hà Nội as comprehensive and impressive while addressing a conference reviewing the 10-year efforts by the capital on Saturday.\nThe national target programme on building new-style rural areas, initiated by the Government in 2010, has 19 criteria in different aspects, aiming to boost the development of rural regions.\nAccording to Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Nguyễn Đức Chung, six outlying districts have met all the criteria and earned new-style rural area recognition, namely Đan Phượng, Đông Anh, Thanh Trì, Hoài Đức, Gia Lâm and Quốc Oai.\nA total 325, or 84.2 per cent of the city’s total 386 communes, have gained the status, surpassing the target of 80 per cent set for the end of 2020. Notably, Đan Phượng, Song Phượng and Liên Trung communes of Đan Phượng District have satisfied advanced criteria.\nOver the last 10 years, municipal authorities have involved thousands of collectives, individuals, businesses and households in contributing to the building of new-style rural areas with more than VNĐ14.74 trillion (US$633.7 million) raised. In particular, some local residents have made donations worth more than VNĐ7.2 trillion in total to the programme.\nHowever, Chung also admitted shortcomings, noting that Hà Nội hadn’t succeeded in attracting more investment into agricultural production, especially hi-tech farming and connectivity in production chains. There remained a gap in building new-style countryside among districts, while funding for the programme in the city was still mainly sourced from the State budget.\nAt the conference, PM Phúc applauded efforts by the city, where the new-style rural area building programme is carried out on the largest scale among all localities, with 17 outlying districts that consist of 386 communes covering more than 2,230 sq.km. and having a population of 4.1 million.\nRequirements for new-style rural areas were very high, in terms of both quantity and quality, he noted, stressing the ultimate goal of the programme would be to improve people\'s lives.\nLiving standards of rural residents in the city had improved considerably and were higher than the national average, the Government leader said.\nThe PM said Hà Nội’s rural areas should lead in applying the achievements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

2513,'Tame the sea with “Marine Dinosaur”',"'PV DRILLING V rig on Hải Thạch mine at night. Photos courtesy of PVN\nHÀ NỘI — When it comes to working on rigs, safety is paramount.\nAt\xa0the Hải Thạch - Mộc Tinh gas field workers must strictly follow safety rules and not make any mistakes. Everyone must work together to ensure smooth co-operation.\nAccording to Trần Hồng Nam, former general director of BIENDONG POC, reservoir pressure and the fracture pressure are two major causes of concern.\nHe says when drill through a high pressure area of the reservoir, the pressure inside the well must be higher than the reservoir pressure. If the pressure inside the well is lower than the outside pressure, the air will flow into the well and up to the top of the rig due to the pressure difference. If the pressure inside the well is higher than pressure of the reservoir, the layer of soil and rock beneath will break and drilling fluid will flow inside. Due to sudden loss of pressure inside the well, the drilling fluid will return to spray back into the well, making it even more dangerous.\nThe key thing is that the difference between the reservoir pressure and the fracture pressure is too small, only about 5-10 bar (about 5-10 atm). But under the vertical depth of more than 4,000m in Hải Thạch - Mộc Tinh, controlling such a small pressure index by the weight of drilling fluid is a big challenge for drillers.\nBut no matter how hard it is, the task still needs to be completed with no room for errors.\nThe problem was then solved by improving drilling fluids, controlling them meticulously and carefully.\nThe well’s heat will make the drilling fluid soar to temperatures of around 70-80oC, sometimes up to nearly 100oC as the water keeps evaporating.\nAlthough machines will handle the fluid for reusing or disposing purposes, during the drilling process, people come in close contact with it. It is not only hot but also contains chemicals that are toxic to human health when inhaled.\nWorkers discuss drilling techniques.\nVõ Văn Phúc, who has worked on the rig for many years, said the team is motivated by patriotism and the determination to assert Việt Nam\'s sovereignty.\nEveryone on board the platform wants to contribute to the construction of the sustainable marine project, which is a milestone to assert the sacred sovereignty of the homeland’s sea and islands.\nNow their wishes have come true. The East Sea 1 Project is a great success, with the PQP-HT central technology rig standing in the middle of the East Sea and being given the name “Marine Dinosaur”.\nIn 2010-11, Nguyễn Văn Thọ, project manager of the drilling project, said that during the initial drilling time, there were so many difficulties and small errors halted construction. But from the second year onwards, when everyone became familiar with PV DRILLING V\'s technology equipment and workflow, everything fell into place. Four consecutive years later, the PV DRILLING V rig’s safety was absolutely ensured with very high drilling efficiency, up to 95 per cent.\nAlthough before the construction of the new TAD rig, workers carefully calculated technical design with special geological conditions at the Hải Thạch – Mộc Tinh, they could not know what was happening under the sea.\nThere was an incident while they were drilling Mộc Tinh 2X Well, the deepest well where the temperature is much higher than other wells.\nThe cement did not set normally like the previous wells when it was pumped into the well, creating holes. The drillers turned to experts of the world\'s top companies, but could not solve the problem because no one had ever encountered anything similar. The Vietnamese drilling team had to do their own research and found a solution which was to use an additive called polymer mixed with cement to make sure it set.\nAnother problem was losing fluid while drilling, making it compulsory to improve drilling fluid quality.\nIn the past, BP used water-based drilling fluids and encountered problems. The lesson for BIENDONG POC and PV Drilling to study was the application of other drilling fluids, specifically synthetic oil.\nBut this solution required some environmental standards before the fluid is discharged into the sea. Therefore, the project management unit and the drilling fluid supplying unit must ask for approval from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to get a certificate.\nSince the fluid was replaced, it was not only suitable for mining conditions, which makes the drilling process much more convenient, but also helps the project save money as it is cheaper than the old fluid.\nThese are two of many typical technical innovations that Vietnamese engineers have studied and implemented to overcome difficulties while working on the project. Many of these innovations have contributed to the success of the East Sea 01 today. It demonstrates the internal strength, intelligence and bravery of Vietnamese petroleum workers.\nTalking about conditions that make PV DRILLING V and drilling campaign of the East Sea 01 successful, Thọ said: “It was made by the Vietnamese.”\nIt was the determination, internal power of Vietnamese people.\nThọ added: “We, including the BIENDONG POC constructors, have made our own discoveries, and mapped out requirements to upgrade the equipment to suit the harsh drilling conditions. All are calculated and studied by Vietnamese people.\n“If we did not learn by ourselves, did not make technical requirements, the rig constructors would not have known what to do. It is not difficult to build a TAD rig, but to build a rig like PV DRILLING V, we had to design it.\nA new generation of drilling experts and engineers who are brave and experienced to meet high technical and scientific requirements of PV Drilling and Vietnamese petroleum sector has been trained during five years of drilling East Sea Project 01. In the near future, the team will conduct drilling for other projects, which are just as difficult and complex as Hải Thạch – Mộc Tinh.\nWhen the old oil and gas fields near the shore were exploited for many years and the output declined, PVN was forced to explore and exploit new fields located in farther and deeper waters with more severe conditions.\nThat was also the time when the drilling team of PV Drilling or PVD Deepwater in particular had the opportunity to promote their internal strength and bravery. It represents PV Drilling’s development strategy: ""Drilling deeper - Reaching farther"". — VNS\nStaff working on the platform all want to contribute to asserting the sovereignty of the sea and islands of Việt Nam.'",2

He said it was necessary to increase supply and stop speculation and profiteering in real estate trading.\nDeputy Nguyễn Văn Dành from Bình Dương Province was concerned about the same problem, asking for detailed measures to address the matter of limited supply of housing for low-income people (or social housing).\nMinister Hà said many localities had not paid enough attention to this issue and had not allocated a sufficient land fund and supporting loan interest rates for needy people.\nCurrently, housing for low-income people is only 4.8 million square metres, while the target set for 2020 is 12.5 square metres.\nHà said in many countries, the Government would provide social housing and financial support to people with low income. However, in Việt Nam, the profit rate of enterprises investing in housing for low-income people, which is set at 10 per cent, did not encourage them to pour money into such projects.\nThe construction ministry would consult the Government on this matter to work out more supporting policies that can attract enterprises to invest in social housing, he said.\nDelegate Lý Tiết Hạnh from Bình Định Province said that there were currently no legal regulations governing investment, construction and certification for tourist apartments (condotel). She asked when legal regulations for such type of real estate would be available.\nMinister Hà said standards and regulations on management and operation of new real estate types like condotel, officetel would be issued in 2019. At the same time, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment would provide guidance on the land use mechanism for works combining condotel and private houses.\nDeputy Nguyễn Kim Thuý from Đà Nẵng was concerned about the quality of urban planning, saying that supervision and examination were lacking and that resulted in “super-skinny” houses allowed to be built in many cities.\nMinister Hà blamed the fact on the capacity to forecast urban development situation, population growth.\nOutdated construction standards system and construction techniques, inaccurate planning calculation were also the reasons for problems arising during the urban planning process, he said.\nWhat could be done, he said, was to strictly supervise projects that had been approved according to the planning, to provide planning to the public transparently and enhance examination and inspection with construction work.

He broke his own record from the previous year (14:45:44) and became the first runner to win two consecutive VMM 100km races.\nBesides the joy of being called to the national team, Hùng is very happy he is one of two Vietnamese runners qualified for the\xa0Boston Marathon 2020 in the US,\xa0the world’s oldest annual marathon and one of the world’s best-known road racing events, in the men’s age group of 35- 39.\nHùng will represent Việt Nam at the November 30-December 11 SEA Games alongside athletes Cao Ngọc Hà and Nguyễn Thị Phương Trinh in duathlon.\nThe athletes will take part in a 10km run, then 40km bike ride and finish with a 5km run.\xa0Hùng has borrowed his friend's\xa0bike to train.\n“Every week, I came to Tuần Châu in Hạ Long City, Quảng Ninh Province three times to train. I have a friend here. He lent me his bike. In Tuần Châu, it's easier to train\xa0than in Hà Nội as it isn’t too crowded,” said Hùng.\nTo prepare for the Games, Hùng and his teammates tested their skills in the Clark Duathlon Championships\xa0in the Philippines on October 13 in which Hùng finished ninth out of more than 400 athletes.\nBesides the Clark event, Hùng said he used domestic events to prepare for the Games and his goal\xa0of earning a historic medal for Việt Nam.\n“I will take the VPBank Hà Nội Marathon 2019 on October 20 as my last test for the regional event. I was the first runner-up in the 42km in the last year’s VPBank Hà Nội Marathon. However, because of the target of SEA Games this year, I will only compete in the shorter distance. My goal in the Philippines is to take a medal. Any medal is noble,” said Hùng.\n“Athletes of the hosts and Singapore are professional. They train\xa0abroad regularly. They are not only strong in the region but also in Asia. However, if I train well, I believe I can get a medal,” said Hùng.\nAccording to Hùng, an amateur runner like him being called to the national team is encouragement for other amateurs.\n“Everybody often sees possible and impossible things. For me, I thought I didn’t have a chance to be part of the national team. I think that my story can inspire\xa0many people,” said Hùng.\nHùng works for a company in Phú Thọ Province, producing fireworks. He handles a lot of\xa0chemical substances, so the work can be\xa0dangerous.\n“I am lucky enough to play sport regularly so it helps me get rid of the toxins from my body. I work from 6am to 1pm so I have time for my hobby,” said Hùng.\nNguyễn Tiến Hùng (left) seen in a recent marathon in Việt Nam.

For example, the number of Vietnamese entrants to the\xa0Ironman 70.3 Đà Nẵng\xa0has increased 20 times in the last five recent years.\n“With the above active development, the National Sports Administration asked the Việt Nam Athletics Federation to inspect\xa0and evaluate to establish the duathlon and triathlon team to take part in the SEA Games. The best athletes were selected through domestic and international events. The whole expenses for these teams will be sponsored by individuals and non-State companies,” said Phấn.\n“This is a basis for Việt Nam\xa0as hosts of the SEA Games 31 in 2021\xa0to put these two sports into the competition programme,” Phấn added.\nThe triathlon team has five players including\xa0Lâm Quang Nhật, Lê Hoàng Vũ, Phạm Thuý Vi.\n“Vietnamese triathlon and duathlon athletes are highly qualified persons who are working in Việt Nam and abroad. Some of them are managers of big enterprises. Being members of the national team is a proud for themselves and for their companies. This is a wonderful chance for triathlon and duathlon movement to develop strongly in Việt Nam,” said Phấn.\nNgọc Hà, 37, is a director of a company\xa0in Hà Nội. He is a leading marathon runner in Việt Nam and was the runner-up in the Việt Nam Mountain Marathon 2017 in 100km.\nWhile Vũ also has an important position for a foreign fund management company in HCM City.

The database is built with the participation of 122 credit organisations and foreign banks’ branches, nearly 1,200 people’s credit funds and four official micro-financial organisations.\nIn the same move, another agency of the SBV – the National Payment Corporation of Việt Nam (NAPAS) – also announced a reduction for its local switching system service fees. The system is\xa0interconnected by more than 170,000 ATMs nationwide, starting from October 1 this year.\nSpecifically, it has reduced 24/7 interbank money transfer service fee for banks by 13 per cent. ATM withdrawal service fees have been also cut by 70 per cent for banks that issue the ATMs and 100 per cent for banks that conduct the payment.\nNAPAS has also provided free internal transfer service and non-financial transactions such as information inquiry and statement printing for banks.\nIn addition, the agency has also continually implemented a promotion programme to reduce 50 per cent of its service fees for transactions at ATMs and 24/7 interbank transfer transactions from October 3, 2019 to December 31, 2019 for banks.\nOn September 16, the SBV decided to make the first interest rate cut since October 2017, which helped credit institutions access more affordable capital from the SBV, enabling them to improve liquidity and keep market interest rates stable.\nAccordingly, the annual refinancing rate and rediscount rate has been lowered from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent, and from 4.25 per cent to 4 per cent, respectively\nThe annual overnight electronic interbank rate and rate of loans to offset capital shortage in clearance between the central bank and domestic banks have been also cut to 7 per cent. — VNS'",2

3580,'Changing behaviour towards nature to keep biodiversity',"Professor Trương Quang Học. Photo vnu.edu.vn\nProfessor Trương Quang Học from Việt Nam National University’s Centre for Natural Resources and Environment Studies spoke with Nhân Dân Cuối Tuần (the People Weekend Edition) newspaper about the impacts that Việt Nam will possibly have in case of biodiversity decline and the importance of changing behaviour towards nature.\nHow do you assess the global decline in biodiversity?\nAs far as I've remember, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon emphasised the importance of giving priority to considering biodiversity issues when making decisions in all sectors. Biodiversity must be the basis for establishing other goals, not an idea that comes up after other goals have been set up.\nI think we need a new vision of biodiversity conservation to maintain a healthy planet and a sustainable future for humanity.\nIn 1993, the United Nations chose May 22 as an international day for biodiversity to raise public awareness on this issue. Biodiversity since then has been considered an essential source of providing ecological services and a source of human life.\nIn recent decades, the concept of non-traditional security has emerged, including the issue of biodiversity decline - a depleted ecological environment. If the ecosystem is like a car, then every animal and plant species act as a part of that car. Lack of any species can threaten the safety when the vehicle operates.\nSo, the relationship between humans and other plant species must be a symbiotic relationship in order to sustain life and maintain the sustainable development. For a long time, people have underestimated the role of biodiversity. It’s high time the world has to look back and put this issue in parallel with the importance of climate change.\nViệt Nam is considered one of the Southeast Asian countries rich in biodiversity and ranked 16th with the greatest biodiversity in the world. Could you tell us about the biodiversity fluctuations in recent years?\nEcosystems and biological resources play an important role in the country's economy and culture. Biotechnology contributes greatly to the national economy, which ensures food security, maintaining genetic resources of animals and plants, providing construction materials and sources of fuel and pharmaceuticals.\nPopulation growth and consumption pressures have resulted in overexploitation of biological resources. The rapid socio-economic development has changed the natural landscape. Changes of land use practices and construction of many infrastructures have reduced the area of natural habitats, fragmented ecosystems, and reduced the habitat of many wildlife species. The construction of many dams has blocked the migration routes of many fish species.\nThe rapid increase in forestation is a good sign, but it should be noted that half of the increase in forest area is planted and restored forests, so the value of biodiversity is not high. Meanwhile, the natural forest continues to be destroyed.\nForest fires, deforestation, and forest land use conversion are three elements that reduced the biodiversity. Natural forests are increasingly being destroyed. The data shows 156 forest fires have occurred in the first six months of this year, and nearly 38,300 hectares of forest has been converted for use in the period of 2012-17.\nNoticeably, 89 per cent of natural forest area was damaged during the forest land use conversion process and 11 per cent was illegally chopped down. All of the areas of the national parks and conservation parks in the country occupied only 7.5 per cent of total mainland.\nDo you think that the sense of excessive material enjoyment is among the causes of the biodiversity decline?\nI want to talk about Bhutan. It is a small country and it is not a developed one, but people are still happy and enjoy life because they know how to live with nature. They have the awareness that people should be part of the nature.\nCould you share the scenario of biodiversity loss in the future?\nAt a recent international conference on non-traditional security issues, I mentioned the scenario of biodiversity loss. Over the past 300 years, the forest on earth has decreased by 40 per cent.\nRainforests account for only 7 per cent of the area but own 70 per cent of the global biodiversity value. However, the forests have\xa0lost 80 per cent of their\xa0total area and continue\xa0to lose 0.7 per cent annually.\nPeople have used up to three quaters\xa0of the earth's resources. When the life-support system is degraded and depleted, how can people survive?\nIt will be extremely difficult to recover what we have lost. Many scientists have warned that humans will only survive until the end of this century. It might sound awful, but it would be true if people don’t change their behaviour and attitudes towards the nature. — VNS",4

The US-funded project, presented yesterday in Hà Nội, aimed to identify energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions of buildings in Việt Nam with a view to reducing emissions in the future, said Vũ Thị Kim Thoa of the USAID Việt Nam Clean Energy Programme.\nThoa said five demonstration projects stimulating buildings’ energy usage in Hà Nội and HCM were also completed, and the buidings were upgraded. The projects consulted the buildings’ designers on using materials and new technologies to save from 22 per cent to 44.5 per cent of energy for the five buildings each year, equalling annual savings of US$170,563, she said. Emissions of over 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide would be reduced each year in the five buildings, she said.\nThe buildings included the Hà Nội Energy Manager Training Centre, the State Securities Commission of Việt Nam, Việt Nam National Construction Consultants Corporation, the Trúc Bạch Building Complex and HCM City’s Capital Place.\nAdditionally, 2,955 Vietnamese professionals and building owners, 26 per cent of them women, participated in training courses of design, construction and operating green buildings for energy efficiency, she said.\nThe programme also promoted the use of energy-efficient building materials in the construction sector in order to reduce energy consumption throughout the buildings’ life cycle, she said.\nLương Đức Long, president of the Việt Nam Institute for Building Materials, said the programme would serve as a foundation to compile a plan for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in manufacturing building materials that had large emission levels. For example, the plan scheduled a reduction of 4.37 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in producing cement and sanitary ware by 2020, he said.\nAssessments\nĐỗ Bình Yên, former deputy director of the Institute of Engery Science, said the data samples collected this time had been considerably larger and more reliable than before.

From there she went from strength to strength and records tumbled, becoming an under-12 national champion at 10-years-old, the youngest US Open girls’ finalist in 2017 and the world’s top junior player.\nNone of this was a surprise to Black, who worked with her for about five years and predicted she would be the world’s best by the age of 17.\n“She was always five years ahead of her age,” he said, noting that the same determination he saw in her as a child helped her rally from the brink of defeat against a seasoned pro like Polona Hercog.\n“She wins matches she shouldn’t win,” he said, adding that “she finds a way.”\nSky’s the limit\nFormer Wimbledon champion and pundit John McEnroe has said he fears Gauff’s success is “too much too soon”, but Black has no such concerns.\nHe explained that attention and column inches are part of professional tennis, and Gauff’s support system will keep her grounded.\n“If anyone can keep up with the pressure it is Cori,” he said.\nAs for her chances of lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish at Wimbledon, Black, who plans to open a training centre in the beach town of Hua Hin in Thailand in the near future, has a hard time seeing anyone stopping Coco.\n“I wouldn’t bet against her.” — VNS'",3

Korean artists tend to choose light colours because they want to avoid the colour becoming\xa0the centre of the whole work.”\nTrịnh Minh Tiến is the youngest among Vietnamese artists at the age of 36. His paintings at the exhibition include paint-on metal Cathedral in The Rain and Old Monastery and acrylic Inside.\nInside was\xa0made this year, inspired by the 1,000-hand Bodhisattva Kwan Yin statue.\n“It’s great to show paintings with many other veteran artists of Korea and Việt Nam,” Tiến said. “I’m proud to represent Vietnamese artists at this exhibition.”\nTiến won awards the second prize at the Young Eye contest held by Việt Nam Fine Arts Association in 2005 and French embassy and the excellent artist at a Work Room Four event in 2003.\nThe exhibition is held by Korean Cultural Centre with support from the\xa0Korea Culture and Information Service,\xa0Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and Korean embassy to Việt Nam.\nThe exhibition runs until December 14 at 66 Nguyễn Thái Học Street. — VNS\nAcrylic painting Inside by Trịnh Minh Tiến. — VNS Photos Nguyễn Bình'",5

After light rain, the road was quite muddy.\nClutching the throttle, she skillfully guided her motorbike through the quagmire.\nIt is quite rare for\xa0a 27-year-old H’mông ethnic minority woman like Xinh to operate a vehicle on her own as tradition dictates that they rely on their husbands\xa0after marriage.\nFreedom of mobility was the first thing Xinh enjoyed after purchasing a motorbike, using money from the local village savings and loan association (VSLA).\nIt takes\xa0Xinh half an hour to ride from her tiny house on the legendary Pha Đin Pass down to a nearby valley, where 18 other members of the VSLA group gather for a\xa0fortnightly meeting.\nThe group, which was established in September\xa02018 under the umbrella “Reach to Excel” project implemented by NGO Care International in Việt Nam, Điện Biên Province Women’s Union and the Điện Biên Centre for Community Development, offers a savings incentive for\xa0members to\xa0pool their money by buying shares and then loaning to each other.\nIn single a session, one member can purchase up to five shares for\xa0VNĐ20,000 (US$0.86) each. The limitation has been\xa0set to avoid speculation, while maintaining the group’s sustainability.\n“Please give me five,” said Xinh confidently, as her family had just harvested their rice crop.\nReceiving the VNĐ100,000 ($4.31), Giàng Thị Mai, one of the group's treasurer, used a small stamp carved from an eraser to ink Xinh’s savings book.\nMai is one of three treasurers who\xa0each hold\xa0a separate\xa0key to the group’s safe – a simple way to ensure transparency.\nAt the beginning of a meeting, they open the safe and count the money together.\nBesides buying shares, each member contributes VNĐ2,000 ($0.086) to a mutual assistance fund which is\xa0used to support sick\xa0members who need\xa0hospital treatment.\n“We are\xa0all healthy so far, so we may spend the fund on\xa0a\xa0year-end party,” said Mai, cheerfully.\nGiàng Thị Mai stamps a member’s savings book, marking\xa0the number of share the book's owner\xa0has bought. —\xa0VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nSaving tool\nIn the mountainous commune of Tỏa\xa0Tình, 98 per cent of the population belong to the\xa0H’mông ethnic minority group,\xa0who live scattered\xa0among the\xa0rocky mountains relying on\xa0agriculture for their\xa0livelihoods.\nThe harsh conditions have pushed them below\xa0the poverty line, with average income per capita per year of\xa0just VNĐ8 million ($345).\nCompared\xa0to other ethnic minority groups living at lower altitudes, H’mông people have less\xa0demand for money.\nHowever, the\xa0impacts of climate change has hit\xa0productivity of traditional upland rice and maize plantations, forcing them to excessively cut spending and save even more.\nThe VSLA was formed to address their needs, while at the same time, creating\xa0a space for local women to share their common concerns over children, health and other family affairs.\n“Since we live far from each other, it is fun when we get the chance\xa0to gather and talk,” said\xa0Giàng Thị Mai.\n“We can also borrow money to pay for our children’s school fees, farming utensils and healthcare,” she added.\nSince the group’s establishment, eight members have been given loans of VNĐ500,000-10 million ($21.55-431).\nDespite the small amounts, the fund\xa0has\xa0empowered them to overcome difficult situations.\nSùng Thị Ly borrowed VNĐ2.5 million ($108) to pay for her children’s stationery.\n“The middle school\xa0tuition fees are\xa0just VNĐ9,000 ($0.39) per month, but we simply cannot afford notebooks, pens and other essentials,” she said.\nLy paid it off after several months.\n“The procedure is simple and transparent. We do not need to sign any contracts, and we do not need to commit to any deadline because everyone in the group knows we will\xa0work hard to\xa0repay the loans as soon as possible,” said Ly.\nAmong her fellows, Hoàng Thị Manh seems to be the most enterprise-driven.\nWith a VNĐ10 million loan from the group, she started her own traditional attire business.\n“I borrowed money from my sisters and relatives as well,” Manh said.\nThe small experiment proved\xa0profitable enough for her to expand.\n“Nervous? Yes! It was the first time I'd\xa0decided to do “something big” without my husband’s involvement,” she added.\n“However, he was very supportive, seeing how much I had changed after joining the group.”\nThanks to the financial solution, loan sharks have no place in the area.\nAccording to project manager Lê Xuân Hiếu, VSLA provides more than an economic leverage, it is a tool to accelerate social cohesion.\n“The\xa0loans offered by VSLA are\xa0small, under VNĐ10 million, but enough\xa0to address the daily demands which no finance organisation can satisfy,” said Hiếu.\n“Members can take out a loan and repay it at any time without being screened or punished for late payment. It is a flexible mechanism in which women can practise their rights,” he said.\n“Empowering individual female members is the ultimate goal of VSLA. Once they know and perform their own rights, they will be able to access\xa0business opportunities, secure their livelihoods and build happy families,” he added.\nSocial concerns\nEvery night, some 120 coaches depart from Tuần Giáo District to transport local people down south on the hunt for work.\nAfter the upland rice harvest season, there is nothing much to do in the\xa0northern highlands. And as Tết (Vietnamese Lunar New Year) is approaching, they need to earn money to prepare for the holiday.\nAccording to Vừa Đào My, deputy head of Điện Biên Province's Women’s Union, the province used to have 50 VSLA groups with 1020 members.\nThe numbers now has dropped to 43 groups with 937 members.\n“It is not because the incentive is inefficient, it's the financial demands that force them to leave,” she said.\n“On the bright side, I can see local women becoming more independent and making\xa0decisions. They can choose to follow their husbands to big cities as they look for work rather than\xa0staying at home waiting,” My added.\nSharing the opinion, Hiếu said it was difficult to hold back a person when they want a\xa0better income.\n“Migration is good for the economy but\xa0I wonder whether anyone has raised the\xa0question about its impacts on social affairs and cultural identity,” he said.\n“I have not seen any reports about\xa0divorce rates among couples who had\xa0to separate due to difficult economic conditions. Migration has to be viewed as\xa0a bigger picture rather than focusing solely on income,” Hiếu added.\nCare International has put an\xa0expansion plan for the\xa0VSLA on the table to discuss with the Việt Nam Women’s Union.\nIf approved, the model will be implemented in other provinces from January 2020 along with training courses for trainers and developing documentation procedures.\n“Localities will then be able to allocate resources to duplicate the model, which acts as an efficient micro-finance solution, helping people improve their lives\xa0in their hometowns,” Hiếu said. —\xa0VNS",1

Labour productivity will be improved with an annual growth rate of about 6.3 per cent.\nThe information was released during a seminar held in Hà Nội on Thursday, themed “Việt Nam economy perspective for 2021-25:\xa0opportunities and challenges from new generation free trade agreements”.\nIt was organised by the National Centre for Socio-Economic Information and Forecast (NCIF) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment.\nAccording to NCIF’s Director Trần Thị Hồng Minh, the signing and implementation of new generation free trade agreements, especially the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Việt Nam-EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) would put a profound and wide impact on Việt Nam's economy in the period of 2021-25.\n“Both CPTPP and EVFTA have wider range of commitment compared to other trade pacts, as they cover import and export terms while setting production methods for goods exchanges,” Minh said.\n“They have positive influence on economic growth, especially in markets of the signatories.”\nEVFTA and CPTPP, respectively, can boost Việt Nam's GDP up by 4.3 per cent and 1.3 per cent by 2030, Minh said, adding that Việt Nam's export turnover to the EU by 2030 is expected to surge 44.4 per cent while that to CPTPP member countries will rise by 14.3 per cent by 2035 .\n“The trade deals will exert influence on the Vietnamese economy in mid-and long-terms as they put pressure on the Government to improve institutions and business climate,”\xa0she said.\nIn another scenario, Việt Nam’s GDP could expand 7.5 per cent if the country can take advantage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, improve quality of investment and well develop the modern economy, Minh said.\n\nMeanwhile, Trần Toàn Thắng, an official from the NCIF, said the EVFTA and CPTPP’s commitments were higher than WTO in terms of investment openness, investment protection and dispute settlement, and they helped Việt Nam promote exports\xa0as well as improve supply chains.\n\nAlthough Việt Nam could improve its competitive capacity in terms of market scale and labour productivity, it could take time for the country to better infrastructure and promote\xa0innovation and technology readiness, Thắng said.\n\nThe country should work more to renew its growth model, accelerate key drivers of economic growth, and make good use of opportunities from global integration, science-technology development and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Thắng said.\nDigital transformation\nAlso on Thursday, the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) co-operated with Alibaba Group and OSB Investment and Technology JSC to hold the seminar “Việt Nam exports on the eve of the EVFTA and digital transformation trends”.\nVCCI Deputy Chairman Đoàn Duy Khương said EVFTA created motivation for the development of Việt Nam’s economy\xa0in general and exporting enterprises in particular.\nAfter the trade deal takes effect, the EU will eliminate about 85.6 per cent of import tariffs on Vietnamese goods, equivalent to 70.3 per cent of Việt Nam’s revenue from exports to the EU.\nThe trend of switching from traditional businesses to digital platforms was becoming increasingly popular and was considered a useful solution to help businesses expand export markets, in the context of Việt Nam’s deeper integration into the global economy, Khương said.\nThe seminar provided attendees with useful information about EVFTA, digital transformation trends as well as the importance of e-commerce application in seeking commodity sources for global importers.\nIt also provides effective marketing and promotion methods on e-commerce site Alibaba.com.\nBernard Dewamme from Belgium-based Mentally Fit Global Group shared useful information to help Vietnamese exporters enhance their leadership capacity, improving the competitiveness of Vietnamese businesses. — VNS",2

So I think, when the two styles get together, with Ringo's drumming, and George Harrison's guitar solos, it all comes together to create immortal hits.”\nTrịnh Linh Chi, 33, of The Beatles Việt Nam – Official Fan Club added: “In my fan club there are many people from previous generations who are in their 40s and 50s and youngsters who are born after 2000.\n“Anyone can find something they can relate to in The Beatles' music, and whenever having a certain emotion, mood or story, everyone can certainly find parts of themselves in The Beatles' musical treasures because this band has so many amazing songs.\n“The Beatles’ music, I think, is very suitable for the tastes of many ages;\xa0the more you hear, the better it gets. So I am very happy because until now, The Beatles music in Việt Nam has still been loved by many people and especially by those who are very young.”\nLast week the songs were sung with even more passion and effort than normal as auditions were held to create a Vietnamese tribute band.\nThey need Johns, Pauls, Georges and of course, Ringos. And there was no shortage of takers packed into the tiny venue ready to try out.\nClassic songs were belted out with gusto. Michelle, Ticket to Ride and\xa0Hey Jude to name just a few.\nHoang Nguyet Cam may only be 18 years old, but she’s already a dab hand on the piano playing Beatles songs.\nCam said: “I’ve been a fan of The Beatles for a long time, since I was in the seventh or eighth grade.\n“Back then there was a friend of mine who used to play and share Beatles songs.\xa0I clicked on those songs and the first song I listened to was And I love her and since then I started to like this band.\n“Among The Beatles albums, I like Rubber Soul the most, and I performed two songs from that album on the piano.”\nThe idea is to bring together Việt Nam’s very own Fab Four to play a small number of gigs in the coming months.\nAnd there’s little doubt the fan base exists to ensure a warm welcome whenever they appear on stage.\n“I have been one of the core members of the club since the first performances,” Chi added.\n“Currently, I’m one of the main singers of the band. The Beatles Việt Nam – Official Fan Club has been in operation since the end of 2015, up to now it has been nearly four years.\n“The number of our members is also the number of fans on our Facebook page.

Hà Nội could also ban motorbikes by expanding pedestrian areas.\\\nIn other areas, motorbikes could only be restricted from 6am to 10pm and replaced by public transport.\n“To achieve this goal, by 2030, Hà Nội needs eight urban metro routes, 200 bus routes, 35,000 cabs, more than 50,000 contract cars, 20 mini bus routes and some 10,000 public bicycles,” said Tuấn.\nVũ Thị Vinh, former secretary of Việt Nam Association of Cities, cited China’s Guangzhou as an example of gradual motorbike banning to avoid disputes.\n“In 16 years, city authorities raised awareness of people about the policy, restricted new motorbike registration, banned motorbikes on some streets, stopped out-of-town motorbikes from entering the city and eventually completely prohibited all motorbikes and destroyed old ones,” said Vinh.\nSince Hà Nội’s most severe traffic hotspot is in the western area, Vinh recommended first implementing the ban on Nguyễn Trãi, Tố Hữu and Lê Văn Lương streets.\nVũ Văn Viện, Hà Nội Department of Transport, highly appreciated these opinions.\n“The public transport system needs improving to serve 80 per cent of the city’s population by 2030 with a transit station 500m away from a residential area,” he said. — VNS'",1

After two months of construction, the road was put into operation early 2019.\nHải, 54, was the first person who called local residents to donate land to the widen alleys. He said the old alley of Mộc Hoàn Đình Hamlet was built in 1990.\n“The alley was so narrow that if a car entered\xa0in the alley, vehicles had to move back to give way. The most extreme was on the rainy days and when the road was flooded, travel for local residents was very difficult,” he said.\n“The smell of sewage stagnated in the grooves on both sides of the alley, forcing people to cover their nose when walking across.”\nHải donated about 8.5sq.m in front of the house he bought in 2010 where one square metre\xa0of land can cost VNĐ25 million (US$110).

These drilling rigs have operated safely and sustainably, bringing in high efficiency for Vietsovpetro.\nThe successful manufacture of the drilling rigs Tam Đảo 03 and 05 has helped position Việt Nam as one of\xa0 the very few countries in the world that successfully made modern and international standard drilling rigs.\nThis is the first mechanical product manufactured in Việt Nam applying high technology with a localisation rate of 35 per cent.\nIt also affirmed the trademark of the petroleum sector’s mechanical manufacturing services when its products can replace imported deep water drilling platforms.\nThe petroleum engineering industry has also developed to be able to meet demands for oil rig manufacture and installation of foreign petroleum companies.\nIn 2014, the PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation (PTSC) announced the load-out and delivery of the Heera Redevelopment (HRD) Process Platform in southern Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province’s Vũng Tàu City after 17 months of manufacturing. The platform was highly appreciated by its investor, India's state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), partners, contractors and supervisors.\nThis is the first and biggest HRD Process Platform manufactured by a Vietnamese company for a foreign client via international bidding.\nThese achievements proved that petroleum engineering companies have gradually approached, implemented and mastered the technology of manufacturing and building petroleum projects which require high accuracy, skills, quality and safety standards.\nThe success construction of the Biển Đông 01 project, for example, can be considered a miracle of Việt Nam’s petroleum sector, which proves the potential of the petroleum engineering industry. It is considered the most complicated project of the petroleum sector in all aspects: progress, technology and scale.\nThe project was developed by the group to exploit two gas and condensate fields – Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh with duration expected to be 25 years and a capacity of 8.5 million cubic metres of natural gas per day.\nAll the process, from designing, equipment and material purchasing and manufacturing, was implemented within 30 months. This is a record that not so many contractors in the world could do, according to the PVN. The project proved skills and knowledge of Vietnamese experts, engineers and workers in the petroleum industry.\nIn the new context, the PVN will strive to continue successfully manufacturing more modern petroleum mechanical projects with support from the State and Government and concerted efforts of its staff in spite of challenges ahead.\nAt a recent conference on measures to boost the development of the mechanical industry of Việt Nam, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc said that the Government would build a market for mechanical businesses to develop, including creating conditions for businesses to supply their products at domestic market and seek opportunities to expand export markets for petroleum mechanical products of Việt Nam. — VNS",2

2493,Moody's review of Vietnam's Ba3 rating improper: Finance Ministry,"The headquarters of the Vietnamese Ministry of Finance. — Photo MoF\nHÀ NỘI — The Vietnamese Ministry of Finance (MoF) on Thursday said Moody's Investors Service’s decision to place Việt Nam’s Ba3 rating under review for downgrade due to delayed payments on an obligation of the Vietnamese Government was improper as the Government has never delayed meeting debt repayment obligations.\nMoody's Investors Service on Wednesday placed the Ba3 local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings of the Vietnamese Government under review for downgrade, saying the decision was driven by institutional deficiencies that have come to light.\nIn particular, Moody's became aware of delayed payments on an obligation by the Government.\nWhile the information available so far points to no or minimal losses for creditors, the coordination gaps within the administration that the delayed payments may reflect, point to creditworthiness that may no longer be consistent with a Ba3 rating, the rating agency said.\nHowever, the MoF said that Moody’s decision was inappropriate as it was based on just a single incident, noting that Moody's needed to clearly classify provisional and direct payments of Government obligations.\nThe MoF explained the delayed payments, which Moody’s mentioned, was guaranteed by the Government, meaning it was a provisional obligation, not a direct one.\n“The Vietnamese Government has fulfilled the responsibility of the guarantor in the payment obligation, even when it has yet received formal requests from creditors. The Government has never delayed in meeting its payment obligations,” the MoF stressed.\nIt said the Moody's decision, which was just based on a single incident, without taking into account the Vietnamese Government’s efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability, is not really convinced.\nEspecially, the ministry noted, that Moody’s issued a press release while being unclear of processes and mechanisms of Government-guaranteed payment obligations could lead to misunderstanding by international investors about the Vietnamese Government’s ability to repay its debts and may cause negative impacts on its credibility and prestige in the international arena.\nMoF expected that Moody's would soon have scrutiny on the issue, saying it was willing to discuss, work and provide information to Moody's as well as other credit rating agencies to ensure the agencies have adequate and accurate information to clarify the issue.\nMoody's expects to complete the review within three months. During the review period, Moody’s will assess the practices and systems the government has or is instituting, to ensure reliable, timely, and smooth payment of all obligations.\nAccording to Moody’s, the key driver behind its decision to place Việt Nam's rating under review for downgrade is institutional weaknesses, as revealed by delayed payments on an obligation by the government.\nThese weaknesses seem to reflect deficient coordination and planning among various arms of the government, with a degree of opacity around the decisions and actions needed to meet some of the government's obligations; and complex bureaucratic processes that can obstruct the smooth and timely payment of Government obligations.\nWhile Việt Nam's large foreign exchange reserves and modest government financing requirements denote ample capacity to meet debt obligations, the review period will allow Moody's to ascertain if the revealed institutional weaknesses raise the risk of future delayed or missed payments that could denote weaker willingness to pay than Moody's has previously assessed.\nDuring the review period, Moody's will aim to clarify the nature and likely effectiveness of the measures and processes that the government has put or is putting in place to ensure full and timely payment of all obligations.\nIndependent of the outcome of the rating review, Việt Nam's credit profile will remain underpinned by strong growth potential.\nAbsent significant economic or contingent liability shocks, Moody's expects the government's debt burden to remain broadly stable, just under 50 per cent of GDP. Meanwhile, although the financial health of Vietnamese banks has improved over recent years, the banking system remains the chief driver of overall event risks for the sovereign.\nMoody's would maintain and confirm Việt Nam's Ba3 rating if the rating review were to conclude that there is evidence of clear and effective steps being taken that offer very high confidence that all debt obligations will be honoured in a smooth and timely manner.\nVietnam's long-term foreign currency (FC) bond ceiling at Ba1, its long-term FC deposit ceiling at B1, and its local currency bond and deposit ceilings at Baa3 are unchanged. The short-term FC bond and deposit ceilings remain unchanged at Not Prime. — VNS",2
4230,'Việt Nam has big potential for renewable energy development',"'Đặng Văn Thành. – Photo theleader\nĐặng Văn Thành, Chairman of the Management Board of the Thành Thành Công Group, talks to the newspaper Nông Thôn Ngày Nay (Countryside Today) about the country’s great potential to develop biomass energy.\nWhat do you see as the country’s potential to develop \xa0biomass energy?\nI should say renewable energy is a current trend of development internationally, given the threat of of climate change. Việt Nam is no exception.\nWith favourable natural conditions, Việt Nam has great potential for the development of clean energy, such as solar energy, wind power and bio mass.\nViệt Nam has more than 3,000 km of coastline running from the North to the South. Việt Nam is next to the equator, so it has a large volume of radiation from the sun – a very important factor for enterprises which are interested in producing solar energy.\nThese are the two opportunities for the country to develop its renewable energy from the wind and the sun.\nTwo years ago, Thành Thành Công Group and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) jointly conducted research on Việt Nam’s clean energy potential. We then agreed to enter into cooperation in clean energy production.\nDo you think Vietnamese enterprises have the capacity to develop biomass energy?\nRegarding biomass energy, I can say that we have big potential for the development of biomass energy, particularly sugar cane refuse from more than 40 sugar mills nation-wide. In addition, biomass energy is a good source of electricity backup for our hydro-power.\nIn Việt Nam, when the rainy season comes to an end, the winter season is approaching. And it is time for the biomass energy to connect to the national grid to add power for electricity consumers.\nHowever, regarding the cost of biomass electricity, I would like to call on the Ministry of Industry and Trade to consider a universal price for a unit of electricity nation-wide, regardless of whether it is produced from coal, hydro power, wind energy or biomass.\nIf my proposal is accepted, it will encourage the development of biomass energy or other types of energy.\nWill you please share with us your experiences in seeking funds for clean energy development?\nAt present, many banks and financial institutions have expressed their interest in the development of renewable energy.\nIn my project, IFC is our strategic shareholder while the Singapore Armstrong Clean Energy Fund is also our stakeholder.\nIn Việt Nam clean energy development is still in a new area. So in my point of view, we should consider carefully which agency would become our stakeholder in both capital investment and technical support. IFC and Armstrong are committed to accompanying us toward the goal of achieving 1,000 MegaWatt (MW) of electricity by 2020.\nDoes the IFC require any special conditions from the Thành Thành Công Corporation?\nThe most important principle that the IFC requires us to observe is that we protect the environment. This is a guiding principle in our co-operation.\nWill you please share with us some of the challenges that your corporation has faced in producing renewable energy in Việt Nam?\nThe weakest point is that at present the infrastructure for Việt Nam’s electric transmission line is still weak.\nThe current transmission line system is still concentrated, not yet distributed according to geographical conditions. This is a stumbling bloc for wind energy or solar energy when they want to join the national grids.\nIn addition, the construction of a hydro power plant or thermo plant with 50-100 MW should not take several years as it does at present. It should take around 10 months as it does in Thailand now.\nDo you have any comments on the current electricity price in Việt Nam?\nThe Government has assigned Electricity Việt Nam as the sole agency to buy all electricity generated from the solar energy projects with the price unit of VNĐ 2.086/kWh (9,35 US cents). This price does not include the value added tax. If it is possible I would like the Government to raise the price unit a bit higher so that more companies will be interested in producing clean energy in the future.\nDon’t you think that quite a few Vietnamese enterprises are also interested in producing renewable energy?\nIn the context of climate change and negative consequences of energy produced from fossils, I think it is high time for Vietnamese enterprises to further complete their plans or change their strategies towards the development of clean energy or renewable energy.– VNS'",4
