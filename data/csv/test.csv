The company calls this model “cloud kitchen”.\nThe kitchen features 12 popular restaurants on the GrabFood platform.\nEach one has a separate kitchen, equipped with basic utilities. Processing equipment is installed by the restaurants. Grab does not charge a lease for the space, it only charges for electricity, water and a commission.\n“Việt\xa0Nam is the second country where Grab has opened a GrabKitchen model. In the Indonesian market, within a short span of six months, we expanded to more than 10 GrabKitchens across the nation as of September. We\xa0aim\xa0to launch more than 50 GrabKitchens by the end of this year,\xa0the largest regional network of cloud kitchens in Southeast Asia,” said Jerry Lim, Country Head of Grab in Việt\xa0Nam.\nIn Việt\xa0Nam, the concept of GrabKitchen could also achieve considerable growth, he added.\nHe also said that the company would set up more kitchens in HCM City this year and expand to Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng next year.\nGrab’s central kitchen is a place for popular restaurants on GrabFood. The platform is to exploit places with high demand. This is a way to satisfy customers, while maximising the revenue potential for the restaurants.\nBased on analytical data, Thủ Đức District is a place of great demand because of its young demographic and high population of students and workers. However, many of their favourite restaurants were far away, said Lim.\nLâm Thành, owner of Tiệm Ăn Chợ Lớn restaurant, told the online newspaper VnExpress that having a branch in the 'central kitchen', he did not need to pay attention to space, infrastructure and management, just focus on process.\nGrabFood said that the platform's total transaction value increased by 400 per cent in the first half of this year, with the average number of daily processed orders hitting 300,000.\nA recent report by Google, Temasek and Bain & Company commented that Grab and Go-Jek were leading the way in distributing online food in Southeast Asia.\nRide-hailing has more than quadrupled in value from US$3 billion in 2015 to almost $13 billion in 2019. As it stands, the sector’s 2025 potential exceeds $40 billion, up from $29 billion predicted previously, as a result of the booming food delivery sector, according to\xa0the report.\nBy sparing consumers the inconvenience of humid weather and traffic jams, food delivery has become particularly popular in metro areas.\nAfter Lala left the market, GrabFood's rivals are Now and Go-Viet's GoFood, with non-stop promotional activities.\nA newer but common name in some HCM City districts is Baemin of South Korean start-up Woowa Brothers.\nIn the near future, at least two platforms have confirmed their participation in the food delivery war, including beFood and Vato.\nThe use of promo codes and ubiquitous marketing campaigns certainly played a key role in convincing users to try out such services. But increasingly, the wide variety of cuisine options available, including affordable meals from food court and street food stalls, the enticing user interfaces and speedy deliveries have become the determining factors behind recurring usage, according to the report. — VNS",2

The\xa0fees will increase to VNĐ130,000 per month in\xa02022.\nWith the garbage collection and transportation fees under the\xa0city's recent decision, the State must pay a small part of\xa0the garbage collection, transportation and treatment in the 2019-21 period, according to Nguyễn Thị Thanh Mỹ,\xa0the deputy director of the city's\xa0Department of Mineral Resources and Environment.\nAs garbage collection fees will increase periodically, HCM City residents will be scheduled by 2022 to pay all costs for garbage collection, transportation and treatment. — VNS",1

Of the figure, late taxes and penalties were worth VNĐ10 trillion.\nTaxpayers that had gone out of business or had their licences revoked owed nearly VNĐ9.47 trillion. Of the figure, late payment and penalties amounted to VNĐ4.17 trillion.\nAccording to the minister, tax agencies had done well to collect late tax payments and penalties. The ratio of tax liability over domestic production fell to 6.9 per cent in late August from 12.2 per cent in 2014.\nThe Ministry of Finance has regulated how to deal with late tax payments and penalties to help local authorities.\nHowever, some agencies have missed out on late taxes because there are no detailed policies to support them.\nDũng also proposed a draft resolution to write-off taxes and remove penalties for individuals and businesses unable to pay their taxes.\nUnder the resolution, the value of tax write-offs would hit VNĐ16.36 trillion.\nNguyễn Đức Hải, chairman of the National Assembly's Committee for Finance and Budget, said the committee had agreed with the finance minister’s proposal.\nHải said that late tax payers were fined at a rate of 0.03 per cent per day, which had increased the value of uncollectable taxes and put pressure on tax agencies.\nA number of individuals had been declared dead or missing while a number of businesses had been dissolved or gone bankrupt without making public announcements. That's why tax agencies had been unable to track those records and erase taxes for them, he said.\nHải warned Government agencies to prevent taxpayers from taking advantage of the policy.\nPrivate share issuance\nNon-public companies must comply with the Law of Enterprises when making a private securities deal, according to the NA Standing Committee.\nPublic companies must also follow the Law of Securities.\nThe separation would ensure public companies were treated differently from non-public firms in issuing private securities in order to protect shareholders.\nBut those companies were not subject to the management of the State Securities Commission (SSC), which is responsible for supervising public companies’ securities issuances.\nNA Deputy Trần Hoàng Ngân argued that non-public firms should be regulated by the SSC and the Law of Securities.\nA company should be considered non-public because there were only a few shareholders, not because it had small charter capital, he said.\nCompanies not regulated by the law could lead to trade fraud in securities trading, damaging investor confidence and gains, he added. – VNS",2

The change could facilitate the introduction of a direct flight route from\xa0Việt Nam to the US.\nHowever, Bình pointed out some shortcomings in the first six months of the year.\nSome incidents still occurred such as thefts, passengers carrying weapons and dangerous items, the use of\xa0improper documents for flights, public disorder\xa0and assaults on\xa0aviation personnel.\nHe said the incidents were caused by legal loopholes,\xa0the failure to follow procedures and a\xa0shortage of airline staff.\xa0Lax management has also led to flight schedule violations and inadequate rest time for crew members between flights.\nMany airlines have been hiring foreign pilots, making it more difficult to standardise the employment of pilots.\nBình said State-trained pilots were a national\xa0resource. He asked the CAAV to curb unhealthy competition, especially the poaching of pilots from other airlines.\nHe also instructed the administration to tighten control to ensure airlines would not increase flights and flying hours of pilots beyond the allowed limits.\nBình said\xa0the goal was a healthy aviation industry that properly and strategically developed its workforce\xa0and the number of aircraft.\nHe asked ministries and branches to co-ordinate to ensure safety and\xa0security in the remaining\xa0months of this year.\nHe also asked the Ministry of Defence to submit to the Government an amended decree on unmanned and ultralight aircraft\xa0to\xa0replace Decree No. 36/2008/ND-CP. — VNS",1

This trend will continue in the future, it said.\nViệt Nam's exports of timber and wooden products to the EU market have good prospects thanks to the advantages from the Voluntary Partnership Agreement on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (VPA/FLECT) and the Việt Nam-EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA).\nTo seize opportunities in the EU market, Vietnamese businesses should invest in equipment, technology and materials following market demand, according to the association.\nFor the Japanese market, besides wooden furniture, Japan has a policy of producing wood pellets to replace fossil energy sources such as coal, oil and gas which are gradually running out. The wood pellets are used as fuel for thermal power plants replacing coal and oil and used as heating equipment in the industrial sector and civil activities.\nRecently, Japanese enterprises have invested in three wood pellet production factories in Nghệ An Province, producing wood pellets for export to Japan.\nTherefore, it expects that Việt Nam's export turnover of wooden products to Japan will surpass the EU, reaching over $1 billion.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Import and Export Department has warned that the rapid increase of Việt Nam’s timber and wood products exports to the US at present may cause the US to pay more attention to the exports of those products to this market. Therefore, local enterprises exporting wood and forest products should actively update information from their partners and authorities to avoid this risk.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's Administration of Forestry, the export value of wood and forest products in the first eight months of 2019 was estimated at $7.08 billion, up 18.6 per cent year on year, including $1 billion in August, up 16 per cent.\nPhạm Văn Điển, deputy director-deneral of the administration, said 87 per cent of the national export turnover from wood and forest products was to traditional markets, such as the US, Japan, the EU, China and South Korea.\nQuyền said the US is the largest export market of Việt Nam's timber industry, accounting for 45 per cent of the industry's total export value. The average growth rate of exports to this market is from 15-17 per cent each year. The export value of timber and wooden products in the first seven months of 2019 was $2.7 billion, up 32.8 per cent over the same period in 2018.\nMeanwhile, Việt Nam’s exports of wood and wooden products to Japan have increased sharply since the beginning of the year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\nViệt Nam was the largest kitchen furniture supplier for Japan in the first half of 2019, reaching 12,800 tonnes, up 19.8 per cent year on year.

Huế had been recognised as Việt Nam’s city of festivals, and ASEAN’s cultural and tourism city, while the complex of historical relics and landscapes had been preserved and upgraded. The poverty rate in the city had dropped significantly, and living conditions had improved.\nHowever, the province’s economic development had not matched potential, the Politburo said, pointing out that urban development was slow and infrastructure remained uneven. Urban planning and management\xa0failed to match the pace of development, while administrative reform, Party building and apparatus building work had not been up to snuff.\nTo develop\xa0Huế into a centrally-run city, the Politburo agreed to issue a resolution and asked the province’s Party organisation, administration and people to seriously implement it.\nFor Buôn Ma Thuột, the Politburo recognised the city’s efforts to tap its potential, resulting in economic growth. The city had become a first-level city of Đắk Lắk Province and was advancing in the direction of a modern city. Living conditions had improved, Party building work received attention, and the administrative apparatus was shifting toward streamlined organisation and\xa0efficient operation. National defence and security in the city had been ensured.\nAt the same time, the Politburo said the city’s economic growth had not been on par with its\xa0advantages. Buôn Ma Thuột had yet to become the central city of the Central Highlands region. Poverty reduction in the city was not sustainable, and there remained complications in security and social order in some areas. Local infrastructure was poor, and transport links with other provinces were slow to be upgraded.\nAiming to turn Buôn Ma Thuột into a green and smart city, the central hub of the Central Highlands and a growth pole of\xa0the Việt Nam-Laos-Cambodia development triangle, the Politburo issued a conclusion on building and developing Buôn Ma Thuột.\nAlso at the meeting, the Politburo made decisions on\xa0personnel matters and gave opinions on other issues.

It uses artificial intelligence to help users improve their English pronunciation.\nELSA Speak has raised over $15 million and has around four million users in more than 100 countries and territories around the world and was listed as one of 13 promising tech startups in Southeast Asia by the South China Morning Post.\nLate last month Vietnamese education start-up Everest Education raised $4 million in a Series B round led by Hong Kong private-equity fund Hendale Capital, according to media reports.\nThe round also saw the participation of venture capital fund Viet Capital and Singapore’s Nullabor.\nEarly last month Singapore- and India-based education fund manager Kaizen Private Equity (Kaizen PE) decided to invest $10 million in YOLA, a Vietnamese ELT service provider backed by local PE firm Mekong Capital.\nAll these start-ups have some common features: their projects have high applicability, they are developing e-learning or EdTech, and their initiators are all Vietnamese.\nGoTit! was founded by Dr Trần Việt Hùng and Elsa Speak by Văn Đinh Hồng Vũ and Ngô Thùy Ngọc Tú.\nWhat accounts for this sudden interest among foreign investors in Vietnamese edtech start-ups?\nViệt Nam and some other countries like India, the Philippines and Mexico, which face major population pressure, have had to opt for e-learning to keep up with the education levels in developed countries.\nViệt Nam’s e-learning market is valued at $2 billion by experts and has enormous potential, thus attracting young people who are strong in digital technology.\nTen years ago some companies pioneered e-learning and achieved reasonable success, including Violet.vn, Hocmai.vn and Topical, who have millions of followers.\nThe quick success of the edtech companies also means Vietnamese people are able to easily use sophisticated education technology, again underlining the huge potential of the market.\nThe country’s e-learning market size is calculated based on the fact that every year Vietnamese are estimated to spend $3-4 billion to send their children abroad to study.\nBesides, the sheer numbers are attractive: it is a country with more than 22 million students.\nThe Vietnamese online training market has in fact been attracting much attention from foreign investors for years.\nAt the end of 2016 the country had 309 investment projects in the fields of tech-based education and training with total registered capital of over $767 million.\nMarket expects banks to follow SBV, cut interest rates\nOn September 16 the State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV) began to cut several key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to pump prime the economy.\nThe cuts, the first by the SBV since October 2017, brings down the refinancing and rediscount rates to 6 per cent and 4 per cent.\nThe annual overnight electronic inter-bank rate and rate on loans to offset capital shortage in clearance between the central bank and domestic banks have been cut to 7 per cent.\nThe interest rate on bids for valuable papers through open market operations is reduced from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent.\nAccording to the SBV, it previously used monetary policy measures to stabilise interest rates in the context of rising international rates, which contributed to macroeconomic stability and ensured reasonable growth.\nBut it has now opted for the new cuts since the global economy has become more volatile and less favourable, and many central banks, including those of the US and Europe, have cut key interest rates.\nExperts had been asking persistently why Việt Nam effected no change though many economies around the world had already loosened monetary policy, including cutting rates.\nDr Cấn Văn Lực, member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Consultation Council, said the central bank’s decision to lower key interest rates was apt amid the current global economic instability.\nBesides, Việt Nam’s inflation rate was fairly benign at 2.57 per cent, which gave the SBV some leeway to cut the rates.\nVeteran economist Nguyễn Trí Hiếu said Việt Nam was suffering from the impacts of the US-China trade war especially since they were also Việt Nam’s two biggest trade partners. So it had to act, he said.\nHow do the rate cuts affect the market?\nAccording to BIDV Securities Company, the market took the cuts in a positive manner as the first sign of policy loosening.\nThey would help weaken the đồng somewhat against the Chinese yuan, helping sustain Việt Nam’s exports as well as competitiveness, it said.\nACBs Securities Joint Stock Company said the cuts were a move to stabilise the economy and support growth against the background of a slowdown in some sectors seen in August.\nLowering interest rates is a powerful form of economic stimulus and the lower interest rates are expected to push up personal consumption and encourage enterprises to expand production.\nExperts said prospective borrowers now expect a wave of interest rate cuts by banks.\nSome bankers said with the lower cost of capital now lenders are likely to slash both deposit and loan interest rates soon.\nThey expected the central bank’s rate cuts would also help banks facing liquidity problems.\nBut some analysts expressed reservations saying it was too early to predict the outcome of the rate cuts because the central bank’s key interest rates had for years had only a modest effect on the economy.\nBesides, a cut of 0.25 percentage points was too little to affect the economy considering the current interest rates, they said, implying they would like to see further cuts in the near future.

4036,'Take a chance on Big Dunc',"'by Paul Kennedy\nGREAT SCOT: Duncan Ferguson celebrates after winning his first match as Everton’s interim manager. AFP/VNA\xa0Photo\nI had the pleasure of meeting Everton’s caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson, on two separate occasions back in the 90s.\nI say a pleasure, but the first time our paths crossed wasn’t very pleasurable.\nI had just covered an Everton Premier League match and found myself stood next to (or rather towered over by) the imposing Scot in the reception area of Goodison Park, home of Everton FC.\nIt was fairly common knowledge at the time that Big Dunc wasn’t very forthcoming when it came to giving interviews with the press, but, being the daring (and stupid) reporter I was at the time, I thought I would try my luck.\n“Mr Ferguson, great win today. Quick word about the game?”\n“%*&?!# *&%%$” was his reply, and I’m not writing that in Scottish.\nI wasn’t particularly offended, it was to be expected.\nA few years later I found myself stood next to him at the urinals in the toilet of a bar in Liverpool City Centre after the Grand National Race Meeting.\nWe chatted briefly about our wins and losses (he won more than me) and, unaware I was a reporter, he was a thoroughly nice guy.\nOn Saturday morning, Big Dunc took charge of his first match at Everton against Chelsea following the dismissal of Marco Silva.\nAnd things could not have gone any better for the caretaker boss. Watching Everton v Chelsea compared to their match a few days earlier against Liverpool was chalk and cheese.\nSure, I get that a new manager will always give a team a boost, but Ferguson gave Everton something the Goodison faithful have not seen for a long time, passion.\nHis sprint down the touchline was Jurgen Klopp-like, and great to see.\nThe next day I saw a meme online that was basically Dunc getting interviewed for the manager’s position and was asked what experience he had as a manager?\nThe cartoon Scot replied: “None, but I have an Everton tattoo.”\nMaybe he doesn’t possess the experience of others in contention for the job will surely have, and yes, I understand good footballers don’t necessarily make good managers, just look at Roy Keane.\nBut why not just roll the dice and say to the big man: “Tell you what Dunc, you’ve got to the end of the season, do your best.” If that happens, Everton fans will have no doubt a manager who understands the club, which is a lot more than others will be able to offer right now.\nHe knows Everton inside out.\nHe knows the city of Liverpool inside out. And he really gets the supporters.\nFor me, for the time being at least, they are all the qualifications needed.\nWhatever happens, Everton are highly unlikely to get relegated come to the end of the season, and will not be challenging for a top-four spot, so why not let Ferguson have a go?\nI remembering watching him on the pitch, and even from the comfort of the press box, and he scared the living daylights out of me.\nHe was tough, talented and a nightmare to play against.\nSaturday’s Everton performance was full throttle and no nonsense, just like Ferguson’s own style when he wore the number nine jersey for the Blues.\nIt wasn’t Spanish-style tiki-taka or total football, mastered by the Dutch.\nIt was gritty, it was hard, and it was very, very effective. Just look at the scoreline.\nAlthough on Merseyside Everton have been a laughing-stock for as far back as I can remember, I can see the tide slightly turning, but only if they give the big man a shot.

Higher demand for electricity during the Lunar New Year 2018 and hot weather in the second quarter and third quarter this year have made the prices of electricity jump by 8.38 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018.\nHigher tuition fees, an increase in the regional minimum wage, plus higher prices of food, public transport services, and oil and gas products also contributed to the CPI rise.\nAccording to the GSO, this year’s basic inflation (CPI exclusive of foodstuff, fresh food, energy, healthcare and education services) rose 2.01 per cent over the previous year.\nNgọc said ministries and agencies had actively implemented the tasks and solutions to realise the socio-economic development plan and state budget estimate in 2019, aiming to keep CPI growth in 2019 below 4 per cent.\nThe Finance Ministry has also stepped up market inspections.

Việt Nam among countries with highest GDP growth in region\nIn 2019, Việt Nam recorded a GDP growth rate of 7.02 per cent despite growing strategic competition in the region and the world.\nThis is the second straight year it has fulfilled all 12 targets set by the National Assembly, including a record trade surplus of US$9.94 billion, low budget overspending, and inflation under 3 per cent. This is also the fourth consecutive year inflation has been kept under 4 per cent. Notably, Việt Nam jumped 10 places in the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Competitiveness Report, becoming the most improved nation in the rankings.\n2. Politburo issues first-ever regulation on power control\nOn September 23, the Politburo issued Regulation 205-QD/TW on the control of power in personnel work, which identifies acts of illegal lobbying for promotion, and covering up and abetting illegal lobbying for promotion. The regulation also specifies the responsibilities of relevant organisations and individuals, along with penalties for the covering up and abetting of such lobbying.\nAs preparations are being made for all-level Party congresses towards the 13th National Party Congress, the implementation of Regulation 205 will help select qualified personnel with sufficient capacity and reputation for the leadership apparatus in the coming tenure.\n3. National public service portal debuts\nOn December 9, the national public service portal was officially launched and put into use, marking an important milestone in the implementation of an e-Government that centres on people and businesses.\nBy going to a single website (http://dichvucong.gov.vn) and using a single account, people and businesses can easily access all public service portals at ministerial and provincial levels to handle public services online, follow procedure settlement processes, assess settlements, and send feedback regardless of time or place.\n4. Việt Nam elected non-permanent member of United Nations Security Council with 192 approval votes out of 193 UN members\nOn June 7, at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, Việt Nam won the support of 192 out of the 193 UN members to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2020 -\xa021 term. This result showed the international community’s trust and high evaluation of the country’s active, practical and responsible contributions to the UN in general, and the UN Security Council in particular.\nThe Vietnamese Government pledged to fulfill its roles as the council’s non-permanent member and as ASEAN Chair in 2020, thereby deserving the international community’s trust and further contributing to regional and global peace, stability and prosperity.\n5.

Việt Nam fulfills role as host of summit between the United States, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)\nHà Nội was chosen as the venue for the second US-DPRK summit on February 27-28.\nBy ensuring the thoughtful and safe organisation of the event, Việt Nam demonstrated itself as a responsible nation helping to guide international relations and actively contributing to global and regional peace.\nThe country was once again recognised as a safe, impressive and hospitable destination that has sufficient conditions and experience to host big international events.\n7. Vietnamese found dead in container truck in United Kingdom:\\\nOn October 23, 39 people were found dead in a refrigerated container truck in Essex county, northeast of London, the United Kingdom.\nShortly after all the victims had been identified as Vietnamese, the Government directed competent agencies to take all appropriate citizen protection measures to bring them home.\nThe identification, citizen protection and transportation of the victims’ bodies and ashes were carried out in a humanitarian spirit and in line with international law, as well as the laws and customs of Việt Nam and the UK.\nThe Vietnamese Government strongly condemned people trafficking and illegally sending people abroad.\nIt called on countries in the region and around the world to press on with cooperation to resolutely prevent and eradicate this particularly dangerous crime to avoid similar incidents, and finalise investigations to prosecute those responsible in an open trial.\n8. African swine fever spreads nationwide\nOn February 19, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development officially reported the first-ever appearance of African swine fever in Việt Nam.\nThis is a dangerous disease with no vaccine or treatment currently available. The whole political system has taken drastic actions to fight the epidemic.\nBy mid-December, nearly 6 million pigs weighing over 342,800 tonnes had been culled, accounting for about 9 per cent of total herds nationwide.\nThe epidemic has led to a pork shortage, pushing pork prices up in the final months of the year, ahead of the expected consumption spike during the New Year and Tết\xa0(lunar New Year) holidays.\n9. Consecutive environmental incidents occur\nPeople seen\xa0wearing masks with the air quality in Hà Nội at alarmingly unhealthy levels\xa0. — VNA/VNS Photo\nA factory fire at the Rạng Đông Light Source and Vacuum Flask JSC in Thanh Xuân District, Hà Nội, released up to 27.2kg of mercury into the environment, triggering public concerns.\nWaste dumping that polluted the Sông Đà Water Investment JSC resulted in a clean water crisis in many districts of Hà Nội lasting for days, affecting hundreds of thousands of citizens.\nSerious air pollution in big cities like Hà Nội and HCM City has negatively impacted people’s health and living environment. Authorities failed to respond in a timely manner, thus affecting people’ lives.\n10. Strict punishments for Party organisations, senior officials committing violations:\nIn 2019, disciplinary measures and criminal punishments have been considered and issued for many Party organisations and senior officials found guilty of committing violations, including a former deputy prime minister, former ministers, incumbent and former deputy ministers, vice secretaries of provincial Party Committees, chairpersons of provincial People’s Committees, incumbent and former secretaries of Party Committees, former executives of State-owned enterprises, Party units at ministries, and the standing boards of Party Committees of provinces and State-owned firms.\nThe strict handling of Party cadres and organisations that committed violations has continued to affirm the Party’s viewpoint that there are no “off-limits” zones in the fight against corruption and negative phenomena, while reflecting the resolve to ensure Party discipline, purify the apparatus, and regain and consolidate the people’s trust. — VNS",1

The pork\xa0will be sold under the city’s price stabilisation programme.\nIn addition, Co.opmart, Co.opXtra and Co.opFood are also selling chilled pork products using European production technologies and herb-fed pork to offer customers more choice, he said.\nSaigon Co.op has also prepared a large volume of chicken and duck meat, and fishery and aquaculture products to serve customers during\xa0the peak shopping season.\nLive pig prices up\nVũ Văn Tư, director of Trường Giang Phát One Member Co., Ltd in Đồng Nai Province’s Biên Hòa City, said the price of live pigs has fluctuated strongly, with prices in the afternoon higher than in the morning.\nHe attributed the situation to a lower supply due to the impact of African swine fever\xa0and a higher demand for pork since businesses have sped up production of pork-based products for\xa0Tết.\nBut while large pig breeding companies offered live pig price at VNĐ79,000 (US$3.4) per kilo, in some areas traders had to pay up to VNĐ90,000 ($3.88) to buy pig from farmers, he said.\nAccording to enterprises, large pig breeding farms are offering good prices to large customers who regularly buy their pigs at a large quantity, while small breeding farms and household farmers expect\xa0that pig prices will increase\xa0in the near Tết, so they have reduced selling the pigs, pushing up prices.\nTứ said after the peak production for Tết ends, the price gap between large breeding companies and the market price will shrink because such a high price will affect consumption demand.\nThiệu from Sagrifood said\xa0that the current high price of live pigs was\xa0only temporary since the price would affect consumption\xa0and live pig prices would\xa0fall soon.\nRepresentatives of some wholesales markets in the city said the volume of pork in\xa0the market\xa0has fallen\xa0significantly,\xa0while the volume of fresh fishery and aquaculture products have increased compared to last month. — VNS'",2

Photo tbdn.com.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Việt Nam’s agriculture sector gained a trade surplus of US$8.8 billion in the first 11 months of this year, $1.5 billion higher than the same period last year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).\nDuring the 11-month period, the sector achieved a total trade value of $65.7 billion from agricultural, forestry and aquatic products, with an export value of $37.3 billion, up by 3.6 per cent year on year, and an import value of $28.5 billion, down by 0.7 per cent.\nThe sector has seven groups of agricultural products with export value of more than $2 billion including timber and wood products, coffee, rubber, rice, cashew nuts, fruits and shrimp.\nRegarding export markets, China was still the largest export market of Việt Nam's agricultural products, accounting for 26.9 per cent of total export revenue; followed by the US, accounting for 21.9 per cent; EU, 11.7 per cent; ASEAN, 10 per cent; Japan, 8.8 per cent and South Korea, 5.8 per cent.\nThe ministry expects the total export revenue\xa0this year to\xa0reach about $41.3 billion and the trade surplus is estimated at $9.5-10 billion.\nBy year end, the MARD will continue\xa0to coordinate with the ministries and other sectors in actively negotiating to open export markets avoiding dependence on one market and stabilising traditional markets.\nThe ministry has asked agriculture, forestry and fishery producers to have production processes meeting requirements of importing countries on traceability and geographical indications for exported agricultural, forestry and fishery products.\nMARD continues to deal with market difficulties to create favourable conditions for exporting seafood to China, the US, South Korea, Australia and Brazil.\nAt the same time, it would monitor agricultural consumption at the border gates and promote the Chinese side to speed up the review of proposals for opening markets for Việt Nam's export of swallow nest products.\nThe sector continues to coordinate with associations and enterprises to closely monitor supply and demand of food, foodstuffs and import-export situation and strengthen strict control of smuggling in the domestic market.\nIt would also find solutions on removing difficulties in the market and stabilising the supply of agricultural, forestry and aquatic products by the end of the year.\nAccording to the ministry, in 11 months, the export value of some products increased over the same period last year, such as rubber (up 9.3 per cent to $2 billion), tea (up 16 per cent to $216 million), vegetables (up 9 per cent to $592 million), wood and wooden products (up 19.5 per cent to $9.6 billion) and cinnamon (up 31 per cent to $163 million).\nHowever, there were still some agricultural products with reductions in export revenue due to a sharp decline in the average export price.\nThey included fruit (down 5.5 per cent to $2.6 billion), cashew nuts (down 1.8 per cent to $3 billion) and rice (down 9.4 per cent to $2.6 billion).\nEspecially, coffee plummeted in both value (15 per cent) and volume (nearly 23 per cent) year on year and the coffee export value reached $2.5 billion. – VNS",2
3669,'Việt Nam’s PMI falls to 50.5 in September',"'Vietnamese manufacturing production dipped in September amid a further slowdown in the rate of new order growth. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI The Việt Nam Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 50.5 in September, signalling only a marginal improvement in business conditions, and the weakest since February 2016.\nAccording to the latest survey released by Nikkei and IHS Markit on Tuesday, the reading was down from 51.4 in August, down for the second month in a row.\n“The initial signs of a slowdown which we noted last month strengthened during September as demand waned again. Manufacturers responded to softer inflows of new work by bringing the recent period of output growth to an end and showing a reluctance to take on extra staff and purchase inputs. Concerns about demand conditions were also evident in relatively weak sentiment data,” Andrew Harker, Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.\n""The latest PMI figures show that while the Vietnamese manufacturing sector has been one of the best performers globally in recent months, the slowdown in global trade flows amid trade tensions between the US and China is starting to impact firms negatively as we enter the final quarter of 2019,” Harker added.\nVietnamese manufacturing production dipped in September amid a further slowdown in the rate of new order growth, the report said, adding employment levels were also down slightly and business confidence was low.\nSigns of weakening demand conditions meant a continued lack of pressure on prices. Input costs were up only marginally, while output prices fell again.\nA slowdown in new order growth was seen at the end of the third quarter, with the latest modest increase the softest since August 2016. Weaker customer demand was mentioned by a number of respondents. This was also the case in international markets as new export orders rose at a slower pace.\nWeaker growth of new business resulted in a slight fall in manufacturing production, the first in two years.\nStaffing levels were also reduced at the end of the third quarter, ending a three-month sequence of job creation. Employee resignations were reported to have contributed to the fall. Reduced operating capacity meant firms were sometimes unable to complete orders during the month, leading to a modest increase in work backlogs.\nLower output requirements discouraged input buying in the sector, with\xa0growth in purchasing activity slowing to near-stagnation. Stocks of both purchases and finished goods also increased marginally.\nPrice reductions by some suppliers attempting to secure new business meant the rate of input cost inflation remained muted in September. Input prices rose marginally, and at a much weaker pace than the series average.\nA lack of pressure from input costs allowed manufacturers to offer price reductions to customers to stimulate demand. Output prices decreased for the 10th month in a row. Although the latest reduction was slight, it was the most marked since June.\nSuppliers\' delivery times lengthened for the second month running, with\xa0delays sometimes linked to shortages of materials at vendors.\nBusiness sentiment deteriorated for the second successive month in September. While firms generally remained optimistic of a rise in production over the coming year, confidence was the lowest since August 2018 and the second-weakest since future expectations data were added to the survey in April 2012. Worries about market demand were behind reduced sentiment, according to respondents. VNS'",2

840,'PM Rutte’s visit to broaden economic ties with VN: ambassador',"'Ambassador to Việt Nam Elsbeth Akkerman. — VNS Photo Khánh Chi\nPrime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte will pay an official visit to Việt Nam from April 9 – 11 at the invitation of Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc. The country’s ambassador to Việt Nam, Elsbeth Akkerman, speaks to Việt Nam News about the visit and the bilateral relationship between the countries.\nWhat is the significance of the visit to Việt Nam by the Dutch Prime Minister?\nIn addition to PM Rutte, his delegation will include the Minister of Infrastructure and Water, Vice Minister of Agriculture, State Secretary of Finance, and more than 100 business representatives representing 70 companies in a number of areas in which the Netherlands and Việt Nam have close ties. And the purpose of the PM’s visit is to strengthen and broaden these ties.\nThe purpose of the visit also allows us to underline the economic relationship that goes way beyond 45 years. These economic ties have so far been in the field of agriculture, food security,\xa0water and climate change. These are topics that are very close to the hearts and minds of both Dutch and Vietnamese people because we are both open economies and delta countries, so for the large part the Netherlands and Việt Nam are below sea level and that very much heightens the impacts of climate change.\nThe visit will be an opportunity for him to underline the importance of the partnership with Việt Nam in a broader context. We are both committed to achieving the sustainable development goals and our ambitions in climate change. I found that Việt Nam is very focused on this, very dedicated and committed to this. I assume that our Prime Ministers will also talk a lot about these very important ambitions, not only for the Netherlands and Việt Nam but also for the rest of the\xa0world as these are global issues that matter to everybody.\nWill the Netherlands share with Việt Nam new ways to better adapt to climate change?\nWholeheartedly, yes. The Netherlands is and will continue to be partner of Việt Nam in climate change, both in mitigation as well as adaptation. And in relation to the latter, Prime Minister Phúc and Prime Minister Rutte will have a dialogue on agricultural transformation and the lessons that Việt Nam might take from our experiences. In that context, we will very closely work on circular approaches of agriculture and the adaptation of smart technologies so we are a partner for Việt Nam in that. It is so necessary that we exchange these experiences because this is part of global development and global challenges that we both have to face.\nThe Netherlands’ PM has initiated a movement to start an alliance of countries that are very much dedicated to climate change adaptation and the Prime Ministers and the ministers of both sides will have dialogue on Việt Nam being one of the partners in this coalition for climate change adaptation.\nCould you please highlight focal points in bilateral ties?\nWater and agriculture are the most visible. We have worked with the Vietnamese government, research institutes, provinces and localities on the drafting of the Mekong Delta Plan. And PM Phúc ordered Resolution 120 for the implementation of that plan, and that’s a great joint achievement. We are looking forward to taking on board the implementation of both the plan and the resolution. Other topics we are currently working on include maritime issues. You can see both in Hải Phòng and in HCM City, there are large facilities on shipbuilding, port management, inland water transport. If you use inland waterways instead of road transport, the impacts on the environment will be less. So in that sense we are working on smart ways of transport, and also achieving mutual ambitions to lessen negative pressure on the environment.\nThe population of Việt Nam is big and growing and there is an enormous flow of people from the countryside to urban areas. The Netherlands is a small country and we don’t have as many people as Việt Nam but we also know about dense population and urbanisation so here we seek cooperation with Việt Nam as a whole and with large cities like HCM City and Hà Nội. So we talk about lighting, urban mobility, and access to services. These are also the future fields of co-operation where we can find help from smart technologies.\nWhat are your priorities during your term to further promote the bilateral relationship?\nIt’s very important of course to foster the bilateral relationship, but in such a way that companies and private actors contribute to public goals. The explicit policy of the Dutch Government is that companies do their business in a sustainable way. There is nothing wrong with making profit, but not at the cost of people and the planet. So do it in a balanced way and make sure that when you earn your money you take care of the environment, both the natural and societal environment.\nThis will be the cause of my involvement. It is very necessary to engage businesses, research institutes, Government officials, representatives of civil society organisations so that we come up with smart and sustainable solutions.\nFor me as an ambassador, I have an eye for talent and skills development of young people to ensure that young people can use their talent and creativity to contribute to the further development of Việt Nam; and an eye on inclusiveness and diversity.

Companies\xa0will also be able to more easily open offices in\xa0other markets.\nA\xa0representative from the E-commerce Development Centre (under the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Việt Nam E-commerce and Information Technology Agency), said that\xa0Vietnamese enterprises have\xa0been using\xa0online trading floors to find foreign partners and customers.\nFor traditional trading platforms, many businesses encounter\xa0cumbersome procedures and\xa0huge expenditures looking for\xa0foreign partners or implementing trade promotion programmes.\nOn the other hand, online import and export channels can\xa0reduce costs and time for businesses, especially SMEs looking for business partners, carrying out\xa0trade promotions, marketing products, and implementing transactions and payments, according to the representative.\nViệt Nam is one of the fastest growing economies in Southeast Asia, and with a stable governance and ease of doing business, Vietnamese SMEs are likely to succeed in joining the global e-commerce trade.\nAccording to the ministry’s Việt Nam E-commerce and Digital Economy Agency, e-commerce has had strong growth with the highest rate of 30 per cent in 2018, rising to US$7.8 billion revenue from $4 billion in 2015.\nIf the growth rate of 2019 and 2020 continues at\xa030 per cent each year, revenue by 2020 would\xa0reach $13 billion. — VNS'",2

Some trees are 200-500 years old,” he said.\n“As a special gift from nature, we have processed and sold tea to earn a living, from generation\xa0to generation,” he said.\nHowever, traditional tea processing and selling\xa0brought little profit, prompting the young man to find ways to develop his family business.\n“I have joined training courses held by local authorities on farming techniques and doing business to develop our business,” Kiêm said.\n“While doing business with others, I learned\xa0how they had successfully used Facebook and Zalo to sell their products,” he said.\n“And I decided to give it a try,” he said.\nJoining these social platforms, the young man made friends with people from different localities which created chances for him to introduce his tea products to a wide range of customers.\n“I usually post photos about ancient tea trees and tea fields of Hà Giang as well as traditional tea processing steps and tea products, which gradually drew attention from people. Then some people started to text me to ask about my products and I received the first orders via those platforms,” he said.\nHowever, the online business was not as easy as he\xa0had imagined.\n“At first, not so many people believed in the quality of the products I\xa0introduced on my social platforms. The images were not enough. And I got no orders for the first several months,” he said.\n“Then I decided to send samples of my tea products for them to try. And gradually, more and more customers came to me,” he added.\n“The business has started to work effectively but more needs\xa0to be done to expand it,” he said.\nChallenges remain, particularly his lack of experience in processing different kinds of tea to make diverse products and meet consumer demand, according to Kiêm.\nInvestment in expanding tea processing workshops and modern processing technology and equipment is also needed. Most local farmers still use traditional tea processing methods with low productivity.\nHe was reminded of years before when most\xa0local farmers sold raw materials to traders, including those from China, with low price, due to limited knowledge about tea processing.\nTo help tackle such issues, Kiêm has formed a co-operative of young local farmers to share experience and support each other. The group has drawn 10 households in the village, most of them poor families.\n“We share experience in tea processing and expanding markets and find ways to improve the products’ quality,” he said.\nThey have also participated in training classes hosted by local authorities and engaged in organic farming to raise tea quality.\nOrganic farming\nLý Quốc Hưng, chairman of People’s Committee of Cao Bồ Commune, said the local government has worked with village elders to\xa0encourage local farmers to use organic cultivation to help raise tea value.\n“We have held regular training classes on organic methods, farming and processing techniques to help local farmers raise tea quality,” he said.\nLocal farmers previously didn't consider tea trees as major farm produce so they paid little attention to the trees’ quality, according to Hưng.\nBut they have gradually changed\xa0to organic farming and tea growth and production has become a key source of income\xa0for many ethnic minority households in the commune, he said.\nKiêm said: “We knew nothing about expanding markets and had no understanding of organic farming before so the tea production and price were so low.”\n“But now the tea quality has improved with more diverse products, it also means tea price has increased and is more stable,” he said.\nChairman Hưng said: “Cao Bồ Commune has become a favourite tea production area of customers not only in Việt Nam but also from other countries. There are times we can't meet export demand.”\nIn the first six months of 2019, farmers in the commune harvested nearly 200 tonnes of tea buds with an estimated value of VNĐ10 billion ($432,000).\nThe commune exports nearly 200 tonnes of organic tea products to many countries each year, mostly in Europe and America.\nEndowed with good conditions for tea production, Hà Giang has identified tea as a way to help local ethnic minorities improve their livelihoods.\nThe province is the third largest tea-growing area in Việt Nam, with 20,000ha of tea with an annual output of over 73,000 tonnes of tea buds\xa0per year. Of which, more than 9,000ha is certified to meet VietGAP and organic standards.\nFarmers\xa0pick tea buds in northern mountainous Hà Giang Province. — VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Chiến\nAnd with the determination and efforts of both local authorities and farmers, tea production has made many once poor ethnic farmers in the province successful businessmen like Kiêm.\nHis tea products are not only sold to customers in Việt Nam but also those from other countries like China, Laos and Russia. Kiêm has exported dozens of tonnes of organic tea products and has provided for his family.\nEach month, his family can earn an average of VNĐ10-12million (US$430-520) from tea production.\nThey had never thought of escaping poverty, not to mention earning a mint\xa0from the tea trees.\nKiêm said doing online business and organic farming were all new, but it was worth learning and trying. — VNS",1

We see more and more Vietnamese looking to invest overseas.”\nKingston Lai, CEO of Denzell Vietnam, said a few years ago many Vietnamese invested overseas for a number of different reasons such as children’s education or residency.\nBut now the trend had changed, and the top reason was to diversify their portfolio, he said.\nConcurring, Pantazis Therianos, CEO of Euroterra Capital, a multinational property investment and development company headquartered in Europe, said Vietnamese were now looking for good global investment, looking to diversify their portfolio and find the best return for their investment abroad.\n“I also saw that in the past they used to buy property in different ways from friends, from platforms but now most of them are looking for the best agencies to buy from them.”\nAccording to speakers at the seminar, Việt Nam is one of the most attractive overseas markets for international businesses thanks to its high economic growth, rising income and increasing demand for making overseas property investment.\nFour international property developers, Euroterra Capital, Pafilia, Australian developer Lendlease, and Thai real-estate developer Sansiri, introduced their products as well as residence permits such as Greece Golden Visa, Cyprus Citizenship Programme and Thai Retirement Visa at the seminar.\nThey also advised investors in choosing where to invest.\nTherianos said investors should consider places they understand, and since tourism is what Việt Nam is famous for, Vietnamese should invest in properties related to tourist such as on an island, in the city centre or near the sea.\nWinters said investors should look at “locations that can generate over 70 per cent of sales to foreign investors and locations that give a good return regardless of the reason for investing.”\nPoomipak Julmanichoti\xa0, executive vice president of Sansiri, said: “There are two locations that I would like to recommend for investment - Bangkok and Phuket.\n“Obviously these two cities are among the most visited by foreign tourists and you can retire there easily.”\nAccording to Eric Chan, residential director, Lendlease Malaysia, Malaysia has a low and friendly tax structure.\nMalaysia is very culturally adaptable for most Vietnamese and also a very easy place to retire in, he said.\nBut investing overseas is not an easy task for investors since they are not familiar with the market, legal processes, developers, and language, according to delegates.\nWinters said the two key elements that investors should think about when they want to invest abroad were “making sure that you are investing in a reputable company in that country and making sure you have a good performance agency here in your home country.”\nLai said Denzell would be a bridge connecting Vietnamese investors with globally reputed real estate development.\nThe company checks developers and projects to make sure they are reliable before it introduces their projects to the market, and invites clients to visit those countries, whether Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, or Malaysia, to enable them to see the property for themselves and meet and work with partners (lawyers), and offers comprehensive after-sales service such as leasing and property management, according to Lai.\nDenzell next plans to organise an event to introduce TRX, an integrated 70-acre development that will be Kuala Lumpur's new financial district, on November 3 in HCM City. — VNS",2

Remittances have exceeded official aid – by a factor of three – since the mid-1990s. This year, they are on track to overtake foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to LMICs.\nThis year, remittances will increase moderately in South Asia (5.3 per cent), Sub-Saharan Africa (5.1 per cent) and East Asia and Pacific (3.8 per cent) due to the buoyancy in inflows from the US being offset by slower growth of receipts from the Euro area and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).\nGrowth of remittance flows slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2019 compared to a robust 8.6 per cent in 2018, the brief noted, adding that cyclical factors affecting the growth of remittance flows include economic growth in source countries, oil price and variations in exchange rates.\nAccording to the brief, assuming that outward remittances growth in tandem with the nominal GDP (in US dollar terms) of the source countries, these flows are projected to reach $574 billion in 2020 and $597 billion by 2021.\nThis forecast methodology is conservative, as it does not account for increasing migration flows, falling remittance costs, and progress in the technology of remittance services, the brief noted. — VNS'",2

4922,'A weight lifted from Klopp’s shoulders',"'TOP OF THE KLOPPS: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp (centre) with the Champions League trophy. AFP Photo\nby Paul Kennedy\nI’ve a friend back in the UK called Dave who I’ve known for years. Good bloke and he really knows his football. He’s a Manchester United fan who rather surprisingly, is actually from Manchester.\nDave has been following United home and away for as long as I can remember. He hates Liverpool like he absolutely should, but when Dave talks football I listen. He knows his stuff.\nAt the beginning of the season he said something to me I didn’t want to hear. A bold statement that, at the time, I completely disagreed with.\nYet as the season went on, I kept hearing his words in my ears, niggling away like a tiny stone stuck in my shoe.\nTo say Dave had touched a nerve was an understatement. Despite Liverpool’s success as the season went on, Dave’s words were playing on my mind.\nThey went something like this.\n“Jurgen Klopp is a fraud. He’s a fake mate. He’ll win nothing with Liverpool. He’s got you all fooled.”\nHe had come to this conclusion based quite simply on facts. His logic centred around Klopp’s managerial style. He is affable, passionate and media savvy.\nHis interviews pre and post-match are entertaining and even include the odd expletive or two. He likes to be viewed as one of the lads.\nAnd Liverpool fans love him for all of the above. But success isn’t judged on hugs, hearty laughs and over-the-top touchline celebrations. Success is judged on trophies, and before last week after four years at Liverpool, Klopp had won nothing. Zero, zilch, nada.\nPurists and diehard fans will argue that Klopp’s time at Liverpool is a marathon, not a sprint. He is building a dynasty and not looking for a Jose Mouriniho-style quick fix.\nBut he had been to three finals, two of them in European competitions, and won none. Liverpool also finished second place in the Premier League despite at one stage of the season leading by 10 points.\nMagpies were circling above Klopp’s house because of the amount of silver medals on display.\nBut around 4am Vietnamese time on Sunday morning, things changed. Sorry Dave, you were wrong.\nBefore Liverpool’s victory over Tottenham in Madrid, Klopp had said that he could write a book about how to win semi-finals but no one would have bought it.\nNow he can add another chapter, and I don’t think by any stretch of the imagination it will be his last.\nOn Sunday, Klopp returned to Liverpool with his team and the trophy. They then paraded their prize onboard an open-topped bus around the city and an estimated 750,000 people came out to catch a glimpse of their heroes and the silverware.\nKlopp looked like he was enjoying every single minute of the journey. He also looked a little drunk but hey, who can blame him as the weight lifted from his shoulders must have been immense. The elephant had finally been banished from the room and Klopp could, at long last, say with his trademark grin, he was a winning Liverpool manager.\nI don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say most football fans, except maybe Arsenal supporters, wanted Liverpool to lose the final.\nBut they never. They won.\nKlopp has written his name in the Liverpool record books and has joined the fab four alongside Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Rafa Benitez as managers who have won Europe’s top prize.\nPaisley won it three times in 1977, 78 and 81. The others just one a piece, but I truly believe Liverpool, and Klopp, will enjoy success in the Champions League in the future.\nFor years I’ve sounded like a broken record when I told\xa0anyone who would listen that Liverpool were a sleeping giant on the verge of waking up and dominating European football for years to come.\nIn the past I\xa0never actually believed it, I\xa0just said it for affect and to wind up fans of rivals teams I was talking too.\nBut now it feels different. Liverpool and Klopp are a match made in heaven and with solid American owners backing the manager, things are looking rosy.\nThat said, only time will tell if Liverpool will push on from this triumph and take it\xa0to the next level. There’s absolutely no reason whatsoever they shouldn’t.\nIt may have been a one-off, a fluke, and, God forbid, my pal Dave may have been right. But something tells me this time, he was wrong. — VNS'",3
2702,'Basis to believe in Vietnamese economic growth',"Nguyễn Minh Cường, ADB chief economist\nDespite lowering the economic growth forecast of Asia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) revised the Vietnamese GDP growth forecast from 6.8 per cent to 6.9 per cent for 2019 and from 6.7 per cent to 6.8 per cent for 2020.\nSpeaking to Vietnam News Agency, Nguyễn Minh Cường, principal country economist at the ADB, said there was a strong basis to believe\xa0in the Vietnamese economic development prospects in the short and medium term.\nIn the update of Asian Development Outlook 2019, the ADB downgraded Asia's economic growth forecast, but boosted Việt Nam's GDP growth forecast. On what basis did the ADB give such a promising prediction?\nThe ADB's forecast is relatively optimistic, based on the growth of domestic consumption, in addition to growth in export turnover and investment in the last 11 months, making trade growth hit a record US$11 billion.\nViệt Nam's total trade turnover may reach $500 billion or more this year.\nBesides, the ADB also looked at the dramatic improvement of the business environment in Việt Nam in recent years and found there is a tendency for foreign investors to gradually withdraw from China to seek other markets with less risks, especially in the context of US-China trade war, and Việt Nam is really an attractive destination.\nAlong with the business environment which has gradually improved, the improvement of Việt Nam's competitiveness is also very noticeable.\nTherefore, it is easy to understand why the flow of foreign direct investment into Việt Nam has been soaring sharply.\nAnother important factor is Việt Nam's stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation due to the State Bank's appropriate and flexible monetary policies, which are good support for the growth.\nThe disbursement of public investment may still be slow, but there have been a number of breakthrough measures introduced by authorities to remove bottlenecks and accelerate the progress of public investment disbursement.\nThis could facilitate wider credit room for the economy.\nThat is why the ADB is very optimistic about Việt Nam's economic growth potential with a forecast of 6.9 per cent and the growth rate will\xa0be maintained in 2020.\nThree important issues, which are business environment improvement,\xa0confidence of investors consolidation and foreign direct investment enhancement, are concerns of the Government, ministries, branches and localities, especially in the context of integration.\nHowever, there is concern about the slowdown in the reform process. Is there any basis for this anxiety and any solution to this problem?\nThe reform process in Việt Nam has been carried out very effectively. Of course, some sectors should continue to take stronger measures such as State-owned enterprises reforms because the current pace of reform in this area has not met the expectations and goals set by the State.\nAlthough the finance\xa0and banking sector has achieved many positive changes such as bad debt settlement and credit risk management under Basel II, the progress has been below expectations and there should be stronger measures, especially for handling bad debt.\nIt is also time for all bad debts that were transferred to the Việt Nam Asset Management Company (VAMC) in the past to return to banks.\nIt is expected that many debts will become bad debts like some Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects which have not been implemented yet and other projects in the field of consumption.\nHowever, there is little reason to be concerned about the reform process that Việt Nam is pursuing.\nWe all see that, besides internal factors, the driving force for reform in Việt Nam\xa0 comes from other external factors.\nLooking back, the country was under an embargo before 1986.\nIn 1996, Việt Nam normalised\xa0relations with the US and joined the ASEAN community in 1998 and immediately had to fulfill some mandatory commitments under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.\nIn 2000, Việt Nam signed a bilateral trade agreement with the US with many binding conditions, creating a strong incentive for reform in Việt Nam.\nIn 2007, Việt Nam joined the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nIn\xa02019-2020, external factors that will affect the reform process in Việt Nam are clear.\nThese include the Việt Nam's commitments when implementing the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Việt Nam - EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA).\nThe commitments under these two agreements are very deep and comprehensive in many sectors, creating conditions for opening markets, improving the business environment and promoting reform in many areas.\nTherefore, I think momentum for reform will continue\xa0next year through\xa0the commitments of the two agreements.\nIt is clear Việt Nam's reform process is heavily dependent on its commitments with the international community through externally binding institutions and legal frameworks.\nThere have been previous comments from the ADB about six bottlenecks that hinder the\xa0private sector, which are business environment, physical infrastructure, level playing field with State-owned enterprises, management institutions, corporate capacity and environmental governance.\xa0What are the solutions to help promote the strong growth of this area and how does the Government play a role to create development momentum?\nNormally, economic forecasts are only predictive of the development potential and they only talk about conditions to fulfill this\xa0potential. Similarly, when the ADB makes forecasts, it is only a forecast of growth potential, but the conditions for achieving and promoting this potential\xa0are a different matter.\nThe development of the private sector is related to a range of conditions such as institutions, business environment, competitiveness and\xa0infrastructure. However, to have a total solution to promote the growth of this region, I think the Government plays a very important role.\nAccounting for more than 96 per cent of the total number of enterprises nationwide, the private sector is very diverse; among which\xa0there are business households accounting for a very large proportion and contributing about 30 per cent of national GDP; and also many small and medium-sized businesses and large private corporations.\nOver the past decade, Vietnamese\xa0private corporations have grown tremendously. The problem here is how to ensure private corporations have strong breakthroughs for the Vietnamese economy while small and medium enterprises and household businesses continue to ensure broad and equitable development roles. This is the task the institutional and policy conditions must ensure.\nIn the current context, large private corporations are also concerned about ensuring their own competitiveness.\nAs you know, when integrating into the international economy, Việt Nam has signed many bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements, which means the country has to commit to implementing regulations to ensure a level and transparent playing field between domestic enterprises and foreign investors.\nThis means there will be no more special privileges or policies for domestic private businesses.\nTherefore, more than ever, they need to identify their strengths\xa0and weaknesses and\xa0at the same time, take\xa0advantage of opportunities to become owners of the distribution chain and participate\xa0in the distribution network\xa0for Vietnamese goods to have a foothold in the global value chain.\nAs for small and medium-sized businesses, we need only look\xa0at current conditions and regulations to assume that access to credit and finance for this area is difficult.\nIn fact, when comparing regulations of collateral, feasible business plans and many other regulations of the banking and finance industry with countries in the region and globally, they are the same as all banks have to perform the task of preserving credit and limiting the risk of bad debts.\nIn my opinion, access to finance to motivate the development of small and medium-sized businesses is not a basic problem.\nThe important thing is how enterprises absorb finance. But this comes with the management ability, and skills and qualifications of workers, businesses. —\xa0 VNS",2

But I still want to have more\xa0children and especially a son.

I had the son I wished for.”\nThe third child ratio was a problem as\xa0the city was looking to maintain a\xa0reasonably low birth rate and control\xa0the gender ratio at birth, according to Huy.\nDr Nguyễn Đình Cử, former director of the Population and Social Affairs Institute at the\xa0National Economics University, said for a long time, people thought that the imbalanced\xa0sex ratio at birth was mainly due to poor and\xa0uneducated mothers, but in fact, this is\xa0not true.\nMany rich families and well educated parents found\xa0out the sex of the babies while the mothers were pregnant and decided whether\xa0to continue the pregnancy depending on the results, generally meaning they were\xa0hoping for\xa0a boy, according to Cử.\nHà Nội Mới (New Hà Nội) newspaper reported that recent census results conducted by\xa0the General Department of Population and Family Planning at the\xa0Ministry of Health\xa0showed\xa0the lowest sex ratio at birth among\xa0illiterate mothers was\xa0about 107 boys per 100 girls.\nThis rate gradually increases to 114 boys per 100 girls among more educated mothers. In rich families, the sex ratio at birth is 112:100, while the\xa0rate in\xa0poor families is 105:100.\nThe surveys also showed the gender imbalance particularly increases among\xa0families with a third child.\nFor the first birth, the sex ratio is 109.7:100,\xa0while this rate rises to\xa0111.9:100 for\xa0the second birth. But at the third birth, the sex ratio stands at 119.7:100.\nAlthough appreciating the achievements of\xa0the city's population and family planning efforts\xa0over the years, Dr Hoàng Đức Hạnh, deputy director of Hà Nội's Health Department, said it was necessary to continue implementing measures to control the gender imbalance, particularly the third-child birthrate.\nRaising\xa0awareness of the problem and changing\xa0public attitudes was also needed to ensure families only had two children, he said.\nSupervision at all levels regarding the sex selection\xa0at health facilities, especially non-public health facilities, should also be strengthened.\nThe municipal Department of Population and Family Planning would\xa0continue\xa0to focus on communication campaigns, counselling and direct dialogue with couples of reproductive age, while\xa0supplying contraceptives, according to Huy.\nThe steering committee for population and family planning in districts and\xa0towns would\xa0also strengthen supervision in\xa0localities with a high rate of third child births.\nNguyễn Thị Ngọc Lan, deputy director general of the General Department of Population and Family Planning, said\xa0that a key solution to preventing the gender imbalance at birth was to promote gender equality and women's empowerment\xa0as well as men's participation in\xa0gender equality.\nIn particular, actions were needed to show\xa0children they are equal, whether they are boys or girls.

I’m guessing probably not.\nSo, bearing all that in mind, it is with a little trepidation that I’d like to repeat something I read this week online, that yes, was a quote, and yes, came with a picture next to it.\nIn this instance, the quote was attributed to Liverpool FC’s Senegalese striker, Sadio Mane.\nGhanaian news outlet\xa0NsemWoha.com\xa0claim he said the following: “Why would I want 10 Ferraris, 20 diamond watches\xa0or two planes? What will these objects do for me and for the world?\n“I was hungry, and I had to work in the field; I survived hard times, played football barefooted, I did not have an education and many other things, but today with what I win thanks to football, I can help my people.”\nMaybe he did say it, maybe he didn’t. But if you delve a little into the private life of the in-form striker, you will see how much of a down-to-earth, humble person he is.\nIn the past, he has donated old Liverpool shirts for children to wear in places like Malawi and has funded several projects including schools and houses in the village he used to live in as a child.\nThere have also been stories about him helping to clean the toilet at his local Mosque in Liverpool and those who have met him say he is quiet, polite and respectful – most of the good work he does takes place without being recognised or publicised.\nAfter the Africa Cup of Nations he wasn’t photographed relaxing on board a luxury yacht surrounded by a bevy of beauties and Hollywood A-listers, nor was he snapped at after-show rap parties in Miami, but instead spotted touring schools in Africa he had supported financially.\nI’d also like to talk a little about Mane’s WAG – that means wife and girlfriend for those of you who have been living in a cave for the past 10 years.\n(tumble weed rolls past)\nHe may be married, I don’t know. He may have a girlfriend but again, that’s news to me. One thing is for sure, he is not married to someone like Colleen Rooney (wife of Wayne) or Rebekah Vardy (wife of Jamie).\nFor the past week these two have been involved in a very undignified and very public spat over allegations Colleen made claiming Rebekah had sold private stories Colleen posted on her private\xa0Instagram account to newspapers in the UK.\nTwo things immediately sprung to mind after I read about their catfight. First, why would Rebekah need to sell stories to newspapers? Surely being married to a professional Premier League footballer means she is not short of a bob or two.\nAnd secondly, how can these so-called stories Colleen was sharing on social media be private? As she was, er, sharing them on social media?\nWhatever the truth of this WAG-atha Christie-esque suspense thriller, and whether or not the ‘whodunit’ finger does point in the direction of Mrs Vardy, one thing is for sure:\nI DON’T CARE.\nSorry Colleen, sorry Rebekah, but instead of getting your knickers in a twist over things the general public are not in the slightest bit bothered about, use your fame and privileged position that you are fortunate to have found yourselves in\xa0to do something good.\nAnd if you are stuck for ideas, ask your respective husbands to give Sadio a call.

5090,'Changing behaviour towards nature to keep biodiversity',"Professor Trương Quang Học. Photo vnu.edu.vn\nProfessor Trương Quang Học from Việt Nam National University’s Centre for Natural Resources and Environment Studies spoke with Nhân Dân Cuối Tuần (the People Weekend Edition) newspaper about the impacts that Việt Nam will possibly have in case of biodiversity decline and the importance of changing behaviour towards nature.\nHow do you assess the global decline in biodiversity?\nAs far as I've remember, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon emphasised the importance of giving priority to considering biodiversity issues when making decisions in all sectors. Biodiversity must be the basis for establishing other goals, not an idea that comes up after other goals have been set up.\nI think we need a new vision of biodiversity conservation to maintain a healthy planet and a sustainable future for humanity.\nIn 1993, the United Nations chose May 22 as an international day for biodiversity to raise public awareness on this issue. Biodiversity since then has been considered an essential source of providing ecological services and a source of human life.\nIn recent decades, the concept of non-traditional security has emerged, including the issue of biodiversity decline - a depleted ecological environment. If the ecosystem is like a car, then every animal and plant species act as a part of that car. Lack of any species can threaten the safety when the vehicle operates.\nSo, the relationship between humans and other plant species must be a symbiotic relationship in order to sustain life and maintain the sustainable development. For a long time, people have underestimated the role of biodiversity. It’s high time the world has to look back and put this issue in parallel with the importance of climate change.\nViệt Nam is considered one of the Southeast Asian countries rich in biodiversity and ranked 16th with the greatest biodiversity in the world. Could you tell us about the biodiversity fluctuations in recent years?\nEcosystems and biological resources play an important role in the country's economy and culture. Biotechnology contributes greatly to the national economy, which ensures food security, maintaining genetic resources of animals and plants, providing construction materials and sources of fuel and pharmaceuticals.\nPopulation growth and consumption pressures have resulted in overexploitation of biological resources. The rapid socio-economic development has changed the natural landscape. Changes of land use practices and construction of many infrastructures have reduced the area of natural habitats, fragmented ecosystems, and reduced the habitat of many wildlife species. The construction of many dams has blocked the migration routes of many fish species.\nThe rapid increase in forestation is a good sign, but it should be noted that half of the increase in forest area is planted and restored forests, so the value of biodiversity is not high. Meanwhile, the natural forest continues to be destroyed.\nForest fires, deforestation, and forest land use conversion are three elements that reduced the biodiversity. Natural forests are increasingly being destroyed. The data shows 156 forest fires have occurred in the first six months of this year, and nearly 38,300 hectares of forest has been converted for use in the period of 2012-17.\nNoticeably, 89 per cent of natural forest area was damaged during the forest land use conversion process and 11 per cent was illegally chopped down. All of the areas of the national parks and conservation parks in the country occupied only 7.5 per cent of total mainland.\nDo you think that the sense of excessive material enjoyment is among the causes of the biodiversity decline?\nI want to talk about Bhutan. It is a small country and it is not a developed one, but people are still happy and enjoy life because they know how to live with nature. They have the awareness that people should be part of the nature.\nCould you share the scenario of biodiversity loss in the future?\nAt a recent international conference on non-traditional security issues, I mentioned the scenario of biodiversity loss. Over the past 300 years, the forest on earth has decreased by 40 per cent.\nRainforests account for only 7 per cent of the area but own 70 per cent of the global biodiversity value. However, the forests have\xa0lost 80 per cent of their\xa0total area and continue\xa0to lose 0.7 per cent annually.\nPeople have used up to three quaters\xa0of the earth's resources. When the life-support system is degraded and depleted, how can people survive?\nIt will be extremely difficult to recover what we have lost. Many scientists have warned that humans will only survive until the end of this century. It might sound awful, but it would be true if people don’t change their behaviour and attitudes towards the nature. — VNS",4

The trade disputes between big economies posed uncertainties to global trade.\nThe priority would be given to enhance the production and integration capacity of the economy, he said. Reforms would continue to be hastened following commitments to FTAs to create firms ground for the country’s growth, he added.\nDeputy Minister of Industry and Trade Đỗ Thắng Hải said that close watch would be kept on the developments of the US – China trade war to raise measures to boost exports.\nHe said the prevention against trade fraud related to the origin of goods must also be enhanced, adding that improving product quality would also be important to meet requirements of the import markets.\nIn addition, forecasts and warnings on trade remedies applied to Việt Nam’s export products would be a focus, he said.\nCustoms statistics showed that Việt Nam exported goods worth $241.65 billion in January – November, while it imported $230.71 billion in the period.\nThe country’s trade revenue reached $480.17 billion in 2018. — VNS",2

It takes time to train those new workers, affecting production and business, he said.\nAnother SBIC unit in Hải Phòng, Sông Cấm Shipyard Joint Stock Company, is also short of skilled labourers as many have left to work elsewhere.\nIt currently has 930 workers and needs 100 more to meet its production capacity.\nAccording to Phan Đình Lượng, deputy director of Sông Cấm Company, the workload has increased since the company worked with Damen Shipyard Group of the Netherlands to make more types of ships. While the orders are available, there are not enough labourers to do the work.\nLeaders of shipyard companies agreed that they must ensure stable work and wages in order to keep the builders with them for a long time.\n“Workers might leave the job if their wages are paid two to three months behind schedule,” Lượng said.\nHe said that companies must not owe social, health or unemployment insurance premiums and wage payments, and also offer preferential mechanisms such as meal breaks and bonuses for high productivity.\nThe shipyard industry depends on shipbuilding and repair orders so recruitment also depends on business and production profits. The company has worked with technical schools to seek more shipbuilders. However, the supply remains limited and faces competition from the mechanical sector, Hà, Phà Rừng Company’s deputy director,\xa0said.\nHe said shipyards must step up training for workers, reorganise labour structure among departments to increase productivity, and increase wages and offer allowances for those holding important positions or skilled workers. — VNS'",1

All local people must also be able to enjoy the fruits of tourism development for what they have contributed.\nReferring to Lào Cai\'s Sa Pa as the ""town in the mist,” PM Phúc remarked that aside from world-renowned tourist attractions in coastal localities, with the huge potentials of northern mountainous provinces such as Lào Cai, Việt Nam could make a name for itself in mountain tourism globally.\nIn addition, the PM urged the province to sustainably develop local traditional industries, like the making of steel billets, cement, kaolin, and yellow phosphorus, saying the Government does not welcome investors in mining with a short-term vision, outdated technology and small-scale production that may hamper environmental sustainability while contributing little to economic growth and improving local incomes.\nHe also underlined the need to intensify prevention of illegal mineral exports and revoke inefficient mining projects.\nThe leader moved on to talk about Lào Cai’s promising agriculture, highlighting seven crops set to grow on large-scale specialised farms, including high-quality rice, specialty rice, medicinal herbs, vegetables, high-quality tea, tropical fruits, temperate fruits and flowers.\nIf advanced techniques and technologies are applied, average agricultural revenue can reach VNĐ120-150 million (US$5,160-6,450) per hectare and possibly up to VNĐ300 million per hectare or more in the next few years, he said.\nPhúc suggested Lào Cai develop agriculture on three pillars – organic and clean farming, use of high technology in production and processing, and linkages in value chains.\nHe asked the province to improve accessibility of land and information for businesses and enhance quality of business support services while investing more in vocational education and human resources quality, taking advantage of its central location on the Kunming (China)-Lào Cai-Hà Nội-Hải Phòng-Quảng Ninh economic corridor.\nThe Vietnamese Government leader also sent a message to investors, saying all investors to Lào Cai in particular and the Northwest region in general are appreciated as, in spite of this land’s great potential, local people struggle to make ends meet and infrastructure is poor in many areas.\n“Each penny from the investor, each livelihood or job created is valuable. Business aside, what matters is the thought towards the society, the country and the people,” he said.\nHe wanted the investors to honour their commitments and make a worthy contribution to the local economy, not only helping create employment but also improve incomes, productivity and social welfare for local people.\nThe event, themed ‘Lào Cai – A Destination of Success’, brought together over 500 delegates, many of whom were representatives from major groups and enterprises at home and overseas.\nLater at the conference, Lào Cai signed cooperation agreements with 11 partners, worth over VNĐ124 trillion ($5.3 billion) and presented decisions approving investment for eight projects worth VNĐ22 trillion (US$1 billion).\nThese projects are expected to commence between 2019 and early 2020.\nDuring 2004-18, Lào Cai attracted 618 domestic projects worth VNĐ93 trillion, while licencing 29 foreign-funded projects worth $574.7 million.\nStriving for top 15\nLater on Saturday,\xa0the Government leader had a meeting with the Lào Cai Government, where he asked that Lào Cai would soon\xa0to be named among top 15 developed localities in Việt Nam.\nAt the meeting, Đặng Xuân Phong, Chairman of the Lao Cai People’s Committee, informed the PM on the province’s recent socio-economic development.\nIn the first six months of 2019, its Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) grew 10.02 per cent.

2747,Moody's takes rating actions on 18 Vietnamese banks,"Moody's rating actions on the 18 banks were driven purely by the sovereign rating action, and do not reflect a weakening of the banks' standalone financial profiles. — Photo Moody's\nHÀ NỘI — Moody's Investors Service on Thursday took\xa0rating actions against 18 banks in Việt Nam, following its confirmation of Việt Nam's Ba3 sovereign rating and change of the sovereign rating outlook to negative a day earlier.\nMoody's noted its rating actions on the 18 banks were\xa0driven purely by the sovereign rating action and did\xa0not reflect a weakening of the banks' standalone financial profiles.\nThe banks include ABBank, ACB, HDBank, Vietcombank, BIDV, Liên Việt Post Bank, MBBank, NamABank, OCB, SHB, SeABank, TPBank, Agribank, VIB, VietinBank, MSB, VPBank and Techcombank.\nFor ten of the 18, Moody's has confirmed the banks' long-term local and foreign currency deposit and issuer ratings and changed the outlooks for these ratings to negative from ratings under review for downgrade.\nOf the ten banks, Moody's has confirmed the Baseline Credit Assessments (BCAs) and Adjusted BCAs of the first four banks, as well as the long-term Counterparty Risk Assessments (CR Assessments) and Counterparty Risk Ratings (CRRs) of the remaining six banks.\nFor five of the 18, Moody's has confirmed the banks' long-term foreign currency deposit ratings and changed the outlooks on the banks' long-term foreign currency deposit ratings to negative from ratings under review for downgrade.\nAt the same time, Moody's has also confirmed the long-term CR Assessments and CRRs of the remaining three banks.\nMoody's rating actions conclude Moody's reviews for downgrade of the ratings of the 18 banks, which were initiated on October 10 this year, after Moody's placed the Government of Việt Nam's Ba3 sovereign rating under review for downgrade on October 9 this year.\nViệt Nam's sovereign credit strength is a key input in Moody's ratings for Vietnamese banks, because the country's credit strength affects Moody's assessment of the government's capacity to provide support to the banks in times of stress.\nThe confirmation of the sovereign rating reflects Moody's assessment that enhanced attention by the administration on forthcoming payments of all the Government's debt obligations, direct and indirect, reduces the risk of renewed payment delays.\nThe negative outlook reflects some ongoing risk of payment delays on some of the government's indirect debt obligations, in the absence of more tangible and significant measures to improve the coordination and transparency around debt management within the administration.\nHowever, the Vietnamese Ministry of Finance (MoF) on Wednesday said Moody's decision to change\xa0the sovereign rating outlook\xa0to negative was not appropriate, given it is grounded on an isolated incident and does not adequately recognise the Vietnamese Government’s instituted policies and procedures to ensure smooth and timely debt repayment on government guaranteed borrowings.\nAccording to Moody’s, it will affirm the ten\xa0banks' ratings with a stable outlook, if Moody's affirms Việt Nam's sovereign rating at Ba3 with a stable outlook, and there are no material changes to these banks' standalone credit strength.\nFor the remaining eight banks, Moody's could upgrade their long-term ratings, if Moody's upgrades the banks' BCAs, due to a significant improvement in their credit fundamentals. — VNS",2

However, most have paid little attention to chemical management, leading to passive reactions when any incident occurs, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has said.\nThe Việt Nam Textile and Garment Association estimates that as of 2017, the number of Vietnamese textile and garment enterprises was about 7,000, with 2.7 million employees. Of which, 177 enterprises are specialised in dyeing and printing.\nThe volume of chemicals consumed in the textile and garment industry reaches\xa0nine million tons per year. The chemicals include inorganic and organic substances such as acids, alkalis, solvents and various salts.\nHowever, the management of chemicals of enterprises has remained weak.\nPhan Quỳnh Chi, deputy general secretary of the Việt Nam Textile and Garment Association, said the majority of textile and garment enterprises were small and medium-sized, so they only focused on production activities and remained lacklustre in chemical management.\nMost were only interested in this critical task when a chemical-related incident\xa0happened, she said.\nDeputy director of the Institute of Environmental Sciences Nguyễn Thị Phương Mai said textile and garment are considered the second largest polluting industry, especially dyeing.\nThe legal documents stipulated that textile and dyeing enterprises must be equipped with functional wastewater treatment systems, so wastewater must meet all the technical criteria set in legal regulations before being discharged into the environment.\nHowever, Mai said, very few companies have achieved that as most are small- and-medium-sized ones while the wastewater treatment systems must be modern and of large capacity to treat wastewater properly.\nConsequently, dyeing enterprises have been found to violate environmental regulations. Many have even violated regulations repeatedly and in the same manner.\nPangRim Neotex Company, in northern Phú Thọ Province, has been found discharging untreated wastewater into the Hồng (Red) River six times since 2010.\nDischarged wastewater contained excessive levels of pollutants such as\xa0ammonium nitrate, coliform and\xa0biochemical oxygen, which were between 6.9 and 24.7 times higher than permitted levels.\nThe company was fined more than VNĐ456 million (US$19,608) and was demanded to install automatic wastewater monitoring systems and cameras to send\xa0data to the provincial Department of Natural Resources and Environment.\nHowever, the story did not end there. In early 2018, local people of Bến Gót Ward complained about the discharge of wastewater by the company and asked it to relocate.\nMei Sheng Textiles Việt Nam Co, Ltd\xa0in the southern coastal province of\xa0Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu has been forced to halt operations seven times for illegally discharging untreated wastewater into the Đá Đen River. The river was the main water supply for 90 per cent of local residents.\nThe company was found to illegally use about 2,760cu.m of underground water and illegally build a dyeing factory with a capacity of 1,100 tonnes per year.\nIn 2017 Pacific Crystal Textiles Company in northern Hải Dương Province was asked to suspend operations for three months and fined VNĐ340 million ($14,620) by the central environment agency after a fine of VNĐ672 million ($28,896)by the local authorities.\nProduction model changed\nThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said the textile and garment industry needed to change its growth model in a sustainable way.\nThe use of recycled materials and safer chemicals for the production and the building of a response plan to chemical incidents must be a priority, it said.\nThe ministry has worked with localities to build policies on preventing and controlling pollution such as making zones for the construction and operation of dyeing factories, monitoring wastewater discharged from these factories, inspecting the transport and storage of chemicals, and updating the wastewater criteria.\nThe ministry has recently released a document on guidelines for chemical management for textile and garment enterprises in Việt Nam. It will help building and evaluating the prevention and response plan of chemical incidents, developing safer products, and enhancing the use of renewable materials, it said. — VNS'",4

In the 1980s, due to broad geostrategic calculations, the United States no longer gave the same priority to normalisation as it did in the latter half of the 1970s though its top concerns with Việt Nam remained a “full accounting” for the POW/MIAs and the Cambodian issue. An anti-Việt Nam sentiment, which was still strong in the United States, was also an obstacle. The thinking “shelving the past, looking to the future” gained more ground in the two countries in the early 1990s which paved the way for the lifting of the embargo in 1994 and establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995.\nHow has the relationship developed since then, and how has it helped Việt Nam’s development?\nThe bilateral relationship has developed quickly since the normalisation of ties.\nTrade increased more than 100 times in 2018 compared to 1995. In 2013, the two countries agreed on a comprehensive partnership with nine key areas of co-operation, including politics, economics, defense and security, science and technology, education, war legacies and humanitarian co-operation. In 2015, General Secretary of the Party Nguyễn Phú Trọng made a historic visit to the United States while every United States President since 1995 has visited Việt Nam.\nViệt Nam now has the highest number of students in the United States in ASEAN. All of these successes would have been impossible without the normalisation of ties.\nDPRK Chairman Kim Jong Un is in Hà Nội for a second summit with the US and also for a state visit to Việt Nam. How can Việt Nam share its experience in the normalisation process with the US with the DPRK?\nThe Vietnamese experiences both in economic development and normalisation with the United States have been studied by several countries. Chairman Kim Jong Un of the DPRK has expressed interest in the Vietnamese success story. Deputy Prime Minister cum Foreign Minister Phạm Bình Minh says that Việt Nam is willing to share those experiences if it is asked to by the DRPK. From a research perspective, the fact that both the United States and the DPRK chose Việt Nam as the venue for the second summit continues to show Việt Nam’s relevancy in this regard.\nWhat does it mean for Việt Nam to host such an important event?\nViệt Nam has deep experience in war and peace, and is a peace-loving country. This summit is testimony to Việt Nam’s proactive foreign policy, which promotes the country as a responsible member of the international community. Perhaps no other country would demonstrate the same level of enthusiasm to host the summit as Việt Nam. A message of peace and dialogue is consistently conveyed by Vietnamese leaders and diplomats and the summit will help to carry that message further.\nThe country’s image and profile will be raised when it comes to tourism, trade, investment and peace and security. Viet Nam will gain more confidence from the international community by resolving issues beyond its borders. Last year, Việt Nam sent a field hospital to Sudan as part of its commitment to maintaining peace with the United States.\nViệt Nam will also send another message to international friends supporting the peaceful settlement of regional and international conflicts via dialogue and negotiations.\nCan you share your expectations about the summit?\nThis summit will touch on more substantive topics compared to the first one in Singapore. The more details it has the more complicated it should be. So the two sides have to manage their expectations. Negotiations of this nature can take a long time. The Iran nuclear deal took more than 10 years. Even trade negotiations can some times span more than a decade. But taken together, the summit itself is already a success by helping sustain dialogue between the two countries. For peace-lovers in both countries and around the world, everyone should hope for the best and wish the summit a great success.—VNS'",0

Developing environmentally-friendly public vehicles will help reduce air pollution. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Many studies in Hà Nội have shown that heat inversion is one of the main causes for recent sharp rises in pollutants, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE).\nIn a report released on Wednesday, the MoNRE said that in order to comprehensively assess air quality in a certain area, it is necessary to analyse and evaluate the monitoring data of many parameters continuously on different days throughout the year.\nThe report was released after Hà Nội’s air quality has been reported at harmful levels over recent days.\nThe monitoring results showed that the air pollution is mainly dust, especially PM2.5, a single particle that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres.\nOther parameters such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone are still within permissible limits, except for some spots near roads with elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide.\nThe report said that during summer months in the rainy season, air quality is the best of the year. However, sometimes abnormal meteorological conditions led to increases in dust concentration.\nLast Monday, the PM2.5 dust concentration increased, thus air quality remained at a harmful level at air monitoring stations in the capital city.\nThe PM2.5 dust concentration reached the highest level at night and dawn last Monday, possibly because of a lack of wind limiting the circulation of pollutants, according to the report.\nIn order to explain the meteorological conditions that cause the dust concentration to increase suddenly, it is necessary to conduct further studies.\nRecent research by the Hà Nội University of Natural Resources and Environment said that heat inversion was an atmospheric phenomenon that occurred when the temperature of the upper atmosphere is greater than the temperature of the lower atmosphere.\nHeat inversion occurs at different times of the year, often with high frequency in the winter when the air is stable, the nights are long and cold air is flowing in.\nWhen heat inversion occurs, it stops the atmosphere disturbance process leaving pollutants trapped in the atmosphere.\nThis process raises the concentration of pollutants and affects human health.\nIn developing countries, many studies have shown that human health is affected by polluted air during the days of heat inversion. Heat inversion also causes acute respiratory diseases.\nThe MoNRE believes that to improve polluted air in Hà Nội, it’s necessary to limit the number of personal vehicles in the city and encourage environmentally-friendly public transportation.\nIndustrial enterprises should be moved to suburban areas and reduce waste from construction work.\nMore inspections should also be conducted on vehicles. — VNS'",4

VNA/VNS Photo Văn Điệp\nHÀ NỘI — The restructuring and streamlining of administrative apparatus and preparing the budget for the reformed salary project are key to wage reform.\nDeputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ, head of the central steering committee for reform of wage and social insurance policies, made the statement at a meeting held on Friday to review the implementation of a Party resolution on salary policy reform.\nUnder the wage plans, which take effect in 2021, the new public sector wage system will be linked to employees’ positions and grades. Employees of State-owned enterprises will enjoy pay parity with those from non-State firms.\nAccording to Huệ, the renovation of administrative apparatus and payroll streamlining will reduce its reliance on State budget and improve the effectiveness of public institutions.\nThe Government has decided to spend 40 per cent of State budget surplus and 70 per cent of budget surplus of localities for 2018-2020 period for salary reform project.\nHuệ said preparation for the implementation of the project was underway.\nFrom 2021, retirement ages will rise by three months per year for men, and four months for women.\nOther contents relating to wage issues including minimum wage and how to calculate salaries will also be revised in accordance with the amended labour code.\nPrime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has issued a directive on the implementation of special wage mechanism applicable to certain units in the State apparatus.\nThe PM allowed these units to carry out the mechanism until the end of 2020 and then exercise payment in accordance with the new wage policy from 2021, ensuring transparency of public administrative services and facilitate such activities as specialised inspections, he said\nDeputy PM Huệ said agencies and sectors would make proposals on wage policy for their civil servants, officials and armed forces while the Ministry of Home Affairs would be in charge of submitting reports on the implementation.\nViệt Nam has gone through several wage reforms in 1960, 1985, 1993 and some further adjustments in 2003.\nIn October 2017, the Party Central Committee (PCC) issued Resolution No 18 and 19 on continued reform to improve the effectiveness of public institutions.

But few tools were available to support their needs, while books in Braille are\xa0costly,” she said.\nWhile she was working, she realised that merely recording books was not the best solution because\xa0it required too much time and effort.\nAs a student with\xa0background in technology at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Trang believes there could be a big pivot with technology and disabilities.\nIn 2009, when she was a professor at HUST, Trang herself\xa0organised a project to record audiobooks for visually impaired people.\nThe wishes of the blind people she met were\xa0her motivation to start a 10-year journey working on a Vietnamese reader\xa0that features\xa0text-to-speech technology. She and her two colleagues\xa0later set up a company in 2018 and named it\xa0Vbee: Vietnamese – BE your Eyes.\nText-to-speech technology has actually been researched and used around the world for many years, and is widely applied in services such as consulting, customer interaction, smart homes and\xa0smart traffic.\nWhat makes Vbee stand out is that it is the first technology developed in Việt Nam for Vietnamese people, with Vietnamese language as the output voice, Trang said.\n“The characteristics of the\xa0Vietnamese language are complex with different accents\xa0and dialects, so it is much harder to apply the technology,” Trang said.\nThe desire to have an artificial voice with the same emotion and tone of a Vietnamese human voice is the difference that the Vbee team cares about.\n“It took us a lot of time to create a voice with an intonation that is attractive and close\xa0to the user, other than the regular reading tools that Google and Microsoft provide for the Vietnamese market,” she said.\nVbee\'s text-to-speech engine also features male and female accents from the North and South, and can be trained to learn a new language in four hours.\nIt was not an easy path for\xa0Trang and her co-workers, because the process of Vietnamese speech synthesis is a complex one.\n“We have to analyse\xa0components such as sentences, words, languages\xa0and phonemes, and\xa0identify the contextual and tonal characteristics of these components. Then we have to create a model for the duration, prosody\xa0and\xa0other acoustic parameters to generate\xa0the corresponding speech,” Trang said.\nTherefore, in addition to her\xa0knowledge of computer science, Trang also had to learn about speech processing and linguistics.\nKhúc Hải Vân, who was born blind, and an user of Vbee, said he loves\xa0the app.\n“I felt like a real person with a\xa0Vietnamese voice reading information and newspapers to me,” he said.\n“I hope Vbee will develop more useful applications\xa0that can support people like me,” he said.\nMore applications\nDuring the development of the tex-to-speech reader for the blind and visually impaired, Vbee’s leaders realised the potential of its\xa0text-to-speech engine (TTS engine)\xa0in other fields, said Hồ Minh Đức, co-founder of Vbee.\nOne of these applications is VADI, a ""virtual assistant"" for\xa0drivers.\nThe first is directions and traffic warnings. Information is collected and updated by a software development team, while people with the app can send in traffic updates themselves.\nThe second function featured on VADI is audio coverage of news and directions. Compared to similar applications, virtual assistance provides information in a natural human-like voice.\n“VADI\xa0has received very positive feedback from mobile users,” Đức said.\n“We look forward to contributing Vbee solutions using artificial intelligence to the market, helping businesses and users to have new solutions to better serve customers while saving more,” Đức\xa0said.\nTrang\xa0said although there are many text-to-speech products in the market, but with products that are tailor-made for Vietnamese people built from our TTS engine, she believed\xa0Vbee has a chance to stand out.\nIn order to apply research on a\xa0product, it takes a lot of time and effort, and she was proud that her team had\xa0overcome such periods to bring our\xa0product to the market.\nWith the advantage of experienced engineers in application research, products development, marketing and sales, Vbee is constantly updating its core products and adapting them to\xa0market needs.\n“Although there are large corporations providing the same service, the advantage\xa0Vbee has is that it can respond quickly and customise well to quickly fill the niche market,” Trang said.\nVbee will focus on completing its core solution and its smart call\xa0centre product. Other potential projects relating to text-to-speech technology in the future include an automated movie dubber,\xa0virtual MC\xa0and digitalised lectures. — VNS'",1

And it\xa0creates\xa0big data for analysis and technology development and more,” she said.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, health literacy reflects a\xa0certain level of knowledge, personal skills and confidence that allows individuals to take action and\xa0change\xa0their\xa0lifestyles and living conditions.\nDigitalisation, however, requires\xa0the ability to seek, find, understand, and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply the knowledge\xa0to addressing or solving a health problem, she added.\nUntil recently, the phrase ”digital divide” has been used to\xa0highlight the disparities that exist\xa0among\xa0the public regarding\xa0the use of mobile phones and\xa0the skills needed to manage health and healthcare in a digital world in which\xa0large groups are\xa0assumed to have been left behind, she noted.\nAn asset-based approach to understanding digital health literacy\xa0views\xa0digital tools as a means of\xa0empowerment for the patient and the public, she said.\nProfessor\xa0Kristine Sørensen from Global Health Literacy Academy in Denmark said that health literacy refers to how people access, understand, appraise and apply information technology to form judgments and make decisions regarding healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion.\nCancer literacy, for instance, is critically important for cancer patients who must make a complex set of diagnostic and treatment-based decisions at times of physical and emotional distress, she said.\nYet, it is unclear to what extent cancer literacy is reflected in cancer strategies such as the national cancer control plans, according to Sørensen.\nProfessor\xa0Paras K \xa0Pokharel of the School of Public Health & Community Medicine at the B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Nepal, said: “With the changing dynamics of the public health problems that we face, these challenges\xa0demand\xa0coordinated actions.”\nThe UN's sustainable development goals (SDGs)\xa0are interconnected and must be shared between every sector in society, he said.\nAs countries strive for\xa0universal health coverage,\xa0it is equally important to focus on social determinants of health, health policies and health literacy, Pokharel said.\n“While we continue to\xa0discuss\xa0health policies and social determinants, there is a lack of discussion at the national level\xa0on the challenges of a health literacy approach to\xa0implement\xa0universal health care, about using health literacy to solve problems, and about the appropriate tools and strategies of health literacy, as well as\xa0the\xa0pertinent issues in which\xa0a health literacy approach can make an\xa0impact,” he said.\nIn such a backdrop, discussion is needed\xa0on how countries can remove\xa0barriers to health literacy and eventually leap forward to attain universal health coverage, he added.\nA health-literate health-care organisation includes\xa0leadership engagement, workforce preparation, a shame-free environment, plain language writing and design principles, clear oral communications and checks on understanding\xa0involving the populations served, and\xa0the need for health literacy in high risk situations, according to experts at the conference.\nThe conference was held by Thủ Đức District Hospital in co-operation with the Asian Health Literacy Association. — VNS",1

Doctors there said there was no hope. We were desperate at the time, and thought he would die. I am happy now knowing that my son will be discharged soon,” said Điển.\n“Before the operation, he was just 41kg. Now he weighs 47kg and has started talking and eating normally,” she added.\nAccording to Nguyễn Hữu Ước, director of Việt Nam-Germany Hospital’s Cardiac and Thoracic Center, post-surgical conditions of organ transplants can be complicated, especially lung transplants as there are many issues including infection control, respiratory care and graft rejection prevention.\nIn K’s case, his condition stabilised after just 6 weeks of intensive care.\n“He will need to have post-surgical examinations to help the new lungs rehab,” said Ước.\nThe success had encouraged doctors to perform further organ transplants in the future, he added.\nIn mid-December 2018, Việt Nam-Germany Hospital doctors performed their first lung transplant on a 17-year-old person suffering from final-stage connected tissue disease – a rare form of lung cancer - and severe multiple-organ failure.\nƯớc said the operation was technically successful.

MEATDeli, Masan MEATLife's chilled meat brand, delivered VNĐ69 billion in the third quarter, four times higher compared to the second quarter of this year. Photo courtesy of Masan Group\nHCM CITY – Masan Group has reported its net profit in the third quarter this year soared to VNĐ2.23 trillion (US$96 million), a three-fold increase against the same period last year.\nThe jump was driven by a financial gain of nearly VNĐ1.65 trillion ($71 million) from the settlement of an international arbitration case between Núi Pháo Mining Processing Company (NPMC) and Jacobs E&C.\nThe Australian subsidiary of Jacobs Group completed the payment of $130 million to\xa0NPMC, a subsidiary of Masan Resource. The one-time settlement helped triple Masan Group’s net profit after tax post-minority interest (NPAT Post-MI) to VNĐ2.23 trillion from VNĐ748 billion earned in the same period\xa0last year.\nConsolidated net revenue of the group in the last three months was down 2.2 per cent to VNĐ8.97 trillion.\nEnding September, Masan Group’s total net revenue decreased slightly 0.9 per cent to nearly VNĐ26.38 trillion ($1.13 billion) from VNĐ26.63 trillion in same time 2018.\nHowever, the nine-month NPAT Post-MI reached VNĐ4.11 trillion ($176.4 billion), up 8.7 per cent year-on-year.\nThe decline in revenue\xa0was attributed to lower pig feed sales due to African swine fever which killed around 20 per cent of Việt Nam’s pig population. In addition, revenue\xa0of Masan Resources, one of its big subsidiaries, also fell due to depressed tungsten prices and no copper sales.\nAccording to the company, tungsten prices had\xa0climbed back up to $225-245 per MTU from\xa0$180-195,\xa0and Masan Resources expected\xa0to sell copper stock in the last quarter.\nMeanwhile, strong growth of Masan MEATLife (MML) and Masan Consumer Holdings (MCH) contributed significantly to Masan Group’s profit.\nMEATDeli, MML’s chilled meat brand, delivered VNĐ69 billion in the third quarter, four times higher compared to the second quarter of this year. As of September, monthly net revenue had\xa0increased by 31 per cent since June 2019.

The company expects to expand its network to 650+ by year-end, only trailing Bách Hóa Xanh and VinMart.\nThe company will broaden its meat portfolio with chilled processed meat innovations in November. Processed meat will be a key growth driver following the success of Masan Consumer’s processed meat category, which grew two times compared to 2018.\nMML is planning to list on the Unlisted Public Company Market (UPCoM) in the last quarter of this year.\nMeanwhile, Masan Consumer Holdings is investing in sales and SG&A to launch innovations and drive medium term growth.

Its operation is advanced and the price of solar panels is quite reasonable,” chairman of the Kizuna JV Corporation’s board of directors, Đoàn Hồng Dũng, said.\nThe Government has a policy to support and buy solar electricity at higher prices, about 9.25 US cents per KWh, he said.\n“We will consider investment in solar power panels at the remaining two factories or work with solar power solution providers to lease the factories’ roofs,” he said\nDemand for solar power has increased sharply, so many power companies are renting the rooftops of citizens or leasing solar power systems.\nFor example, TTC Green Energy Investment Joint Stock Company (TTC Energy) is negotiating with several partners to lease 18 MW of rooftop solar power systems.\nThe company targets leasing 45 MW this year, much higher than the rate of 12 MW in previous years.\nVNG Corporation and enterprises at Tân Thuận EPZ and some supermarkets in HCM City are among the company’s first customers leasing solar power systems.\nPhạm Trọng Quý Châu, director of the TTC Energy, said the company will sell the electricity generated from solar panels to the tenant at a price at least 10 per cent less than the national retail electricity price.\nDepending on purposes of trading or production, the leasing contract period may last for six to seven years or longer. After the contract expires, the lessor will hand over the entire system to the tenant to continue to use the system, he said.\nThe useful life of solar panels is 20 to 25 years.\nThe solar power rental service is used by businesses only. There are still legal barriers for use by households.\n“Our service is in the process of developing.

5183,'Việt Nam should be proactive in coping with natural disasters',"'Heay rain causes flood in Thái Nguyên Province. – VNA/VNS Photo Quân Trang\nHÀ NỘI – As a country highly exposed to droughts, floods and landslides, Việt Nam needs more active prevention instead of just a passive response.\nThat was the message from a workshop held in Hà Nội yesterday Entitled “Natural Disaster Management for Sustainable Development”.\nIts aim is to share knowledge and expertise with policy makers, universities, research institutions and international development partners, industry and private partners on issues relating to natural disasters.\nNguyễn Quốc Phi, from Hà Nội University of Mining and Geology, said the study conducted by him and his students showed landslides are frequent in the North and North Central Provinces.\nFrom 2010 to 2016, at least 577 lives were lost due to landslides. As well as loss of lives and structural damage, landslides damaged agricultural land and roads, causing economic disruption.\nPhi said the community had most to gain if they can reduce the impact of disasters by effectively using their capacities.\nMatthieu Kervyn, from the Free University of Brussels in Belgium, agreed, saying a scarcity of reliable data had hampered effective disaster risk reduction.\nThat was the reason why the Brussels cooperated with Vietnamese partners in developing a network of geo-observers.\nThe geo-observer network has been piloted in Uganda. It demonstrated that local people are valuable assets in collecting data on their environment through knowledge on their environment and direct access to the field.\n“The establishment of a geo-observer network in Việt Nam will be objective to decision-making of local authorities,” he told Việt Nam News.\n""The involvement of local stakeholders during the data collection period makes the database more complete.”\nHe also said a pilot project would be implemented soon to build capacity for disaster management for the mountainous region of Hòa Bình Province’s Đà Bắc District which is considered a hot spot of landslide. Analysis of climate change impact, consideration of increased risk and vulnerability as well as actions for capacity building, awareness raising and infrastructure works were all topics on the table.\nRegarding technology solutions, Lê Quang Tuấn, deputy director of the Department of Science Technology and International Cooperation under Việt Nam Disaster Management Authority, said the application of new technology would be a big help.\nFly cams are currently used to monitor, survey and access areas affected by natural disasters. It is transmitting detailed images for data.\n“In cases of serious flooding like the one in Hà Nội’s Chương Mỹ District in April last year, using mobile dykes will not only prevent overflow but help save human resources and time,” he said.\nThe mobile dyke, which was produced by Tân Đại Hưng Joint Stock Company in collaboration with AquaDam Inc from the US, has been tested in Nam Định Province recently and proved to be effective.\n“The department has been developing an app to let people know if they are in a dangerous area,” he said.\nTuấn said challenges the department faced included limitations in protecting coastal banks in the Mekong Delta due to lack of sand and water and there is no mechanism for mobilisation of the private sector in the application of new science and technology.\nThe lack of equipment and lack of investment to synchronise specialised monitoring and warning systems were also a problem, he said.\nThe workshop was organised by the Belgium Embassy in close collaboration with Việt Nam Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources (VIGMR) and Free University of Brussels. — VNS'",4

Two Chinese companies which produce components for the bestselling earphones are looking to expand production in Vietnam. Photo AFP\nHÀ NỘI — Apple’s bestselling wireless earphones, AirPods, could be soon manufactured in Việt Nam, as component suppliers look to expand away from their production hubs in China.\nThe news was reported by theinformation.com.\nThe two suppliers, Luxshare Precision and Goertek, are seeking funding to begin moving some of the manufacturing process to Việt Nam, amid ongoing trade tensions between China and the US. One of the firms started trialling production earlier this year, but as the trade war rumbles on with no sure sign of settling, the companies are ramping up efforts towards the move.\nApple is trying to diversify its supply chain while continuing to shift manufacturing outside of China.\nSince launching in 2016, Apple’s AirPods have dominated the wireless headphone market, selling in the millions and reaching a 60% market share. The latest versions of the product, the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro, have proved a Christmas hit, remaining sold out at many stores and forcing the tech giant to ramp up production to meet demand. Global shipments of all wireless earbuds are\xa0forecast to surge from 48 million pairs in 2018 to 129 million pairs by 2020, according to Counterpoint.\nApple’s audio factory in northern Việt Nam has long made the company’s wired earbuds, but this marks the first time the plant will take on the wireless variety.\nAccording to a report by Nikkei earlier this year, Apple is exploring the consequences of sourcing 15\xa0to 30 per cent of its output\xa0outside of China, as cost advantages start to dwindle. Việt Nam is seen as a natural alternative to China, thanks to its proximity and low cost of highly-skilled labour. Other tech firms like Samsung have long-established presences in the country.\n""Many tech players are relocating or increasing production [in Việt Nam] to avoid tariffs, given that it is close to China, and has a relatively complete supply chain compared with other Southeast Asian countries,"" said Karen Ma, an analyst at Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research Institute.\nLuxshare Precision and Goertek have seen strong growth thanks to the \u200crunaway success of the AirPods\u200c, with their stock tripling this year.\xa0— VNS'",2
4155,'Footballers are human after all',"'PASSION: Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling was a little miffed after his side was beaten by Liverpool. — AFP/VNA Photo.\nDespite many thinking to the contrary, professional football players are really, after all, just like everyone else. They are human beings.\nSure, their bank balances may well contain more naughts than you will find at a tic-tac-toe convention, but if you cut them open, they bleed the same blood as you and I (although chances are they will be treated for said cut at a five-star private medical facility).\nTowards the end of the so-called Premier League decider last Sunday (checks diary, yes it is still only November), Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling and Liverpool’s Joe Gomez were involved in an on-field spat.\nRaheem, a super-talented footballer, was clearly miffed at his side’s performance as they trailed Liverpool by three goals to one as the match was in its closing stages.\nIt was typical footballer bust-up. Handbags at ten paces.\nCity were rightly or wrongly upset some of the close decisions didn’t go their way and probably left Anfield feeling somewhat aggrieved.\nSeeing Sterling go head-to-head (or rather head-to-chest) with Gomez did remind me of what it would look like if Napoleon ever squared up to LeBron James. It was a mismatch to say the least.\nBut after their 10-second showdown, and after the final whistle blew, it seemed all was well in the world as the two players embraced post-match.\nHow wrong could one be.\nFast forward a few days when the two came face-to-face once again, this time on international duty, it appears Sterling was still at boiling point, and him and the Liverpool defender had to be pulled apart once more.\nSterling, who has been dropped by England coach Gareth Southgate for the next fixture, has since apologised for his actions.\nPersonally, I quite like what Sterling did.\nWhile I’m not for one minute condoning violence in the workplace, I do think he showed his human side and has rightly apologised since.\nSterling gets dog’s abuse wherever he plays.\nWhether enduring God-awful racist abuse while on England duty, or being lambasted at every touch of the ball at Anfield as he was a former player, the knives are certainly out when the Jamaican-born footballer plies his trade.\nI like him. I think he is an amazing talent and while I would have loved if he was still wearing the red of Liverpool, I totally get why he left in 2015.\nAt the time, Liverpool were a pale imitation of the team they are today, and since he left for Manchester, Sterling has won more Premier League titles than\xa0Steven Gerrard ever did.\nAt the time it was a good move. Liverpool did okay from it as well, getting oodles of cash for a player that cost very little.\nFrom now until he hangs up his boots, he will always be hated when he plays Liverpool, but that’s par for the course.\nI thought on Sunday he was City’s best player, certainly the one who cared the most, and obviously the one who had the most to lose.\nWhat happened with him and Joe Gomez is now in the past.\nEngland coach Southgate has clearly decided the best course of action is to punish the striker by dropping him for the next match, but after he took to Instagram to offer his apologies, I think he should be recalled.\nYes, England lead the group and Euros qualification is all but assured, however at the same time he is probably the country’s best player. So in my mind, play him.\nWelsh firebrand Craig Bellemy reportedly attacked his Liverpool teammate John Arne Riise with a golf club after the two had a bust-up before a match against Barcelona.\nBoth players played in the game, both players scored. Liverpool won by two goals to one.\nYes, footballers can often be seen as arrogant buffoons who think they are the bee’s knees, but at the end of the day they are just like everyone else.\nEveryone else, that is, who don’t\xa0own a Ferrari. — VNS'",3

Shrimp is one of the country’s major farm exports.\nTrương Đình Hoè, General Secretary of Việt Nam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP), said that Việt Nam’s shrimp exports surpassed Thailand in 2013, attaining an export turnover of US$3.1 billion, compared with Thailand’s US$2.3 billion.\nIn 2017, Việt Nam had shrimp export turnover of US$3.8 billion, double Thailand’s shrimp exports of\xa0 US$1.9 billion, said Hoè.\nTo reach the target of shrimp export value of US$10 billion for 2025 (as instructed by the Prime Minister), shrimp breeding firms have mobilized capital to expand areas under shrimp breeding and ensure shrimp quality and safety, allowing for traceability of produce to meet consumption demand.\nSao Ta Foods Joint Stock Company has announced that it would offer more than 8 million shares priced at VNĐ25,000 each. With the offer, Sao Ta is expected to attain stakes of about VNĐ200 billion (US$8.7 million).\nA spokesman from Sao Ta Foods said that capital mobilisation is expected to help the joint-stock firm become less reliant on bank loans, while ensuring sufficient capital for the firm’s production and business activities.\nHe said all the sales of shares from Sao Ta Foods will be spent on purchasing materials and the expansion of shrimp breeding ponds.\nBy the end of the third quarter, Sao Ta’s 200 ha of shrimp breeding ponds had supplied 10 per cent of shrimp used as materials for the company’s processing lines. Sao Ta had to purchase the remaining 90 per cent from shrimp breeders in the market.\nTo reduce the volume of shrimp used for its production line purchased from the market, the company has unveiled plans to invest VNĐ100 billion to expand shrimp breeding ponds from the existing 200ha to 400ha in 2020 and to 800 ha in 2025, raising the ratio of the volume of shrimp supplied from the company’s breeding pond networks to 30 per cent.\nSimilarly, Minh Phú Seafood Corporation has sold 35.1 per cent of its shares to Mitsui & Co Ltd. for 17 billion yen (about US$155 million), making Mitsui & Co the biggest shareholder of Minh Phú Seafood.\nLê Văn Quang, chairman of Minh Phú Seafood Corp.’s management board, said the company would further invest in production facilities in the Mekong province of Cà Mau.\nQuang said the company would also apply more advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), in aquaculture and seafood production and processing in the near future, aiming to cut 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the company’s labour force, and at the same time increase profits.\nAccording to a spokesman for Sao Ta Foods, to reach a partnership with global shrimp supply chains, local shrimp suppliers must meet high standards.\nHe said that most global shrimp supply chains require not only production and manufacturing traceability but also ASC standards for aquaculture, the highest standards for aquaculture.\nTo attain ASC standards for aquaculture, aqua-breeding enterprises must have strong financial capacity for investment in big breeding facilities that help to reduce breeding costs, he added. — VNS'",2

VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Chinh\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam must continue to improve on its Law on Enterprises,\xa0experts and researchers said at a law conference in Hà Nội yesterday.\nThe business code, since its formation in 1999 and two major reforms in 2005 and 2014, still has numerous shortcomings and limitations, according to the experts.\nCompliance costs – expenses incurred to keep up with industry\xa0regulations – remained high. Notably, decreases in compliance, if any, were often results of Government directives or reform programmes when what the country desperately needs is a framework to reduce such costs systematically, said Dr Nguyễn Đình Cung, former head of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and member of the Economic Council under the Prime Minister.\nMinistries and agencies tend to over-regulate the business sector, especially firms specialised in legal services, finance and banking. Technical barriers often proved to be significant hurdles to starting operations in such fields. Level of policy risk and legal complication remained high. Businesses often found themselves without reliable means to protect their legitimate interests, said CIEM’s former head.\nMinistries were slow to push for legal reforms thanks to both red tape and a lack of incentives.\n“One cannot expect changes to come from within the ministries. If what we are hoping for are swift legal reforms we must find the strength to push for them in the private sector,” said Cung.\nOn the other hand, according to Cung, the law has been getting more lax when it comes to State-owned-enterprises (SoEs). Regulatory oversights and poor law-enforcement have resulted in many SoEs being unable to establish an efficient management framework or fail to adhere to good management practices.\nPhạm Đức Trung, head researcher of CIEM’s business reform and development, said the country has been struggling with the implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 39 principles for corporate governance as a standard for business management.\nFor example, the State has yet to define its strategy and function in many SoEs even after the formation of the Committee for Management of State Capital at Enterprises – a central body responsible for the management of a massive amount of assets owned by the State in SoEs.\nA lack of autonomy has resulted in SoEs being unable to adopt modern management standards because SoEs cannot make important decisions without approval from\xa0the State, Trung said.\nTrung called for greater autonomy be granted to SoEs along with accountability for their performance. The State must build a system of performance criteria for SoEs to follow and they must be made to publicise financial information and their management board selection.\xa0— VNS",2
3692,'Overlaps\xa0in legal system create difficulties for property businesses',"'Overlaps in legal documents are a hindrance to the development of construction projects.\xa0Photo cafeland.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Overlapping legal documents are a major obstacle in need of removal to help construction and the development of housing projects.\nĐỗ Viết Chiến, general secretary of the Việt Nam Real Estate Association, said enterprises face inconsistencies in regulations on investment procedures and approval of development projects between the Investment Law and Housing Law.\nTherefore, it is necessary to unify procedures on approval of investment in housing and new urban development projects under the law on housing and new urban areas with procedures on granting investment registration certificates.\n“The Construction Law is being revised according to three policy groups: reform and simplification of administrative procedures; simplification and abolishment of business conditions; and review of the legal system and synchronisation of laws,” Hoàng Hải, head of the Ministry of Construction’s southern representative office, said.\nThe amended law is more open and in sync with international regulations, according to Hải. Việt Nam has combined procedures for design appraisal with construction licensing procedures for projects using capital from non-budget sources. This combination may lead to abolishment of the construction licence. This means simplifying licensing procedures.\nVõ said the State should review any loopholes in the legal documents. Then, the State should issue a decree on supplementary regulations and submit it to the National Assembly Standing Committee for approval. This decree should focus on unifying regulations for an investment project.\n“Ten years ago, the National Assembly had to amend and supplement a number of articles related to basic construction investment in 2003-05, including the Construction Law, the Bidding Law, the Enterprise Law, the Land Law and the Housing Law, to solve a number of conflicts,” Võ said.\nToday, there are more conflicts, including the 2014 Construction Law, the 2009 Urban Planning Law, the 2014 Housing Law, the 2014 Real Estate Business Law, the 2013 Bidding Law, the 2013 Land Law, the 2014 Law on Environmental Protection and the Civil Code 2015, according to Võ.\nThis leads to congested investment activities, interrupted production and service value chains, and a decline in real estate supply.\nThe main cause of the overlaps in the current legal system is the inefficient method of law building. The process of building and appraising laws, decrees and circulars does not take advantage of the opinions of legal experts. Therefore, it is difficult to find conflicts.\nSince the beginning of 2019, the real estate market has shown signs of slowing down. The private real estate business sector is growing, but faces many challenges and risks that need to be removed for its healthy and sustainable development.\nMany ministries, sectors and localities have solutions for real estate businesses but there are still many risks, especially in legal documents.\nThe legal document system for business activities is still unreasonable. According to a review by VCCI of a number of related laws in the real estate sector, such as the Housing Law and the Real Estate Business Law, there are up to 20 policy conflicts. Circulars in the real estate sector had overlaps and contradictions, Vũ Tiến Lộc, chairman of Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), said at a conference held by the Business Forum Newspaper and the Press Center in HCM City.\nLê Hoàng Châu, chairman of the HCM City Real Estate Association, said the real estate market in HCM City faced difficulties due to policies. Projects had been halted because of overlaps in the laws. About 170 projects had been approved for investment but could not be implemented due to legal problems.\nTo develop a project, a business took a total of 10 years, including five years of site clearance, three years of preparing investment capital and two years of construction. So, the State should have policies to reduce those difficulties for property businesses. - VNS'",2

Viet Nam Corporation.\nThe company instructed the farmers in the entire farming process, from building ponds and installing equipment to oxygenating the ponds, breeding density and feeding method.\nThe farmers bred white-legged shrimp on a total of 150ha of ponds and had a yield of 50 – 55 tonnes per hectare per crop. The model offered an income of VNĐ2 billion (US$86,200) per hectare per crop, 10 times the income from the industrial farming model.\nAccording to Phan Văn Hận, who now breeds white-legged shrimp on an area of 3,200sq.m under the model in Cầu Ngang District’s Mỹ Long Nam Commune, his farm has a density of 178 shrimp per square metre.\nThe model requires farmers to have a large breeding area and make a large initial investment in infrastructure of VNĐ3 billion ($130,000) per hectare.\nThe model requires ponds for breeding shrimp and treating wastewater, anti-sunlight nets to cover the ponds and plastic sheets to cover their beds and equipment for pumping oxygen and feeding the shrimp.\nTrịnh Thị Loan, an agricultural expert in Mỹ Long Nam, has bred white-legged shrimp on 1.5ha under the model for two years and earned a large income.\nThe model is sustainable since the ponds are covered with plastic sheets to prevent the spread of disease pathogens from soil, according to Loan.\nThe covering also helps farmers proactively control the quality of water used for raising the shrimp.\nThis year she expects to harvest around 100 tonnes of shrimp in two crops and earn VNĐ5 billion ($216,000).\nPhạm Minh Truyền, director of the province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the model had been expanded to nearly 400ha this year.\nIt would be a basis for the province to develop its shrimp industry and increase exports to high-demand markets like the US and EU, he said.\nThe province has identified shrimp, rice, vegetables, tra fish, and coconuts as its key agricultural produce.\nPotential\nBeing a coastal province, Trà Vinh has large potential for aquaculture with 95,000ha suitable for aquaculture, especially brackish-water and saltwater shrimp farming.\nThe province has 24,000ha of brackish water and saltwater ponds to farm shrimp, including 7,000ha under intensive and semi-intensive farming, and produces 35,000 tonnes annually.\nBut the average income from shrimp farming is only VNĐ100 – 150 million ($4,300 – 6,500) per hectare per year since most farms areas are small and do not use advanced techniques, according to the department.\nUnder a plan to restructure aquaculture in 2017 - 25, the province seeks to expand its shrimp farming area to 27,000ha and annual output to 87,000 tonnes next year.\nIt also plans to expand shrimp output by 5.3 per cent a year in 2021- 25.\nTo meet the targets, the province will expand its shrimp farming area and adopt advanced techniques to produce high-quality shrimp while also safeguarding the environment.\nĐồng Văn Lâm, chairman of the province People’s Committee, said both domestic consumption of and export demand for shrimp were high and steady, and so farmers would not need to worry about selling their produce.\nThe People’s Committee had instructed all relevant agencies to assist shrimp farmers in terms of infrastructure and farming processes, he said.\nThe Department of Agriculture and Rural Development should zone efficient shrimp farming areas and strictly monitor them to adequately support farmers, he said.\nThe province will prioritise implementation of 25 projects at a cost of VNĐ3 trillion ($130 million), including in infrastructure like irrigation, power and transport for breeding brackish and saltwater shrimp, according to the People’s Committee.\nIt will offer incentives to investors to produce and process shrimp. – VNS'",1

On the economic development front, Vietnamese entrepreneurs are playing perhaps the most important role today, especially in realising the objective to transform Việt Nam into a modern industrial country by 2030 and a developed country by 2045.\nVietnamese entrepreneurs, as a major economic driver, must work together with the Party and the State to improve the country's\xa0business environment, policy-making capacity and national competitiveness. In order to make it happen,\xa0the Central Economic Committee has started an initiative\xa0to encourage\xa0Vietnamese entrepreneurs to participate in the\xa0policy-making process.\nI strongly urge each and every business to join the initiative as policy reform and business improvements are two crucial objectives that often go hand in hand. More than 30 years after đổi mới reforms, Việt Nam fields over 700,000 licensed businesses and millions of individual business households. The next step is for Vietnamese businesses to aim for greater innovation, to achieve sustainable development and to meet social responsibilities.\nWhat are Vietnamese businesses' shortcomings and limitations?\nI think our economy has a sufficient number of businesses compared to other economies in the Southeast Asian region. Our problem is quality. Top Vietnamese entrepreneurs, who can effectively compete\xa0on a global level, are few.\nA report on business management capacity among ASEAN listed companies ranked\xa0Việt Nam in 6th place. Ours are also reported as average in similar rankings by the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. This points to limited productivity, even among ASEAN countries, and numerous issues yet to be resolved in order to provide our businesses with much-needed support for growth.\nHow can Việt Nam approach the mentioned\xa0issues?\nThe most pressing issue at the moment is how to strengthen and improve Vietnamese businesses in a comprehensive manner. The\xa0focus of Việt Nam's national programme on business development must make a shift to increase\xa0quality, rather than just increase the number of businesses.\xa0Sustainable development and digitalisation are two important objectives for business development and must be integrated into each business’s growth strategy.\nViệt Nam's draft\xa0Law on Enterprises, which is to be submitted to the National Assembly for review this month, prioritises business management improvement and increasing transparency, especially in micro-businesses and business households.— VNS",2

Phúc also mentioned the case of Ba Vàng Pagoda in Quảng Ninh Province, where tens of thousands of worshippers paid up to thousands of dollars each to have their “bad karma” removed.\n“Is this alarming? What are the responsibilities of the education ministry and localities when it comes to school violence?” Phúc said.\n“Ministries and authorities need to address this issue so it does not lead to public outcry.

DOVECO is one of the country’s leading businesses in processing exported food.\nAccording to PM Phúc, besides traditional knowledge about water, fertiliser and stocks, Việt Nam’s agriculture sector needs to focus on technology, a decisive factor in improving productivity and competitiveness.\nThe PM mentioned automated robots, big data, information and communication technology, the Internet of Things, cloud computing and 3D printing, among others.\nDOVECO is a typical example of switching from a farm to a joint stock company and applying technology in production. The company has not only created networks among farmers but also fostered co-operation between localities nationwide to produce various types of products, according to the Prime Minister.\nThis is a successful agricultural model in which farmers’ benefits are ensured and land management proves efficient.\n“Smart agriculture, along with a digital economy, can be a strategic driving force to help Việt Nam become an upper-middle income economy by 2035 and create an equal, sustainable and culturally rich society in rural areas,” he said.\nPM Phúc highlighted the important role of agriculture, farmers and rural areas, and urged relevant ministries to create favourable conditions to make changes in the sector, aiming at massive production not only to meet demand of nearly 100 million of Vietnamese people but also to boost exports. — VNS'",0

It also shows\xa0the growing stature and prestige of Việt Nam in the international arena.\nHe noted it is a great honour for Việt Nam to become a non-permanent member of the UNSC, affirming the country’s foreign policy. However, it is also a heavy responsibility that requires Việt Nam to make utmost efforts to fulfil the tasks assigned by the international community.\nViệt Nam has been implementing a consistent foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, multilateralisation and diversification of foreign relations, and active global\xa0integration; being a friend, trustworthy partner and responsible member of the international community; and promoting the compliance with the UN Charter and international law, thereby actively contributing to global joint efforts for peace, cooperation and development, he said.\nThe Party and State leader added with the new resolve, strong belief in the whole Party and people’s strength and will, efforts and smooth, effective coordination among all-level authorities, ministries and sectors, along with the people’s support, Việt Nam will successfully play its role as a non-permanent member of the UNSC, deserving its position as a trustworthy partner for sustainable peace.\nActive contributions\nPrime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc wrote an article entitled “Partnership for sustainable peace: Việt Nam stands ready to make active contributions to international efforts for global peace, security, development and progress” after the election.\nWhen joining the UNSC for the first time in the 2008-09 tenure, Việt Nam, with the support of UN members, successfully fulfilled its assigned tasks in line with international law and the UN Charter, helping to ease tensions and promoting cooperation and settlement of peace and security issues in many regions across the world, PM Phúc wrote.\nWith a foreign policy of peace, independence, self-reliance, multilateralisation and diversification of international relations, Việt Nam has actively joined important multilateral organisations and forums such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and successfully hosted significant international events, including most recently the APEC Year 2017 and the World Economic Forum (WEF) on ASEAN 2018.\nThe country has also actively participated in UN peacekeeping operations, successfully deployed a level-2 field hospital to South Sudan for the UN peacekeeping mission in October 2018, and successfully hosted the second DPRK-USA Summit in February 2019, gradually upholding its role as a mediator in regional and global peace and security issues.\nOver more than three decades of comprehensive reform and global integration, Việt Nam’s annual gross domestic product has grown by 6.67 per cent on average, rising to 7.08 per cent last year, the PM wrote.\nViệt Nam was among few countries to fulfil the UN millennial development goals 2015 ahead of schedule, especially the goal regarding poverty reduction, according to the article.\nThe country also formed strategic and comprehensive partnerships with 28 countries around the world, including all five permanent members of the UNSC.\nAmid the fourth industrial revolution, the emergence of nationalism and populism, and geo-political competition among major countries, the UN faces both challenges and opportunities, the PM wrote, adding that the UN needs to urge all countries, especially small- and medium-sized nations, to rally resources and seek long-term solutions to present global challenges.\nDuring the first year of serving as UNSC non-permanent member, Việt Nam will also take over the role as ASEAN Chair 2020, enabling the country to boost ties between the UN and regional and sub-regional organisations, including ASEAN, he wrote.\nThe PM expressed his belief that with experience from its 2008-09 tenure, Việt Nam is ready to do its best to successfully undertake the role of a UNSC non-permanent member for the 2020-21 term, towards becoming a partner for sustainable peace.\nAccording to UN Resident Coordinator in Việt Nam, Kamal Malhotra, with the election to the UNSC, Việt Nam will have more opportunities to prove its ability and play an important role in regional and global events.\nApart from fully participating in 1,500 meetings of the UN Security Council, Việt Nam actively got involved in all matters and in all stages of work in the council, through making speeches, joining in negotiations, contributing to the drafting of resolutions and documents, and serving as chair and vice chair of some sub-committees of the council.

Today that number is around a dozen, and Ngọc is not one of the lucky ones.\n“I did think I could work here until retirement,” said the married father-of-two. “But now I have no choice. I need to find a new job.”\nThống Nhất Match company has a long history in Việt Nam. After the end of the war with France, it was the first factory built in the country’s north.\nFor more than six decades the company has produced countless books of matches. Next year they will scale down operations and produce less and less, concentrating instead on lighters.\nAnd with more and more people quitting smoking, the need for matches and lighters is burning away.\nNguyễn Hưng, the firm’s general director and chairman of the board said: “Currently, Thống Nhất can sell 70 million to 80 million packages of matches per year. With that amount, we need only few workers.”\nIn the past, one of the indicators when valuing a company was determined on its history. However earlier this month, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) removed that criteria.\nFor companies like Thống Nhất Match Company\xa0which has a long and valued history, removing this should not cause problems as the value of a business is much more than just its history, but experts believe companies need to up their game.\nBranding expert Mibrand Lại Tiến Mạnh, CEO of Mibrand, feels businesses need to move with the times, and those that rest on their laurels, could have problems.\n“Though traditional branding is a valuable intangible asset, it is not an important factor in valuing an enterprise,” Manh told Việt Nam News.\n“Thống Nhất firm still has chance to take advantage of its being well known in the lighter making if they know how to do branding.”\nManh believes the story of Thống Nhất Match Company is not unique. But other companies have moved with the times and found themselves heading in a different, and more profitable, direction.\nSince last year, Hà Nội Soap (Haso) has been rebuilding its brand-name and is now known as Power. In the past, the firm concentrated in outsourcing for Unilever instead of maintaining its own soap brand.\nSince 2017, seeing the potential loss of the brand, Haso came back to grow its own products. Haso’s director Đỗ Huy Lập said: “Haso produces 40,000 tonnes of washing liquid and 6,000 tonnes of soap per year, serving the rural market.\n“The firm will launch other new products to meet more demands and serve more customers.”\nBut these changes will not happen overnight. Right now, Haso employs just 10 per cent of its capacity, but Lập hopes that by 2024, they will be back to 100 per cent.\nLập’s firm now only employs 10 per cent of its capacity. He said Haso will try to run its 100 per cent capacity by 2024.\nGarment 10 Corporation is among the few businesses taking advantage of their history.

However, individuals and organisations can purchase them and resell at a higher price. Some books even are sold for several million đồng. A large amount of State assets is seriously wasted, causing a loss for the country’s precious knowledge resources,” he said.\nTrần Văn Túy, head of the NA Standing Committee’s Commission for NA Members’ Affairs, said some libraries are located at communal peoples’ committees, which are not always open and accessible to the public.\nMany books remained unopened, even though they were sent to the library a long time before.\nPresenting an assessment report on the draft law, Phan Thanh Bình, chairman of the NA Committee for Culture, Education, Youth and Children, said after 18 years of implementation, the Ordinance of Library has revealed many shortcomings and was no longer consistent with the reality and the relevant legal system.\nThe development of science and technology has created great progress of the library’s science sector, changing the way people access information in libraries, he said.\nHe said: “The system in Việt Nam, particularly the public library, is ineffective, failing to meet the demand of people. Due attention hasn’t been given to school libraries and reading culture has changed because of information accession.”\nDuring the discussion, NA deputies agreed the promulgation of the Law on Libraries would contribute to creating a legal corridor for the development of the sector, promoting reading culture and ensuring the right to access information, culture and help the lifelong learning of people.\nHowever, they pointed out people rarely went to libraries at communes and about 30 per cent of libraries at district level were not granted books.\nAlthough many provinces and districts have nice libraries, their target of attracting readers was largely ignored.\nParticipants also agreed about the need to diversify libraries, including non-state ones like those of social and professional organisations and those in the private sector. They said the building of digital libraries or digital resources were common trends of modern libraries given the change of habits and information accession in the society.\nThey said it was necessary for the draft law to have regulations on copyright relating to digital books and the digitalisation of documents to facilitate the development of digital libraries.\nDespite accounting for large numbers, the majority of school libraries failed to fulfill their role, deputies said. Therefore, they called for clarification of responsibilities of the State and relevant bodies with a view to promote the development of school libraries. — VNS'",0

This year, only students in Argentina, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Republic of Northern Macedonia, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Việt Nam still took the paper test.\nBy\xa0 the\xa0 time\xa0 the\xa0 ranking\xa0 was\xa0 published,\xa0 the\xa0 international\xa0 comparability\xa0 of\xa0 Việt\xa0 Nam’s\xa0performance\xa0 in\xa0 reading,\xa0 mathematics\xa0 and\xa0 science\xa0 could\xa0 not\xa0 be\xa0 fully\xa0 ensured.\xa0 For this reason,\xa0 the\xa0 OECD\xa0 did\xa0 not\xa0 report comparisons of Việt Nam’s performance in PISA with other countries.\nInitially, OCED suggested that Việt Nam’s test data would be published in 2020. The organisation wanted to spend more time to delve into the difference of Việt Nam’s test results, the ministry said.\nHowever, thanks to the active co-operation of Việt Nam in processing the data after the tests, the organisation agreed to announce the result of Việt Nam with other nations in December 12, without naming the country in the ranking.\nThe ministry said OECD had sent the head of data analysis committee to Việt Nam to evaluate the process of organising the test. The organisation said Việt Nam made no errors in the process of organising and scoring the test.\nFollowing the PISA 2018 ranking, Asian countries once again came out on top. China and Singapore rank first and second, South Korea ranks 9th and Japan ranks 15th.\nEuropean countries such as Estonia, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Norway are also in the high-ranking group.\nPISA is an international study that was launched by the OECD in 1997, first administered in 2000 and now covers over 80 countries. Every three\xa0years, the PISA survey provides comparative data on 15-year-olds’ performance in reading, mathematics and science.\nThe Vietnamese education ministry said it wants to take part in PISA programme to see where Vietnamese students are placed in the world and to draw up an overall picture of the country's education situation in comparision to other countries' education, which will then help to formulate necessary policies. — VNS",1

One of the best opportunities to further our mission towards reform lies at Hospital Management Asia, with several stellar case studies from across the region,"" said Vietnamese health minister Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến.\n""Healthcare is accelerating exponentially in Asia and I am excited to be part of the movement to bring hospitals, investors and solution providers together to help our hospitals provide better service and the best patient outcomes possible,"" said Tiến.\nMinister Tiến said that in recent years, the health ministry has implemented a health reform programme with a goal towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), in which health service quality has played an important role in ensuring safety for patients and people. To protect the health of 96 million people, Việt Nam always follows the ""patient-centred"" motto –\xa0providing safe, quality services and satisfying patients.\n”To improve the quality of medical services, we have developed hospital quality, surgical and test quality criteria. We also launched the Satellite Hospital Programme to transfer medical technologies to lower-level hospitals to improve their professional quality, reduce over-capacity and overcrowding at higher levels,” stressed Tiến.\nShe added that the health sector also implemented various measures to improve patient satisfaction such as establishing hotlines, increasing health insurance coverage, training health worker and applying IT in hospital and patient management.\nDuring the two-day event, participants will focus discussions on topics such as the latest technologies for healthcare, cost reduction and patient safety to increase efficiency and improve patient outcomes. The conference will also discuss Healthcare 4.0, investments in hospitals and healthcare across Asia, and winning the war for healthcare talent, among others.\nThis year, the conference will feature five main streams, including a new one for C-level leaders, which will discuss financial sustainability through investments, the impact of public policy for hospital services and how to address the challenges in the implementation of value-based care. Other streams include Safety, Quality & Accreditation; Patient Care & Engagement; Talent Management; and Healthcare 4.0.\nRunning alongside the conference is the Asian Hospital Management Awards that recognise and honour hospitals in Asia Pacific that implement best practices. All projects submitted by Vietnamese hospitals will also be eligible for the \'Most Improved Local Hospital\' category – a special award for entries by Vietnamese hospitals.\nAccording to the health ministry, after 5 years implementation, the programme has built and formed 23 nuclear hospitals and 138 satellite hospitals nationwide. Ten specialties were invested and prioritised for development, including oncology, surgical trauma, cardiology, obstetrics, paediatrics, endocrinology, neurology, clinical haematology, emergency resuscitation and poison control.\nInitial results showed that it has gradually reduced the overload of higher-level hospitals, especially in HCM City and Hà Nội, contributing to improving the service delivery capacity of lower-level hospitals, strengthening people\'s confidence in the grassroots health system, reducing referral rates, and allowing people to receive technical services and safe quality right at their localities.\nAt the event, a Memorandum of Understanding on healthcare and treatment collaboration was signed between three Vietnamese private hospitals, including Hùng Vương General Hospital, Quang Khởi General Hospital and Central Otolaryngology Hospital, and three Malaysian private hospitals, including Mahkota Medical Center, Subang Jaya Medical Center and Sunway Medical Center.\nThis collaboration will allow patients after receiving initial consultation and diagnosis by doctors at the three Vietnamese hospitals to seek second professional advice from three Malaysian health units, if required. Three Vietnamese hospitals will continue to monitor and treat these patients after returning from Malaysia.\n“The co-operation of Malaysian health with three Vietnamese hospitals is an important milestone, emphasising the trust of our partners and foreign stakeholders in the quality healthcare service\xa0of Malaysia,” said Sherene Azli, CEO of Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC).\nIn 2018, Malaysia Healthcare served more than 1.2\xa0million visitors coming to the country for healthcare purposes, an increase of more than 14 per cent compared to 2017. — VNS'",1

Investors are also still waiting for a push from the relaxation of foreign ownership.\nHưng forecast the market might continue to move up this week in a narrow margin.\nAlthough the VN-Index was pushed back to 990 points on Friday as stocks were hit strongly on the last day exchange-traded funds (ETFs) completed reviewing their portfolios, the short-term uptrend of the market might not be interrupted, Hưng said.\nThe wave of interest rate cuts by central banks around the world had helped reduce concerns about an economic downturn, he said.\n“During the past several months, the world stock market has continuously fluctuated and been dependent on the developments on US-China trade war and investors were gradually getting used to this instability. Therefore, the uptrend of the market in the coming week may still continue,” Hưng said.\nAccording to Nguyễn Thế Minh, head of analysis at Yuanta Securities Vietnam Co, Việt Nam can hardly be considered for upgrading in FTSE restructuring this time.\n“However, the hope for upgradation was still a supporting factor for the stock market as we still have large growth opportunities,” Minh said.\n“Not to mention the upgrade, the US Federal Reserve (FED)\'s interest rate reduction showed us that cash flows were gradually returning to the emerging markets and frontier markets, especially countries with high GDP growth rates like Việt Nam.”\n“Therefore, in a positive scenario, Việt Nam’s reclassification as an emerging market can strongly support market’s trend in the meantime,” Minh said.\nNguyễn Trung Du, Director of the Business Development Section at VNDirect Securities Co., said if Việt Nam was upgraded to emerging market status by FTSE, the local stock market would further attract international investment flows.\nViệt Nam had stable macro-economy, Du said, but adding the Vietnamese market had only partially met requirements from the international funds, therefore, the upgrade plans still needed a lot of effort.\nDu said the short-term trend of the market was quite positive with indices rising at a slow pace and wide divergence.\n“This is still a positive sign in the current context when the international financial market is very unstable,” Du said.\nBảo Việt Securities Company\'s daily report says the market is forecast to face correcting pressure early this week and recover toward the weekend.\n""The index may drop to support zone 978-983 points in the short term due to the selling pressure.

Known in Việt Nam as 'vích', the creature used to be common with dozens of thousands of turtles laying their eggs on the beaches every year prior to the 80s, but now the number of individuals is barely past\xa0500. Yet the species is still faring better than the famous đồi mồi of the same family, which has been hunted down for its shells to make decorative items to the extent there are less than 10 animals left.\nDr Vương Tiến Mạnh, an official at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Việt Nam (Cites Việt Nam), said the issue stemmed from both traditional and emerging threats.\n“In the past, when the economy was yet to develop, people consumed wild animals such as crabs, frogs, shellfish or even snakes as a way to supplement protein. This was common among people living in forest areas and the Cửu Long Delta Region,” said Mạnh.\nThis habit was part of their tradition coupled with the fact that they don’t really have a sense of protecting animals and plants or access to information that carried this message, the expert said.\nOn the other hand, there are a large number of people who consume wild animals for medical purposes.\nSeventy-one per cent said wild animals were consumed as a mean of treating diseases, while 21 per cent said they boosted health, according to a Cites’ survey, Manh said.\nWild animals and animal parts have become commercial goods and a fashionable trend with elephant tusks or rhino horn acting as a status symbol.\nCorruption and illegal protection by criminal gangs also contribute to thwarted efforts to investigate and prosecute wildlife crimes.\nInadequate regulations\nAccording to statistics from the Forest Ranger Department, since 2010, forest rangers had discovered more than 140,000 violations on forest and forestry product management, of which violations relating to wild animal management numbered 3,823.\nForest rangers seized nearly 59,000 animals, of which 3,078 were rare or endangered species.\nThe illegally hunting and trade of rare animals had been expanding across the country, but the number of cases brought to court was very low, reported Vietnam News Agency.\nFigures from the Supreme Court showed that from October 2015 to the end of July 2017, Vietnamese courts took up a total of 231 cases with 339 defendants, and nearly 90 per cent of them were brought to trial.\nHowever, only three defendants were handed prison sentences of longer than three years, while the remaining 37 received shorter terms.\nCaptain Trần Thị Kim Thanh from the Environment Police said there were many legal regulations that exposed shortcomings causing difficulties in the process of dealing with the trafficking of wild animals.\nMoreover, international co-operation in information sharing, investigation and arresting criminals remained ineffective, Thanh said.\nLarge shipments of tusks, rhino horns and pangolins originating from African countries or Indonesia were being transported through many countries before arriving in China or Việt Nam, where local use of wild animal products remains widespread among certain groups of people.\nHowever, it is difficult for enforcement agencies and NGOs from different countries to join forces to prevent trafficking or to arrest the culprits because information is not shared due to a lack of mutual legal assistance agreements or other forms of cooperation.\nMeasures needed\nAccording to Bùi Thị Hà, vice director of Education for Nature – Việt Nam (ENV), a Vietnamese non-governmental organisation, 10 urgent actions were needed to put an end to illegal hunting and trade of wild rare and endangered animals in the country.\nThe actions include stepping up investigations and issuing strict fines to those who lead illegal rings, a resolute ban on the sale of wild animal products and the destruction of any seized product, permanently closing all private tiger, bear or any other wild animal breeding farms, holding local governments accountable for the wild animal trade in their jurisdictions, and effectively deterring illegal trading on the internet.\nMeanwhile, director of the Wild Animal Conservation Centre Nguyễn Văn Thái, said: “Việt Nam needed to complete and ensure consistent legal documents related to the protection of wild animals and plants.”\n“The Government should issue policies that encourage domestic and international organisations to launch campaigns to raise awareness and dissuade people from using wild animals and plants,” Thái said.\nThe campaigns should aim at changing local habits of consuming wild animals and plants as well as urging a zero-tolerance attitude against such actions, he added.\nAuthorities should also create sustainable jobs for those whose livelihoods depend on wildlife and nature to reduce the hunting of wild animals.\nPeople living in buffer zones near national parks, conservation areas and preventive forests should be encouraged to take part in wildlife protection, said the director.\nAt present, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is drafting a decree on the management of wild, rare and critically endangered animals and plants and the implementation of international conventions to stop the trade. This decree aims to streamline many international protection provisions into Vietnamese legal regulations to ensure a transparent and fair implementation of the law. —\xa0VNS",4

3830,'Competition in airline industry set\xa0to intensify',"Aircraft at Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport in HCM City. Competition in Việt Nam's\xa0aviation sector looks to soar as more new players enter the fray. — Photo vnfinance.vn\nHÀ NỘI — Increasing numbers of airlines and aircraft are putting serious pressure on Việt Nam’s aviation infrastructure. As competition for market share and skilled labour intensifies, the Government must take measures to ensure a fair playground and long-term development, said industry experts and authorities.\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) has recently approved an air operator’s certificate (AOC) submitted by Vietstar Airlines, bringing the total number of licensed air operators in the country to seven. CAAV also confirmed two more AOC applications submitted by Vinpearl Air and Vietravel Airlines were pending.\nVinpearl Air said it would field a fleet of six aircraft in July next year and bring in 30 more by 2025 to fly both domestic and international routes. Vietravel Airlines said it hoped to commence operations next October with three aircraft and planned to bring in five more by 2025.\nCentral Quảng Nam Province’s department of planning and investment has also filed an application for its local airlines KiteAir, who said it would begin with six ATR72 aircraft during the first quarter of next year. It aimed to operate 15 ATR72 models and 12 A320/A321 models by the end of 2024.\nIt has placed further strain on the overloaded and overcrowded major airports across the country such as HCM City’s Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport, Hà Nội’s Nội Bài International Airport as well as those in the cities of Đà Nẵng and Nha Trang.\nFor example, the CAAC cited the Nội Bài - Tân Sơn Nhất route, operated by Vietnam Airlines, Jetstar Pacific and VietJet Air, which accounted for a whopping 22.7 per cent of Việt Nam’s air ticket sales last year with flights connecting the country’s two major economic hubs reported over 90 per cent of seat capacity filled.\nTerminals and runways at the two airports, as a result, are forced to operate over capacity for a long time. To make matters worse, legal issues and complex aviation regulations slowed down the process to carry out much-needed repair and upgrade work. New players had to find bases elsewhere. Bamboo Airways was reported to set up base at Phù Cát Airport in central Quy Nhơn Province, KiteAir at Chu Lai Airport in central Quảng Nam Province and Vietravel Airlines at Phú Bài Airport in Huế City.\nWhile routes considered profitable by air operators were over-exploited, airports in less-than-popular-destinations have seen little business with airlines claiming operations to and from such localities financially unsustainable.\nAirlines also faced strict scrutiny in attempts to bring in additional aircraft to their fleets. \xa0For example, CAAV reportedly turned down Bamboo Airways’ request to add 30 more aircraft in April citing an inadequate number of air traffic controllers to safely monitor flights. It also curbed Vinpearl Air’s plan to add 36 aircraft by 2025 to 30.\nAs market share is fiercely contested, air operators were forced to introduce new and better services to lure customers. Some have started to look for routes outside Việt Nam. Vietjet Air’s first half of the year report showed an increase of 35 per cent on the number of passengers served on the airline’s international routes compared to last year at a total of 4 million. The airline’s revenue from international routes outweighed its domestic counterpart for the first time at 54 per cent.\nBy CAAV’s estimation, by 2030 there will be 600 aircraft operating in the Vietnamese aviation sector, three times the country’s current number. As numbers of both air operators and aircraft are set to increase in the foreseeable future, skilled manpower was also expected to be in high demand.\nOffensive tactics were reported to have been used to poach technicians and pilots from competitors. The situation has gotten so severe the Government needed to step in. In a recent meeting to discuss the sector’s issues, Deputy PM Trương Hòa Bình asked air operators to maintain a fair playground and make sure workers and pilots are not overworked saying they are both important components in the long-term development of Viêt Nam’s aviation industry.\nBy June this year, Vietnamese air operators’ fleet numbered 197, increasing by 30 compared to 2018. Vietnam Airlines, the country’s flag carrier, operated 95 aircraft and employed 1,135 pilots, of which 860 were Vietnamese. Vietjet Air, Jetstar Pacific and Bamboo Airways operated 65, 15 and 6 aircraft, respectively. — VNS",2

5176,'Việt Nam’s energy transition faces challenges',"Solar power panels installed in the south-central province of Bình Thuận. The province now has about 95 solar power investors. — VNA/VNS Photo\xa0Nguyễn Thanh\nViệt Nam News\xa0talks to Vietnamese and Danish lawmakers and experts about barriers that Việt Nam has faced in energy transition to reach sustainable development goals, experience from Denmark and the two countries’ partnership in the field.\nLê Hồng Tịnh, vice chairman of National Assembly’s Committee of Science, Technology and Environment\nViệt Nam has followed the global trend of developing renewable energy. Located in the equatorial zone, Việt Nam has a natural advantage in solar power. In the context that hydropower potentials are\xa0running out and imported coal pollutes the environment, it is a priority of Việt Nam to implement wind and solar power policies.\nHowever, if solar power develops at a too rapid speed, it will cause an imbalance in the power system. A cloud blocking the sun can interrupt the system.\nEuropean countries have their power system connected to a general European network. When the grid of one country is interrupted, they buy electricity from the general regional power system. Unlike Việt Nam, the power system is not connected to any regional network. Therefore in case of interrupted transmission, it is difficult to find alternative sources of energy.\nViệt Nam has revised the Law on Electricity, Law on Economical and Efficient Use of Energy and related laws to attract and encourage the public to engage in using renewable energy.\nThe Vietnam Electricity has offered assistance of VNĐ1 million (US$43) for each household installing solar-powered water heaters. Now we have to adopt policies in which families can sell extra solar power on their roofs to integrate into the national grid.\nWe need also an electricity tax policy. The National Assembly has conducted studies to work with the Ministry of Industry and Trade to make amendments and supplements to related laws.\nProfessor Trần Đình Long, full member of International Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences, vice president of Việt Nam Electrical Engineering Association\nViệt Nam has not mapped out an appropriate plan for national electricity structure in the long term. Việt Nam used to target a low proportion of renewable energy in the plan. After that, following the global trend, the proportion of renewable energy has been adjusted to increase.\nThe percentage of renewable energy accounted for in the national electricity structure needs comprehensive planning on power sources and grids.\nExperience from around the world including European countries, China and\xa0India shows renewable energy policies start from feed-in tariff and preferential treatment for clean energy. Việt Nam needs to conduct insightful research to adopt a general appropriate feed-in tariff policy. This must answer questions of how electricity prices are supported, through loans or preferential import-export policies.\nDr Vũ Minh Pháp, Institute of Energy Science, Việt Nam Academy of Science and Technology\nThe barrier of Việt Nam is weakness in technology quality inspection. Technologies of solar and wind power from global manufacturers have entered Việt Nam at a rapid speed. However, there is no Vietnamese unit in charge of inspecting these devices to check whether the technologies are well suited to the Vietnamese environment. Another barrier is that there has been no study in Việt Nam that finds proper answers to the question of how to treat waste after solar and wind power projects reach their end of life.\nSteen Gade, former member of Danish Parliament, former chairman of the Climate, Energy and Building Committee\nI think Việt Nam needs to combine energy politics with climate issues. Việt Nam needs to combine economic growth with a very strong environmental and climate agenda.\nDenmark has experience in involving people. It has been the centre in Denmark when we need high prices of energy, we discuss in public, in media, in organisations, among ordinary people to find out the best\xa0solution.\nIn Denmark, local farmers in rural areas made co-operatives where they own wind mills and they can sell wind power to the grid. That means it was an economic benefit for farmers, at the same time, it started the process of renewable energy. We combine economy and environment and we focus on renewable energy. We have developed action between people, topic discussions, media, education and politics.\nAton Beck, director of global co-operation, Danish Energy Agency\nWe have very good co-operation with the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade and the electricity of renewable energy authority on how to ensure more renewable energy in Việt Nam's system. On November 4th, we will launch a new Việt Nam’s energy outlook that will look into different kinds of scenarios for the long-term transition in Việt Nam. There is definitely a huge potential for wind, solar energy and biomass in Việt Nam.\nNext year, Denmark will have more than 50 per cent of our electricity consumption based on wind. We can integrate it into our system. In 2028, we will have 100 per cent of electricity consumption based on wind.\nDenmark has some good experience and we would like to share with Việt Nam.\nViệt Nam has\xa0very successful economic growth but it also creates challenges in the energy sector including higher energy demand, higher dependence on coal, higher emissions of greenhouse gases and higher dependence on importing energy with dramatic increase in energy import.\nWe have good co-operation with the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade to ensure that Việt Nam has the right framework for having international developers coming to Việt Nam to invest.

The patient was taken to the hospital with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating and vomiting. After being examined, the patient was diagnosed with a bowel obstruction due to colon cancer.\nUnder the instruction of Leroy, the tumour was successfully removed in just over an hour. The surgery was recorded and presented to the hospital’s meeting room so other doctors could watch it.\nIn the operation room, Leroy guided doctors on how to conduct open laparoscopy and explained how to perform minimally invasive colon and rectal surgery.\nLater, in recognition of Leroy's contribution to the city’s health sector and Việt Nam, late President Trần Đại Quang awarded him the Friendship Medal of the Socialist Republic of Việt Nam in 2017.\nLeroy is currently helping train doctors specialised in gastrointestinal laparoscopy for the city’s health sector as well as doctors for the hi-tech and digestive centre.\nAnother example of international co-operation is 108 Military Central Hospital. Doctors from the hospital worked with their colleagues in France’s Foch Hospital to conduct Viet Nam's first lung transplant from a brain-dead donor in March 2018.\nThe leading partner of the hospital is now Japan, a country with some of the most developed medicine in the world. The hospital has sent doctors and technicians to training courses in Japan to improve the quality of examination and treatment.\nAssociate Professor Nguyễn Anh Tuấn, deputy head of the hospital’s Gastrointestinal Surgery Department, said after the training courses, doctors and technicians of the hospital had learned advanced techniques.\nTuấn said doctors from the hospital now could conduct techniques for treating gastric and esophageal cancer just as doctors in Japan can.\nChallenges remain\nData from the hi-tech and digestive centre show thanks to the improvement in service quality, the centre has received 20 -30 per cent more patients each year since 2016.\nNguyễn Ngọc Đan, a doctor from the centre, said there were patients diagnosed in Singapore’s hospitals but they returned to the centre for treatment because of the reasonable price and to be treated by reputable doctors, he said.\nStatistics of local hospitals revealed most foreign patients chose to be treated in well-known hospitals, including Saint Paul, 108 Military Central and Bạch Mai because of good service quality and the skills of doctors.\nDespite initial results, challenges still remain, said director of the city’s health sector Nguyễn Khắc Hiền.\nHiền said international co-operation had only been carried out by some hospitals and focused on certain aspects, while many other hospitals and aspects had not enjoyed international co-operation.\nHe said a lack of staff with fluent foreign language skills was the major challenge. It caused limits in finding partners, negotiating and implementing international co-operation.\nHe said the city’s health sector would focus on improving foreign language skills for medical staff, he said.\nAdditionally, the sector hopes to seek international co-operation in building a general strategy to develop the city’s health sector to improve service quality. It also plans to construct new medical centres with advanced equipment equal to centres of developed countries and establish hi-tech medical centre, according to Hiền.— VNS",1

As such, we expect South-East Asia’s GDP growth to moderate to 4.5 per cent in 2020, remaining unchanged from 2019.”\nBesides a\xa0more dovish US Federal Reserve, low inflation and a deteriorating economic outlook, regional central banks have shifted to a more accommodative stance.\nThe Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are expected to reduce interest rates by a further 25 basis points over the coming quarters, followed by an extended pause with fiscal stimulus to complement central bank efforts in cushioning the economic slowdown.\nHowever, the room for fiscal manoeuvring will differ across the region. Most Southeast Asian economies such as Thailand and the Philippines are expected to roll out stronger fiscal impulses.\nAfter running a series of fiscal surpluses, Singapore has the most fiscal room to ease policy. Given the highly uncertain trade environment, its government is likely to announce measures such as cash handouts and funding support for small and medium-sized enterprises in next year’s budget.\nIn contrast, both Việt Nam and Malaysia are constrained, given current levels of public debt.\nIn Malaysia, despite the announcement of a mildly expansionary budget for 2020, the government’s continued emphasis on fiscal consolidation and the risks of fiscal slippage suggest limited room for further support. — VNS'",2

With its modern infrastructure, it has become one of the leading localities in attracting FDI (foreign direct investment) in Việt Nam.”\nAs Việt Nam’s emerging gateway for technology, trade and services, the province is well positioned to serve as a commercial hub for Southeast Asian economies, he added.\nThe province is the most vibrant business region in the country, with a growth rate 1.5 times faster than the country as a whole, according to Liêm.\nInvestment in a wide range of fields, including industry, trade and services, education, and human resources, is now being sought.\nJust two decades ago, Bình Dương was an agricultural area with modest infrastructure, but now is the third largest FDI destination in the country, behind only HCM City and Hà Nội.\nMore than 3,700 FDI projects from 64 countries and territories operate in the province.\n“Investment priorities are in the high-tech industry, supporting industry, IT, precision engineering, trade, and services,” Liêm said.\n“Bình Dương is proud to host the Horasis again this year as the country aims to become an export economy that is growing rapidly and providing more high-paying jobs,” he said.\nBình Dương New City, where the event opens today, is a 45-minute drive from HCM City’s Tân Sơn Nhất international airport.\nMany CEOs and investors from Southeast Asia, Japan, South Korea, India and other parts of the world have been invited to Bình Dương to look at the huge FDI opportunities there.\nHorasis Chairman and Founder Frank-Jürgen Richter said that Bình Dương had sufficient “hard” infrastructure but now would need “soft infrastructure” such as more high quality human resources, and would need to continue to catch up with more developed countries in Asia and other regions.\nNguyễn Văn Hùng, chairman of Becamex IDC, noted that Horasis was one of the most important events which Bình Dương was proud to host and would be vital to the smart-city plan of Bình Dương.\nAccording to Don Lam, CEO of VinaCapital, besides good infrastructure development, competitive labour costs, and good training facilities, Bình Dương is known for its proactive and pro-business authorities.\nBình Dương jumped from 14th in 2017 to sixth nationwide in 2018 in the 2018 Provincial Competitiveness Index from the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In the southeast region, Bình Dương has surpassed HCM City and is now in first place, with a score of 66.09 points on a scale of 100 in 2018.\n“The time is ripe for us to talk about Bình Dương’s potential to attract investors and investment,” Lam said.\nThe Becamex City complex project is\xa0one of the projects included in\xa0the Bình Dương Smart City scheme.

Its core mission is to build interaction between the state, scientists and entrepreneurs.\nTo execute the project, the province has coordinated with Eindhoven City in the Netherlands, as well as the South Korean city of Daejon and the World Technopolis Association.\nUnder the smart city scheme, Bình Dương aims to strengthen workers’ skills and education; expand R&D activities and build a start-up eco-system; attract more FDI in high-tech manufacturing; and improve transport, the ICT infrastructure, the business climate and people’s living conditions.\nBình Dương New City will be the centre of the smart province and house the most important urban areas, and research and educational institutions, as well as industrial zones.\nBình Dương Smart City is home to a growing number of Techlabs and Fablabs located in schools, universities and vocational colleges around the province. The labs collaborate closely with industrial partners and the province’s Department of Science and Technology.\nTechlabs offer practical education in the latest technology, including equipment provided by industry partners. They also provide a space for joint research projects between universities and local employers.\nBình Dương’s Techlabs include a lighting lab at Eastern International University, a mechanical electrical lab at Việt Nam-Singapore Vocational College and an ICT lab at Thủ Dầu Một University, with a robotics and intelligent systems lab, a power electronics system lab, and a data analysis and artificial intelligence lab in the works.\nBình Dương also aims to join the Intelligent Community Forum (ICF) before 2021, which will allow it to link up with a network of 160 smart provinces and cities around the world.\nLocal agencies have been told to prioritise projects related to semiconductors and LED lighting projects, and e-government. Provincial agencies will seek more partnerships with neighbouring cities and provinces, as well as businesses and local and international experts, to help with the project.\nBình Dương was the only area in Việt Nam named as one of the world’s Smart21 communities of 2018 by the New York-based Intelligent Community Forum, a non-profit policy research organisation focused on job creation and economic development in the broadband economy.\nLast year the province hosted the World Technopolis Association Summit 2018, attracting around 100 members from the World Technopolis Association from nearly 50 countries and territories. — VNS'",2

The central bank’s HCM City office has kept up with the movement of gold prices to deliver proper responses but actual demand and sales of gold and gold products are quite weak.”\nIn the remaining months of the year, international gold prices might not reach $2,000 an ounce while it might continue falling in a short period before going again in medium and long terms, investment consultant Phan Dũng Khánh at Maybank Kim Eng Securities Co said.\nGold might move between $1,500-1,600 an ounce or VNĐ42-45 million per tael.

Imports from Thailand, still the biggest import market of Việt Nam, went down 24.5 per cent, while those from China picked up 10 per cent and from the US up 54 per cent.\nAccording to the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s report on exports in the first 11 months of this year, many other key products had dropped in export value due to difficulties.\nTotal export revenue of agricultural, forestry and fishery products was estimated at $23.1 billion, down 5.2 per cent over the same period of last year, including seafood (down 2.3 per cent), coffee (down 22.2 per cent), and cassava\xa0(down 5.3 per cent).\nOther commodities increased in export volume but decreased in export value due to the decrease in\xa0prices such as cashew nuts, pepper and rice.\nImprovements are needed\xa0for sustainable development, including quality control, traceability, processing capacity, preservation of agricultural products and supporting industries for the agriculture sector.\nTo remove these difficulties, the Ministry of Industry and Trade said it would study solutions and measures to develop exports and imports for important markets,\xa0seek new potential export markets and consolidate as well as expand the market share of Vietnamese goods in traditional markets and FTA partners.\nLê Thanh Hòa,\xa0deputy director\xa0of the\xa0Agricultural Product Processing\xa0and\xa0Market Development Department, said to seize the opportunity, Việt Nam needed\xa0to accelerate registration of planting zone codes and packaging\xa0codes, helping local businesses export more fruit\xa0and vegetables to the Chinese market.\nIn addition, Việt Nam's fruit and vegetable businesses needed to put investment in technology and modernisation of processing and production equipment,\xa0and also strengthen co-operation and connectivity with partners in the supply chain to improve export capacity.\nHòa was quoted by the Thời báo Kinh tế Việt Nam (Vneconomy) newspaper as saying the State should promote\xa0farming products in potential markets. Thailand exported 22 kinds of fruit and vegetables to China while Việt Nam only had nine. The nation needed\xa0three years or longer to gain\xa0export certificates for its tropical fruit to be shipped to\xa0China.\nEurope and many other countries had\xa0also set up technical barriers for imported goods. In the EU, besides the advantages from the EU-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), the\xa0market had\xa0standards that asked Vietnamese businesses to improve production and product quality and to apply high technology in production, processing, preservation, packaging\xa0and transport.\nTo achieve these standards, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development had\xa0asked the Government to offer\xa0incentives to\xa0the agricultural sector to develop production and business monitoring programmes avoid trade and technical barriers, Hòa said. - VNS",2

They have been living under enormous pressure and you see it in their performances,"" said Ljungberg.\n""You can see the players have been a bit low and you see in the dressing room the relief and how happy they are.""\nA first win in 10 games in all competitions lifts Arsenal up to ninth and cuts the gap on fourth-placed Chelsea to seven points in the battle for Champions League qualification next season.\nLjungberg reacted to taking just one point from his opening two games in temporary charge against lowly Norwich and Brighton by making five changes with Martinelli and Pepe among those coming into the side.\nPepe\'s inability to make an impact has been one of the major reasons for Arsenal\'s struggles, but the Ivorian looked a new player after curling home his first Premier League goal from open play 24 minutes from time.\n""Nicolas is an amazing football player, but it is not easy to come from the French league into the Premier League and adjust straight away,"" added Ljungberg.\n""It was an amazing goal and he\'ll get better and better.""\nWest Ham \'dominated for 60 minutes\nNot much had improved in Ljungberg\'s first two games since replacing the sacked Unai Emery and it was the same tame and lifeless Arsenal for the first hour against a West Ham side that have won just once in their last 11 games.\n""I think we dominated the game for 60 minutes and after that in 10 minutes we lose the game,"" said West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini, who is under increasing pressure as his side sit just one point above the relegation zone.\nAnother home defeat means the Hammers have taken just one point from their last five games at the London Stadium and the home side were booed off at full-time.\n""You understand the boos because the last five games we played here we didn\'t win,"" added Pellegrini. ""You cannot concede three goals in every game.""\nIn a first half of precious little good football it was fitting the opener arrived in scrappy fashion as Ogbonna\'s attempted header came off his shoulder and deflected off Martinelli to wrong-foot Bernd Leno in the Arsenal goal.\nBut one moment changed the course of the game when Sead Kolasinac burst down the left and crossed low for Martinelli to slot home his eighth goal of the season after impressing in the League Cup and Europa League.\nSuddenly the confidence which Emery and Ljungberg bemoaned had drained away from their players in recent times was restored, none more so than in Pepe, who cut inside onto his favoured left foot and curled into the top corner.\nPepe then turned provider for Aubameyang to slide in for his 13th goal of the campaign.\n""At half-time, Freddie told us to play with a higher tempo,"" said Aubameyang.\n""We have the quality in the squad, and if we believe in ourselves, we can go forward and win games. We will take this second half as an example for the rest of the season."" — AFP'",3

Despite their importance for ecosystems, few quantitative,\nspatially-explicit\nmodels of the active belowground community\ncurrently\nexist. That’s why we wanted to study these most abundant animals on Earth,” Duong said.\nThe study revealed that there are 57 billion nematodes for every single living human being\n–\nmuch greater than previously estimated. They also have a total biomass of about 300 million tons, approximately 80\nper cent\nof the combined weight of Earth's\xa0human population.\nNematodes play a significant role in the recycling of carbon, nutrients and minerals in the soil.

Vân said making decisions on how to fund public investment projects was one of the NA’s key responsibilities.\nDeputy Tôn Ngọc Hạnh from Bình Phước Province said that with the NA’s heavy workload, it would be unrealistic to expect the legislative body to approve and adjust specific funding for as many as 9,000 projects in five years.\nOther lawmakers disagreed, saying the NA’s approval process would not take too much time if the Government makes careful preparations before submitting investment plans.\nUnfocused investment\nDeputy Lê Thanh Vân said the implementation of the mid-term public investment plan had faced difficulties, including a failure to follow public investment law regulations because the Government’s advisory team had not completed all of the tasks assigned by the NA.\nDeputy Nguyễn Thị Quyết Tâm from HCM City proposed the Government attempt to determine whether slow disbursement of public investment funds for key national projects was due to structural problems with the Law on Public Investment or poor implementation of its regulations.\nSpeaking with Vietnam News Agency reporters on the sidelines of the meeting on Tuesday, deputy Nguyễn Đức Kiên from Sóc Trăng Province said the cost overrun of Bến Thành-Suối Tiên metro project in HCM City and the slow disbursement of funds to hospitals in Hà Nội and HCM City showed that the problems lie in unfocused and ineffective implementation of the law rather than any flaw with the law itself.\nAccording to deputy Hoàng Văn Cường from Hà Nội, the Law on Public Investment must prioritise urgent and realistic projects to address transportation problems, support people in mountainous areas and help stabilise lives.\nHe proposed the Government issue a set of quality standards for State budget–invested projects after the revised law is passed.

The Ministry of Public Security has also been instructed to conduct investigations and bring charges against organisations and individuals, foreign nationals included, who continued to break the laws.\nIn addition, Dũng asked MARD for faster implementation of monitoring systems to track fishing boats at sea.\nThe EC issued a yellow card to Việt Nam in October 2017, warning the country that the EU could ban its seafood products entirely unless effective measures were taken to halt illegal fishing. The commission has made a number of key recommendations for Việt Nam, which aim to strengthen the country\'s legal framework, capacity to monitor its fishing vessels and to track product origin.\nViệt Nam and the EC have been collaborating to resolve IUU fishing issues. In spite of some progress made, exports of Vietnamese seafood to the EU have since been on the decline.

However, only 23 firms made it to the final assessment and those firms were the largest companies by market value.\nSome of the finalists were the Vietnam Dairy Products JSC (Vinamilk), insurer Bảo Việt Holdings and the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV).\nAccording to Nguyễn Viết Thịnh, CEO of the Vietnam Institute of Directors, only 11 companies last year had independent sustainable development reports, which was almost double the number recorded in 2017. But it was still modest compared to the size of the Vietnamese business community.\nNotably, the top 10 companies nominated for the awards had their sustainable development reports included in the annual reports. The largest firms by market capitalisation maintained a good quality of reports for six straight years.\nThịnh said the sustainable development report must be finalised in the April-May period and the sooner it gets done the better.\nData should be collected consistently during the financial year and the report should be treated as a long-term opportunity for the business, he added.\nEven top companies with best sustainable development reports have not performed data analytics to see how they have changed through the years, Thịnh said.\nHe suggested the board of directors must play a major role in making sustainable development strategies popular to investors and shareholders, thus improving the company’s transparency and corporate governance.\n“The board of directors must be strongly committed to delivering sustainable development activities and ensure the company stays on its path towards a sustainable business operation,” he said.\nAccording to Nguyễn Công Minh Bảo, Director of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Vietnam, reputational risks and benefits, regulatory requirements and CEO’s directive, operational risks and benefits, investors’ interests and requirements, and market growth opportunities are among the most common factors that prevent a business from striving towards sustainable development.\nHoàng Đức Hùng, deputy director of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Vietnam, told attendees that compiling a sustainable development report requires the company to have sufficient human and financial resources.\nSmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have to establish a specialised unit to monitor the compilation of sustainable development reports, Hùng said.\n“Financial and non-financial strategies must be developed within the business.

Việt Nam was one of the first 107 countries to sign and ratify the convention.\nAddressing the ceremony, Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyễn Quốc Dũng underlined that seas and oceans\xa0not only connect continents but are also sources of livelihoods and the space for activities and interaction among more than 200 countries around the globe.\nDũng noted building a legal document to resolve all issues relating to the law of the sea and establishing a legal order for the seas and oceans were vital and also the aspiration of all nations as shown in the preamble of the UNCLOS.\n""Covering all activities on the seas and oceans, the UNCLOS is considered a constitution for the seas and oceans and serves as the legal foundation for all sea-related activities at the national, regional and global levels,"" Dũng said, adding that 168 countries had joined this convention so far, and almost all its regulations\xa0had become international practices.\nAccording to the official, the UNCLOS has become a solid international legal basis to define the rights, obligations and responsibilities of coastal countries, and to deal with issues related to the seas and oceans.\nDũng said over the last 25 years, Việt Nam had respected the guidelines and objectives of the UNCLOS while making efforts to enforce the convention in the East Sea.\nThe country had aligned its legal system on the management and use of the sea, especially the 2012 Law of the Sea, with the UNCLOS. Besides, it had handled sea-related differences by peaceful means and in line with international law, including the UNCLOS.\nUnder this policy, Việt Nam had held negotiations on and signed treaties on maritime delimitation with neighbouring countries like Thailand, China and Indonesia. It was also promoting talks on the delimitation of the sea area beyond the mouth of the Gulf of Tonkin with China, the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone with Indonesia, and the maritime delimitation with other neighbours, he said.\nDũng added the country had stepped up maritime co-operation in a diverse and substantive manner so as to optimise the sea’s potential and deal with emerging challenges and create a peaceful and stable environment in the East Sea.\nHe pointed out many recent complex developments in the East Sea that seriously violated the rights of Việt Nam and other regional countries which are stipulated in the UNCLOS.\nViệt Nam had persistently respected and complied with the UNCLOS, respected diplomatic and legal processes, and not wrongly interpreted or intentionally played down the significance and role of the convention, he stressed, adding that when there are differences relating to the interpretation and application of the UNCLOS, concerned parties need to solve those issues via negotiations or other peaceful measures in line with international law, including the UNCLOS.\n""When differences haven’t been resolved, relevant parties need to respect and fully implement the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC); exercise self-restraint; not take unilateral actions that may complicate the situation, elevate tensions or jeopardise regional peace and stability; and take part in negotiations in a constructive\xa0manner\xa0to soon finalise an efficient and practical Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC)\xa0in conformity with the UNCLOS,"" Dũng said. — VNS'",0

Roads near EPZs and IPs were often overloaded, leading to higher production costs for their tenants and reducing their competitiveness, Trần Trọng Tiến, a representative of enterprises in Tân Thuận\xa0Export Processing Zone said.\nOther problems included flooding, lack of schools, accommodation and medical facilities for workers and their families, Tiến said.\nThe limited availability of skilled IT and management personnel was also an issue.\nTo address these problems, administrative procedures related to investment, labour and construction in the\xa0EPZs and IPs\xa0needed to be simplified to attract foreign investment.\nThe quality of life and working environment for workers needed to be improved.\nĐào Xuân Đức, deputy head of the HCM City\xa0Export Processing Zones and Industrial Parks Authority (Hepza), said the city would make all EPZs and IPs green, clean and hi-tech by 2025 and build new hi-tech zones for supporting industries.\nThe city targeted having 23 EPZs and IPs with an area of around 6,000ha\xa0by 2020.\nPriority would be given to current investors in hi-tech, Industry 4.0 technologies and parts supply industries with high value-addition.\nLosing sheen\nThe city is losing its advantages over neighbouring provinces, and one of the main reasons is its high land rental rates.\nThe average rental in its EPZs and IPs is US$120 per meter square. In comparison, it is $74 in Đồng Nai Province, $73 in Long An and $43.7 in Bình Dương. The city needs to improve the efficiency of land use to reduce rentals and also strengthen linkages with other zones in the southern region, Trịnh\xa0Ngọc Vũ an\xa0expert in economics\xa0said.\nLast year the city’s EPZs and IPs attracted $772.3 million worth of investment, but only $290.8 million worth of foreign investment, a drop of 25.8 per cent from 2017, according to Hepza.\nMost projects were in technology-oriented industries, including food processing, chemical-rubber, information technology, and supporting industries. – VNS'",2

It would also hold bidding\xa0in a fair and transparent manner as well as be “extremely considerate” as this was a project sensitive to national security.\nThe North-South Expressway is the biggest road project in Việt Nam with total length estimated at 2,100km and will run through 32 cities and provinces.\nRegarding the decade-long-delayed Trung Lương-Mỹ Thuận Expressway – a key infrastructure project in the\xa0Mekong\xa0Delta, Thể told deputy Nguyễn Thanh Xuân from Cần Thơ City that the Government recently decided to pump more than VNĐ2 trillion (US$87 million) into the project.\nApart from more than VNĐ3 trillion already spent by the investor, the remaining capital needed – about VNĐ6 trillion - should came from credit institutions, the minister said.\n“The Government has ordered the State Bank governor to ask for support from commercial banks to make loans of VNĐ6 trillion for the project.

After collecting the fees, the park was allowed to keep 20 per cent while 80 per cent would be sent to the State budget.\nHe said the money the park kept was barely enough to pay salaries, with no money left to develop tourism.

When residents protest, they simply switch to operating only at night,” Bình said.\nClashes had occurred between drivers and local residents, he said.\nThe issues had been reported to authorities, but nothing was done.\nThat’s why the waste had kept piling up, he said.\nDumping in the area has caused serious impacts by encroaching on agricultural land and the riverbed and blocking the river.\nIn the rainy season, it becomes a major obstacle for flood drainage and causes serious pollution.\nConstruction waste, together with domestic waste, has transformed the area into a dump with a horrible odour.\nHoa Thị Kiều, a resident on Tân Ấp Street, complained that the smell was even worse on sunny days.\nShe said she hoped authorities would get serious and collect the waste.\nAuthorities’ feedback\nTô Ngọc Vũ, a resident of Nhật Tân Ward, raised doubts over how much authorities were doing to stop the illegal activity.\nVũ said tens of trucks went in and out of the area every day, creating a mountain of waste.\nThe issue had been raised several times, so there was no way authorities were unaware of the problem, Vũ said.\nĐặng Hữu Tiến, vice chairman of Nhật Tân Ward’s People’s Committee, said they had taken efforts to stamp out violations in the area.\nTiến said the committee had installed barriers to block trucks from entering the area and installed cameras to deter violations.\nOfficers were also keeping a close watch for violations.\nHowever, a shortage of officers made the work difficult.\nTiến said the site was managed by flower-growing households, and the committee would examine the situation and consult local police if needed.\nLast month, chairman of the city’s People’s Committee Nguyễn Đức Chung asked the people’s committees of Ba Đình and Tây Hồ districts to clarify and deter violations on illegal dumping along the Red River.\nViolations would be prosecuted if needed.

In just the last 12 months, WWF has fundraised US$40 million to work on circular economy projects in cities in Thailand, Việt Nam, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nAn estimated 60 per cent of plastic marine debris derives from urban centres is\xa0often carried to the ocean by rivers. While cities will rapidly increase their populace to account for two-thirds of the global population by 2050, they must urgently adopt smart solutions that reduce the collective impact of their prospering communities.

Plastic Smart Cities will strengthen action when it comes to preventing, measuring, and managing plastic waste at a local level. Our goal is to promote best practices around the world and to make sure that smart measures on plastic reduction and waste management are widely shared. With strong commitments from cities, governments and industry, we can end additional plastics in nature and ensure the safety of our communities and the environment.”\nAccording to key statistics on plastic pollution given by WWF, eight million tonnes of plastic pollution ends up in the ocean every year.\nOverall carbon emissions from the plastic life cycle are expected to increase by 50 per cent, while the carbon increase from plastic incineration is set to triple by 2030, due to wrong waste management choices.\nAn additional 104 million metric tonnes of plastic is at risk of leakage into our ecosystems by 2030 without a drastic change in approach.\nSince 2000, the world has produced as much plastic as all the preceding years combined, a third of which is leaked into nature.\nMore than 270 wildlife species have been documented as having been harmed by entanglement, while more than 240 species have been found to have ingested plastics, according to WWF. — VNS'",4

3741,'Indian firms keen to invest in solar energy in VN: consul',"K Srikar Reddy, the Indian consul general in HCM City.\nThe Indian corporate sector has a growing interest in investing in and doing business with Việt Nam. They are investing in many sectors, including solar energy.\nDr. K Srikar Reddy, the Indian consul general in HCM City, talks to Việt Nam News about the investment by Indian companies in solar energy in Việt Nam and what Việt Nam should do to attract investors.\nHow do you see the potential of solar energy in Việt Nam?\nViệt Nam, being a tropical country with around 1600 to 2700 hours of sunlight every year, has huge potential to develop solar energy, especially in the south-central and southern [regions].\nAccording to recent reports, Việt Nam’s economy will continue to grow between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent a year until 2030, and requires around 90,000 MW and 130,000 MW of power by 2025 and 2030 respectively.\nViệt Nam will benefit immensely by developing its vast potential of several hundreds of GW of renewable energy, especially solar energy, as it will help reduce dependence on fossil fuels, reduce pollution, protect people’s health, create employment, and ensure sustainable development.\nMany Indian companies have invested in the sector here. How has their experience been?\nIn July 2018 India's Shapoorji Pallonji Infrastructure Capital Company Ltd. signed the first solar power purchase agreement in Việt Nam with the Electric Power Trading Company, an arm of Electricity of Vietnam, for its 50MW SP Infra 1 Solar Power Plant in Ninh Thuận Province.\nIndia's Adani Group in collaboration with Việt Nam’s TSV group is developing a 50MW solar power plant 1 and a 27MW wind power plant in Ninh Thuận. After completion of phase 1, both Indian companies will proceed with developing phase 2 of the solar projects.\nProposals for development of renewable energy projects by Indian companies such as Adani Energy, Shapoorji Pallonji Infrastructure Capital Company, Tata Power, and Hero Future Energies in many provinces are at various stages of consideration by the provincial and national authorities.\nMoreover, many Indian companies specialising in EPC (engineering, procurement & construction) work are looking for opportunities to execute renewable energy projects in Việt Nam.\nSterling and Wilson Ltd recently completed EPC work for a 100MW and a 168 MW solar energy project in An Giang and Ninh Thuận provinces respectively. It is also operating and maintaining the two plants.\nHow do you foresee further investment from India in the renewables sector in Việt Nam, especially solar energy?\nRenewable energy has been identified as a priority area for co-operation by the leadership of the two countries. The Government of India under the direction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi set an ambitious and the world’s largest renewable energy capacity expansion programme.\nIndia plans to develop 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 with 100GW of solar power, 60GW of wind power and 15GW from bio and small hydropower plants. As of July 2019 India’s cumulative installed renewable energy capacity was 81GW including 30GW of solar energy and 37GW of wind energy. India is on course to achieve its ambitious target of 175 GW by 2022.\nThe Indian companies, which have developed world-class expertise by executing renewable energy projects in India, are very keen to invest in wind, solar and hybrid projects in Việt Nam.\nMany Indian companies have submitted proposals for developing solar plants in many provinces in Việt Nam like Ninh Thuận, Bình Thuận, Bình Phước, Phú Yên, Bến Tre, Sóc Trăng, Gia Lai, Lâm Đồng, and Kon Tum. Altogether, Indian companies are interested in developing 3-4GW of renewable energy in Việt Nam.\nIs the current electricity price policy attractive enough to attract investors? What would you suggest to make the sector more attractive to investors, especially Indian?\nThe feed-in-tariff of 9.35 US cents per kWh for solar projects (until June 2019) and feed-in-tariff of 9.8 US cents and 8.7 US cents per kWh for offshore and onshore wind projects respectively are attractive for Indian investors.\nThe other special incentives provided by Việt Nam for investment in the renewable energy sector such as corporate tax preferences, import-duty preferences, and land-related incentives are also attractive for the Indian investors.\nIndian companies are also anxiously waiting for the new feed-in-tariff scheme for solar projects that will be effective from July this year.\nIndia has transited from a feed-in-tariff regime to tariffs based on transparent bidding for renewable energy. Indian power companies have experience in executing auction-based solar and wind projects in India with tariffs of under 5 US cents per kWh.\nIndia was able to achieve the low tariffs due to various policy measures, including guaranteed offtake of power, large scale of projects, reduced EPC costs, and availability of concessional finance.\nAccording to reports, there is a concern about the capacity of the current grid and transmission infrastructure in Việt Nam, especially in provinces such as Ninh Thuận and Bình Thuận, where there has been a surge in renewable energy projects in recent years.\nIndian investors are worried that they have to now operate below their capacity due to insufficient transmission infrastructure. To augment the transmission system for evacuation of large-scale renewable energy, Việt Nam could consider developing high-voltage transmission lines similar to the ‘green energy corridor’ in India. — VNS",2

However, they are showing higher profits in the Southeast Asian region, including Việt Nam, thanks to the Korean government’s New Southern Policy, the Business Korea newspaper reported.\nSouth Korean commercial banks are showing a steady growth in Việt Nam. The net profits of domestic banks in Việt Nam came to US$131.80 million in 2018, showing a 116 per cent rise ($70.80 million) from $61 million in 2017, according to the data from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).\nWoori Bank Vietnam also saw its net profits surge 130 per cent year-on-year to $8.17 billion won ($6.83 million) in the first half.\nMeanwhile, the net profits of Chinese subsidiaries of South Korea’s top four commercial banks, including Shinhan, Kookmin, Woori and Hana Bank, came to 45.20 billion won ($37.81 million) in the first half of this year, down 44 per cent, or 36.30 billion won ($30.36 million), from a year ago. The return on assets (ROA) also stood at 0.58 per cent, falling short of 1 per cent of Chinese banks as well as 0.75 per cent of foreign banks in China.\nAccording to Lee Chi-hoon, a researcher at the Korea Center for International Finance, the business environment in China has worsened as a whole amid the slowing Chinese economy. Furthermore, Korean conglomerates’ investment in China has shrunk after the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)\xa0issue. As a result, the Korean banks’ strategy of focusing on South Korean firms operating in China has reached its limits.\nAccordingly, Hana Bank, which suffered the biggest drop in net profits among commercial banks, has closed down some branches. After the net profits of the Chinese subsidiary of Hana Bank plunged 68 per cent on year to 14.40 billion won (US$12.04 million) in the first half, the bank has reduced the number of its branches in China from 30 to 27.\nSome analysts pointed out that domestic commercial banks need to come up with a new strategy for China as their earnings gap between China and Việt Nam has been narrowed to $22 million.

VNA/VNS Photo Vũ Sinh\nHÀ NÔI — The private sector was\xa0the main driver of growth for Việt Nam in the first nine months this year, a conference held by the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) heard on Wednesday in Hà Nội.\nCIEM also shared a report it jointly conducted with an\xa0Australian programme to support Vietnam\'s economic reform (Aus4.Reform Program) at\xa0the conference, that stated\xa0economic growth in Q3 and the first nine months maintained at a relatively high level.\nWhile the macro-economy remained\xa0stable, the report said local industrial industries had grown rapidly with the largest contributor to GDP being the\xa0processing industry. Imports and exports also kept up their momentum with a\xa0trade surplus in the first nine months estimated at US$7.1 billion, exceeding the same period in 2018, said the report.\nRegarding the imports and exports, the contribution of FDI enterprises had\xa0slowed while the private sector had\xa0become the main driving force of growth.\nNguyễn Anh Dương, head of CIEM’s General Research, said: ""The FDI sector has slowed with export growth of 5 per cent, or one digit growth, while the private sector reported export growth of two digits.”\nDương told the conference that growth of the private sector was “very impressive” in the context that many domestic private enterprises were not receiving\xa0enough support.\nDương added that\xa0uncertainties caused by\xa0the trade war between the US and China affected a lot of foreign-invested enterprises but was “an opportunity for domestic private enterprises”.\nDuong said local private enterprises\xa0had taken opportunities offered by integration with their adaptability, urging relevant agencies and policymakers to support and create more favourable conditions for them.\nHowever, the conference also pointed out challenges for the local economy, mentioning the ""return"" of the mining industry, which was considered a threat to the environment and of low value.\nThe report said after three\xa0years of negative growth, the mining industry had\xa0returned to positive growth in the first nine months of this year.\nAt the same time, participants mentioned the quality of growth was not meeting existing potential.\nCIEM’s former director Nguyễn Đình Cung, who is also a member of the Prime Minister\'s Economic Advisory Group, warned: ""In FDI investment, the number of projects increased by 26 per cent but the amount\xa0of registered capital decreased by 14.5 per cent.” Thus, Cung doubted the quality of some FDI projects and whether they contributed to local development.\nTo overcome challenges, a CIEM representative suggested continuing to\xa0reform\xa0macro-economic fundamentals, improving the business environment, and creating new drivers for\xa0development with more support for private businesses.\nIn addition, CIEM asked the Government to monitor the exchange rate carefully, adding that the relevant agencies should pay more attention to credit quality not quantity.\nBased on the\xa0report, economists predicted\xa0GDP growth of 7.02 per cent for this year and 6.72 per cent for 2020.— VNS'",2

A large number of workers from the north are moving to work in industrial zones near home. The workforce in Bình Dương now comprises workers from Bình Dương and neighbouring provinces.\n“The province now has 29 industrial and economic zones.

She had gained a share of the lead after back-to-back birdies at 13 and 14, and two-putted for birdie from 50 feet at the final hole, her tap-in lifting her to victory.\n""To be honest, my round today didn\'t go as well as I thought it would,"" said Park, who was just one-under on the front nine with two birdies and a bogey.

451,'Korean scholar says states should not resort to force',"Việt Nam rejects China’s statement on sovereignty over Trường Sa islands\nChina asked to withdraw ships from\xa0Việt Nam’s territorial waters\nViệt Nam voices concern over developments in East Sea at AMM-52\nViệt Nam consistently exercises, safeguards sovereignty by peaceful measures\nVN consistently protects sovereignty in East Sea: spokeswoman\nPresident of the Geopolitics Institute of Korea, Professor-Doctor Lee Woong-Hyeon, talks to Vietnam News Agency correspondent\xa0Mạnh Hùng\xa0in Seoul\xa0about\xa0the recent activities by China\xa0in the East Sea.\nProfessor-Doctor Lee Woong-Hyeon (R) answering VNA correspondent Mạnh Hùng in Seoul\nAs an expert on international relations, can you give us your general assessment on the current security situation in the East Sea and speak about the China's intentions?\nAs far as I know, the Chinese geological survey vessel’s activities in this area are\xa0not new. The Chinese survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 entered waters near the Việt Nam-controlled Vanguard Bank on July 3, with the first encroachment of China’s oil rigs five years ago. The first intrusion of a Chinese oil rig triggered fierce anti-China protests in Việt Nam, without any special international reactions. But this time, the incident upset Việt Nam, the Government and people, and went further to make the United States criticise Beijing for “bullying behavior” in the area. This means that July’s action came from the desire to demonstrate\xa0China’s presence in this area and reflected the recent the US-China relations including economic conflicts.\nAs the result of the trade war with the US, China’s economy is reported to continue to stall, and the Chinese government may want to incite nationalism to distract the public’s attention from some difficult diplomatic situations. Of course, China’s political and military intention in this area should not be excluded. China has remained the power with the upper hand over its neighbours, along with about 25 to 30 military outposts from the Paracel islands to the Spratlys. The dominant status in this area will give China a lot of diplomatic cards at the\xa0negotiating table with the other great powers and with the states in this area including Việt Nam. China’s intention is said to originate from its ‘national interests, virtual or real’, territorial [maritime], military, economic, diplomatic gains\xa0and desire for recognition (in the Hegelian term), which are pursued by all the states in general, especially by the rising great powers.\nIn your opinion, what are legal frameworks necessary for ensuring the security and freedom of aviation and navigation in the sea?\nPersonally, I cast doubts on the capability and possibility of the international law in solving the international territorial problems. But I think, for the peace and prosperity of people, we should not resort to only\xa0naked power or military force. We should not give up the efforts to cite, utilize\xa0and adopt\xa0international norms for the peaceful solving of the problems among states. There is a legal framework for security and peace in this sea besides the general and traditional principle of free navigation.\nThe Vanguard Bank, the westernmost reef of the Spratly islands, hosts Việt Nam’s strategic DK1 oil rigs which are called ‘ocean fortresses’, and sits well within the 200 nautical miles of Việt Nam’s exclusive economic zone. The exclusive economic zone, set by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is the foremost legal frame of reference with which the Hà Nội Government can strengthen its own position. Although the Chinese government has contested the UNCLOS rule, especially as interpreted by Việt Nam and other countries around this sea, Beijing’s method of justification for its action, the nine-dash line, cannot be said to be an international legal frame consented to by other states.\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) dismissed the nine-dash line claim as groundless in 2016, which has not been respected by the Chinese government. But PCA, like other international courts, has no realistic power to\xa0enforce of its own decision. This is the limitation of international norms and legal judgments we\xa0sometimes look to. But a legal frame would be a weak state’s good weapon for criticizing the illegal action of the stronger state\xa0and for getting the world’s opinion support.\nCan you predict developments relating to the security situation in the area in the coming time?\nConsidering the salami-slicing tactics of China\xa0in this area and Hà Nội’s cool (this means ‘reasonable’) and wise policy reaction even under the pressure of Vietnamese people’s anger and protests, we can forecast that outright and armed conflicts will not happen. But every statesman should be careful not to escalate an incident into a serious confrontation or conflict especially in a crisis\xa0which is stirring public protests like this. Crisis management is a statesman’s vital virtue.\nWhen a claimant intrudes into the area which it claims as ‘its area’ or as having an interest in it, its actions are\xa0apt to make itself a recurrent pattern, though not going up to the extreme line. That is the salami-slicing or grey-zone tactic. Of course, those activities threaten\xa0the security situation in the area, provoking the concerns of people. This kind of tactic\xa0will be witnessed for the foreseeable future in this area.\nIn your opinion, what should the Việt Nam authorities do to protect its legitimate sovereignty and interests in the Vanguard Bank in particular and the East Sea in general?\nViệt Nam, sharing a dozen hundred kilometre border with China and having experienced a war with China in 1979, is evaluated as a state with high tolerance of strategic risk, including during the confrontation with China in 2014. At\xa0the end of a very dangerous and collision-possible period of two-month stand-off, China eventually backed down and pulled its energy rig in that year. This is the diplomatically and strategically wise course to be taken in the coming time.\nIn an international crisis threatening the state’s security and sovereignty, the most important stance a state should take is to maintain strategic, theoretical and policy consistency, which could gather\xa0international support and could get the normatively stronger position. And it is needed for academics to study and research the related maritime history of this area, preparing for the possible debate on who the historically and internationally legitimate sovereign of this area should be. Sometimes the pen is mightier than the sword. — VNS",0

The National Assembly is\xa0considering changes to a draft law on PPP\xa0to attract more private investment in the future. — VNA/VNS Photo Huy Hùng\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0Legal plans to help promote more public private partnerships (PPP) in Việt Nam have been submitted to the National Assembly for approval.\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng said only when a concrete legal framework is in place, more private companies will invest in State-owned projects.\nThe draft law, consisting of 11 chapters with 102 articles, supplements a number of policies to the existing Decree No 63/2018/NĐ-CP on PPP investment.\nIt is designed to eliminate the areas that are not realistically suitable for PPP or have been implemented in PPP format but are not effective and unattractive to private sector.\nWith regard to the scale, the Government reported two options for the National Assembly to consider in order\xa0to draw financially capable investors for key infrastructure projects and limit spreading investment.\nFirst, the minimum scale of the projects will be stipulated in the law and the Government will specify details for each field (but not lower than VNĐ200 billion, or US$8.6 million, except for operation and maintenance projects).\nSecond, the law will not stipulate the minimum scale and assign Government to specify the number for each field, which can be adjusted to the country’s socio-economic development periods.\nUnlike public investment projects, partnership schemes are often complex and risky, which requires long-term commitments from investors. The draft law proposes setting up an appraisal council to further investigate each plan.\nPPP projects are divided in three groups, including user-pays (Build-Operate-Transfer, Build-Transfer-Operation, Build-Own-Operate and Operation-Maintenance), government-pays (Building-Transfer-Leasing, Building-Leasing-Transfer) and resources exchange for infrastructure (Building-Transfer).\nThe Government also proposes setting up a development fund and a separate budget to deal especially with these projects.\nEnterprises will be allowed to issue corporate bonds to raise capital for the project but not issue public shares.\nTo ensure the feasibility, the draft law also establishes a mechanism to ensure foreign currency balance with a limit of 30 per cent of the project’s revenue in Vietnamese đồng after subtracting the expenses in Vietnamese đồng.\nIn addition, a mechanism of risk sharing between the Government and investors will also be set up, including adjusting prices, fees or contractual terms but does not exceed 50 per cent of the deficit between actual revenue and contracted revenue.\nVũ Hồng Thanh, chairman of the National Assembly Committee for Economic Affairs, agreed with the need to enact the law but said it still needs further research and thorough review.\nThe establishment of appraisal council for PPP project was necessary, Thanh said, but he also emphasised the efficiency, professionalism and simple administrative procedures to save time and money.\nFor investor selection, Thanh said it must be done through competitive bidding, publicity, transparency, minimising the bidder’s appointment (preferred bidder) or restricted bidding.\nIn the discussion with the PPP law team on Monday, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc also emphasise the importance of the law, saying investors believe it will protect their interest and when in place, they will invest.\nHe said to entice investors, the law should ensure both sides must have economic benefits; procedures should be fast, simple, transparent and objective.\nThe message from the Government’s leader is that all areas could be open for private investment, except for the fields that the State must take control\xa0such as currency, defence and national security. —\xa0VNS'",2
4104,'Blades are being sharpened in Sheffield',"'WILD TIME: Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder is leading his team to the promised land. AFP Photo.\nPaul Kennedy\nWith all the hype and attention around a certain José Mourinho over the weekend, one small achievement would have passed many by.\nGranted, Manchester United are far from the force they once were, but late Sunday night Việt Nam time, minutes before the final whistle, 23-year-old Oli McBurnie scored an equaliser to secure a point for Sheffield United.\nThe result means the team from South Yorkshire sit sixth in the Premier League, ahead of Manchester United, their weekend opponents, plus above Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham.\nBefore the United game, it was revealed Sheffield are paying their entire squad less than Man United currently pay striker Alexis Sanchez, and Sanchez doesn’t even play at Old Trafford, he’s on loan at Inter Milan.\nWhen teams get promoted to the Premier League they often need a massive dose of luck just to survive. Not the Blades.\nThey have taken their introduction to the big time by the scruff of the neck and are not just punching above their weight, but are behaving akin to David toppling Goliath.\nIt is difficult to pinpoint exactly why they have done so well since the beginning of the season, but it is fair to say a lot, if not all, credit must go to their manager, Chris Wilder.\nThe 52-year-old’s playing career was pretty forgettable.\nAs a full-back between 1986 and 2001 he had two spells with the team he now manages and also played for Rotherham United, Notts County, Bradford City, Brighton and Halifax Town.\nI’ll be honest with you, I’d never heard of him.\nAs a manager, he was in charge of Alfreton Town (who?), Halifax, Oxford and Northampton before taking the reins at Bramall Lane.\nLet’s face facts here, he won’t win the Premiership with United, and although they currently sit in sixth place, it is highly unlikely his team will qualify for Europe at the end of the campaign.\nBut what they will do, and in fact have already done many times this season, is make life very, very uncomfortable for the big teams they face.\nTheir football is simple and although their style is uncompromising, they are very much getting results.\nChelsea and Tottenham could only manage draws when United travelled to London. Arsenal were beaten by them and so too were Everton.\nWhen Liverpool, the champions of Europe, paid a visit to Sheffield back in September, the visitors needed a lucky deflection and a mistake by goalkeeper Dean Henderson to ensure they returned across the Pennines with three points.\nSo what next for the Blades? More of the same I imagine.\nIn January, when the likes of Mourinho and Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer splash the cash in the transfer window and spend jackpot lottery wins on a single player, Wilder will do what he does best and\xa0shop around the bargain basement for signings.\nWhen the team got promoted back in May, I’ve no doubt every single Sheffield United fan would have wished for survival.\nBut now, as we approach the end of the first half of the campaign, they must all be on cloud nine.\nNo matter who they face, they will fear no one. And I’ve no doubt Pep Guardiola will be looking at the fixture list with some trepidation ahead of Manchester City’s trip to Bramall Lane in January.\nJurgen Klopp meanwhile as he attempts to lead Liverpool to their first ever Premier League title will certainly be breathing a sigh of relief knowing, albeit with a massive slice of luck, his team have already been to Sheffield and won.\nAs I said, Sheffield United won’t win the Premiership, but they will definitely play a major part in who does.

They must appreciate the importance of a corporate culture and promote democracy by creating corporate cultural values.\nTo build a corporate culture, businesses must build a set of corporate regulations, have transparency in information and perform their social responsibilities, including payment of taxes, ensuring quality of products and services and protecting the environment, Hợp said.\nVũ Thị Hoài Nam, vice president and senior regional manager of Manulife Vietnam, said that leaders had an extremely important role in building and practising corporate culture. If leaders do not care or take seriously these cultural values, it would be impossible to convince staff to perform, causing both them and customers to lose faith in the value of the business.\nExperts also said that building a corporate culture was not easy because each business was made of individuals with different qualifications, skills and personalities.\nMany enterprises had shown interest in building a corporate culture but not many know how to. Building a corporate culture needed solidarity among all members of an enterprise, they concluded. - VNS'",2

A partnership was created in 2016 that made Family responsible for administering community-based HIV testing for high-risk groups, including men having sex with men (MSM), finding cases of infection and persuading them to have antiretroviral (ARV) treatment with the support of Thái Nguyên CDC and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nSince then, the group of 20 members has provided free HIV screening tests for 700 people and accompanied 200 HIV-infected people on their ARV treatment journeys.\nMost of them are students and workers, aged from 18 to 25.\n“It is not simple to convince MSM to take HIV tests as they have to face enormous social stigma and always tend to hide their own identity,” Hoàng said.\n“Over the past four years, we have approached a thousand MSM. In conversations, we avoid mentioning sexual orientations and HIV, instead, we introduce our services of providing free condoms and lubricants. The process has to be repeated over and over again to build trust until they are comfortable enough to expose themselves and are ready to take tests,” he added.\nSo far, this year, the group has uncovered 37 cases of new HIV infections. All of them were sent to Thái Nguyên CDC for treatment.\n“We face huge challenges dealing with clients’ emotions while waiting for their test results,” said Hoàng. “Administering a test is easy, you only need to follow certain steps but no one has ever told us how to psychologically support people while they are waiting for the results.”\nOne of Family’s earliest clients committed suicide. The tragic incident has haunted Hoàng for years.\n“It used to take a week for test results to come back. It was hell for our clients. Sucidal thoughts came up at night when they were all alone. We had to follow them, and talk to them about self-harming,” he said.\n“Now, test results are ready within a day, and we tell them being HIV-positive is not a death sentence as long as they follow ARV treatment. That is really a relief.”\nThere is a bookshelf filled with dozens of Japanese\xa0manga\xa0comics in Hoàng’s tiny bedsit, which also serves as a meeting place and test centre.\n“Clients can read a couple pages of the comics while waiting for their test results. It stops them from thinking too much, even for 20 minutes,” he said.\n\n\nFamily’s bookshelf is filled with comics and brochures for clients to read while waiting for their results. —\xa0VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nPaying back\nLê Thanh Hậu used to be a drug user before witnessing his family break into pieces.\nReturning from a local drug rehab centre in 2016, he started revamping his life by becoming a volunteer at Thái Nguyên Province Outpatient Clinic, supporting ARV patients and searching for new cases of HIV infections.\n“It was strange how health workers at Thái Nguyên CDC treated me dearly like a family member,” Hậu said. “Their kindness motivated me to do something good in order to pay back for the sinful past I left behind.”\nAlong with four friends, Hậu wanders into countless alleys in Thái Nguyên City and nearby localities in search of drug users to convince them to take HIV tests.\n“There used to be some infamous spots where hundreds of needles used to hang out of banana trees,” Hậu said.\n“The situation has changed a lot now. Drug users are getting younger. They prefer amphetamine-type stimulants like ecstasy which make them lose control and become more vulnerable to HIV due to unsafe sex,” he added.\nSome of Hậu’s friends, who were unable to quit the habit, show him where addicts gather.\n“People say I will fall back into my old ways if I keep on visiting drug dens. But no way, I have paid enough,” said Hậu.\nThis year, Hậu’s group has found 18 cases of HIV infections and helped 120 patients to undergo ARV treatment.\n“I receive a monthly allowance of only VNĐ300,000 (US$13) but I never want to quit this job.”\nMore than anyone, Hậu understands the discrimination HIV-infected people have to tolerate.\n“Compared with removing a scar from my arm, fighting against stigma is so difficult. People with HIV need social acceptance and tolerance to step out of their dark zones and undergo treatment. The mission would be impossible without the community’s participation,” he said.\nCommunities make the difference\n“They are our trusted partners,” said CDC Thái Nguyên Deputy Director Lê Ái Kim Anh about Hoàng and Hậu.\nThái Nguyên Province is ranked fourth nationwide in terms of the number of people suffering from HIV, following Hà Nội, HCM City and Hải Phòng, and sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise.\nWith nine colleges and two industrial zones, the province has a high population, making it hard to estimate the number of HIV-positive cases.\nThanks to restless efforts of community groups, more than 79 per cent of people living with HIV know their status, nearly 73 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV receive sustained ARV therapy, and over 95 per cent of them have viral suppression treatment.\n“Communities make the difference in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” said Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control.\n“However, the withdrawal of foreign resources has posed several challenges to these groups as they do not have legal status or financing. We are working with them to overcome these difficulties,” he added.\nTo Hoàng, funding cuts do not bother him much.\n“We estimate there are 5,000 HIV-infected people who have no idea about their status. Our journey has not come to an end yet,” he said.\nAnd to Hậu, “being an event planner helps to sustain my social service.

But after just\xa0three months, the group\xa0stopped using the technology.\nTrịnh Văn Vĩnh, the co-operative\'s director, told Kinh Tế & Đô Thị (Economic and Urban Affairs) newspaper that the technology requires\xa0farmers to keep track of information about their crops and cultivation and then enter it into the software system. Maintaining accurate information with the QR codes takes three to four times the usual efforts than just putting a normal stamp on the packaging to indicate a product\'s origins.\n“After a short trial time, we realised that customers do not really care much about the technology,"" he said.\xa0""Only one to two out of 10 customers scan the codes so we decided to stop applying it.""\nNguyễn Tú Linh, a customer of PT Mart in the city\'s Hà Đông District, told the newspaper that it takes time to get out her smartphone and scan the codes.\n“Each product has many different stamps and codes with various shapes and sizes,"" she said.

VNA/VNS Photo Ánh Tuyết\nCẦN THƠ — A method that involves parents holding their babies to their bare chests has helped triplets born prematurely at the Obstetrics Hospital of Cần Thơ City gain weight and survive.\nThe Kangaroo Care method allows for warm skin-to-skin contact which helps maintain body temperature, respiration and digestion.\nDr Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Hà, deputy head of the hospital’s Neonatal Department, on Monday told Việt Nam News Agency that the babies, including one girl and two boys, were born via vaginal birth after 27 weeks of pregnancy on September 5. They weighed 1,100 grammes, 1,240 grammes and 1,200 grammes.\nBabies born prematurely and at such a low weight face risks such as respiratory failure, low blood glucose, neonatal infection and others, according to Hà.\nInitially, the hospital’s doctors used various methods including continuous nasal positive airway pressure before taking the babies to the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. Their respiration improved two days after treatment.\nAfter that, the newborns were taken to their mother’s room where doctors gave instructions in the Kangaroo Care method to their parents and grandparents.\nThe method improved the immunity of the babies, which were fed breast milk. The babies are now at a reasonable weight.\nThe hospital uses the Kangaroo Care method for premature babies as soon as possible after birth, according to Hà.\nThis method helped raise the survival rate of premature babies with low weight, she said. Doctors recommend the use of the Kangaroo Method until the children are nine months and 10 days old.\nMany obstetrics hospitals in the country have been using this method in an aim to reduce the neonatal mortality rate. Fifty per cent of all deaths in Việt Nam are from premature births.\nPremature newborns are born with immature organs, which lead to a high risk of mortality and difficulty adapting to the environment.\nEach year, more than 10,000 neonatal deaths occur in the country, according to UNICEF Việt Nam.\nIn 1997, Từ Dũ Obstetrics Hospital in HCM City set up a unit called Kangaroo Mother Care which has been used for more than 10,000 premature babies. This kind of care was initiated in 1978 by doctors in Colombia to solve a shortage of incubators. However, many countries, including developed countries, began to use it later. VNS'",1

However, the trade turnover between the two countries is still low, reaching around $470 million per year.\nBusinesses of the two countries said the demand of each side is huge and to exploit this potential effectively, each country needs to proactively seek partners, attend seminars and exhibitions, and enhance direct exchange between trading enterprises.\nBesides, the two countries also have cooperation potential in developing tourism, oil, gas and banking sectors.\nSpeaking to a Vietnam News Agency correspondent, EBA CEO Mohamed Youssef held that the two countries should weather challenges and obstacles to bring two-way trade to $1 billion in the future.\nIt is most important that the business communities of the two countries intensify the contacts for better understanding, thus broadening the scope of their investment and cooperation, he said.\nAt the conference, queries on Việt Nam’s commodity market were settled and many Egyptian companies expressed their hope of increasing exports to Việt Nam, while the Vietnamese peers raised the idea that the two sides should boost cooperation in the direction of prioritising key products on the basis of mutual benefit.\nAccording to the EBA, the conference was a good opportunity for businesses of the two countries to promote bilateral trade exchange, share information and propose solutions and support for businesses with governments and ministries of the two countries. \xa0VNS",2

Export value was equivalent to the 2017 total at nearly US$200 billion, up over 14 per cent. The trade surplus reached $6.4 billion.\nThere were about 110,000 new businesses registered nationwide, which brought the country closer to the goal of having 130,000 new firms this year, while total retail revenue increased by 11.4 per cent.\nThe number of foreign tourist arrivals grew by 22.4 per cent.\xa0Pointing to shortcomings in the economy, PM Phúc said the country had dropped off in the business rankings.\nHe asked ministries and agencies to prepare for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, otherwise the country would lag behind.\xa0Hà Nội, HCM City and major cities should take more drastic measures to develop business and production, he said.\nThe leader also expressed concern about social order and safety in some localities, and instructed drastic measures to be taken to fight crime.\nConcluding the meeting, he instructed ministries and sectors to work on solutions to address problems that were dragging on the country’s business environment and competitiveness.\n“We will fail without innovation,” he said.\nHe also highlighted the slow disbursement of public investment, saying that besides obstacles in terms of institutions such as the Law on Public Investment, shortcomings in management work were another reason, such as slow capital allocations by some ministries and weak guidance from many local administrations.\nThe PM reminded ministries and sectors not to be complacent about their socio-economic achievements in the past 10 months. He stressed the need to boost exports, especially farm produce.\nHe also instructed the government to prepare for the implementation of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).Regarding the drafting of a decree for the enforcement of the Law on Cyber Security, the PM said the work should be done in an open and transparent manner, adding that relevant organizations could be invited to give opinions in the spirit of protecting national security and safety, while ensuring human rights and citizens’ rights.\nRegarding tasks for the remaining two months of the year and 2019, PM Phúc said the Government gave priority to maintaining macroeconomic stability, controlling inflation and facilitating investment and business.\nHe asked the Ministry of Planning and Investment to research and develop plans to improve the country’s business environment ranking.\nJust before the meeting, the PM handed the State President’s decision to appoint Minister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng to the minister.\nOn July 25, the PM signed Decision No.900/QĐ-TTg on assigning the position of Acting Minister of Information and Communications to Major Gen Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng, member of the Party Central Committee, president and chairman of the military-run telecom provider Viettel. \xa0— VNS'",0
3891,'Talking shop - EVFTA: Agricultural exporters\xa0will increase in professionalism',"Đào Thế Anh, Deputy Director of Việt Nam Academy of Agricultural Science\nThe\xa0EU-Việt Nam\xa0Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) is expected to boost Việt Nam's exports, especially agricultural and aquatic products that already have competitive advantages in the European market. However, the domestic agricultural sector will face challenges when penetrating this market of over 800 million people.\nĐào Thế Anh, Deputy Director of the Việt Nam Academy of Agricultural Science, speaks to the Vietnam News Agency about those issues.\nWhat opportunities will the EVFTA offer the agricultural sector in Việt Nam?\nThe European Union (EU) is an important market for Việt Nam's agricultural exports. In 2018, Việt Nam's farming export turnover to the EU was over US$22.7 billion, accounting for over 15 per cent of Việt Nam's total agricultural export revenue.\nThe EVFTA will allow tariff reductions for local agricultural products, increasing competitiveness in export markets and the EU, so export turnover will continue to increase.\nThe European market is very fond of Southeast Asian agricultural products, especially seafood, fruits and rice. However, among Southeast Asian countries, EU customers are most aware of Thai agricultural products. The EVFTA is expected to create chances for more Vietnamese agricultural products to reach EU customers.\nEurope is also one of the markets with the highest quality and food safety requirements in the world. Therefore, those requirements will help Việt Nam's agricultural sector, especially processing firms, gradually increase professionalism in production and processing of export farming products.\nAre non-tariff barriers the biggest challenge for our country's agriculture sector?\nDespite advantages from reductions in tax, Vietnamese agricultural products may find it difficult to enter the EU market because of non-tariff barriers such as food safety standards and quality control. Fresh exports to the EU must all have a Global Gap (Global Good Agricultural Practices) certificate.\nTo get this certification, businesses and cooperatives must build concentrated planting areas. In addition, the stages of preliminary processing must meet the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) certificate. These are all standards at the highest level.\nRegarding food safety, Europe has scientific management and regular updates of risks, so besides learning by themselves, local businesses need support from the State in updating information and training to keep up with modern management in food safety and quality of the European market.\nAt present, Vietnamese enterprises still lack information about those trade barriers. After the EVFTA was signed, many European businesses sought suppliers of Vietnamese food products but they required those products to have Global Gap and HACCP certificates, as well as plant and animal breeds with intellectual property protection and clear origin.\nMany businesses still do not know about these requirements, therefore, it is essential to communicate to them about food safety standards in Europe.\nMoreover, goods entering the European market must comply with intellectual property regulations. Việt Nam has now exported to Europe 41 products with protected geographical indications in Việt Nam, while 171 European products have protected geographical indications in the domestic market. This means the products with protected geographical indications, such as Quảng Trị pepper and Bình Phước cashew, have a great opportunity to export to the EU. However, most businesses do not know about this opportunity.\nIn the process of integration, local enterprises will face increased competition. What can local exporters do to survive?\nTo enter the European market, the first thing the import-export enterprises need to understand is the laws of import/export countries, especially intellectual property laws. The legal system is the basis for resolving complaints or questions.\nFor agricultural exports to Europe, origin is also important. Therefore, local businesses and cooperatives must comply with regulations on transparency and product origin. Now, electronic traceability facilities such as QR Codes and Blockchain will help us avoid counterfeit goods. They will also reduce risks of unfair competition.\nWhat solutions are available to ensure traceability of raw materials for export products?\nIf an enterprise wants to export its products to the EU, it needs Global Gap certification for those products. To get this certification, it must have a concentrated production region or a network of farms and cooperatives developed under Global Gap standards. That means it must reorganise production.\nNow, Việt Nam has a production area code certificate issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, having standards approaching Global Gap. Therefore, businesses need to sign contracts to purchase raw material with farms and cooperatives that are granted the production area code.\nIt is necessary to have cooperation between businesses and cooperatives for sustainable development of an agricultural product supply for export to the European market.\nWhat policies can ensure smooth bilateral trade and also protect the interests of domestic businesses and products?\nThe State should strengthen legal knowledge for local businesses. Many cooperatives have eligible products for export but the cooperatives’ leaders cannot speak foreign languages so the State needs to strengthen training in this respect.\nLeaders of businesses and cooperatives also need more training on information technology in the context of e-commerce development. These are new skills, as well as a focus on how to produce well in the field and how to manage value chains including post-harvest technology and understanding of the world market. - VNS",2

However, recent data shows Việt Nam still reports low rates of repeat visits. Why is this?\nViệt Nam ranks 63rd among 140 countries and territories in the recently released Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) 2019 released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), jumping four places from the latest 2017 ranking. Compared to regional peers, Việt Nam has achieved the largest overall improvement in competitiveness as other competitors just stepped up three places or even receded.\nThe country had the largest strides in ICT readiness, international openness, safety and security, and ground and port infrastructure.\nHowever, Việt Nam still lags the rest of the region considerably with regards to its tourist service and air transport infrastructure, weakness in environmental sustainability, the lack of product and location diversification, transport and services infrastructure and low-skilled labour force. In\xa0international openness, Việt Nam’s visa regime, which has been liberalised somewhat in recent years, still lags compared to the relatively more open visa policies of key regional competitors.\nThese patterns of tourism development threaten to negatively affect the quality of the visitor experience in many of Việt Nam’s destinations, contributing to low rates of repeat visits. The share of repeat international visitors to Việt Nam stood at about 32-40 per cent in 2017, which is low compared to key regional competitors such as Thailand, where 60-70 per cent of international arrivals in 2016 were returning visitors, and Indonesia, which had 55 per cent repeat visitors in 2016.\nWhat are the visa hassles that\xa0hold back Việt Nam's tourism sector?\nViệt Nam currently grants visa-free travel to nationals of 26 countries. This compares to visa-free travel for 57 nationalities to Thailand, 168 nationalities to Indonesia, 162 nationalities to Malaysia and 132 nationalities to the Philippines. Việt Nam has introduced an electronic visa system for citizens from 80 countries.\nThe 15-day limit for travel has also puzzled tourists from long-distance European countries. They say a complete tour should be 20 to 30 days to take in the main sights in Việt Nam.\nTherefore, TAB suggests more flexible measures be adopted, such as extending the visa waiver\xa0to 30 days.\nNot to mention, there is a high risk of inaccuracy in sources of information guiding visa applications for foreigners. According to a poll by TAB, 15 per cent of foreign\xa0visitors asked for information from their embassies, 14 per cent through the Việt Nam National Administration of Tourism, 26 per cent through travel agencies, and the rest get it from informal channels or through the internet.\nViệt Nam should also focus on attracting foreign visitors from Europe, the US, Australia and New Zealand who tend to travel longer and spend more on holidays.\nTrần Trọng Kiên, Chairman\xa0of the National Tourism Advisory Board (TAB),\xa0Chairman and CEO of Thiên Minh Group\nTrần Trọng Kiên, Chairman\xa0of the National Tourism Advisory Board (TAB), Chairman and CEO of Thiên Minh Group\nSome have argued that most international visitors to Việt Nam originate from Northeast Asia, who tend\xa0to have a short length of stay and spend less\xa0than visitors from the longer-haul markets such as Europe and the US, which could harm\xa0the tourism sector in the long-term. What’s your opinion?\nThe vast majority of international visitors to Việt Nam originate from Northeast Asia, especially China, South Korea and Japan. These three countries accounted for 60 per cent of Việt Nam’s international arrivals in 2018.\nIn the first nine months of 2019, international arrivals to Việt Nam reached 12.9 million, of which visitors from China accounted for a significant amount of 30.9 per cent.\nIt is fortunate for Việt Nam to welcome such a large amount of visitors from Northeast Asian countries, whose economies\xa0are growing very fast. Our location allows us to greet these\xa0visitors. I believe they are strategic markets of Việt Nam.\nThe point is we must find ways to effectively exploit these\xa0markets. For example, China is growing very fast and I am sure there are many Chinese tourists who are willing to pay a lot. Our job is to access these tourists.\nWhat\xa0needs to be done to boost the image of Việt Nam and promote the country’s tourism?\nWe must attach great important to enhancing visitors’ experience. Every foreigner coming to Việt Nam having a good experience will share it to five or six other potential visitors. Now we are greeting some 18 million international arrivals annually, which means we could\xa0welcome 70 million potential clients in the future.\nMarketing and promotion must also be increasingly targeted at relatively higher-spending visitor source markets.\nNew and higher-quality tourism products need to be developed, both to encourage visitors to spend more but also to stay longer. This will also help address current visitor perceptions that Việt Nam lacks tourism product variety and encourage a higher share of repeat visitors. — VNS",2

In recent years, the loans have also helped revive traditional villages.\nThe developed farms help create jobs for rural women and people with disabilities, improving living\xa0standards in many poor areas.\n“The programme’s effect was recognised by local authorities and residents, but the capital for loans is still limited so it has not satisfied\xa0all of the demand for jobs in rural areas,"" said Hồng.\nMoving forward, the bank will co-operate with provincial Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs to supervise the use of the loans\xa0and assess the results of the programme.\nThe latest report by the Việt Nam Bank for Social Polices showed that at the end of May this year, the total fund for job creation\xa0jobs was VNĐ16.9 trillion ($732\xa0million).

As part of this, the government is aiming to bring 70 per cent of the adult population under the formal banking system by 2020.\nOther objectives include the expansion of point-of-sale infrastructure and increased payments of utility bills through electronic methods.\nTo further boost non-cash transactions, the State Bank of Việt Nam has granted licenses to 30 non-bank companies as of July 2019 to provide payment services in the country, with most offering services through online and mobile channels.\nBanks are also expanding their services to both rural and urban locations in the form of new branches, mobile van branches and digital self-service branches. Agribank now runs a fleet of more than 60 mobile banking vans across the country to serve customers primarily in remote areas.\nMeanwhile, digital-only banks have also made inroads into Việt Nam during the review period, tapping into the tech-savvy millennial customer base. Digital-only bank Timo was launched in Việt Nam in 2016 while VPBank’s YOLO followed in September 2018, offering a digital account and a Mastercard debit card.\nChalla added: “The government’s increasing focus on achieving a ‘less-cash’ economy, the emergence of new payment card technologies such as EMV and contactless, the advent of digital-only banks, and a strong e-commerce market will support the growth of electronic payments during the forecast period.” — VNS'",2

We hold very high expectations on the results of the summit.\n“If there would be any statement on the denuclearisation of the Korea Peninsula and an official end of the Korean War at the summit, it would bring about peace for the Peninsula and contribute to world peace and the development of humankind.”\nYoon said he hoped the day would come when there were no longer two Korean countries, but instead just one nation.\n“I strongly believe there will come a day when there is no longer a South Korea and North Korea, but just the single name, Korea,” he said.\n“However there are still many obstacles to overcome to reach that day. With the upcoming summit, however, I believe it will come sooner.”\nOne thing that is guaranteed from this month’s meeting is the positive impact hosting the event will have for Hà Nội and Việt Nam.\nLê Hồng Hiệp believes the capital city is the perfect choice.\n“Hà Nội is where North Korea has the embassy,” he said. “And it’s a very important condition for North Korea to have the embassy where the summit takes place because they need to communicate back to Pyongyang.\n“Hà Nội is also famous for its ability to host major international events without incidents in the past. It is also within the range of North Korea’s aircrafts. So it’s quite convenient for North Korea to hold the meeting in Hà Nội.\n“The US side indicated that the summit should be held in Đà Nẵng. And now they have agreed to hold the summit in Hà Nội, meaning they have made a concession to North Korea. But it’s not a bad idea for the US, either, because Hà Nội can meet the demands of security, logistics and media for the summit from a US perspective.”\nHiệp, who is a fellow with the Singapore-based ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, thinks the summit is a great opportunity to showcase Hà Nội to the world.\nHe added: “This event will be a good chance for Việt Nam to promote its international standing. It can be a very good opportunity for Hà Nội and Việt Nam to sell its success story to the world and thereby attract more tourists and investors to the country.”\nSung-Yoon Loon, an expert on North Korea at Tufts University in Massachusetts, America, told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper: “Việt Nam, as Singapore did, will gain much in publicity, image, tourism.\n“Việt Nam will come across as a cosmopolitan, peace-seeking state that is a legitimate neutral ground for this historic moment.\n“The summit pageantry will cast Việt Nam in a very positive light around the world. The summit will not only enhance Việt Nam’s international stature but also its leverage vis-a-vis China and the US in the short-term.”\nThe exact location of the venue for the summit is yet to be announced. — VNS'",0

Humans who relied on hunting and gathering began to settle and use various techniques to farm.\nThe third was the Scientific Revolution. With the emergence of modern science, major countries entered the overseas market more freely.\nThe fourth expansion was known as\xa0the Industrial Revolution, which featured the\xa0development of steam engines, expanding\xa0productivity rapidly.\nFinally, Knowledge Revolution 5.0 features the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as artificial intelligence, 5G and\xa0smart sensing, which\xa0is poised to dramatically change human life.\nChang stressed many challenges lie ahead as the world is witnessing a trade war between the US and China,\xa0political crises such as Brexit and the Hong Kong protests,\xa0as well as the adverse impacts of climate change.\nHe said that it’s time for countries to act toward globalisation goals and reconciliation of free trade and innovation.\n“We cannot succeed alone,” Chang stressed.\nHe called for an increase in knowledge-sharing as knowledge is a decisive factor\xa0in information-based decision making.\nEsko Aho, former Prime Minister of Finland and co-chair of the event, said since the 2000s, the challenges have increased, not decreased. Major technological invention and innovation drive economic and social developments but there are more technological interruptions without fundamental changes in economic, political and social policies as well.\nTherefore, social and economic models should be revised\xa0to get full benefit of\xa0technological advances, Aho said.\nWang Jia Rui, vice chairman of the Chinese People′s Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of China Soong Ching Ling Foundation, said the world is going through a transformation unseen in a century.\nThe most striking feature of the changes is uncertainty, he said, adding that governments seem unable to catch up with changes caused by new technological evolution and industrial revolution.\nTo cope with the changes, countries need to understand the laws of history, identify the general trend of the world and share knowledge, he said.\nHe emphasised that countries need to focus on long-term goals by working together in an open and inclusive manner, finding common factors and common interest of each other in order to build mutual trust and co-exist.\nThe World Knowledge Forum, one of Asia’s largest annual business forums, takes place from yesterday to Friday with the participation of 250 leaders from political, economic, business and technology sectors and 3,500 attendees. — VNS'",1

Of these, 780 have met standards as of the end of July.\nThe department has organised training for officials in charge of food safety management and fruit stores in these districts. It has also worked with food preservation equipment providers - Sanaky\xa0and Alaska – that agreed to sell their products to fruit shop owners in the city for 10-15 per cent lower than market price.\nNguyễn Mạnh Hà, vice chairman of Long Biên District People’s Committee, said positive changes have been\xa0made over the past year in his district.\n“Ninety per cent of fruit stores have shelves and all businesses selling ready-cooked food have cabinets to store food,” he said, adding that all stores have signed a food safety commitment.\nTrần Thị Hiền, a fruit seller in Long Biên District’s Ngọc Lâm Market, said since the market’s management board promoted a programme on ""civilised trade"", she has realised her duty is to follow the regulations.\n“I’ve committed myself to fight trade fraud. The price of each kind of fruit\xa0must be publicised.\n""I promise to treat customers friendly and with the most hospitality,” she told Việt Nam News.\nWhile efforts to improve the food service have had success, experts said\xa0challenges remain.\nThe quantity of fruits supplied from Hà Nội is only 30 per cent while 70 per cent is imported from other provinces and cities. Thus, it was difficult for many wholesalers to provide bills of sale to prove where the food comes from.\nMany\xa0consumers don’t pay attention to product origin and buy fruit\xa0in places convenient\xa0for them, allowing the existence of fruit street vendors.\nSome market\xa0management boards failed to fulfil their duties so substandard food still existed in some places.\nSolutions\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the initiative, Lan said\xa0the DoIT would work with relevant units to deal with street vendors.\nThe department has been drafting a project to supply safe fruits to local consumers, she said.\nLê Hồng Thăng, director of Hà Nội Department of Industry and Trade, said the project would soon be expanded to all fruit shops in the capital city including those at wholesale markets. Awareness campaigns will also be strengthened to spread knowledge about the project’s objective as well as regulations on the\xa0trade of fruits.\nThe department plans tp collaborate with districts’ People’s Committee in advising fruit stores to complete procedures\xa0to receive project signboards, he said.\nThăng said\xa0during the project’s implementation, the Hà Nội Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has worked with the association of small and medium-size enterprises to apply QR codes for tracing the origin of agricultural products in the city.\n“So far, 80.5 per cent of the city’s fruit stores use QR codes,” he said.\nChu Phú Mỹ, director of Hà Nội Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the department would continue working with other provinces and cities in exchanging information relating to food safety, supervising and advertising their safe food in Hà Nội.\nRelevant departments were asked to submit recommendations to the municipal authority regarding the establishment of a special zone dedicated to the sale of safe agricultural products with clear origin at traditional and wholesale markets, he said.\xa0— VNS'",1

VNS File Photo/TTXVN.\nHCM CITY -- Developing HCM City into a supplier of high-quality human and technological resources for the logistics industry was the subject of a recent conference held in the city organised by the HCM City Department of Industry and Trade in coordination with the Việt Nam Logistics Research and Development Institute.\nSpeaking at the event titled “Project for Development of the Logistics Sector in HCM City until 2025, with a vision to 2030”, Hoàng Minh Trí, a former head of the HCM City Institute for Research and Development, said the city should also become a hub for logistics workforce training for the Southern Focal Economic Zone since it has many top universities, hi-tech parks and research laboratories.\nTo turn the city into a logistics hub would require a lot of land and a large workforce, which would worsen the congestion plaguing it, he said.\nBesides, this was not envisaged in its master plan for economic development approved by the Government in 2010, he pointed out.\nThe city planned to develop clean industries which do not harm the environment, and use advanced technologies which do not requires a large workforce, he said.\nOverloaded infrastructure\nHCM City has two major infrastructure facilities, Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport and Cát Lái port, both overstretched.\nTân Sơn Nhất is crowded both inside and outside and any increase in goods transport or logistics services would make these traffic problems even worse, raising transportation costs.\nConstruction of a flyover to ease traffic outside the airport cost over US$10 million but it would require 10 times that amount to clear the congestion at Cát Lái.\nFurthermore, traffic congestion and pollution affect people’s lives and have a negative impact on the efforts to attract foreign investment.\nFor these reasons, HCM City should be developed into a human resource hub for the Southern Focal Economic Zone, supplying labour for the Cái Mép – Thị Vải Port Complex (in Bà Rịa – Vũng Tàu Province) and preparing to do the same for the proposed Long Thành International Airport in Đồng Nai Province, Trí said.\nOnce construction of Beltway Nos 3 and 4 and the Bến Lức – Long Thành – Dầu Giây Highway is completed, goods from the Mekong Delta could be directly transported to Long Thành International Airport and the Cái Mép – Thị Vải Port Complex bypassing HCM City, he added. — VNS'",1

He’d lost the previous six.\nBut in the early hours of Sunday morning Vietnamese time, Klopp’s trademark grin was as wide as it has ever been as he\xa0dished out hugs to all and sundry. And there were plenty of takers in red.\nFor Klopp’s Liverpool the game could not have started any better.\nJust 30 seconds in, a cross from the left by Sadio Mane struck the outstretched arm of Tottenham’s Moussa\xa0Sissoko and the ref pointed to the spot.\nHarsh maybe, but the decision was backed by VAR and Salah made no mistake from 12 yards.\nIf Mauricio Pochettino’s game plan was to let Liverpool have the majority of possession and catch them on the break, then he needed a plan B. His players couldn’t deliver.\nThe onus was now on Spurs to hunt for an equaliser, but with a clearly half-fit Harry Kane upfront, they created nothing in the opening period.\nIn fact the only real excitement of the first half after the early goal was the appearance of a scantily clad female pitch invader who sprinted past Liverpool’s Vigil van Dijk, a feat not many have managed this season.\nAfter the break Tottenham continued to dominate possession but had nothing to show for it.\nIt wasn’t until the last 15 minutes Liverpool goalkeeper Allisson Becker was called into action making neat saves from Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura.\nTime was running out for Spurs and on 87 minutes substitute Origi hammered the final nail into Tottenham’s coffin putting Liverpool two in front. Game over.\nIn four years Klopp has turned a bang average Liverpool team into the champions of Europe, a final they have reached twice in two years.\nNext year\xa0the game will be held at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul where Liverpool famously won the trophy in 2005.\nWill they be there again to defend their prize?

2905,'THACO sets up major auto parts industrial park',"Overview of THACO's factories in Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Quảng Nam Province. — Photo courtesy of THACO\nHCM CITY — Developing supporting industries to increase the use of locally produced parts is an urgent requirement if Việt Nam's automobile industry is to be developed, and this will also help grow other industries.\nIn the context of the country’s increasingly deeper integration and facing fierce competition from car imports from ASEAN member countries and elsewhere in the world, investment in supporting industries to increase the rate of use of locally made parts and gradually enter the global supply chain is the direction chosen by many businesses to improve their competitiveness and ensure sustainable growth.\nTrường Hải Auto Corporation (THACO) is one of the pioneers and largest investors in supporting industries.\nBased on the situation on the ground in the automobile industry and the company’s production and business, THACO developed a strategy for increasing the use of local parts and participation in the global value chain right at the beginning when it invested in the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in 2003.\nIn addition to investing in new auto manufacturing and assembly plants and upgrades to existing plants to increase automation and digital management for mass production to meet customers' specific requirements, THACO has built Việt Nam's largest automobile parts manufacturing industrial park at the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Quảng Nam Province. It is almost 100 hectares in size.\nIt has 12 factories producing automobile parts, a mechanical engineering complex, not only supplying THACO's auto assembly factories and other companies but also exporting to Southeast Asian markets and elsewhere.\nThe products made in these factories include interior and exterior items for buses, trucks and passenger cars; composite components; leaf springs; glass; air-conditioners; bumpers; auto frames; seats and seat covers; wire harnesses; chassis; and many others.\nThe factories have acquired technology from Japan and South Korea and installed modern equipment and use intelligent management systems throughout the production chain from ordering, to manufacturing and distribution.\nFor instance, the automotive springs plant uses production technologies transferred from South Korea’ s Daewon Group with a modern machinery system such as heat treatment line, ram line, shot blasting line, zinc coating line and quality control equipment on each stage.\nThe plastic components plant is equipped with a 3,200-tonne-injection moulding system and the most advanced plastic coating technology in Việt Nam with paint robots and an automatic paint feeding system.\nThe automobile seat plant has modern, automatic machines imported from Europe and South Korea, which produce seats for many different models and brands.\nTo master its own technologies and designs, THACO has invested in an R&D centre.\nIt also promotes joint ventures and collaborates with partners to acquire new technologies to improve their products and receive technical support for manufacturing spare parts and components for trucks, buses and passenger cars from Korea and Japan.\nTHACO has completely mastered the technologies used in manufacturing components like glass, seats, springs, wires, mechanical engineering components (passenger cars’ moving parts, trunks, exhaust pipes, hydraulic cylinders, bus frame, and punching components), plastic components (bumpers and interior components), air conditioning, composite components and others.\nIncreasing local parts rate, exports\nBy investing in spare parts manufacturing plants, THACO has achieved a local parts use rate for certain auto models of over 40 per cent, meeting the regional value content (RVC) criterion and enjoying the zero tax rate when exporting to ASEAN countries while also exporting components to other countries and gradually joining the global value chain.\nThe largest exports are of car bumpers, passenger car wiring kits, leaf springs, and seat covers for passenger cars, with Korea, Japan, Russia, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Germany being the main export markets.\nTHACO’s component exports were worth over US$20 million last year and are expected to rise to $25 million this year. The company plans to expand its exports to the Europe and America in the coming time.\nIt plans to invest further in building new supporting industries plants to enhance automation, establish joint-venture components factories for Mazda vehicles when the output reaches 50,000 vehicles a year and acquire technology from companies who supply components to Mazda.\nIt will also continue to enter into joint ventures and partnerships with foreign companies to build factories for manufacturing products for export in the THACO Chu Lai Industrial Park, tie up with Kia Motors’s suppliers to produce high-tech parts, and enter the Kia and Foton OEM component supply chain in Việt Nam.\nTHACO also plans to develop non-auto products based on its existing technology platforms with appropriate quality and competitive prices to meet customer needs. — VNS",2

Ltd., said mid-priced serviced apartments have mushroomed in the last two years with average monthly rents of around $500.\nThese are targeted at relatively wealthy tenants who have to work in these areas for short periods, he said.\nRecently, they have also been seen in suburban districts like Tân Bình, Bình Tân and Gò Vấp, he said.\n“In the past few years, serviced apartments have been recognised as a safe and profitable channel for investment.”\nNguyễn Hoàng, head of R&D at DKRA Việt Nam, said mid-priced serviced apartments are preferred by young tenants. While expatriates working for multinational groups usually prefer regular apartments in inner districts, the young tenants prefer comfortable mid-range serviced apartments which offer them privacy, instead of apartment buildings and boarding houses.\nMost of them are in five- to seven-storey complexes built on smallish plots of land in inner districts. A complex could have seven to 30 units measuring 20-40sq.m and costing $350-$380 per month.\nIn suburban districts such as Bình Thạnh and Gò Vấp, they could cost VNĐ4-6 million for 20-40sq.m units.\nHoàng said these are targeted at medium-income civil servants and workers who spend long hours at work.\xa0— VNS.'",2

3438,"'Strong growth, but rising bottleneck risks forecast for Việt Nam'","'Growth in services is expected to support headline growth for Việt Nam over the coming quarters. — Photo nld.vn\nHÀ NỘI — Fitch Solutions has revised up its real GDP growth forecast for Việt Nam to 6.9 per cent in 2019, from 6.5 per cent previously, in light of the strong growth print in the third quarter of 2019.\nIn the latest report, Fitch has maintained its 2020 growth forecast for Việt Nam at 6.8 per cent.\nReports from the General Statistics Office (GSO) showed that real GDP growth came in at 7.3 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2019, up from 6.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2019.\nAccording to Fitch, the acceleration was underpinned by the ongoing influx in companies from China amid the US-China trade war, given that manufacturing sector growth continued to outperform.\nThe acceleration in headline growth in Q3 2019 was driven by the manufacturing sector, which grew by 12.0 per cent year-on-year versus 10.0 per cent year-on-year in Q2 2019. Growth in the construction sector also picked up to 9.7 per cent year-on-year in Q3 2019, from 9.1 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter. Both of these components helped to propel the overall industrial sector’s growth contribution to 3.6 percentage points, its highest in at least five years.\nHowever, Fitch noted it is seeing signs that the surge in companies relocating to Việt Nam is putting increasing stress on the country’s infrastructure and labour force.\nViệt Nam’s manufacturing sector has without a doubt been a beneficiary of the US-China trade war, which has accelerated the structural shift in low-end electronics manufacturing and textiles manufacturing to the country from China. However, the sudden influx of companies appears to be putting considerable strain on the current level of infrastructure in the country.\nBesides, there are increasing reports of a growing shortage of qualified workers, and this has put significant upside pressure on wages. Average monthly wages increased by 13.0 per cent year-on-year in Q3 2019. On a year-on-year basis from January to September 2019, the average wages of executives have risen by 16.7 per cent, technical workers by 12.2 per cent, and unskilled labourers by 17.4 per cent.\nThough Việt Nam’s average monthly wages are still low compared with other low-cost manufacturing hubs in the region, at about US$290 versus $470 in Thailand and $580 in China’s manufacturing sector, Fitch highlighted that a persistent sharp increase in wages as well as the inconvenience associated with logistical delays could begin to weigh on the manufacturing sector’s growth rate.\n“That said, we expect growth in construction and services to support headline growth over the coming quarters,” Fitch noted, explaining that the Vietnamese authorities are aware of the infrastructure bottlenecks and are proactively trying to fast track transport infrastructure projects to alleviate the traffic congestion.\nBesides, Fitch forecast the robust FDI inflow, which reached total registered capital of $22.6 billion in the first eight months of 2019 against $35.5 billion during the whole of 2018, will support further demand for banking and financial services.\nIn particular, FDI in the manufacturing sector will also increase demand for transport and warehousing services, Fitch projected. — VNS'",2

This would create poor internal co-operation and troublesome procedures, leaving bad experiences for customers, he said.\nTo avoid this kind of fragmented management, company departments should work closely with each other to improve customer services.\nIn addition to making sure that their products and services work as promised, businesses should provide conveniences such as ease of access to their products and services, and leave consumers with positive experiences and memories.\nAt the conference, Nguyễn Sơn Hải Đăng, technical sales manager at IT consultancy InfoFabrica, introduced a Freshbots product, a codeless bot-building platform from Freshworks, a US customer engagement software company and a partner of InfoFabrica.\nThe Freshbots product creates chatbots that improve customer services such as answering frequently asked questions and assisting customers in buying products and services.\nVũ Mạnh Cường, IT director of agricultural corporation Wilmar CLV, said that businesses should avoid irrelevant landing pages, and annoying advertisements and cumbersome checkout processes in today's digital landscape.\nMore than half of Việt Nam's population uses the internet and smartphones, with the trend expected to rise in the future.\nThe conference was held by CIO Việt Nam, a community formed to promote learning and networking in the IT field, and the High Quality Vietnamese Product Business Association. - VNS",2

Historical reality has proven this.”\nThe spokesperson reiterated Việt Nam’s consistent stance that all international disputes, including those relating to sovereignty over Hoàng Sa and Trường Sa, must be settled by peaceful measures in accordance with international law, including United Nations Charter and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982.\n""Việt Nam wishes that China will join efforts in developing the bilateral relationship and maintaining peace, security and stability in the region,"" Hằng said.\nThe Chinese spokesperson has also asked that Việt Nam should refrain from actions that could “complicate matters or undermine peace and stability” in the East Sea, just a few weeks after a simmering stand-off between the two countries when China deployed the survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 08 and a group of escort vessels right into Vietnamese Exclusive Economic Zone and continental shelf, provided for by UNCLOS 1982.\nChina has also been criticised for engaging in aggressive building of manmade features in the East Sea and militarising them.\nIn 2016 July, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration – established pursuant to the UNCLOS 1982 – has ruled legally invalid China’s sweeping nine-dash claims over the East Sea in the landmark Philippines vs China case.\nHowever, China refused to take part in the tribunal process and categorically rejected the verdict.\nImportant framework\nDirector of the Department of Law and International Treaty under Việt Nam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lê Thị Tuyết Mai, Canadian Ambassador to Việt Nam Deborah Paul, and EU Ambassador to Việt Nam Giorgio Aliberti have affirmed the crucial role of the UNCLOS in managing activities of nations at sea over the past 25 years and said the convention is an important framework for countries to address disputes and enhance maritime cooperation, during the second ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) workshop on implementing UNCLOS held on Wednesday in Hà Nội.\nBased on the convention, a number of initiatives have been proposed to promote cooperation between ASEAN member nations, and between the bloc and its dialogue partners to cope with marine security challenges.\nDuring the two-day workshop, participants focus discussions on measures to increase the efficiency of implementing the UNCLOS and related international legal documents in addressing maritime challenges such as sovereignty disputes, delimitation of maritime boundary, law enforcement at sea, maritime pollution, and climate change as well as terrorism and piracy.\nThey will also exchange views on new developments in the interpretation of the UNCLOS, share experience and new realities in law enforcement at sea and put forth recommendations to further reinforce cooperation between nations and strengthen the role of mechanisms and frameworks in sea and ocean governance. — VNS'",0

1536,'Railway stations must stay in city centres: experts',"'Hà Nội Railway Station. Experts recommend keeping stations in city centres\xa0to serve as interchanges for\xa0public transport. — VNA/VNS Photo Huy Hùng\nHÀ NỘI — While Việt Nam Railway wants to keep its stations in city centres, many localities plan to push them\xa0to outlying areas, pleading\xa0pressure on inner-city traffic infrastructure, Thanh Niên (Young People) newspaper has reported.\nIn 2017, Hà Nội Police put forward a proposal to move the historic Hà Nội Railway Station, which was built in 1902, to the other side of the Hồng (Red) River or Thường Tín District, saying with 10km of railway running through the capital and many level crossings, the station was\xa0putting an enormous burden\xa0on the city’s traffic infrastructure\xa0and posing the threat\xa0of accidents.\nThe railway sector fiercely opposed the plan.\nBefore Hà Nội, the Government had given permission to Đà Nẵng to move its railway station out of the city centre under a\xa0public-private partnership model. The project, however, has been delayed due to funding\xa0difficulties.\nĐà Nẵng recently relaunched the project under the form of a build-transfer\xa0(BT) model with\xa0total investment of VNĐ12 trillion (US$516.5 million).\nThe central provinces of Bình Định and Khánh Hoà have also shown an interest in relocating their main railway stations in\xa0Quy Nhơn and Nha Trang.\nThe Ministry of Transport has approved the Hà Nội-based Tuấn Dung Group to conduct a pre-feasibility study in\xa0Nha Trang in the form of a BT. In return, the corporation will receive an area of land where the current station is located once it moves.\n“Golden locations” where\xa0railway stations are located in big cities are targets of many large private developers. Therefore, relocating stations is not simply a question of easing traffic congestion but also of a conflict of interest among authorities, citizens and enterprises.\nThere are rising concerns about how these areas will be used when stations are relocated. If new apartments or high-rise offices are built, the initial purpose of reducing traffic jams will not be accomplished.\nThe\xa0historic, cultural\xa0and architectural values of stations\xa0also need to be considered before they are relocated.\nTokyo, Paris, Frankfurt and\xa0Beijing all have railway stations in downtown areas, serving huge numbers of passengers each day.\nVũ Anh Minh, director of the Việt Nam Railway Company, said the railway had two preeminent characteristics – safety and convenience in terms of favourable locations. Big cities usually develop overpasses or tunnels to address traffic congestion caused by inner-city railways instead of relocating stations to save expenses.\n“Localities are not interested in railways because they do not generate fast money. However, they must ensure the benefits of citizens, the country and the railway sector in developing projects,” he said.\nTo utilise stations’ “golden locations”, Minh said they planned to upgrade existing facilities for use as offices.\nArchitect Ngô Viết Nam Sơn said central stations such as Hà Nội and\xa0Sài Gòn could\xa0become interchange hubs connecting North-South routes with metro lines. Relocating these stations would mean\xa0missing a chance to\xa0develop\xa0public transport.\n“To reduce congestion, the railway sector could\xa0reduce freight carried to and from central stations and focus on transporting passengers instead,” he said. — VNS'",1

Approval by the NA was not needed at that time.\nAfter investment costs were re-calculated by consulting agencies, costs increased to more than VNĐ47.300 trillion in 2010.\nThe city administration attributed the rising costs to price changes for construction materials, an increase in the minimum wage, and the depreciation of the Vietnamese\xa0đồng\xa0and Japanese yen, among others.\nIn August 2011, the Prime Minister agreed to the city’s proposed project adjustments. But with investments reaching more than VNĐ47.3 trillion, the National Assembly\xa0then had to approve the amount.\nMeanwhile, metro line No 2\xa0connecting Bến Thành and Tham Lương in District 12\xa0is now scheduled to open in 2026, a two-year delay from its 2024 goal.\nThe metro line 2\xa0project has also seen costs nearly double, from VNĐ26 trillion to VNĐ48 trillion. This\xa0funding has not been approved.\xa0Construction on the second metro line was supposed to start in 2014 and be completed last year, but so far only an operating centre has been built.\nLast month, Nguyễn Thành Phong, chairman of the People’s Committee, said the\xa0construction of the first metro line could stop as contractors who have not been paid are likely to stop work, which could result in legal issues.

However, their contribution to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remains modest and is tending to fall.\nHe suggested learning from international experience to fully tap the power of new-style co-operatives and collective economic models.\n”Mechanisms to develop co-operatives and working groups must be fine-tuned, and co-ordination with other economic sectors, especially businesses, strengthened\xa0towards opening up more new markets for farmers,” the Governement leader said.\nHe also asked for facilitating labour training, land and finance-credit policies, science-technology, and infrastructure upgrades, requiring tapping advantages and potential of co-operative models to make profound and basic changes in agricultural production and rural lives.\nDeputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ said the outcomes of the teleconference will serve as important scientific evidence to report to the Politburo, thus contributing to policy-making in the near future.\nMinister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng said since the launch of the resolution 15 years ago and the adoption of the Law on Co-operatives in 2012, the number of effective co-operatives has kept growing, accounting for 55 per cent of agricultural co-operatives and about 50-80 per cent of non-agricultural ones.\nCollective economy out of prolonged slump\nIn the morning the same day, the Việt Nam Co-operative Alliance and the Ministry of Planning and Investment held a 2019 national forum on co-operative economy and co-operatives\xa0to collect opinions of co-operatives and members on current production and obstacles, as well as experience in developing new models.\nSpeaking at the forum, Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đinh\xa0Huệ,\xa0who is also head of the Steering Committee for Innovation and Collective Economic Development, said the collective economy had come out of a prolonged slump. Up to 57 per cent of co-operatives in the agricultural sector are operating effectively, he said.\nHowever, the target of the sector achieving a certain proportion in the country’s GDP has not been realised. In 2003, the proportion of the collective sector's contribution to\xa0Việt Nam’s GDP was 7.49 per cent. The current figure is only 4 per cent.\nHuệ said due attention in this field was still limited, with people only thinking about agricultural production when talking about the co-operative economy. Non-agricultural production is another major part of the co-operative economy.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister said the Law on Co-operatives in 2012 has opened up a clear direction, allowing the establishment of enterprises in co-operatives. However,\xa0many are still confused the new model.\nIn addition, among human resources for the co-operative sector, currently only 40 per cent are primary trained staff and up to 60 per cent are untrained. Therefore, the Việt Nam Co-operative Alliance must focus on enhancing training in the future.\nCo-operatives must enjoy supporting policies on technology transfer, trade and market expansion, Huệ said.\nHe hoped that, with awareness of authorities and people about the importance of co-operatives, this model would become an important link between agricultural production and consumption, and a bridge between farmers and businesses.\nAs of late 2018, Việt Nam had 64,081 co-operative groups, 8,744 co-operatives and 21 co-operative unions in the non-agricultural sector.\nIn 2018, the revenue of each non-agricultural co-operative stood at VNĐ8.5 billion (US$366,000), and profit was VNĐ480 million ($20,640) – 2-5 times higher than the figures in 2003.\nNguyễn Ngọc Bảo, VCA president and deputy head of the Steering Committee for Innovation and Collective Economic Development, said the collective economy in the non-agricultural sector is expected to grow from 8-15 per cent annually by 2030.\nViệt Nam expects to have 130,000 co-operative groups and 15,000 co-operatives and co-operative unions by 2025, attracting five\xa0million members and generating permanent jobs for three\xa0million\xa0labourers.\nThe figures are projected to increase to 260,000 co-operatives, 25,000 cooperative unions, eight\xa0million members and 4.5 million labourers by 2030, he said. — VNS",2

Indonesia has developed tra breeding areas with an expectation to occupy the Middle East market. Meanwhile, China tightened inspection of goods quality, including tra fish, exported across the border from June this year – with many Vietnamese tra exporters yet to respond to new regulations.\nChina is currently Việt Nam’s largest tra importer, with January-September import of Vietnamese tra fish worth $450.7 million, up 19.6 per cent year-on-year. Việt Nam previously exported whole pangasius to some border provinces in southern China, but tra fillet products are now available in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Dalian.\nAccording to General Secretary of VASEP Trương Đình Hòe, Việt Nam continues facing difficulties in exporting tra fish to US and EU.\n“In the US market, exports are not forecast to recover until the end of the first quarter of next year when the Department of Commerce will give the final result on anti-dumping tax on Việt Nam’s tra fish,” Hòe said.\n“Meanwhile, the export of seafood to the EU is struggling with the yellow card after fishermen were found to have violated regulations on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) fishing,” Hòe added.\nThe Vietnam-EU Free Trade Agreement will take effect from 2020, in which tariffs on tra products will be gradually reduced to zero per cent under a three-year roadmap. This means that Việt Nam’s export of tra fish will enjoy zero per cent from 2023, from the current basic tax rate of 5.5 per cent (frozen tra fillet). — VNS'",2

Investing in the form of public-private partnership will create better products and services,"" he said.\nNguyễn Đức Trung, deputy minister of Planning and Investment, said the draft law contains 12 chapters and 117 items based on existing regulations on investment and investment contracts in the form of PPP. It is expected to amend some regulations related to project scale and competence to decide on investment policy.\nIn accordance with current regulations, State\'s investment in PPP projects must be in line with procedures of the law on public investment.\nThis led to a lack of flexibility in capital arrangement because it would be adjusted with finance plans.\nHe said it was necessary to set forth a new rule on the arrangement of investment from the State in PPP projects.\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment has proposed two options on allocation of State funds to PPP projects.\nFirst was to set up a development fund to allocate State money and grant guarantees for PPP projects. The second option suggested reserving separate funds for PPP projects in mid-term public investment plans.\nNA deputies said given the constraint budget, attracting private investment is essential to reduce pressure on the State budget.\nVũ Hồng Thanh, head of NA Economic Committee, emphasised the necessity of the law on PPP and the draft law would be submitted to the NA Standing Committee for consideration.\nAccording to the Government\'s report on the implementation of PPP projects, as of January 2019, the country has mobilised about VNĐ1.6 quadrillion (US$69.1 billion) from private investment to address urgent needs for infrastructure development. — VNS'",0

For 27 years, it has been engaged in environment and development issues, seeking to influence national policy and North-South relations.\nAccording to Germanwatch’s report, Việt Nam ranks 6th globally, the highest of any ASEAN country, followed by Thailand at number 10. This is the result of storms, typhoons and droughts in 2017, which killed 298 people.\nThe deadliest one, Typhoon Damrey, hit Việt Nam in November and killed at least 106.\n2017 was an exceptionally intense year for tropical cyclones, according to Germanwatch Policy Adviser for Climate Risk Management Lena Hutfils. “Many countries are hit very frequently, so they don’t have an opportunity to recover in time,” Hutfils said. She also drew attention to how eight out of the top ten countries are from low- or middle-income groups.\nDavid Eckstein, the organisation’s Policy Adviser for Climate Finance and Investment, explained that the index consists of two components: one which looks at data from the previous year, and one which incorporates a 20-year development. Data includes direct short-term and long-term linkages between climate change and meteorological events.\n“[The index] should be understood as a warning signal,” Eckstein said. Furthermore, it provides crucial evidence to support the story that climate change and annual increases in storms, typhoons, floods, are linked.\nEckstein hopes that this would translate into action from national governments, not only to deal with the impact once it happens but also do more planning in advance.\nResponding to these recent developments at COP24, Phạm Văn Tấn, Deputy Director General of the Climate Change Department, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE), declared that climate change adaptation would be “the number one priority.”\nTấn noted how Việt Nam’s Government was one of the first to pass an implementation framework for the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly a month before the agreement itself went into effect in 2016. A key part of this plan is the constant review, submission and implementation of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), each country’s objectives for mitigation measures.\nAt COP24’s Session on ASEAN NDC Partnership, Tấn stated that 47 of Việt Nam’s 63 provinces had already submitted concrete implementation plans for the Paris Agreement. Việt Nam is “among the most advanced in ASEAN” in terms of NDC implementation, according to the Vietnamese official. His claim is supported by many in the international community, who raised questions during the session to learn from Việt Nam’s policies.\nThe NDC Partnership’s Country Engagement Director Jahan Chowdhury commended Việt Nam on its effective coordination between the government’s supreme leadership, Ministries and civil-society actors for better climate change adaptation. According to Tấn, MoNRE meets with NGOs once every three months to discuss the implementation of policies at the grassroots level.\nTấn has high expectations for the outcome of COP24, the most important gathering of international negotiators on the issue of climate change.\nHe wants to see how much support Việt Nam will be able to obtain from the international community following MoNRE’s proposal for Greenhouse Gases Reduction plan.\n“Support” is hereby defined as a combination of three things: finance, technology transfer and capacity building. So far at the conference, Việt Nam has not received any new pledges from developed countries with regards to financial support, a major concern. — VNS'",4

The domestic market growth is forecast to cool down this week as investors correct from being overexcited on the weekend. —\xa0Photo baodautu.vn\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0Việt Nam’s benchmark VN-Index has climbed to the highest level in three weeks but analysts have warned positive market sentiment may not last in the coming week.\nThe VN-Index on the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange on Friday gained 1.14 per cent to finish last week at 987.22 points, the highest end since August 23.\nThe VN-Index made a weekly gain of 1.35 per cent.\nInvestors are expecting the benchmark will reach its previous peak of 1,000 points soon. But analysts warn the scenario won’t be realised in the coming days.\nThe Vietnamese stock market did not match global stocks, which advanced strongly on the softer stance of the US and China towards their trade relations, specialist Nguyễn Hữu Bình said.\nWhat really drove local shares last week were individual companies’ business news and the State Bank of Việt Nam’s statement on cutting lending rates, which is seen as a move to match other central banks’ policies and boost the domestic economy.\nLast week, technology firms, retailers and banks were among the biggest gainers that took turns giving the market a boost.\nAccording to Bình, central banks are seeking ways to stimulate their economies and one of the ways is to cut lending rates to encourage domestic businesses and people to borrow more and spend more.\nThe Vietnamese central bank has decided to intervene in the monetary market as the Vietnamese đồng has got stronger since the beginning of the year, putting pressure on the country’s exports.\n“Tightened credit policy and stricter capital control are two of the reasons that have made Vietnamese shares less attractive so far this year,” Bình told tinnhanhchungkhoan.vn.\n“In the coming months, some banks will get the green light to raise their lending limits,” he said.\n“However, it (the lending rate cut policy) will take some time to really have an impact on the Vietnamese economy, so investors will correct themselves from being too excited.”\nThe local stock market will keep rising this week, but the growth isn’t as strong as expected and there will differentiation between different groups of stocks, he said, adding the market will soon encounter strong profit-taking pressure.\nInvestors might overreact on the weekend because they thought they would get an injection from banks following the central bank’s statement, director of the Việt Dragon Securities Corp (VDSC)'s individual investors department Hoàng Thạch Lân said.\nThe latest statement would lift bank stocks while other sectors hardly have any support, he said.\nBut the market growth would be short-lived and it may end if investors are struck with bad news from the international market, he warned. “It doesn’t mean capital injection.”\nWhat will really matter now is the trading liquidity, specialist Bình said. “If trading volume does not increase, it means investors haven’t got a capital boost yet.”\nAverage trading volume on the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange last week reached 119 million shares each day, up 1.5 per cent on a weekly basis.\nThe rate cut policy will not have a big impact on Việt Nam like it often does in other developed economies, according to Trần Đức Anh, director of macro-economics and market strategy at KB Securities Vietnam Co (KBSV).\nViệt Nam’s central bank attempts to control the volume of cash supply through lending and payment methods while European and American central banks use lending rates to keep control of the cash supply, Anh explained.\nTherefore, the latest announcement of the SBV is only mentally effective and it will take more time to see if the policy really has an impact on the country’s cash supply, he said.\nForeign capital returns\nForeign capital may return to the Vietnamese equity market in the next quarter after they have net-sold local assets in recent months, analysts have said.\nForeign investors net-sold VNĐ1.6 trillion (US$68.7 million)\xa0worth of local shares in August – the strongest since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, investors have withdrawn their money from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since January.\nBut during the eight-month period, local investors have helped absorbed a part of foreign selling to keep the market from falling sharply. According to analysts, Việt Nam was the least hit by foreign selling among all Asian markets.\nAccording to Matthew Smith, director of research and analysis at Yuanta Vietnam Securities Co, the volatility and risk of global markets and economies have forced investors to seek safe assets like gold and silver, and they are running away from emerging markets.\nBut foreign investors may return to the Vietnamese market as they get boosted by central banks’ lending rate cuts, which provide them with a bigger wallet. Many investment funds are holding onto a big volume of cash, so they need a trusted destination to spend that money, and Việt Nam is the trusted destination.\nIn addition, the development of new indices focusing on foreign-ownership-capped firms will help foreign investors filter the companies that they are interested in. —\xa0VNS",2

949,'Comments of experts on the summit',"'Việt Nam pulled out all the stops for media: foreign affairs spokesperson\nDPRK Chairman Kim Jong-un leaves Hà Nội\nAchieving denuclearisation needs more time\nPM says hosting DPRK-US summit was big success for Việt Nam\nReactions to the failed summit\nViet Nam News\nThe second summit between US President Donald Trump and Chairman of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un ended without any agreement signed on Thursday. Experts worldwide share their views on the outcome of the talks.\nProf Leon Sigal,\xa0Director, Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project, Social Science Research Council, USA\nLeon Sigal\nObviously, this is a big disappointment, but if the US version is correct, it’s clear that the North Koreans overreached in wanting an end to sanctions. The negotiating issue was how sanctions could be relaxed in return for steps toward denuclearisation by North Korea.\nIt was also clear from the discussion at the press conference that just because they didn’t agree this time, that doesn’t mean talks are over. I think that’s important because it seems to me this is quite negotiable.\nFrom the other things that were discussed at the press conference, it was clear that there was a pretty robust discussion of verification. The missile production issue was clearly brought up. So I think we have the basis for agreement here but the critical thing is if the US version is correct the DPRK overreached by wanting to end all the sanctions. That is not to say that the sanctions are terribly effective. It’s clearly putting some pressure on the North Korean economy. But I suspect some of the reaction would exaggerate the pressure of sanctions. The real thing about the sanctions in the North Korean view is they’re a sign of enmity and we have to move away from enmity.\nOn the other hand, to ask for the sanctions to be eliminated at this point is too big a step given what the North Koreans are prepared to do on the denulearisation side.\nSo I think it’s well worth everybody’s while to get back negotiating, have Stephen Biegun go talk to his counterpart, maybe \xa0Secretary of State Pompeo talk to his counterpart and see if we can work out a few more of the details recognising that sanctions are not going to be eliminated but they should be relaxed in return for denuclearisation steps by the DPRK. So I think it is time to get over the summit. We can do this. And it struck me that the President was keeping the door open.\nJenny Town\nJenny Town, Research Analyst, Stimson Center and Managing Editor, 38 North, a programme providing analysis of events in and around the DPRK\nIt is surprising that they didn’t come away with a preliminary deal, as they clearly had the outline for one going into the final round of pre-summit negotiations. But it\xa0seems both sides still wanted more than what the other was willing to accept. Taking more time to negotiate is not a bad development, but walking away from the summit with nothing is likely to have a deflating effect on the process as a whole.\nOf all the stakeholders in this process, the lack of movement on the DPRK-US agenda puts the Republic of Korea in a very awkward position, unable to secure the sanctions exemptions they were hoping for as part of this deal, which would facilitate the resumption of inter-Korean economic co-operation. Moreover, despite the President’s stated will to continue negotiating with North Korea, in the current domestic political environment, there is a real risk of the momentum for this issue waning in a sea of competing interests.\nLê Hồng Hiệp,\xa0Fellow,\xa0the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore\nLê Hồng Hiệp\nThe two sides’ failure to reach an agreement at the summit shows that there’s still a large difference between them regarding how to solve the North Korean nuclear issue.\nDemolishing the\xa0Yongbyon\xa0nuclear facility only will not be enough for the US to lift sanctions on North Korea, and President Trump indicated that he wants a right, not quick deal. Meanwhile, North Korea is not ready to give up more without any credible concession from the US.\nNow it’s important to see whether the two sides can make any progress by the end of the year. If not, the momentum of bilateral talks may face headwinds due to distractions generated by US electoral politics or unforeseen developments elsewhere.\nProf., Dr. Phạm Quang Minh, Dean of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Hanoi National University\nProf., Dr. Phạm Quang Minh.\nThe meetings ended without the outcome which had been highly anticipated. The result must be viewed through three perspectives: international, domestic and individual.\nFirst, regional and international affairs such as the trade war between the US and China and increasing tensions between Pakistan and India are unfavourable for success.\nSecond, the domestic issues of either country have had impacts on the two leaders, such as the congressional testimony of President Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and the DPRK’s issues of sovereignty and nuclear weapons, which are really big pressures.\nThird, for the two leaders, this is their second meeting so the trust between the two leaders hasn’t been built up whilst their characteristics are very unpredictable. President Trump still said on Wednesday that ""we have made a lot of progress"".\nI think the result is appropriate when taking into account the three elements as mentioned above.\nVũ Văn Khanh, former head of the Department of International Affairs, the Institute for Defence Strategy\nThe outcome is not something too surprising as the dialogue/relationship between the two countries has witnessed numerous contradictions which were unresolved. One side insists the other denuclearises whilst the other is not ready yet. This results in pressure for each other.\nIt is normal that dialogues and discussions between any countries are prolonged. In this particular case, there needs to be concessions from one of the two sides. Nevertheless, we need time to take into account other parties such as China and the Republic of Korea to settle the issue and bring peace to the Korean peninsula. As what DPRK Chairman Kim Jong Un has done so far we can see that relations between the two countries has become less tense.\nThe point is that both sides need to reach an agreement and gradually reach what they wish for.\nI forecast that the situation in the Korean peninsula will come to an end but it needs time. President Trump left for the US earlier than scheduled but he still said ""We haven’t given up anything, and .. we will end up very good friends with Chairman Kim.""\nScottie Nell Hughes, RT News, US\nScottie Nell Hughes, RT Ạmerica\nI think Americans as well as anybody who wants peace in the world is disappointed that we are not walking with a deal done by President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un, or at least a benchmark specifically given as to how that deal could be accomplished.\nI think President Trump missed an opportunity with not only the summit but also with the press conference to have at least something positive that was established during the past two days of meetings. Going into this President Trump seemed to be very positive about being able to bring about deals with Kim Jong Un. Unfortunately, it seems like none of that happened - whether you’re talking about benchmarks for the denuclearisation of North Korea or the ending of the Korean war. He walked out of the summit today with even more questions in the air than after the second summit finished.\nJonathan Karl, ABC News\nJonathan Karl, ABC News\nNot even a signing statement or a joint statement after the summit is clearly a disappointment to the American side. It seems the President was quite clear in the press conference that the issues it laid down on was that North Korea wants those sanctions lifted, they want them lifted now, they want them all lifted. And the position of the United States has been, from the previous presidents onto this president, that the sanctions don’t get lifted. It tells North Korea to take action steps to get rid of its nuclear programme. And that’s obviously not happening.\nThe President said he made no commitment about another summit. It’s possible. But I got the sense hearing him say that we probably won’t see a third summit any time soon.\nGrigory Trofimchuk,\xa0head of\xa0the expert council of the Eurasian Ideas Foundation:\n\nGrigory Trofimchuk, head of the expert council of the Eurasian Ideas Foundation\nOn the summit outcome, I think President Trump was a little bit in a rush to have said on Wednesday that the summit was going well and he hoped a series of important agreements would be signed.\nI would say Chairman Kim gained a concrete win over President Trump although Kim will face challenges ahead. The challenge is that Kim must understand from now on the US will require a concrete nuclear solution, a concrete one, not destroying a testing site.\nThe victory, first things first, is for Việt Nam which gained the chance to be mentioned worldwide.\nOn Trump, he was a little hasty and now his US opponents will dig into his abrupt exit from the summit.\nI think Russia’s viewpoints on the DPRK nuclear issue will also catch attention. Russia thinks dealing with the issue in a successful way will ensure real security when Pyongyang makes concessions. The progress leading to the outcome should be conducted step by step and not hastily.\nIn the future, I predict that there will be more approaches to the DPRK nuclear talks. One of those is six side talks. Russia might think about strengthening its role as the US did not succeed.\nOn the other hand, Việt Nam hosted the summit with excellent quality, showing the country’s prestige in international politics has been consolidated when Việt Nam has engaged in significant geo-political orientations and contributed to ensuring security in Asia.\nViệt Nam has been trusted by the world in important issues such as nuclear disarmament and has become one of the key factors in bolstering trust in the world\nProfessor Georgy Toloraya, director of Asian Strategy Centre at the Institute of Economics RAS:\nProfessor Georgy Toloraya, director of Asian Strategy Centre at the Institute of Economics RAS\nAll of us in Hà Nội are anticipating a concrete, significant deal with all related documents available. However, the summit ended without a joint statement. We are not privy to what exactly was the deal breaker, and we have only heard US President’s claims that the talks’ abrupt end was due to the DPRK’s refusal to dismantle its nuclear weapons. Now we need to hear the DPRK’s side of the story. I don’t think lifting sanctions was a precondition on the part of the North Koreans, but the point is they want the US to change its hostile attitude towards the country. To Pyongyang, as long as sanctions continue, hostility remains and there would be nothing to talk about.\nIt’s a regret that this opportunity has been wasted and the certainty of a third summit is still up in the air.\nStill, I want to emphasise the fact that the two sides have not been critical of each other and President Trump remains optimistic of another summit and respectful of the North Korean leader.\nThe summit has not resulted in any notable progress, as widely reported by international media, but it’s really not that bad, the important thing is tension hasn’t escalated, which would possibly lead to renewed rounds of missile tests or bomb detonations.\nAn agreement seems to have been reached between the two countries’ leaders that such activities will no longer happen.\nLet’s remain hopeful that while there might not be a step forward, there’s at least not a step backward.\nViệt Nam’s organisation of the summit has been perfect. Through this summit, it has managed to elevate its position in the region as a responsible nation and proved that it could pull off holding such an event. Hà Nội doesn’t need to feel disappointed missing out on the chance to be a part of history, it happens quite often. You have all done really well. — VNS'",0

The cap on deposits of one to six months has reduced by 0.5 percentage points to 5 per cent.\nThe rates on deposits of six months and more will be set by banks themselves based on the market.\nThe central bank has also cut interest rates on loans to priority sectors.\nShort-term loans to agriculture, supporting industries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the technology sector have seen the interest rate cut from 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent.\nLoans from microfinance organisations are now capped at 7 per cent, down from 7.5 per cent.\nResponding to the central bank’s move, several banks have also announced cuts to both deposit and loan interest rates.\nOn September 19 Maritime Bank cut interest rates by 2 percentage points to 6.99 per cent for three-month loans and 7.99 per cent for six-month loans.\nACB cut its rates by 0.2-0.4 percentage points for less than six month loans to 5 per cent per year.\nVietcombank and VietinBank, two of Vietnam’s ‘Big 4’ state-owned lenders, which are the four banks with the highest total assets, reduced deposit rates by 0.2 percentage points for term deposits of under 9 months.\nVietcombank also cut its interest rates on đồng loans by 0.5 percentage points.\nMid-sized lenders like Military Bank, TPBank, Eximbank, and VietCapital Bank have announced cuts in short-term deposit rates by 0.1-0.2 percentage points.\nSenior bank executives said the central bank’s decision to lower both the deposit and loan ceiling interest rates is aimed at stopping the race between banks to hike deposit interest rates.\nPhạm Ngọc Hưng, vice chairman of the HCMC Enterprises Association, said lowering lending interest rates at this time was of great significance especially for businesses since many of them were in dire need of capital for stocking up for the upcoming peak shopping season.\nThe rate cuts would also help them feel more secure about making business plans for next year, he said.\nThe director of an agriculture company in Tiền Giang Province said with the new interest rates his company was likely to reduce loan interest expenses by around VNĐ1 billion a year.\nThe amount might not be much for a large company but would be very significant for small and medium-sized enterprises like his, he said.\nThe lower costs would improve the competitiveness of Vietnamese products in overseas markets, he added.\nState firms look to speed up divestment of stakes in other companies\nThe Hà Nội Stock Exchange recently announced an auction of 3.2 million shares of the Hà Nôi Synthetic Paint Joint Stock Company (HasynpaintCo) by the Việt Nam National Chemicals Group (Vinachem) on December 5.\nHasynpaintCo was equitised in 2006, and Vinachem is one of its biggest shareholders with its 3.2 million shares accounting for 27 per cent of the capital.\nVinachem’s decision to sell all its shares at HasynpaintCo is part of its divestment plan for the 2017-20 period, under which it was to sell its stakes in 15 enterprises in 2018, 14 in 2019 and four in 2020.\nBut it failed to achieve the 2018 target.\nSo, since the beginning of this year, Vinachem has had to sell its stakes in many companies in which it was a significant shareholder.\nThey included Sao Vàng Rubber Joint Stock Company in which it held a 15 per cent stake and sold it to four investors for VNĐ195.5 billion ($8.5 million) through an action in June, the Đà Nẵng Rubber Joint Stock Company in which it sold 17.23 million shares for VNĐ434 billion and the Southern Fertiliser Joint Stock Company in which it sold 13.9 million shares.\nPower Generation Corporation 3 (Genco 3) recently announced plans to auction its stakes in the Vĩnh Sơn-Sông Hinh Hydropower Company this quarter.\nAt the end of last year Genco 3 owned 63 million shares or 30.55 per cent of VSH’s charter capital.\nIt is also making preparations to divest its stakes in two other companies, the Việt Lào Power Joint Stock Company and the Nhơn Trạch Thermal Power Joint Stock Company.\nBut in spite of their earnest efforts, many State-owned corporations have found it difficult to achieve their divestment targets.\nAccording to Prime Minister’s Decision No 232/QĐ-TTg issued in August 2017, 62 State units were to have sold their stakes in other companies this year.\nBut as of the end of the second quarter only nine did. Of the VNĐ1.657 trillion (US$72.04 billion they collected, VNĐ1.587 trillion($69 billion) came from the sale of stakes in just one company, Viglacera.\nSpeaking at the 2019 Việt Nam Mergers and Acquisitions Conference, Lê Song Lai, deputy general director of sovereign fund, the State Capital Investment Corporation, said the state capital divestment progress had been slow in the last two years.\nWhat ails State companies’ divestment plans?\nAnalysts blamed this on several reasons like reluctance on the part of their managements since the divestment would result in losses, especially for businesses who are not doing well, and the failure of many equitised enterprises to list on the stock market.\nA report by the Ministry of Finance showed 667 enterprises had been equitised but not listed as of last year.\nThe failure to list also resulted in their lax supervision.\nExperts said many businesses were not aware of the benefits of listing.\nLand use rights are another problem plaguing divestment efforts. Many companies lack legal documents to prove their land use rights while lands are often their most valuable assets.\nThe Government should take drastic action to disinvest to mobilise resources for development and reducing public debts, they said.\nTo achieve the divestment targets ministries and local administrations should instruct firms to proactively look to settle their problems, they added.— VNS'",2

They have been held in custody since October 15.\nLiễu is the chief accountant while Huệ is the treasurer of the district’s Department of Education and Training.\nThe amount of money embezzled by the two officials from 2017 to May 2019 is over VNĐ26.5 billion (US$1.1 million) and was used for personal spending. The source of money came from the supporting policy for poor students and regular expenses of the department.\nLiễu is thought to be the mastermind and Huệ an accomplice.\nAccording to Bùi Xuân Phong, deputy director of the provincial police department, the Investigation Police Agency is striving to clarify the embezzlement and appropriation of funds.\nThe agency would also expand investigations to verify the responsibilities of organisations and individuals involved in the incident.\nLê Thanh Dương, vice chairman of Sìn Hồ District’s People’s Committee told Vietnam News Agency reporters that the financial mismanagement and the fact that teachers and students couldn’t receive payments on time had affected the prestige of the sector.

Michele D'Ercole,\xa0Chairman\xa0of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Việt Nam (ICHAM), speaks to Việt Nam News Reporter Nguyễn Linh Anh on the sideline of the two-day “Machinery Made in Italy 2019” event ending Wednesday in Hà Nội.\nWhat does ICHAM expect to achieve through this event?\nThe Italian Government attaches great importance to the Vietnamese market. Việt Nam is one of only four countries in Asia, so far, which has signed a free trade agreement with the European Union, therefore, Italy wishes to turn Việt Nam into a strategic entrance for trading and investment in Southeast Asia.\nTo enhance both the volume and the value of exports to the European Union market, product quality is the top criteria that Vietnamese businesses need to focus on to meet strict market requirements. Italy is one of the leading countries in technology exports.\xa0We have made thorough research and investment in high-tech production lines and machinery, especially in the field of manufacturing and processing agricultural products. We are here to help Việt Nam access Italy's most advanced technology.\nThis event brings in an unique B2B (Business-to-Business) model as it allows Italian businesses not only to meet with Vietnamese partners but also to connect with other clients in the Asian region, such as India, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, helping them bridge the gap,\xa0making the most of opportunities for exchanging experience.\nAs this B2B model will help Italian firms reach many other Asian buyers, will it lessen the chances of connection between Italy and Việt Nam?\nI would say not at all, for sure.\nVietnamese businesses absolutely do not have any disadvantages when participating in this B2B model. All Italian businesses coming here have the desire to expand their business network to the maximum. Buyers from different countries have different requirements depending on their own demand.\nFor example, buyers from India have different needs than buyers from Việt Nam. Meanwhile, Italian businesses are capable of offering diversified choices to meet those different needs. Therefore, Vietnamese businesses can be fully assured that their benefits will not be affected. On the contrary, this model can even help Vietnamese firms have more opportunities as they can learn more and exchange more with partners from different regions around the world.\nAre you confident that Italian machinery and technology can compete with those from China, which is a very large import market of Việt Nam?\nChina is considered one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and they have great advantages in multiple sectors. However, in terms of mechanical engineering, production lines technology, especially for food and agriculture produce, frankly speaking, those from Italy\xa0would definitely work better.\nWe have researched this segment for 40 to 50 years, thus we have high-tech machinery and modern solutions, the components that make up the production lines also have good quality, with a life cycle of 30 to 40 years.\nHow do EU and Italian consumers like Vietnamese products?\nAt present, Vietnamese products are categorised in the low-middle segment in the Italian market and the European market. Products with high potential to export to Europe are agricultural products, tea, coffee, textiles and footwear.\nThe European market particularly likes Vietnamese agricultural products, especially fruits and vegetables. However, Vietnamese businesses are facing a big problem as they are exporting mainly raw and unprocessed products. This makes the value of products low, even though you are exporting a large volume of products to the EU.\nTherefore, Vietnamese businesses need to improve their production technology and machinery to diversify their supplies. For example, in addition to exporting fresh fruits, they can offer customers other choices such as fruit juice and fruit jams, this also helps prolong the product's life cycle and create a higher value and increase competitiveness for their products. — VNS",2

Scarlotta berries are large, sweet and slightly crispy.\nNguyễn Vui, owner of Toàn Thịnh grape seedling establishment in Phước Dân, said foreign grape varieties normally have large berries with good shape and colour, and a sweet and crisp taste with fragrant flavour. They are neither too sour nor too sweet.\nHis establishment is selling seedlings of many foreign grape varieties like Scarlotta, Kyoho, Black Queen and Shine Musat to farmers.\nThe province, which has the lowest rainfall in the country, has more than 1,200ha of grapes.\nThe province’s grape area accounts for only 3-3.5 per cent of the province’s total farming area, but the value of grape accounts for 19-20 per cent of the province’s total agriculture value, according to the province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\nThe red cardinal and NH 01-48 grapes are the province’s two major grape varieties.\nThe red cardinal was the first grape variety planted in the province and now accounts for 80 per cent of the province’s grape area.\nNH 01-48 green grape is a high-quality table grape variety but its yield and quality are stable in only some areas that have suitable weather and soil conditions.\nTo improve the quality of grapes, the province has conducted research to create new seedless grape varieties like NH 04-61, NH 04-128 and NH 01-152, and to develop high-quality foreign grape varieties.\nPhạm Dũng, head of the department’s Plant Protection and Cultivation Sub-department, said the department would work with farmers to complete a draft on growing processes for foreign grape varieties. The processes will be transferred to farmers to ensure high-quality grape varieties in the province.\nThe province has encouraged grape farmers to use Vietnamese good agricultural practices (VietGAP) standards.\nUnder its plan to restructure agriculture in the 2017- 30 period, the province will expand its grape cultivation in Ninh Hải, Ninh Phước and Ninh Sơn districts and Phan Rang-Tháp Chàm City.\nThe plan targets having 2,000ha of grapes with an output of 50,000 tonnes next year. The province has about 8,000ha of arable land suited for growing grapes. — VNS'",1

2749,'Domestic property market to have enough capital next year',"'A view of HCM City. Việt Nam\'s property market will not lack capital for development next year. Photo tbck.vn\nBy Hoàng Hà\nHÀ NỘI – Việt Nam\'s real estate market will not be short of capital next year but will still face many challenges from policies and administrative procedures, experts said at the annual Vietnam Real Estate Forum.\nCấn Văn Lực, chief economist of the Bank for Investment and Development of Việt Nam (BIDV), told the forum in Hà Nội on Thursday that real estate capital with 60 per cent from banks and 40 per cent from other sources will be maintained next year.\nOn November 15, the State Bank of Việt Nam issued Circular 22 effective from January 1, 2020 to tighten credit in the real estate sector, which will aid the market, according to Lực.\n“The property market is healthy in the long-term and this circular will encourage loans for building, buying and repairing houses,” Lực said.\nIn 2019, bank loans for real estate activities, such as buying, repairing and building houses, exceeded VNĐ300 trillion, up 15 per cent year on year. Meanwhile, capital from other sources, including bonds, remittance and foreign direct investment (FDI), reached about VNĐ240 trillion, he said.\n""Thus, financial resources for real estate are still relatively large, the local real estate market doesn\'t have to worry about lacking capital,"" Lực said.\nThis economist said there are five main sources of capital flowing into the real estate market, including banking loans, private capital, FDI capital, corporate bonds and other resources like cash of the people, gold and remittances.\nIn the first 10 months of 2019, loans for construction rose by 8.5 per cent year on year to VNĐ8 trillion, 5.5 per cent for trading of property and 19.6 per cent for house buying and home repair. This year, the Government has consolidated loans for trading real estate, and buying and repairing houses into real estate loans so the figure increased by 14.5 per cent.\nRegarding private capital, in the first 11 months, there were 16,000 construction enterprises were established, up 2 per cent, and 7,300 newly-established real estate trading enterprises saw their capital rise by 27.5 per cent. Meanwhile, FDI from newly-registered projects and increases of existing capital reached US$4.8 billion.\nThe total value of enterprises’ corporate bonds issued in the 11 months was VNĐ237 trillion, up 6 per cent year on year, including VNĐ71 trillion from real estate enterprises. This is an impressive figure and an important capital resource.\nViệt Nam allows businesses to set up trust funds to supply more investment for the property market, which is a potential channel in the future, Lực said.\nFintech could also be a channel to attract capital for real estate in the future, said Lực.\n""Currently, the global economy is recovering while global trade will recover next year, making foreign capital flow strongly into Việt Nam. The capital is expected to continue the strong growth in Việt Nam next year,"" economic expert Lê Xuân Nghĩa said.\n""Bank credit is also important for the stable development of the real estate market due to the large proportion of capital banks supply. In the past year, the stable commercial banking system has contributed greatly to the stability of the real estate market,"" Nghĩa said.\n“The capital for the property market should be centralised in a bank, because banks manage risks well. The good management of risks will bring benefits for developers of property projects and property investors,” he said.\nBesides that, domestic investment has flowed into infrastructure development, and Government investment in infrastructure is set to increase in 2020 with the construction of several large projects, according to Nghĩa.\nPrivate capital in infrastructure will also continue to increase strongly next year. This will have a great impact on the domestic real estate market next year and beyond. When infrastructure improves, the real estate market will improve.\nAnother factor that will also impact the real estate market in the coming years is the large amounts of capital for urbanisation.\nMore opportunities to attract FDI to the real estate market will come from free trade agreements Việt Nam has signed.\nNguyễn Hồng Vân, market director of JLL Vietnam’s Hà Nội branch, said foreign capital in the market would create many positive impacts. Recently, many foreign investors had sought to invest or find Vietnamese partners to open joint ventures.\n“This is a potential capital source. The foreign investor will bring capital and experience in development of property projects to Việt Nam. Domestic businesses can find not only more capital but also more experience to develop their projects at a higher level,” Vân told\xa0Việt Nam News.\n""Foreign capital and remittances to the real estate market will increase and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) will continue. Foreign businesses will collaborate with local entities to create quality real estate products,"" Vân said.\nForeign investors put their money into many fields such as commercial property, apartments and industrial parks. Investment from China has been mainly in industrial zones, while commercial centres and shop-houses have attracted the most capital from Korean and Japanese investors.\nMeanwhile, Nguyễn Mạnh Hà, Chairman of Landora Group, said the people held a large capital resource with a total value of cash, gold and remittances of more than US$16 billion, though this resource is congested due to legal issues.\nMarket 2020\nWhile real estate firms can expect stable development next year, licensing policies and administrative procedures are set to give them headaches.\nHà said it was important to simplify administrative procedures, especially in tax calculation, and create favourable conditions for businesses in working with State agencies.\nAccording to Nghĩa, current market supply has decreased slightly but is still higher than demand and real estate prices have not decreased.\nWith positive adjustments from the State, the real estate market is expected to return to normal development from the second quarter of next year grow steadily due to the high demand for housing.\nAt the forum, the experts said real estate segments set for strong development next year would be land plots and apartments.\nIndustrial property would also have great potential for development in the near future, Vân said.\nThe experts also said in the first half of 2020 the real estate market would face difficulties because of problems related to mechanisms, of which the delay in licensing new projects would impact new supply.\nĐặng Hùng Võ, former Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, said in 2019, few new real estate projects were licensed due to legal tightening. Real estate projects under construction now have been licensed from previous years.\nIn the next 2-3 years, if getting construction licences for projects continued to be tough, the market would face supply reduction while demand would still increase, Võ said.\nThe domestic condotel market would be temporarily quiet next year after the failure of the Cocobay Đà Nẵng developer to fulfil payment obligations to investors. But this market would continue its development if the State completes the legal system for it.\nNguyễn Văn Đính, Vice President and General Secretary of the Association of Real Estate Brokers said he would choose investment in condotel because legal system for this product would be completed under market demand.\nOn the other hand, Việt Nam’s resort real estate prices were still low compared to other countries in the region and the world. Việt Nam’s tourism industry was sure to boom in the future, he said. Therefore, condotel prices would increase together with the development of the tourism industry.\nTo get success in development of this condotel market, Nghĩa said, project developers should work with travel companies in building attractive programmes for tourists. - VNS'",2

The plastic industry is very hopeful of meeting this year’s export target of $3.2 billion. — VNS Photo Xuân Hương\nHCM CITY — With solid growth in shipments, the plastics industry will surely meet its full-year export target of US$3.2 billion, according to the Việt Nam Plastics Association.\nSpeaking to Việt Nam News, Hồ Đức Lam, its chairman, said exports saw impressive growth last year to $3 billion while overall revenues jumped to $12 billion.\n“Exports in the first nine months of the year increased by 5 per cent and will continue to enjoy good growth in the rest months of the year.\n“The US-China trade war has offered opportunities to Vietnamese plastics firms to boost exports.”\nAccording to the association, exports go to more than 150 countries and territories, with the US and Japan being key markets.\nIn the domestic market, some industries, even those such as aerospace which use high-grade materials, are shifting to plastic products, and as a result sales have grown rapidly, Lam said.\nLocally-made plastic\xa0products are confidently taking on imports from Thailand, Malaysia and China, he said.\nThe industry has stepped up investment in technology and facilities and co-operation with foreign partners to make more products meeting local and export demand, he said.\nBut it also faces challenges, he said.\n“Many countries have put up safeguard measures to protect their domestic plastics industry from imports. Some producers have shifted their production to Việt Nam, which requires the Government and business groups to ensure transparency in the manufacture of products in Việt Nam, and accurate certificates of origin.\n“Another challenge is that we are importing 60-70 per cent of raw materials.\n“The world commodities market has been volatile, affecting the industry. Besides, the Government plans to raise import tariffs on some raw materials, which will affect producers.”\nForeign investors are enamoured of Việt Nam’s plastics industry due to its high growth rates, increasing exports and enormous potential, he said.\n“But huge investments by foreign investors also pose challenges to Vietnamese firms since they have to face fierce competition, requiring them to transform and invest in new technologies to improve productivity and cut costs.”\nAccording to the Việt Nam Plastics Industry Development Plan for the period until 2020 approved by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the industry is expected to achieve average annual growth of 17.5 per cent in 2011-20.\nThe industry also targets to become a key sector by 2020 with a high and sustainable growth rate.\nIt seeks to gradually build a complete supply chain encompassing all stages from raw material production to final processing, increasing the ratio of locally sourced raw materials to reduce reliance on imports.\nPhạm Thị Huệ Anh of the University of Economics - Technology for Industries said plastics firms need to further improve designs, models and quality, restructure, invest in advanced technologies, develop local sources of raw materials and cut costs to improve competitiveness.\nThe Government needs to have policies to encourage investment in raw material production and develop supporting industries, she added.\nThe plastics industry has nearly 4,000 enterprises, most of them small and medium-sized ones. — VNS'",2

We expect it from us that we fight for everything,"" he said.\n""The boys did really well, they fought really hard. It is completely normal that you come under pressure but we defended well.\n""That is how it is in the top six and in the Premier League. You will never win at Chelsea without putting a proper shift in and we did that today.""\nAfter City\'s astonishing 8-0 demolition of Watford on Saturday, this was the perfect response from Liverpool as they try to dethrone Pep Guardiola\'s champions.\nChasing a first English title since 1990, Liverpool are on a club-record run of 15 successive league wins and have lost just once in 45 top-flight matches, going unbeaten in the last 23.\n""It is exceptional. What can I say? We have to keep on going. It is never looks as easy as it did for City yesterday but we have not had these games yet.\nWe have to work for it,"" Klopp said.\n""We knew how good City were before the game yesterday. I really believe they are the best team in the world.\n""They are brilliant. We are not bad as well. We have to be ready for each opponent. They are want to give us a knock, rightly so.""\n\'Character and spirit\'\nThe only worry for Klopp was an injury to Senegal winger Sadio Mane that forced him off in the second half.\n""It is a knock on the bone around the knee and a dead leg,"" Klopp said.\n""He\'s OK, but we took him off, he wasn\'t limping but I didn\'t like how he was running.""\nChelsea had a greater share of possession, managed 13 shots to Liverpool\'s six and won six corners to their opponents\' four.\nBut those encouraging signs were undermined by poor defending and a lack of cutting edge, leaving Lampard as the first Chelsea manager to remain winless in his first four home matches since Bobby Campbell in 1988.\nLampard claimed Chelsea deserved more from their spirited effort, but he \xa0conceded his young side aren\'t mature enough yet.\n""No home wins, we want to change that and I believe we will if we play like that,"" he said.\n""Performance wise we were the better team. We had more energy in our game, character and spirit. That\'s why the crowd applauded at the end.\n""The difference between us and Liverpool is we aren\'t consistent enough. To work towards those levels is hard. It is a daily thing.\n""That is what we have to aspire to. The reality is younger players have come into the team.""\nChelsea were denied a first-half equaliser when Cesar Azpilicueta\'s effort was ruled out for offside against Mason Mount and Lampard admitted it was a momentum changer as Firmino bagged the second goal moments later.\n""I like to think we might get a couple in our favour.

United and Arsenal were the champions of England for nine consecutive seasons between 1996 and 2004.\nHowever, the fact the were facing off a Monday night because neither are in Champions League action later this week was reflected in a first 45 minutes devoid of quality.\nIt took 28 minutes for either goalkeeper to be tested as Arsenal's Bernd Leno saved well low to his left to deny Andreas Pereira after a solo run.\nUnited have not scored more than one goal in any match since the opening day of the season and, even against an Arsenal defence that had conceded nine goals in their last four league games, looked toothless when not afforded space to counter-attack into.\nArsenal, though, played right into the hosts hands in the final five minutes of the first-half.\nFirstly, Marcus Rashford wasted a huge chance when played in behind by Paul Pogba's through ball with the Gunners furiously protesting for a free-kick against the Frenchman as he dispossessed Matteo Guendouzi.\nArsenal then had the chance to strike on the counter-attack themselves as from a United corner the visitors burst forward through Bukayo Saka and after his effort was palmed away by David de Gea, the Spaniard got back in position to block Guendouzi's follow-up effort.\nBut from the resulting corner, it was United who took the lead.\nDaniel James led the counter from one end of the field to the other and after his cross just evaded Rashford, the England international cut the ball back to the edge of the box where McTominay smashed into the top corner.\nThat was the first goal United had scored a goal from open play at home in the first-half this season.\nBut they soon needed a second as Arsenal struck back after the break thanks to VAR.\nSaka pounced on a loose pass deep inside the United half and fed Aubameyang, who had been flagged offside, before dinking the ball past De Gea.\nHowever, replays showed he was clearly played onside by Harry Maguire and his eighth goal of the season was allowed to stand.\nSeconds later, Unai Emery's men were unlucky not to be in front when Saka's shot from Callum Chambers's cross was deflected just over by Victor Lindelof.\nAttack looked like the best form of defence for Arsenal as their backline never looked comfortable at holding out for a point.\nPogba fired inches wide from the edge of the area before McTominay somehow didn't score his second of the night with a free header six yards out from a corner.\nLeno produced a fine save to turn a piledriver from Maguire over as the world's most expensive defender tried to atone for his earlier error.\nBut the German goalkeeper's best save of the evening came at the death as he flew to his left to turn Rashford's powerful free-kick to safety. — AFP",3

So research in the country should be strengthened, he said.\nMany foreign and Vietnamese scientists are presenting their research in AI, the internet of things, decision support systems, and others at the conference, he added.\nThe 14th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems aims to facilitate technology and knowledge exchange by international researchers and scholars in the fields of knowledge science, information systems, system science, creativity support systems, and complex system modelling.\nIt is being held by Hoa Sen University in co-operation with Vintech City, which is a comprehensive eco-system supporting tech research and start-ups based on the Silicon Valley model in the US.

However, the sector was to blame for great amounts of environmental pollution, with huge water and energy use, as well as the discharge of toxic chemicals.\nAs one of Việt Nam’s garment hubs, Thăng said: “It is time for Hà Nội to pioneer sustainability in the industry – reducing emissions and waste to protect the environment. This is also a way for local enterprises to increase their competitiveness in domestic and international markets.”\nNguyễn Hải Đường, CEO of the M2 clothing chain, which has mostly served local consumers for the last 18 years, said: “We changed the way we serve our customers as their behaviours changed. We introduced products with less harmful materials and adopted recycled packaging. Though such things cost more, our customers are happier with their purchases.”\nĐường’s chain is now expanding to other areas outside Ha Noi.\nNguyễn Quốc Trung, who has exported products made from bamboo to Germany for the last 15 years, now sells hessian jute bags, which can be used for shopping instead of plastic ones.\nHe told Việt Nam News: “With more environmental awareness, consumers are paying more for eco-friendly products. We see a big local market and we don’t want to miss out.”\nBuying a bag at Trung’s booth, Nguyễn Linh Chi told Việt Nam News: “The bag looks trendy and it also helps protect the environment. People of my age are now paying more attention to the environment.”\nChi added: “Doing something serious may be hard but buying products like this is easy.”\nAccording to Trịnh Quốc Vũ, deputy head of Energy Saving under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, with some 6,000 factories employing more than 3 million people, the industry is both economically and\xa0socially important for the country. However, the sector has an\xa0adverse environmental impact. Intensive water extraction, use and discharge of wastewater and high energy consumption for water heating and steam generation are all environmental concerns.\nIn contributing to sustainable development in Hà Nội, Thăng’s department encouraged suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and local consumers to help ensure the sustainable development of the industry.\nIt set criteria for sustainable development from the very beginning of the production cycle, such as the use of dyes with low formaldehyde content, to using recycled materials for packaging. — VNS'",2

""We\'re looking for perfection.""\nMoreno confirmed on Sunday he has been in constant contact with Luis\xa0Enrique and Ramos has insisted the situation is not affecting the players.\nThere have been many given a chance to impress, with eight changes from the 4-1 thrashing of the Faroe Islands on Friday taking the number of starters to\xa024 in the last four games alone.\nDani Parejo and Fabian Ruiz both impressed in midfield but Asensio and Isco lacked spark again in the final third, with Rodrigo Moreno also ceding ground\xa0to Morata in the central striker spot.\nKepa Arrizabalaga had little to do in goal but his third consecutive start suggests he is now not just an alternative to Manchester United\'s David de Gea\xa0but the side\'s preferred keeper.\n""I think in Spain we don\'t watch so much foreign football,"" Moreno said.\n""If they\'d seen the end of the season Kepa had, nobody would be surprised by our decision.""\nSweden\'s disciplined defence carried them to the World Cup quarter-finals\xa0almost a year ago and Spain only really rattled them for five minutes in the opening half.\nThe first of a flurry of chances saw Fabian\'s shot palmed over by Robin Olsen, who then parried away a dipping volley from Parejo.\nEven when Spain had the ball in the net it was crossed off, incorrectly,\xa0for offside, after Rodrigo tapped in Parejo\'s cutback.

3075,'Inflation controllable despite soaring pork prices: Deputy PM',"'This year’s inflation would be\xa0controlled\xa0at 3.3-3.9 per cent despite the recent surge in prices of pork, an essential foodstuff. Photo vietnamplus.vn\nHÀ NỘI – This year’s inflation is controllable at 3.3-3.9 per cent, Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ said while chairing a meeting on November 18 regarding the recent surge in pork prices, an essential foodstuff.\nThe General Statistics Office (GSO) predicts that the consumer price index (CPI) in November may rise by 0.8-1 per cent from last month, and pork price hikes will contribute 0.75 per cent to the CPI expansion.\nData of this office shows that pork prices at present have increased by almost 19 per cent from the same period last year. They now stand at VNĐ70,000-VNĐ75,000 per kilo in the north, even VNĐ78,000 in Lào Cai and Hưng Yên provinces, VNĐ70,000 in the central region and VNĐ65,000-VNĐ75,000 in the south.\nIt also forecast a shortage of more than 200,000 tonnes of pork, compared to the total demand for over 600,000 tonnes, in the fourth quarter of this year. If pork prices continue to increase by 10-15 per cent to around VNĐ80,000 per kilo, this year’s CPI will grow by less than 3 per cent against 2018, still under the ceiling limit of 4 per cent.\nMeanwhile, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Đỗ Thắng Hải said the country is likely to experience a shortage of 70,000-90,000 tonnes of pork in live weight for the Lunar New Year (Tết) holiday, which falls in late January 2020.\nHe said relevant agencies should consider importing pork if domestic supply is insufficient, adding that this will help cool down pork prices and reduce inflation expectations.\nAt the meeting, Deputy PM Huệ said a supply shortage is obvious, noting that supply and demand must be balanced on a monthly basis. He asked the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development to consider pork imports.\nHowever, Huệ said, the imports must ensure supply for consumers while not affecting pig farmers, and the move is just to deal with the temporary supply shortage and not a long-term activity.\nHuệ also affirmed that the Government will manage to ensure supply-demand balance and harmonise interests of consumers, businesses and intermediaries.\nAt the meeting, Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phùng Đức Tiến reported that from early February to November 15, African swine fever was recorded in almost 8,500 communes across the country’s 63 provinces and cities. Up to 5.88 million pigs weighing 337,000 tonnes were culled, accounting for over 8.8 per cent of the total pig weight nationwide.\nRecently, average prices have reached VNĐ60,000-67,000 (US$2.59-2.89) per kilo of live pigs and even up to VNĐ72,000 in some places, due to supply shortage. Meanwhile, in some places, pigs are still transported to China via border crossings, he noted.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister said the increase of pork prices is due to some traders who have kept this commodity to push up price while the State management agency has not strictly controlled the export of pork because there are cases of collecting pork for exporting to other countries.\nIn this situation, Huệ asked the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to closely coordinate with the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the General Statistics Office to carefully calculate supply and demand each month, especially in the next three months.\nMARD solutions\nAlso, on November 18, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường had a meeting with a number of large animal husbandry enterprises to discuss solutions to stabilise pork supply for the domestic market during the upcoming Tết holiday.\nMinister Cường said in the last two months of this year and the first quarter of 2020 with the highest demand for food, the market is likely to lack pork in some places and have imbalance in supply and demand among regions, leading to strong fluctuations in pork prices.\nTherefore, the minister will have solutions to increase supply of other foods such as seafood, cattle and poultry, to meet domestic demand and export, he said. The Livestock Production Department will guide farmers to promote re-breeding of pigs and extend the breeding period to increase productivity.\nRegarding trading activities, Minister Cường said the State needs to control pork imports and exports to ensure a stable domestic market and profit for farmers.\nVũ Anh Tuấn, Deputy General Director of the CP Việt Nam Livestock Joint Stock Company, said if the pork prices have surged sharply, farmers will promote re-production of pigs. That will lead to the risk of disrupting the development plan of the pig industry.\nĐào Mạnh Lương, General Director of Mavin Group, said the first solution is to remove difficulties in circulation to remote areas, avoiding price hikes because businesses themselves wish to stabilise prices.\nLương also said that the industry should encourage the re-development of pig herds with incentive policies, including credit support for eligible households breeding pigs. - VNS'",2

1928,'Bạc Liêu to expand 2 sustainable shrimp farming models',"BẠC LIÊU – The Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province of Bạc Liêu plans to expand its efficient and sustainable super-intensive shrimp farming and shrimp-rice farming models.\nThe former model was first developed by companies in 2017 and later expanded to households, according to the province’s Agriculture Extension Centre.\nThe province has 1,845ha of super-intensive shrimp farming ponds, including 950ha belonging to companies and 324ha to households.\nThe model requires large initial investment of VNĐ1-1.6 billion (US$43,100-69,000) per hectare, but offers profits of VNĐ600 million-1 billion ($25.900-43,100) a year.\nUnder the shrimp-rice farming model, farmers grow rice in the rainy season and breed shrimp in the dry season on the same rice fields.\nThe rice yield is 4.4-5 tonnes per hectare per crop and the shrimp yield is 230-350 kilogrammes.\nThe shrimp-rice farming model is friendly to the environment as farmers use few pesticides and chemicals and it adapts to climate change.\nThe province has 37,700ha under the model, and, according to its Agriculture Extension Centre, has the capacity to expand it to 50,000ha.\nSpeaking at a seminar in Bạc Liêu on Thursday, Dương Thành Trung, chairman of the province's People’s Committee, instructed local agencies to co-operate with research institutions to finalise the farming processes for the two models and train farmers.\nWaste treatment facilities should be included in the super-intensive model to protect the environment, he warned.\nThe growth of shrimp co-operatives and co-operative groups that use advanced farming techniques should be fostered, he said.\nThe province encouraged farmers to breed shrimp to quality standards like Vietnamese good agricultural practices (VietGAP) and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), he added.\nLưu Hoàng Ly, director of the province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the province was quickly building infrastructure for a hi-tech agriculture zone to develop shrimp farming.\nThis would help to develop the province into the country’s shrimp industry hub, he said.\nThe province plans to have four hi-tech aquaculture areas, including one for producing fry, by next year, and 10 by 2025.\nIt targets exports of $750 million worth of shrimp next year and $1 billion by 2025.\nBạc Liêu expects to produce 155,000 tonnes of shrimp this year, 15.1 per cent more than last year, according to the department. – VNS",1

According to a survey conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO), Việt Nam is among the countries having the longest working hours – 48 hours per week among the 194 countries and territories in the world.\nRegarding the annual leave, according to a survey conducted in 155 countries, Việt Nam is among the countries having the least annual leave per year - 12 days.\nRegarding the working days in a year, Việt Nam is in the group having the highest working hours in the world. According to a survey on the working hours conducted in 2014, Việt Nam ranks 3rd among the group of nations having the highest working hours internationally with average from 2,339.55 hours per annum- only after Cambodia and Bangladesh.\nAmong the 11 member countries in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ((CPTPP), Việt Nam is a country having the highest working hours. Among ASEAN, Việt Nam ranks 2nd after Cambodia.\nRegarding the extra working hours, compared with other countries, Việt Nam is at a medium level, yet violations of the extra working hours in Việt Nam is rather common. According to a report from labour inspectors in the textile sector, in 2015, 39.5 per cent of enterprises have failed to comply with the working hours written in the Labor Code. It is reported that quite many Vietnamese workers have to work many extra hours to fulfil\xa0their assigned labour norm without extra payment.\nWill you please explain a bit further about the proposal on the extra-working hours written in the revised Labor Code?\nUnder the current law, 12 hours is the top working hours permitted for a worker in a day; no more than 30 hours in a month; and no more than 200 hours in a year. However, in a special circumstance, a worker can work up to 300 hours a year. Yet, during the implementation of the law, many enterprises have complained that such restriction on the working hours has some negative impacts on them, particularly in processing contracts; import-export processing factories. As a result, many enterprises have proposed to get rid of the extra-working hours quotas, particularly for enterprises specialized in import-export processing. Meanwhile, quite many enterprises have proposed the lifting of the working hour cap per week/month while still maintaining the cap on the annual over-time working hours.\nI support the idea to increase the working hours, yet the overtime working hours should be paid more than the official working hours. Yet, the decision to ask the workers to work overtime should only be applied in the case of emergency – without planning before.\nDo you support the proposal to cut down the official working hours from 48 hours to 44 hours per week?\nMore recently, prolonged working hours has become an acute problem for many factories’ owners.\nSurveys and investigations on the living conditions of Vietnamese workers which were jointly conducted by the Institute for Workers and Trade Unions, under the Việt Nam Trade Union Federation and some other organizations have indicated that the prolonged working\xa0hours has some how having negative impacts on the employees/workers and their family members, particularly those who have small children.\nFurther more, the earning from extra work, for the majority of people, particularly for parents with small children. For most of the Vietnamese workers, the money earned from extra work is just used to compensate for the money they have to pay for their baby sitters after the kindergarten closure and others. That’s why the Việt Nam General Confederation of Labour has come up with a proposal to cut down the working hours from 48 hours/week to 44 hour/week._VNS'",1

It also allows people to access and make payments not only within the country but even globally.\n“To date, cashless payments have been applied at about 30 medical facilities nationwide, gaining remarkable results. At several hospitals, non-cash payments made up 35 per cent of total payment transactions for health check-ups and treatment, reducing congestion, queuing time and improving patient satisfaction,” said Tiến.\nHowever, Tiến said, there are still many difficulties in expanding cashless payments in the health sector, such as low rate of hospitals using cashless payment systems or shortcomings in connecting with banking software or between organisations providing intermediary services and information systems of hospitals.\n“Vietnamese people are still used to paying for medical services with cash,” said the health minister.\n“Recently, the health sector has accelerated the application of IT and ensured infrastructure in improving management activities, quality of medical services and satisfaction of patients in fields of public administration, health check-up and treatment; medical and pharmaceutical training. This will be the foundation for implementing electronic payments for services,” said Tiến.\nAt the event, the health ministry requested units in the sector to develop action plans, resources and conditions to implement suitable non-cash payment solutions.\nThe ministry asked hospitals and health facilities to actively deploy various forms of electronic payments for hospital fees and tuition, such as via credit card, smartphone, electronic wallets and electronic payment gateways.\n“For people who have no bank card or account, health facilities must work with banks to implement a convenient non-cash payment solution,” said Tiến.\nAt the same time, the health sector will also promote communication and strengthen people’s awareness on the significance and important utilities of non-cash payment, encouraging people to use cashless methods in paying hospital fees and tuition.\nThe State bank of Việt Nam Deputy Governor Nguyễn Kim Anh said that the SBV will continue to work with the health sector in improving people’s experience and satisfaction in paying treatment fees, reducing queues, contributing to improving the quality of check-up and treatment services.\nSBV also suggested commercial banks research and apply incentive policies and affordable service fees for payment of hospital fees and implement incentives, promotion and discount programmes to change habits and behaviours of customers in paying hospital fees from cash to e-payments.\n“SBV will instruct commercial banks to work closely with medical facilities in providing safe, fast, accurate service products and payment methods with affordable fees,” added Anh.\nA report of the State Bank of Việt Nam showed that around 50 per cent of Vietnamese people still do not have bank accounts or e-payment cards. Fees for cashless payments are still high and there is a lack of payment methods for medical services at hospitals in mountainous and remote areas, hindering the development of non-cash payments in the health sector.\nViệt Nam currently has more than 70 banks providing Mobile Banking and 31 e-wallets of intermediary payment service providers that can participate in providing cashless payment solutions.

However, over the past month, the price was still around VNĐ48,000-50,000 per kilo of live hog. This shows that supply still meets demand.\nThere is no reason to forecast a lack of meat for the Tết festival in 2020. About 93 per cent of pigs were unaffected by African swine fever.\nThe price of pork in the Chinese market is rising – up to VNĐ100,000 per kilo of live hog in some localities – due to a shortage of pork. The crisis of supply means some provinces and cities have opened frozen pork storage, such as Jinan City, Hainan Province, Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, enhancing pork supply for the local market.\nHowever, China has recently reduced its imports of pork through border gates, and at the same time, it has increased the traceability and food safety of imported foods under commercial contracts.\nThose issues in neighbouring markets do not affect the pork price in the Vietnamese market.\nWhat will the ministry do to ensure enough pork\xa0and reduce the pressure on pork prices towards CPI?\nFacing African swine fever, the Government and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have directed the restructuring of the livestock sector.\nAs a result, the sector had a growth of about 3 per cent in cattle production in the first eight months of this year.\nPoultry production gained a growth rate of about 10 per cent. It is expected to increase from 11-13 per cent from now to the end of the year, with 409 million units of poultry and 11.6 billion eggs. Those products will partly offset the shortage of pork.\nMeanwhile, production of aquaculture in the first eight months rose by 5.7 per cent and is expected to reach a growth rate of 8 per cent for this year, ensuring both export and production growth targets.\nWhat will the ministry do to re-breed pigs in localities after African swine fever, especially regarding bio-safety breeding solutions?\nThe ministry\xa0has asked localities to implement synchronous measures on controlling African swine fever for stability in production and restructuring the livestock industry to diversify products.\nPig breeding maintains a large proportion in the meat structure because of the high demand for the daily meals of Vietnamese people. Therefore, if there is no solution for re-production, the risk of pork shortage is very high, especially towards year end and next year.\nIn fact, there are many companies applying bio-safety breeding measures for their production of pig, poultry and cattle, such as the pig breeding of Quế Lâm Group, Amavet Group and the Southern Breeding Sub-Institute.\nIn the process of re-development of pig herds, the ministry has guided the transportation of pig varieties and has also provided support for pig breeding facilities to ensure bio-safety in those facilities. Therefore, pig breeding facilities have basically maintained their production despite African swine fever. This ensures enough quality pig varieties to meet production needs.\nWith the strong development of the bio-safety pig breeding measure in provinces and cities nationwide and the development of breeding cattle, poultry and fishery products, the domestic market is expected to have enough meat for the upcoming Tết holiday.\nAccording to the Livestock Department, in 2016, there were 2,147 bio-safety pig farms, accounting for 18.3 per cent of total pig farms nationwide. This figure rose by 15.6 per cent in 2017 to nearly 2,500 farms, accounting for 24.4 per cent of the total pig farms. VNS'",2

But frankly, sometimes I do\xa0not know how to teach,”\xa0Hoà said.\nThis school year, Hưng Nguyên District recruited more than 30 teachers, but still lacks\xa050 others at pre\xa0and primary school levels.\nThe problem is particularly serious in mountainous schools which should be\xa0given priority.\nTà Cạ Ethnic Boarding School has no English or\xa0IT teachers.\n“From third grade, students are meant to study\xa0English and IT, but this seems like\xa0‘mission impossible’ in\xa0mountainous areas because we cannot recruit teachers for these subjects”, said Lê Văn Hoàng, the school’s vice principal.\n“The school is also unable to hire teachers on short-term contracts due to lack of money,”\xa0Hoàng said.\nAccording to Phan Văn Thiết, head of the Kỳ Sơn District's Department of Education and Training, there were only seven\xa0English and two\xa0IT teachers to cover the 29 primary schools in the district.\n“The teachers are\xa0sent to two national-standard schools as priority,”\xa0Thiết said.\n“The district was given a recruitment quota\xa0but we could not found the teachers,”\xa0he added.\nStatistics from the\xa0Nghệ An Department of Education and Training\xa0showed the province lacked nearly 4,300 teachers this year.\nAt primary level, the teacher-class ratio is meant to\xa01.5, but it's actually only\xa01.2.\nConsequence of staff downsizing\nThe situation is partly due to a plan to\xa0streamline\xa0payroll staff.\nAccording to experts, the plan was sound and would help increase labour productivity among\xa0public servants.\nBut the plan has exposed shortcomings in\xa0each specific sector,\xa0especially the education sector, because at present poor, rural, mountainous and remote areas\xa0where\xa0populations are\xa0scattered are suffering teachers shortages.\nAt present, thousands of teachers are working under direct contracts with their schools. The streamlining plan says that teachers must be instead on the Government\xa0payroll. This means they have to reapply for their jobs or the schools will have to end their\xa0contracts.\nThe consequences of this have\xa0been\xa0classes being\xa0merged together and\xa0increased working hours for the remaining\xa0teachers.\nSome schools have cut classes from\xa044 to 39,\xa0causing student overload.\nAccording to the Ministry of Education and Training, many localities\xa0were short of teachers including Kiên Giang (1,008), HCM City (1,290), Bình Dương (2,811), Đồng Nai (1,762), Gia Lai (2,572) Thanh Hoá (2,877), Nam Định\xa0 1,169, Thái Bình (3,167), Hưng Yên (1,742), Hải Dương (1,823), Bắc Ninh (1,479), Vĩnh Phúc (2,300), Bắc Giang (1,019), and Sơn La (3,355).\nHoàng Đức Minh, head of the the ministry's Department of Teachers\xa0and Education Managers, said the education sector and local authorities had been looking for solutions to deal with the situation in order to ensure teaching quality.\nThe Ministry of Education and Training\xa0had\xa0set up a database to calculate teacher shortages in different areas to guide\xa0the Ministry of Internal Affairs to adjust the streamlining plan, Minh said. – VNS",1

Ethereum is the leader of a new era of smarter and more complex blockchain technology and its open-source nature enables developers to create and publish decentralized apps for value transfer, social media, email, e-voting and other applications with great transparency. Buterin attended the University of Waterloo but dropped out in 2014, and went on to establish Ethereum Foundation, which launched a development project with over 30,000 bitcoins raised from its initial coin offering (ICO).\nThe economic war between the US\xa0and China is getting worse. The tit-for-tat began with a tariff and non-tariff barrier building, expanding into attacks and counterattacks even on individual companies. Now the two economic powers are almost at all-out war in economic fronts. The point is that the G2 war not only negatively impacts the two countries themselves but also threaten the whole global economy. For example, South Korea, which is heavily dependent on international trade, can be a victim of the war.\nThe trade spat will be discussed by two renowned scholars who represent their respective country: Niall Ferguson, senior fellow of Harvard University, and Justin Yifu Lin, professor of National School at Peking University. They will diagnose the nature of the G2 war and outline how it will develop. They are also expected to propose a solution to end the standoff.\nThe World Knowledge Forum this year will also provide a platform for a rich and stimulating political debate and this time will involve a close aide to President Donald Trump and a front-runner in the opposition camp regarding the US presidential election next year. David Urban, Chair of American Battle Monuments Commission, who helped spearhead Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state, and Bob Woodward, WP Associate Editor and author of his new book “Fear: Trump in the White House” will face off in this session.\nDavid Urban who joined the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1982 is Trump’s inner circle along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Mark Esper. Urban who is confident about Trump’s second-term win is expected to lay out the vision and policy direction of the Trump administration for the second term in office. Bob Woodward, an outspoken critic of President Trump, published the non-fiction book last year to reveal in unprecedented detail the harrowing life inside Donald Trump’s White House and how he makes decisions on major policies.\nOne of this year’s key differentiating factors for the World Knowledge Forum lies in shedding light on the K-Pop industry. Lee Soo-man, founder and executive producer of SM Entertainment Group, who is a global cultural figure and one of the who’s who behind K-Pop superstars, will be on the podium at the Jangchung Arena on September 25 to take a look at the past achievements and future opportunities in 2020 and beyond. He will also explain in detail the overseas market strategy for SM Entertainment’s new “Avengers” boy group SuperM. SuperM is a seven-member group consisting of SHINee’s Taemin, EXO members Baekhyun and Kai, and NCT members Taeyong, Mark, Ten, and Lucas. — VNS'",1

VNA/ VNS Photo Minh Đức\nKiều Trinh\nThe Ministry of Education and Training has published 32 textbooks for first graders under the new general education curriculum issued in 2018. These textbooks will be used from the 2020 -2021 school year.\nStudents across the country are still using textbooks approved under the 2005 general education curriculum, including a set published by the Vietnam Education Publishing House and a number of Professor Hồ Ngọc Đại\'s Primary Educational Technology books.\nIn December 2018, the Ministry of Education and Training announced a new general education curriculum, including 27 subject curricula. Based on the curriculum, authors were tasked writing textbooks for evaluation. After two rounds of evaluation, 38 out of 49 manuscripts on nine subjects met the requirements.\nOn November 21, Minister Phùng Xuân Nhạ approved 32 of the books. The subjects include Vietnamese, maths, ethics, nature and society, physical education, music, fine arts and experimental activities. Most of the authors of the 11 ""failed"" manuscripts are expected to continue editing for re-evaluation in December.\nAccording to the ministry, the new textbooks had been carefully compiled in accordance with the requirements of the new education curriculum. Many of the books apply modern teaching methods that were suitable for schools and students in Viet Nam.\nAmong the approved textbooks, the Vietnam Education Publishing House prevailed with 24, constituting four complete sets. Hanoi Pedagogical University and Ho Chi Minh City University of Education also had sets of four books approved.\nRegarding concerns that the Vietnam Education Publishing House had the most approved titles, Thai Van Tai, director of the Primary Education Department, said the textbooks were compiled by various authors and publishers, and exclusivity had been minimised.\nAccording to Nguyen Xuan Thanh, deputy director of the Secondary Education Department, with the new curriculum the textbooks were just part of the learning materials.\nAccording to the Education Law 2019 that will take effect in July 2020, the selection of textbooks will be decided by provincial People\'s Committees. Currently, the Ministry of Education and Training is drafting a circular guiding the selection of textbooks, which will then be widely studied before issuing. The circular on the selection of textbooks will specify the composition of the board, including educational managers, scientists and a majority of teachers who directly teach the subjects.\nBefore March 2020, localities will need to set up selection boards and announce the results of selection of textbooks from the list published by the ministry. In this regard, some people suggest that in order to select the right textbooks that are suitable for students, teaching conditions in each locality, and information about textbooks for schools, administrators, teachers, parents and the general public must be complete, accurate and publicly available.\nThe ministry plans to implement this and organise training for teachers, as well as ensure the textbooks are ready for the 2020-2021 school year. VNS\nThe differences of new general education curriculum\nFirstly, the current general education curriculum is content-oriented knowledge-transfer that does not help students apply what they have learned in practice.\nThe new general education curriculum aims to improve child development through basic, practical and modern knowledge with active learning methods to help students form and develop the skills expected by society. Education is not only about knowledge, it\'s about helping students complete tasks and solve problems effectively and creatively using what they have learned.\nSecondly, the current general education curriculum has almost identical educational content for all students and without clear career orientations for students.\nThe new curriculum clearly distinguishes two phases: the basic education stage (grades 1 to 9) and the career-oriented education phase (grades 10 to 12). In the basic education stage, the curriculum integrates related content of some subjects in the current programme to form integrated subjects to avoid overlapping of educational content and reduce the number of subjects reasonably.\nIn the career-oriented education phase, students are given a choice of subjects and educational activities that suit their interests, competence and career orientation.\nThirdly, the new curriculum pays more attention to connections between the content of classes and grades in each subject, and between subject curricula in each class and grade.\nFourthly, the new curriculum ensures unified orientation and core educational content, which are compulsory for students nationwide, while empowering local and school authorities to take the initiative and responsibility in their selection of some educational material, while implementing education plans suitable to local conditions.'",1

Additionally, more than 130,000 new enterprises were established and some 34,000 firms resumed operations in 2018, PM Phúc noted.\n\nDeputy PM Phạm Bình Minh attributed these achievements to the Government’s actions under the motto ‘Discipline, Integrity, Action, Creativity, Effectiveness’.\n\nThe Cabinet had taken actions with consistent targets of stabilising the macro-economy, controlling inflation, creating clear and substantive changes in the implementation of strategic breakthroughs, restructuring the economy and reforming the growth model, and improving labour quality and productivity and economic competitiveness.\n\nIt had also worked to reform mechanisms and policies to remove obstacles, streamline administrative procedures and enhance the business climate, he said.\n\nHowever, Minh also pointed out shortcomings of the Government, noting the proposal of mechanisms and policies remained slow, the settlement of policy loopholes had yet to meet expectations and ministries and agencies still lacked co-ordination in resolving inter-sectoral problems.\n\nThe shortcomings were attributable to the fact that leaders of some agencies hadn’t been drastic enough in their work and some officials lacked responsibility towards their duties.\n\nPM Phúc said following this meeting, the Government would issue several resolutions so the whole administrative system, enterprises and people could work to accomplish targets set for 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Việt Nam has fulfilled and surpassed all 12 socio-economic targets. The country’s GDP growth rate exceeded 7 per cent, while GDP scale reached US$245 billion, and average per capita GDP rose to $2,580. Exports were valued at $245 billion, up 13.8 per cent year-on-year, posting a trade surplus of more than $7 billion. The consumer price index growth was maintained at 3.54 per cent. The household poverty rate decreased to 6.8 per cent.—VNS'",0

Permeable fabric or fine nets were installed outside the barrier to hold the soil.\nThe barriers also cushion the banks from ripples and waves caused by travelling boats.\nCajuput and other plants that grow in water were then planted inside the barriers so that their roots bind the soil against erosion.\nThey cost VNĐ350 million (US$15,000).\nTheir cost per metre was only VNĐ400,000 ($17) compared to VNĐ60 million ($2,580) for concrete embankments, according to the sub-department.\nBesides, the trees planted in them generate an income of VNĐ700,000 – 900,000 ($30 - 38) per metre in three or four years’ time.\nThe province then built another 25 kilometres of similar embankments last year and 143 kilometres so far this year.\nIn Búng Tàu Town in Phụng Hiệp, some 100 households along the Búng Tàu and Ngang canals have built these embankments near their houses.\nCao Văn Bồi, who built a 30-metre embankment in front of his house in Búng Tàu’s Tân Phú A2 Hamlet, said many large boats traverse the canal, and without something to block them, the waves caused by the boats hit the canal banks and cause erosion.\n“The embankment helps stabilise the bank.”\nBesides cajuput, Bồi has also planted spotted mangroves in the embankment. He grows water hyacinth in the canal to absorb the energy of the waves until his plants grow large enough.\nTrần Thanh Oai, chairman of the Búng Tàu Town People’s Committee, said locals have built 2,000 metres of embankment under the guidance of officials.\nThe cost is borne by the locals themselves in some places.\nThe town plans to build more embankments and also instruct residents in building them, Oai said.\nTrần Thanh Toàn, head of the sub-department, said the embankments are a sustainable solution since they offer reliable protection and are cheap and environment-friendly.\nTheir use should be widely and regularly propagated to educate officials at all levels and the public, he said.\nThe province has a dense network of rivers and canals extending nearly 3,500 kilometres.\nIt has suffered from nearly 250 cases of erosion in the last five years, losing 25,000sq.m of land.\nTrương Cảnh Tuyên, deputy chairman of the People’s Committee, said the province has also built concrete embankments, but their high cost is an inhibiting factor, he said.\nThe earthen embankment is an appropriate solution and the province would expand its use, he added. \xa0VNS'",1

The difference lies in science and technology as it becomes increasingly important as the natural resources are being depleted fast,” Phúc said, adding that the resources Việt Nam should rely on are its ‘brainpower’ and creativity in order to foster our growth and development.\nWithin the framework of the ceremony, an exhibition featuring the science-technology sector’s development in the past six decades was held, introducing products and services used for mechanical engineering, electronics and telecommunications, medicine and pharmaceuticals, among others, along with materials reviewing the history of the sector with important milestones. — VNS'",1

VNA/VNS Photo Xuân Khu\nAN GIANG Lieutenant Colonel Vũ Trọng Tuệ still remembers one of his first investigations into drug trafficking as a member of the Southern Border Guard Soldiers’ Department of Drug and Crime Prevention.\nIt was almost 10 years ago when the Southern Border Guard Soldiers team learned some\xa0traffickers planned to transport drugs in a seven-seat car and decided to chase after the criminals, after two prior failed attempts to apprehend the group.\nIn April 2010, in\xa0Ninh Thuận Province the traffickers realised they were being followed and suddenly changed direction towards Phan Rang City.\nNo matter how crowded National Highway No 1 was, the traffickers drove very fast, sometimes at\xa0100km per hour and shot at the soldiers, Lieutenant Colonel Tuệ recalled.\nThe criminals drove for 30km and abandoned the car when encountering a road without an exit in Bảo An Ward, Phan Rang.\nIt was not until 1pm the next day that the soldiers found\xa0where the traffickers were hiding, arrested them and seized 20 bricks of heroin. Two police officers and one sniffer dog were injured in the firefight with the criminals.\nFor Lieutenant Colonel Tuệ and his colleagues, the case coded 909C was a difficult one as the team had failed to catch the traffickers on\xa0their first two attempts.\nNo matter how difficult it was, the team did not give up;\xa0they never do.\nColonel\xa0Nguyễn Trường Thọ, investigation assistant of the team, said case 909C taught soldiers lessons on selecting the right time to attempt to strike, preparation and working with other units.\nHot spots of drug trafficking\nDrug trafficking around Việt Nam's borders has become more complicated as the country has become a transit hub for traffickers.\nAccording to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 80 per cent of drugs brought into Việt Nam are bound for another country.\nBorder guard soldiers in the south have to be vigilant at all\xa0times to protect the border\xa0from local and foreign drug traffickers.\nThe number of drug trafficking cases at the end of 2018 and in the first months of 2019 in southern localities has reportedly risen, especially after northern and central localities stepped up a crackdown on drug traffickers.\nMore and more drug traffickers have fled to the south and Cambodia to produce synthetic drugs, set up drug trafficking rings\xa0and transport\xa0drugs from Cambodia to Việt Nam\xa0for local consumption or to ship elsewhere.\nForty provinces and cities in the south share more than 1,100km border with Cambodia and have nearly 50 international borders.\nThat makes the fight against drug trafficking tough for southern border guard soldiers.\nAccording to the Southern Border Guard Soldiers’ Department of Drug and Crime Prevention, in the first six months of this year, border guard soldiers nationwide tackled 482 drug-related cases involving 746 criminals and seized more than 2.1 kg of drugs. The number of cases increased by 142 per cent compared to the same period last year.\nOn the Việt Nam-Cambodia border, 60 people were arrested in 32 cases, with more than 129kg of drugs of different types seized.\nMajor General Nguyễn Hoài Phương, deputy commander of the Southern Border Guard Soldiers, said drug trafficking was predicted to get more complicated with more hot spots in the south.\nCities, big trade centres\xa0and transport links between Cambodia and Vietnamese southern provinces facilitate large numbers of people and goods crossing the border.\nThis had become a big challenge for border authorities, he said.\nThe Southern Border Guard Soldiers’ Department of Drug and Crime Prevention is a leading agency in the fight against drug trafficking in the south.\nColonel Nguyễn Trọng Việt, deputy head of the department, said drug traffickers were dangerous and had experience of fleeing authorities,\xa0and some were even\xa0armed.\n“The investigation is complicated and requires soldiers to spend time and effort. With professional skills, the border guard soldiers must be careful and follow laws because drug trafficking cases across borders involve foreign factors,” he said.\nAfter identifying suspects, the soldiers report to the department and start an investigation if approved. The soldiers work with agencies to probe how drugs are transported, set up plans and select the right time to catch the traffickers.\nOver the past 10 years, the team has tackled about 200 cases, arresting more than 400 criminals\xa0and seizing drugs and other exhibits including petrol, natural resources, guns and explosives.\nOn May 24, 2018, the team worked with HCM City’s police to arrest 10 drug traffickers and seized 39 bricks of heroin, 26kg of meth and more than 100,000 synthetic drug tablets.\nIn March this year, the team worked with police and customs to arrest 11 traffickers transporting 300kg of meth and expanded investigation to seize 276kg of meth to be transported to a third country.\nThe fight against drug traffickers is never easy and many soldiers have shed blood in the battle. Since the team was established in 2009, six soldiers have died on duty and\xa0hundreds of others have been injured.\nAccording to Lieutenant Colonel Nghiêm Nam Phong, deputy head of the department’s investigation group No1, the soldiers need to be not only determined and brave but also creative. The most\xa0dangerous time is when the investigators secretly follow the traffickers and wait for an opportunity to arrest them.\n“They need to be not only skilful at their professional skills but also brave enough to overcome challenges and not succumb to temptations such as bribes from\xa0the criminals.” VNS\nSoldiers arrest a trafficker and drugs in May 2019.

2011,'Việt Nam needs to pay more attention to Whitmore’s disease',"HÀ NỘI Whitmore, or melioidosis, is an infectious disease that has gone largely ignored in Việt Nam.\nLittle research has been conducted on the disease, despite the fact it is relatively common in agricultural countries\xa0like Việt Nam because it's caused by bacteria found in soil.\nSpeaking at the 9th global scientific conference on Whitmore’s disease held on Wednesday, Trịnh Thành Trung, director of the Hà Nội-based Vietnam National University’s Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology, said Việt Nam used to be a hotspot for\xa0the disease during the French Resistance War and the American War.\nThe first case of Whitmore’s disease was diagnosed\xa0in HCM City in 1925. After\xa0national liberation, a few more\xa0cases were discovered\xa0in Hà Nội and HCM City, but then the outbreak died down.\nThe disease has been neglected since then. In local hospitals, doctors have\xa0little knowledge about the disease and don't know how to test for it, leading to\xa0misdiagnoses.\nAs a result, the re-occurance of Whitmore’s disease has led to speculation of what it actually is,\xa0causing public anxiety.\nTrung said Whitmore, or melioidosis, was a dangerous acute infectious disease caused by a bacteria\xa0called Burkholderia pseudomallei. The bacteria lives\xa0in contaminated soil and water and is transmitted to humans through skin contact or inhalation and consumption of particles containing the bacteria.\nHowever, there was no conclusive scientific evidence for human-to-animal or animal-to-human transmission. Thus, Whitmore infections were\xa0often sporadic and not a pandemic.\nTrung\xa0has worked with 26 hospitals in 17 localities to introduce testing methods.\nThat’s why the number of diagnosed patients has reportedly increased in the past two months.\nIn that time, at least 12 people have been\xa0hospitalised with Whitmore’s disease at Hà Nội’s Bạch Mai Hospital and the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases, and four have died.\nĐỗ Duy Cường, director of\xa0Bạch Mai Hospital’s Centre for Tropical Diseases, said the disease was reportedly on the rise in many countries,\xa0such as Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, India and\xa0African nations.\nThe disease is especially dangerous for patients with high blood pressure or diabetes as the bacteria can\xa0cause septicaemia or organ failure.\nInternational experts said about 50 per cent of infected cases suffered immunodeficiency diseases and about 30 per cent of deaths\xa0were related to septic shock.\nThat's why it was so important to identify the primary infection on the patient's body so it could be treated quickly and effectively.\nAt the workshop, doctors shared different methods of\xa0testing for\xa0the disease. Currently, the test for Whitmore’s disease takes\xa05-7 days.\nDoctors are encouraging\xa0people, mostly farmers who have\xa0diabetes/chronic kidney or\xa0lung disease to go to a hospital equipped with microbiological laboratories if they start experiencing a high fever.\nThe 9th global scientific conference on Whitmore’s disease was jointly organised by the Vietnam National University’s Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology and the Medical University of Graz’s Institute of Hygiene, Microbiology and Environmental Medicine in Austria.\nThe three-day event is the largest global scientific conference on the research of Whitmore’s disease, and\xa0is held every three years. The event attracted more than 100 leading scientists from 26 countries to share the most outstanding research results about Whitmore’s disease and experiences on early diagnosis and treatment. VNS",1

Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore, on 31 May expressing his condolences on the passing of General Prem Tinsulanonda in which he said ‘His [General Prem’s] time as PM coincided with the ASEAN members (then five of us) coming together to oppose Việt Nam’s invasion of Cambodia and the Cambodian government that replaced the Khmer Rouge...’,” Hun Sen wrote.\n“His statement reflects Singapore’s position then in support of the genocidal regime and the wish for its return to Cambodia,” the Cambodian PM said, recalling that Singapore was the host of the tripartite meeting that led to the formation of the coalition government of the Democratic Kampuchea, which had prolonged the war and the suffering of the Cambodian people for another 10 years.\n“It’s an act against the survival of the Cambodian people. His statement is also an insult to the sacrifice of the Vietnamese military volunteers who helped to liberate Cambodia from the genocidal regime. His statement reveals to the Singaporean people and the world that leaders of Singapore had indeed contributed to the massacre of Cambodian people,” he added.\n“Finally, I shall ask whether H.E. Lee Hsien Loong considers the trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders legitimate?” the PM concluded.\nEarlier, Cambodian Deputy PM and Defence Minister Tea Banh, President of the Union of Youth Federations and National Assembly member Hun Many, and many scholars and analysts in Phnom Penh also rebuked PM Lee Hsien Loong for his statement. — VNS'",0

They are really good at controlling the ball\xa0and some of their players can have\xa0an instant impact.\n“We cannot afford to loose our\xa0concentration\xa0even for a second. We have our advantages but Ceres are a difficult team and they have more experience in the Zonal finals,” Nghiêm said.\nNational midfielder Đỗ Hùng Dũng said: “We understand them. They have national team players. They are skilful and fast. We have experienced them in the previous match and hope\xa0our tactics will\xa0work in the match tomorrow. We expect to have a slot in the final.”\nOn the other side, coach Risto Vidakovic confirmed Hà Nội’s advantage but said his team would not give up.\nThe Serbian manager said Ceres Negros would work hard for the\xa0win.\nVidakovic said he could not describe his confidence of a win over Hà Nội who were home to 10 national team players. Ceres Negros also had national players and secret weapons. They were 100 per cent beating the hosts.\nCaptain Alvaro Silva, who played for Hà Nội FC in 2017 and scored four goals, said the chances were\xa0equal for both teams. Playing against former teammates, especially national team members, would be a good experience\xa0for him and he believed Ceres would come through.\nThe match will kick\xa0off\xa0at 7pm and will be aired live on Fox Sports and VTC channels. — VNS",3

We face extreme weather, environmental pollution, smog, toxic emissions that led to a much higher risk of occupational diseases than drivers of other means of transport.”\nSên said drivers should be earning VNĐ150 million ($6,450) instead of the current VNĐ100 million($4,300) before they pay income tax.\nMany other drivers agree with Sên.\nSpeaking on the Facebook page, Hà Nội\xa0Grab\xa0Driver Community, many voiced their opinions about the amount they pay in tax.\nDương Thành, whose sons are aged 11 and five, said: “I earn VNĐ9 million ($390) per month and it is just too hard to afford the schooling of my two sons.

He told his colleagues they need to fight for change from Government.\nOn August 26, Grab started collecting a fixed sum of VNĐ60,000 ($2.6) daily from drivers, whom it estimates have an annual income of VNĐ100 million or higher, to fulfil its tax obligations on their behalf.\nAfter facing immediate opposition, Grab cancelled the collections the next day.\n“[We] will also refund any amount already collected to the e-wallets of these partner drivers,” Grab said in the statement on August\xa027.\nAt the meeting, Nguyễn Văn\xa0Thiện - Head of Public Relation Department of HCM City Tax Department confirmed they instructed Grab to collect taxes according to the law, adding “however, if there are unsuitable points, we will listen, record then make recommendations to the General Department of Taxation, the Government to change for better tax policy.”\nGrab representative also said they always did their best to obey the local laws and also work with the tax authorities to find a softer tax solution for its driver partners.\nThere are more than 400,000 drivers riding with three major ride-hailing firms of Grab, Go-Viet and Be.\xa0 — VNS'",2

Photo SBV\nHÀ NỘI The State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV) on Friday announced it would cut several key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, starting from September 16, to support economic growth.\nThe rate cuts were the first by the SBV since October 2017.\nAccordingly, the annual refinancing rate and rediscount rate will be lowered from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent, and from 4.25 per cent to 4 per cent, respectively\nThe annual overnight electronic interbank rate and rate of loans to offset capital shortage in clearance between the central bank and domestic banks will be also cut to 7 per cent.\nThe interest rate of bids of valuable papers through the open market operations will be reduced from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent annually.\nAccording to the SBV, it previously took monetary policy measures to stabilise interest rates in the context of rising interest rates in the international market, which contributed to macroeconomic stability and support growth at reasonable levels.\nHowever, it has now decided to make the new move as the global economy has become more volatile and less favourable, while central banks of many countries, including the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB), have cut their key interest rates.\nThe cut is made in the context that in the domestic market, the macroeconomy continues to be stable, inflation was under control, and the monetary and foreign exchange markets were stable, the SBV said in the statement.\nExperts have also agreed with the central bank’s move.\nBanking and finance expert Cấn Văn Lực told\xa0Việt Nam News\xa0that the cut at this moment was suitable, especially in the context that the economy was slowing and central banks in many countries have cut interest rates.\n“It is estimated that some 40 countries worldwide have so far this year cut interest rates. After making a rate cut for the first time in more than a decade in July, the Fed is likely to cut the rates a second time at its meeting later this month,” Lực said.\nLực said the cut would not put pressure on the country’s inflation and the exchange rate as the inflation was low and the exchange rate was relatively stable.\nData from the General Statistics Office showed that the country’s inflation cooled to 2.57 per cent in August 2019, down from 3.52 per cent in August 2018. The rate was the lowest rise for the past three years. In 2019, inflation is projected to average at 2.9 per cent, buoyed by weak transport inflation due to a drop in average oil prices in the year.\nThe exchange rate was also nearly steady, with the US dollar listed at commercial banks to inch up by only some VNĐ10 for buying and VNĐ30 for selling against the end of 2018. The central bank’s USD/VNĐ daily reference exchange rate also rose slightly by 1.28 per cent against end-2018.\nAccording to Lực, the new rate cut will also help interest rates listed at commercial banks to cool in the context that some banks have increased their deposit rates to 8.55 per cent per year.\nThe central bank’s key rate cut is considered a reference for the market to follow suit. It would also be an effective measure to support liquidity for commercial banks, helping them cut input costs so as to ensure the stability of lending interest rates. VNS",2

This year, Việt Nam welcomed more than 620,000 Japanese visitors, up 13.7 per cent over the same period in 2018.\nIn 2018, the number of Japanese visitors to Việt Nam reached nearly 830,000, a year on year increase of 3.6 per cent.\nJapanese guests have a special impression on traditional culture, cultural heritages, cuisine, handicrafts, natural landscapes and historical sites of Việt Nam, it said.\nFollowing Japan, Việt Nam's tourism industry will continue to attend the China - ASEAN International Tourism Fair 2019, which takes place from October 18-20, in Guilin, China, according to the administration.\nThe VNAT also said\xa0Việt Nam ranks 63rd among the 140 countries and territories in the recently released\xa0Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index\xa0(TTCI) 2019, jumping four places compared to the latest 2017 ranking, especially thanks to improvements in international openness and visa policies.\nIts visa requirements in the international openness sub-index achieved the greatest improvement, jumping 63 spots in the global rankings.\nIn recent years, Việt Nam has made multiple efforts to improve the openness of its visa policies, such as increase of number of countries joining visa exemptions for travelers and applying of e-visas.\nAccording to the report, Việt Nam also moved up in terms of price competitiveness (to 22nd from 35th), airport transport infrastructure (to 50th from 61st) and tourism service infrastructure (to 106th from 113th).\nIt ranked fifth in Southeast Asia in travel and tourism competitiveness, following Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.\nHowever, the report said Việt Nam still has to deal with challenges relating to labour quality, availability of information technology and communication, and tourism service infrastructure.\nAsia-Pacific was one of the fastest-growing travel and tourism regions in this year’s ranking, according to the report.\nReleased by the World Economic Forum (WEF) every two years since 2007, the TTCI 2019 analysed 140 economies and scored each according to their performance on the following six pillars – air transport infrastructure, ICT readiness, price competitiveness, international openness, travel & tourism prioritisation, and safety and security. \xa0VNS",2

Many banks had to sell bad debts to VAMC so they could take the debts off\xa0their balance sheet to have a bad debt ratio of below 3 per cent as required by the central bank and could continue their operations as normal banks.\nBy selling the debts to VAMC, instead of money, banks received five-year special bonds from VAMC. During the five years, banks had to make provisions of 20 per cent for special bonds each year. In principle, this affects banks’ annual profits.\nCurrently, the list of banks which have cleared all bad debts at VAMC includes\xa0Vietcombank, VIB, Techcombank, TPBank, MB, OCB, Nam A Bank and Kiên Long Bank.\nWhen the on-balance sheet bad debt ratio at banks is low and banks have gained fairly high profits in recent years, the trend of buying back bad debts to clear debts at VAMC is becoming more popular.\nIn the first nine months of the year, Kiên Long Bank’s core businesses were positive, with total assets rising by 10.8 per cent against the end of last year to VNĐ46.87 trillion and pre-tax profit up 6 per cent year-on-year to VNĐ236 billion.

The Government has issued a clear mechanism to encourage renewable energy development through an attractive feed-in tariff (FiT) pricing mechanism with long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and subsidies on related taxes to facilitate the mobilisation of funds for renewable energy projects.\nHowever, they also said the policy on electricity users has not yet been given due attention. The current PPAs are currently limited to signing with only one buyer of the Vietnam Electricity. Other contracts that allow power plants to sell their renewable-based generated electricity directly to large power consumers are only at the pilot implementation stage. They also said the existing FiT pricing mechanism in Việt Nam did not reflect the market price.\nThus, they recommended Việt Nam create attractive financial mechanisms to attract renewable energy power plants to participate in the energy balance and ancillary service market; specific regulations and mechanisms to control grid congestion, limiting curtailment of renewable energy sources in line with the trend of integrating high proportion of renewable energy; as well as regulations and mechanisms to encourage the installation of an energy storage system and to allow the participation of auxiliary service providers to increase the flexibility and reliability of the electricity system.\nRepresentatives of the workshop also suggested financial mechanisms to implement the Demand Response Programme (DR) and attractive financial regulations and mechanisms to enable the realisation of the virtual power plant (VPP) model.\nERAV Deputy Director Trần Tuệ Quang told the workshop that ERAV expected to receive ideas, comments\xa0and suggestions from technical experts as well as consultants, to evaluate and propose a suitable legal framework for the actual development of Việt Nam’s smart grid and electricity system. —\xa0VNS'",2

If we don\'t catch up and transform in time, we will be landed in an embarrassing situation,” Cường said.\n“China is promoting economic restructuring, focusing on reviving agriculture. Because of that, many of our major agricultural products have seen reduced export turnover, facing many difficulties. If these changes are not recognised, export efficiency will be low,” he added.\nAnh said exports of agricultural and aquatic products to China still faced many difficulties as Việt Nam’s business practices were still mainly based on border trade, with small volume transactions paid for in cash and with simple export procedures.\nTherefore, agricultural and aquatic products had not met technical barriers, not creating a sustainable production and consumption chain, Anh added.\n“Difficulties in exporting to China have existed for many years although ministries and businesses have made great efforts to resolve them. However, at this time, it must be changed because China has increasingly applied barriers and high and strict requirements related to product quality, food safety, traceability and branding construction,” Anh said.\nHe said the Chinese side had great demand for Vietnamese key products such as rice, rubber, seafood and processed agricultural products. Therefore, Việt Nam wanted to work with China to find specific solutions for export growth, creating a stable market for Việt Nam’s agricultural sector in China.\nLê Hoàng Oanh, Director of the MoIT’s Asia-Africa Market Department, recommended businesses focus on production according to plans, which must be based on demand, market capacity and season.\nIn parallel with that, Oanh said it was necessary to promote national trade promotion programmes in China, building distribution and consumption channels in the country.\nShe said thinking in terms of exporting agricultural and aquatic products must also change to increase official exports, abolishing small-sized border trade.\nShe said it was important to focus on official exports to cut legal risks as well as gradually building brands and improving quality, safety and product design, meeting requirements on packaging, labels, traceability, factory registration and growing areas.\n""In particular, the reliance on border trade and non-contractual transactions needs to be abolished and converted into formal trade,"" Oanh said.\nAccording to Deputy Head of MoIT’s Export-Import Department Trần Thanh Hải in terms of agricultural and aquatic products, China is the largest export market of Việt Nam, accounting for 27 per cent of the country’s total export turnover. China is also Việt Nam’s largest importer of rubber, vegetable and fruits and various types of cassava, the third largest of wood and wood products and the fourth largest of tea.\nWith a population of more than 1.4 billion, or 18.7 per cent of the world, the Chinese market’s demand for agricultural and aquatic products is huge and diverse. China\'s 32 provinces and cities all have different needs for each specific product.\nViệt Nam and China have signed the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA), which came into effect in 2010, with tariffs reduced to zero for 8,000 product lines. It has great potential for Vietnamese agricultural and aquatic products to be exported to China.\nStatistics shows Việt Nam’s agricultural and aquatic product export turnover in the first eight months this year is estimated at US$16.6 billion, down 7.2 per cent year-on-year. — VNS'",2

Floating solar, the term used to refer to floating PV structure installed on water bodies, such as lakes, reservoirs, mining or irrigation ponds, is expected to become the ‘next frontier’ of the solar energy industry.\nViệt Nam’s first floating solar farm on Đa Mi Reservoir was connected to the power grid in May this year. The VNĐ1.2 trillion (US$51.5 million) plant, developed by Đa Nhim-Hàm Thuận-Đa Mi Hydropower Joint Stock Company (DHD), has a total capacity of 47.5MWp (megawatt peak) and power output of about 70 million kWh per year.\nThe project features 143,940 solar panels on\xa050ha of the reservoir in Tánh Linh and Hàm Thuận Bắc districts of Bình Thuận Province. In the first phase, it is operating at a capacity of 20.5MWp.\nAccording to Nguyễn Trọng Oánh, chairman of DHD, floating solar systems are similar to land-based solar power except the solar panels are installed on pontoon-type floats, with an anchoring and mooring system holding the platform in place.\nBesides the advantage\xa0of using existing electricity transmission infrastructure at hydropower sites, eliminating the need for major site preparation, floating solar farms have been proven to bring higher energy yield thanks to the cooling effects of water and decreased presence of dust which hurts panel performance.\n“Under the same solar radiation, floating solar installations will be more efficient than ground-mounted or rooftop solar power systems,” Oánh told Việt Nam News.\nLast week, Đồng Nai People’s Committee proposed the Ministry of Industry and Trade develop eight floating solar farms on the man-made Trị An Lake. Spanning more than 7,100ha of water surface across different districts in the province, these floating solar projects would have total capacity of 5,400MWp and be added to the national power development plan by 2025.\n“The potential for floating solar is quite promising in Việt Nam, especially in existing hydropower reservoirs,” Jackie B\xa0Surtani, Director of Infrastructure Finance Division, ADB Private Sector Operations Department, told Việt Nam News.\nSurtani said ADB had conducted “quick look” satellite imagery surveys of Việt Nam’s hydropower resources and found there would easily be room for several gigawatts of floating solar in existing reservoirs. Protected bays are a second possibility for floating solar and could allow for hundreds of additional megawatts.\nHybrid hydro-PV system\nSince the first floating PV system was built in 2007 in Japan, the floating solar market has been well established in many countries, with China the largest player. However, the development of hybrid systems that combine hydropower and floating solar is still at an early stage.\n“The combination of hydropower and floating solar is definitely feasible,” Surtani said.\nHydropower and solar can be co-located, with either floating or ground-mounted solar around a hydropower reservoir, he said, adding that using existing hydropower infrastructure reduces installation costs of the solar farm. Depending on daily demand, it is possible to reduce hydropower output during the day and bring it back up in the evening, with solar covering a portion of peak demand in the afternoon.\n“The ADB-DHD floating project shows that the solar output can be coupled with hydropower output. In practice, hydropower output can be varied to smooth out or ‘mask’ the intermittency of solar output,” he said, saying that blending\xa0hydro and solar output required an intelligent energy management system, and this technology is proven and currently being used in Việt Nam.\nOn the difficulties of\xa0developing Việt Nam’s first hydro-floating solar system, Oánh said the project had received mixed feedback on its feasibility and efficacy.\n“We’ve spent a lot of time researching, measuring radiation and environmental parameters, visiting similar works at home and abroad to support and prove the project's efficiency,” Oánh said.\nSince being put into operation in June, the performance of Đa Mi solar power plant has been high thanks to the effective\xa0solar panels, which are cooled by natural cooling surface temperatures, he said.\nProject progress was also a major challenge. Oánh said to be able to sell electricity at 9.35 US cents/kWh, all solar power plants must be operational by June 30, 2019, thus the company\xa0rushed to complete the project and successfully run it commercially in early June, a month ahead of schedule.\nHe said the project was contributing to the\xa0development of the province by recruiting local workers, easing\xa0electricity shortages for the province and the southern region, as well as paying tax to the local budget.\nThe combination of hydro and solar power on the reservoirs could be a new direction in\xa0electricity in Việt Nam but challenges remain.\n“In my experience, utilising hydroelectric reservoirs to install solar power platforms will be only effective for lakes with low water level fluctuations,” Oánh said, adding that if water levels fluctuate greatly, the cost of the anchoring system would be very high.\nBoth local and foreign investors have shown interest in floating solar power in Việt Nam. Vietnam Electricity is considering building floating solar farms on lakes and reservoirs in Bình Thuận, Đồng Nai and Gia Lai provinces.\nCompanies from South Korea and Norway have carried out surveys in Việt Nam, seeking partners to build floating solar power plants on lakes.\n“The next phase of the renewable programme in Việt Nam should focus on leveraging private sector competition to reduce the cost of renewable energy generation. If this goes through an auction or some other mechanism, Việt Nam can benefit from lower generation costs,” Surtani said.\nTechnology is moving fast and Việt Nam needs to catch up with the trend to rapidly transition to a green energy market.— VNS",2

If everyone gets ready to come up with new ideas and work together to turn ideas into practice, success will definitely come to us,” the Deputy Prime Minister said.\nHe highlighted the need to connect in the era of the fourth industrial revolution to cut gaps between Việt Nam and the world.\nAccording to Chu Ngọc Anh, Minister of Science and Technology, the Vietnamese start-up eco-system has been supported by a legal framework including various laws.\nIn the first 10 months of this year, there were 29 business transactions attracting a total of more than US$750 million, with the biggest deal worth up to $300 million in fintech, the\xa0biggest such transaction in Southeast Asia\nStart-up spirit has been spread nationwide. The Vietnamese start-up eco-system has grown up with 38 incubators and\xa0more than 170 co-working spaces nationwide, while 52 out of 63 provinces and cities have plans and mobilised resources to support start-ups. There are 61 innovative start-up funds nationwide, he said.\nTechfest 2019 will continue until Friday with activities such as a start-up exhibition, technology showcase, matching between investors and start-ups and start-up contests.\nUnlock potentials\nVenture capital investment in Vietnamese start-ups surged by eight times between 2015 and 2018, said Thạch Lê Anh, Việt Nam Silicon Valley Accelerator’s Founder at the Eco-system Summit 2019 held at Techfest the same day.\n“The investment in Vietnamese start-ups, which ranks third in Southeast Asia behind Indonesia and Singapore, has improved in both quality and number of deals. This is such a source of pride for Việt Nam and also an opportunity for localities across the country to develop local start-up eco-systems,” she said.\nAccording to her, Vietnamese start-ups specialise in not only one sector but in various fields, with the number of start-ups increasing from 400 in 2012 to 3,000 in 2018.\nHowever, the definition of angel investors seems to be rather new to the public in Việt Nam. Angel investors who make “silent contributions to the start-up community” might be entrepreneurs, working or retired policy makers who consult start-ups and invest\xa0to help start-ups access markets. In Việt Nam, there is no specific policy to encourage angel investors or any agency in charge of certifying\xa0angel investors, she said.\n“There should be a law on venture capital including regulations related to angel investors,” she said.\nTo unlock the full potential\xa0of Vietnamese start-ups, Anh highlighted the need for a network of angel investors as well as start-up and venture capital investment centres.\nGibs Song, an investor from South Korea and a partner of Việt Nam Silicon Valley Accelerator, said Việt Nam’s start-up eco-system is very active. It is young compared to US’s Silicon Valley, as well as the Japanese, South Korean and\xa0Singaporean eco-systems, but start-ups are very eager, have a lot of desire and are catching up with the rest of the world very quickly.\n“More foreign companies are interested in Vietnamese start-ups. Right now it is not easy for them to come to Việt Nam to settle down, learn the market and find partners,” he told Việt Nam News.\nViệt Nam can do more to host non-Vietnamese companies so they can move to Việt Nam more easily. Foreign and Vietnamese companies can work together to create a diverse start-up eco-system, he said. — VNS",2

He was previously charged with child molestation without intent to have intercourse in December 2018 but was released on bail.\nThe scandal was brought to light late last year when an investigation by Vietnam Television (VTV)\xa0found the 58-year-old principal took advantage of his position to call many male students to his office for so-called study checks. These checks occurred from the end of 2016 until December 2018.\nVTV exposed the scandal by secretly filming the boys recalling the\xa0abuse. While the children spoke to reporters voluntarily, they were unaware they were being recorded.\nSome of the seven victims\xa0claimed My forced them to perform sex acts on him.\nMy allegedly gave the boys some sweets or cash of between VNĐ20,000 and VNĐ50,000 (90 US cents-$2) each time, telling them to keep quiet.\nMy’s victims ranged from 7th to 9th graders with the youngest only 13-years-old at the time. Some were sexually abused several times over a long period of time, according to police.\nMost of the students at the school where the scandal took place came from poor ethnic minority families.\nThe investigation is ongoing but if found guilty, My faces up to 15 years behind bars.\nFormer prosecutor jailed\nOn the same day, HCM City’s District 4 People’s Court sentenced Nguyễn Hữu Linh to 18 months in jail for molesting a child under 16 years old in accordance with Article 146 of 2015 Penal Code.\nLinh was a former deputy head of Đà Nẵng City People’s Procuracy.\nAccording to the indictment, the incident occurred on the evening of April 1 in\xa0the elevator of the\xa0Galaxy 9 apartment building in District 4 where Linh was\xa0visiting his son and the girl in question was returning home to\xa0the 10th floor.\nThere were only two of them in the elevator and Linh is alleged to have suddenly grabbed the girl and started\xa0kissing her\xa0despite her resistance.\nThe girl was only able to escape when the elevator opened.

5362,'Renewable-energy plan could help VN meet power goals by 2030',"'Visitors at a booth displaying a solar power model at the Solar Show Việt Nam 2019 organised last week in HCM City. — VNS Photo Bồ Xuân Hiệp\nHCM\xa0CITY\xa0—\xa0A long-term plan for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind must be devised for Việt Nam to realise its goal of connecting the entire country to the national grid, experts have said.\nRenewable energy will play an essential role in helping Việt Nam accomplish the\xa0goal by 2030, but more Government efforts are needed to attract investment in the sector, they noted.\nSpeaking at an international conference on renewable energy held last week in HCM City, experts said that annual energy consumption in the country had risen by 10 per cent in recent years, and the country was at risk of facing power shortages in the 2020s.\nViệt Nam has the potential to reach 35,000MW generated by the sun by 2030, according to researchers. Solar energy projects, including rooftop solar, is viewed as one of the major solutions to reduce pressure on the electricity sector.\nThe generation of 1kWh of solar energy will help reduce CO2 emissions by 0.6612 kg, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.\nSolar energy, a clean energy resource with relatively high output, would also reduce the amount of state spending on power generation and transmission facilities.\nIf only two million rooftops have solar panels (with a capacity of 10 kW per roof), the country would cut by 16 million tonnes the amount of coal needed per year for coal-fired power plants.\nTrần Việt Nguyên, deputy head of the Electricity of Việt Nam (EVN) business division, said that EVN offices last year installed rooftop solar systems at 54 locations with a total capacity of 3.2 MWp.\nSome 1,800 customers, including offices, businesses and households, are installing rooftop solar systems with a total capacity of 30.12 MWp, he said.\nIn HCM City, EVN has installed rooftop solar systems with a total capacity of nearly 1,130 kWp and is continuing to deploy other systems.\nHowever, Trần Đình Nhân, EVN general director, said this amount was far below the potential of Việt Nam, attributing the reason to a lack of specific regulations about electricity purchases when households connect their solar power systems to the national grid.\nIn addition, information about rooftop solar power remains unclear and the cost of solar power investment at VNĐ20-25 million ($1,000) per kWp is still high, while there is little Government support policy for solar power projects.\nCustomers continue to be reluctant to invest in solar systems due to a lack of information about product quality, operating methods, and equipment warranty.\nSolar energy goals\nWith the goal of reaching solar output of 1GWp by 2020, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc recently approved Việt Nam’s renewable energy development strategy to 2030.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade has also issued Circular 16 on solar project development and power purchase agreements (PPAs) in order to solve issues related to taxes and payment methods for rooftop solar power projects.\nAs of the end of last year, about 10,000MW of solar energy had been generated by large solar projects,\xa0according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\nMore than 100 power purchase agreements (PPAs) were signed with two of them having total capacity of 86MW,\xa0the ministry said.\nPPA is a financial agreement in which a developer arranges for design, permits, financing and installation of a solar energy system on a customer’s property, at little to no cost.\nThe developer sells the power generated to the host customer at a fixed rate that is typically lower than the local utility’s retail rate.\nThis lower electricity price serves to offset the customer’s purchase of electricity from the grid while the developer receives income from the sale of electricity as well as any tax credits and other incentives generated from the system.\nAt the end of the PPA contract term, a customer may be able to extend the agreement, have the developer remove the system, or choose to buy the solar energy system from the developer.\nPPAs usually range from 10-25 years and the developer remains responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system for the duration of the agreement.\nEVN currently cannot sign PPAs with customers because of the lack of official instructions on how to buy solar electricity from households.\nMore effort needed\nNhân, EVN general director, said the electricity sector would assist households and enterprises in installing solar power systems and help them with procedures to connect to the national grid and sign power purchasing agreements.\nHe said the buying of solar electricity connected to the grid would be done as soon as there are guiding circulars issued by the authorities.\nEVN will pay for installation of electricity meters to measure the volume of electricity consumed as well as connected to the grid.\nSamresh Kumar, managing director for principal investments at VinaCapital, said it was important to mobilise international capital to improve the development of rooftop solar energy.\nHoàng Quốc Vượng, deputy minister of Industry and Trade, said that a circular to amend Circular 16 would soon be issued by the ministry after collection of comments from ministries and sectors is completed.\nThe new document will specify the method of payment for the purchase of solar output via specific contracts.\xa0The legal document is also expected to encourage investment in and development of rooftop solar energy in the future, he said.\nSpeaking at an international conference on renewable energy held last week in HCM City, Nguyễn Tâm Tiến, CEO of Trung Nam Group, said that renewable energy generation had already significantly increased.\nMai Văn Trung, business development director at SolarBK, said the country\xa0has favourable conditions to develop solar energy\xa0and that commercial and industrial solar PV rooftop applications have great development potential.\nSamresh Kumar of VinaCapital said that solar rooftop power is an effective solution which provides a commercially viable option, especially for commercial and industrial segments.\nJohn Rockhold, head of the power and energy sub-working group under the Việt Nam Business Forum, said rooftop solar panels were key to reducing pressure on the national grid, and that modest annual price increases and a road map for efficient energy were both needed. —\xa0VNS'",4

Technologies helped improve business models and processes as well as created new products and services to serve the need of customers.\nTake mobile payments, for example. According to a PwC survey this year, Việt Nam was among the countries with the fastest growth rate in mobile payments. The number of users had seen a sharp increase to 61 per cent from just 37 per cent the year before.\nIn the first eight months of 2019, total value of mobile payments in Việt Nam increased by 150 per cent as the number of mobile transactions doubled from the same period last year, according to a report by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV).\nA report by Google in April showed the size of Việt Nam\'s digital economy could reach US$12 billion by the end of 2019 and $43 billion by 2025. Việt Nam and Indonesia are the fastest-growing digital economies in ASEAN, with over 40 per cent annual growth.\nThe SBV projected the digital economy would account for up to 20 per cent of the country\'s GDP in 2025. Technologies, especially digital technologies, would be an important driver for economic growth and increased productivity to help develop the nation.\n""The digital transformation is inevitable and Việt Nam\'s banking and finance sector is well-prepared to embrace it,"" said Nguyễn Kim Anh, the SBV\'s Deputy Governor, at the workshop.\nAnh said the sector was among the country\'s leaders in adopting new technologies and innovations, and in reworking its regulatory and legal framework to make use of their advantages.\nDr Sebastian Paust, First Counsellor, Head of Development Cooperation at the German Embassy in Hà Nội, discussed Germany’s development cooperation strategy in supporting digital transformation.

He stressed that ambassadors and diplomatic missions of Middle East-African countries play a significant role in helping the two sides fully tap the potential.\nThe PM suggested the two sides work together in fields such as trade, investment, agriculture, information technology and communication, energy, education-training, labour and tourism.\nBesides bilateral co-operation, the two sides should expand collaboration in the region and the world, he recommended.\nThe PM welcomed the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) and Việt Nam’s preparation for the signing of an agreement to set up a dialogue mechanism, and urged accelerating the establishment of official relations between Việt Nam and the African Union and expanding cooperation between Việt Nam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other regional and sub-regional organisations in the Middle East-African region.\nPM Phúc called on regional and international organisations, and development agencies of developed economies to accompany Việt Nam and Middle East-African countries in carrying out trilateral and quadrilateral cooperation activities towards realising common development goals.\nOn behalf of the delegation of ambassadors, Ambassador of Djibouti to Việt Nam Admed Araita Ali described the meeting of ambassadors from Middle East-Africa, an initiative of Việt Nam’s Foreign Ministry, as a useful activity. In the context of rising global protectionism, the co-operation between Middle East-Africa and Việt Nam proved the significance of opening the market, he said.\nPPP in agriculture\nViệt Nam, the Middle East and Africa should pilot trilateral public-private partnerships in farm produce production and processing, said Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Lê Quốc Doanh.\nThe partnerships should\xa0prioritise sectors in which Việt Nam has technological strength and high consumption demand in Middle Eastern and African markets such as rice, rubber, coffee, cashew nuts, breeding and aquaculture, he said.\nDoanh made the recommendation yesterday at the\xa0‘Prospects and Project Models for Agricultural and Aquaculture Co-operation between Việt Nam and the Middle East, Africa’ workshop.\nDoanh said Việt Nam had sent more than 400 experts to support agricultural development in African countries such as Mozambique, Benin, Guinea and\xa0Senegal.

In 2010, Mozambique’s rice production was 2 tonnes per ha. After the introduction of good practice of Vietnamese agriculture, Mozambique is producing 7 tonnes of rice per ha, which is a very good achievement.”\nAccording to the ambassador Mozambique has a strategic position for regional and international markets. Mozambique has 36 million ha of agricultural land but only 5.2 million ha has been used so the country has more room to make profit.\n“80 per cent of Mozambique’s population is living in rural areas. We are making all efforts to improve our agriculture,” he told the workshop.\nAccording to the ambassador, Mozambique’s co-operation with Việt Nam in aquaculture began in 2009.\n“Before that, we used to produce 600 tonnes of fish per year. Since 2009 when we received technical support from Vietnamese technicians, we now produce 3,000 tonnes per year, which is also a good achievement.”\nHe took the opportunity from the workshop to invite the Vietnamese business community to invest in Mozambique’s agriculture and aquaculture in technology transfer, agriculture modernisation, drainage, processing service and infrastructure.\nInvestment in Mozambique is guaranteed by law. The country also has investment procedures and business procedure guides, according to the ambassador.\nThe workshop concluded with the signing of a memorandum of understanding to kick off co-operation between Việt Nam Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Organic Agricultural Economics Institute, Lavifood JS Company and Green Start-up Fund to apply agricultural sciences in agricultural value chains’ sustainable development.

All his left side is a bit messed up but nothing serious,"" he said.\n""We have to refocus after the rest day,"" added Portal.\nThomas remains 1min 35sec behind Alaphilippe in the overall standings, with the following three riders all within 27seconds ahead of three challenging days\xa0in the Alps.\nHe also tumbled after flying over a barrier in the wild atmosphere in Brussels on the opening day, and again on the road to Saint-Etienne on stage\xa0eight.\nThis time the 33-year-old had no problem getting back to the pack on a flat stage with no wind to split the peloton.\nThe popular 2018 Tour de France champion was sweating at the start line\xa0alongside the spectacular stone bullring known as the Arena in downtown Nimes.\n""I\'m just concentrating on keeping fuelled and hydrated and getting to the\xa0end of the race,"" he said before embarking.\nAlps like in Colombia\nThomas\'s teammate the 22-year-old Colombian Egan Bernal, who is fifth 27 seconds behind Thomas but 2min 02sec behind Alaphilippe was a picture of\xa0serenity after the race.\n""Okay it was hot but it wasn\'t so bad,"" said Bernal, who has the best under-25\'s white jersey.\n""I rather like these conditions and to be honest I\'m looking forward to the Alps. In terms of altitude it\'ll be like in Colombia"" he said.\n""The day off really did me good, I feel great today.""\nBernal said that Thomas was in good shape despite his heavy fall.\n""I spoke to him just now and he\'s seen the doctor already and he\'s just got a couple of cuts, nothing serious"" said Bernal.\n""It was nothing out of this world, there must have been something on the\xa0road.""\nAlaphilippe has been hugely active signing autographs with the French\xa0public the past two weeks, but went straight to his team bus Tuesday and did\xa0not reappear.\nEwan meanwhile was following up his victory on stage 11 at Toulouse and with Nimes melting under 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) the Australian was\xa0favourite for a repeat performance, this time edging Italian Elia Viviani on\xa0the line.\n""I\'ll look back on this Tour and say it was a success,"" said the diminutive Ewan. ""This is the furthest I have ever been in a Grand Tour, I\'ve never\xa0finished one before.""\nPeter Sagan, who came fourth on the day but is in the green sprint points jersey, said it was too hot to race and that something should be done to\xa0protect riders.\nDehydration was a major issue as team cars were carrying an average of 200 water bottles, many of them with added minerals and saline with riders expected\xa0to drink 15 of the half litre bidons each.\nSome fans stayed away due the extreme afternoon heat on this southern French route, but the conditions failed to slow the peloton as it sped past the\xa0celebrated regional vineyards and olive groves.\nOne of the pre-race favourites Jakob Fuglsang, the Criterium du Dauphine champion, pulled out with 25km to go after falling and hurting his hand.\nWednesay\'s 17th stage sees the Tour head north towards its Alpine reckoning with a 200km run from the Pont du Gard bridge in the Camargue to Gap, where\xa0bonus seconds atop a climb 10km from the finish line ensure further drama ahead of the three much awaited stages that follow it. — AFP'",3

Some enterprises even had to employ 50-year-old labourers, she said.\nMeanwhile, it was hard for enterprises to invest too much in technology to increase labour productivity while the number of products remained the same, she said.\nTherefore, cutting working hours to 44 per week would cause a reduction in sales for enterprises, she added.\nVũ Tiến Lộc, chairman of VCCI said “It is not the proper time to cut working hours.”\n“If the country wants to escape from the middle-income trap, we have to take full advantage of the labour force and work very hard,” he said.\nOvertime increase\nRepresentatives of the enterprise associations also suggested the draft should increase overtime instead of applying a maximum of 300 hours of overtime each year as at present.\nNguyễn Xuân Dương, deputy president of the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association said in a global context, China now allowed their labourers to work 600 hours of overtime each year and Japan permitted their labourers to work 700 hours of overtime each year.\nIf a domestic enterprise wanted to deliver goods to its international partner on time, they might have to violate current regulations on overtime to meet the deadline and compete with other enterprises in the region, he said.\nHowever, if the partner found that the domestic enterprise violated the regulations, they would halt the order. ""We would lose the order,"" he said.\nDương also said that the domestic textile sector often had no orders from partners in March and October. In September, some enterprises worked just 4 -5 hours each day due to a lack of orders.\nAdditionally, the wage for domestic textile labourers was currently higher than textile labourers in India and Bangladesh. ""If we tighten the amount of overtime, our enterprises would lose orders and the labourers would lose their jobs,"" he said.\nAgreeing with Dương, Nguyễn Hoài Nam, deputy general secretary of the Việt Nam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) said “We could miss out on orders from partners if we have problems with overtime.”\nBùi Sỹ Lợi, vice chairman of the National Assembly’s Committee for Social Affairs, said the Government was planning to propose to the NA to allow the Government to solve the problem of overtime in some special sectors. This proposal would be decided by the NA but the opinion of the committee was that it did not agree with the increase in overtime.\nMinister Dung, head of the draft’s compiling board said it was difficult to satisfy all people because the impact of the labour code was significant.

2272,PM praises Hà Nội's rural development,"'Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân\xa0Phúc speaks at the\xa0conference reviewing the 10-year implementation of the\xa0national target programme on building new-style rural areas in Hanoi on Saturday. VNA/VNS Photo\n\n\nHÀ NÔI – Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc described new-style rural area building in Hà Nội as comprehensive and impressive while addressing a conference reviewing the 10-year efforts by the capital on Saturday.\nThe national target programme on building new-style rural areas, initiated by the Government in 2010, has 19 criteria in different aspects, aiming to boost the development of rural regions.\nAccording to Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Nguyễn Đức Chung, six outlying districts have met all the criteria and earned new-style rural area recognition, namely Đan Phượng, Đông Anh, Thanh Trì, Hoài Đức, Gia Lâm and Quốc Oai.\nA total 325, or 84.2 per cent of the city’s total 386 communes, have gained the status, surpassing the target of 80 per cent set for the end of 2020. Notably, Đan Phượng, Song Phượng and Liên Trung communes of Đan Phượng District have satisfied advanced criteria.\nOver the last 10 years, municipal authorities have involved thousands of collectives, individuals, businesses and households in contributing to the building of new-style rural areas with more than VNĐ14.74 trillion (US$633.7 million) raised. In particular, some local residents have made donations worth more than VNĐ7.2 trillion in total to the programme.\nHowever, Chung also admitted shortcomings, noting that Hà Nội hadn’t succeeded in attracting more investment into agricultural production, especially hi-tech farming and connectivity in production chains. There remained a gap in building new-style countryside among districts, while funding for the programme in the city was still mainly sourced from the State budget.\nAt the conference, PM Phúc applauded efforts by the city, where the new-style rural area building programme is carried out on the largest scale among all localities, with 17 outlying districts that consist of 386 communes covering more than 2,230 sq.km. and having a population of 4.1 million.\nRequirements for new-style rural areas were very high, in terms of both quantity and quality, he noted, stressing the ultimate goal of the programme would be to improve people\'s lives.\nLiving standards of rural residents in the city had improved considerably and were higher than the national average, the Government leader said.\nThe PM said Hà Nội’s rural areas should lead in applying the achievements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. He called on the city to develop satellite urban areas and associate new-style rural area building with urban development.\nAdditionally, rural areas needed to preserve the traditional culture of the millennium-old capital city, PM Phúc said.\nHe requested Ha Noi pay heed to environmental protection while building new-style countryside, noting it should use new technologies in waste and wastewater treatment, say no to plastic bags and disposable plastic products, ensure the reuse of agricultural waste, and form green belts around the capital’s central zone.\nThe Prime Minister emphasised the importance of the new-style rural area building programme, saying it has “the stature of a long-term strategic revolution"".\nAs part of the conference, a fair was opened the same day to introduce agricultural products, handicrafts and other goods under the \'One Commune – One Product\' programme of Hà Nội\nThe fair, featuring 170 booths, is a chance to popularise outstanding products of the city’s agriculture. It is also a platform for local businesses, associations and production facilities to step up partnerships in production, processing and sale of farm produce.\nOn the occasion, the municipal People’s Committee opened an exhibition on Hà Nội’s achievements in building new-style rural areas.\nThe fair and exhibition at the Cultural Friendship Palace ended yesterday.--VNS'",1

But according to the National Financial Supervision Committee (NFSC), this would rise to 40 per cent if it includes loans for buying homes.\nThis rate is too high since the property sector is always considered high-risk.\nIn light of the new circular, many experts said, while the credit tightening could have some impact on property developers and the market, it would help banks better control money flows, reducing risks and ensuring economic stability.\nBanking expert Dr Cấn Văn Lực said not only developers but also homebuyers who need to borrow money need long-term loans, and so the central bank’s decision to reduce the ratio of short-term funds used for long- and medium-term loans would help lenders minimise risks possibly arising from stretching themselves too thin.\nSBV Governor Lê Minh Hưng has ordered a strengthening of inspection of credit activities, particularly of lending to developers and homebuyers, to ensure safety and proper used in line with regulations.\nExperts believe that the new credit policies would encourage banks to shift lending to individual homebuyers to hedge risks while at the same time not losing interest income.\nFor many banks, mortgages are key credit products.\nLenders have to carefully assess property projects before providing loans to homebuyers and take the initiative to work with developers to better manage risks, they said.\nForeign businesses eye VN furniture market\nThai furnishing retailer Index Living Mall has entered into a strategic tie-up with VI Furniture Joint Stock Company, and they have opened a 1,000sq.m store on Hồ Chí Minh City’s Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai Street.\nVI Furniture, backed by the Vietnam Investment Fund, and the Thai company, are all set to open a second store in the city’s District 2.\nIndex Living Mall came to do business in the Vietnamese market eight years ago, but had to quit.\nWith its return this time, Thailand’s most favourite brand -- with more than 30 years of experience -- hopes to bring to the Vietnamese market quality products at reasonable prices.\nThe $4.5 -5 billion a year Vietnamese furniture market has also been attracting many other foreign furniture brands.\nThe market is in fact flooded by foreign furniture products including famous brands like the US’s Ashley, Denmark’s JYSK and South Korea’s Kimsfullhouse.\nViệt Nam is generally considered one of the region’s most attractive markets for foreign investors with its steadily increasing GDP and FDI boom.\nAccording to the 2018 Furniture & Home Décor report released by the EU-Vietnam Business Network (EVBN), as the country’s economy continues to grow, the home décor and furniture industry can expect to grow along with it.\nRising household incomes lead to improving living standards as local consumers become more able and willing to spend on high-quality goods.\nSo a preference for western-style products is expected to put pressure on local manufacturers to come up with innovative designs to compete.\nExperts said consumers in the past were only looking for functional items but are now looking for products to match their personal style and way of life while also offering better quality.\nAnother reason is\xa0a growing trend among the younger generations to move out of their parents’ home, and the youngsters place greater emphasis on new and stylish furniture at affordable prices, the report said.\nThe westernisation of the younger generation is the key driver of success for foreign furniture companies, according to the EVBN.\nKý Quí Trung, CEO of AKA Furniture Group, a leading furniture retailer, said demand for high-class furniture is increasing sharply, especially in Hà Nội and HCM City.\nLast year the country spent $500 million\xa0importing foreign furniture, and the trend is expected to continue in the coming years.\nPlywood imports suspended on re-export fraud\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade has decided to suspend the import of plywood products for re-export to the US from December 27 this year to prevent possible origin frauds and unauthorised transshipments.\nIt has issued Circular 22, which will take effect on December 17, to strengthen efforts to prevent the circumvention of trade remedies and origin fraud.\nOne of its measures is to gain greater control over plywood exports to the US since failure to do so could prompt the world’s largest economy to take drastic measures against Vietnamese plywood products.\nAccording to scoutAsia Research, a corporate data and news service provider backed by the Financial Times and Nikkei Inc., the US-Việt Nam bilateral trade gap is also caused by goods originating in China and other countries and rerouted through Việt Nam to take advantage of the country’s friendlier tariff treatment.\nThe true scope of this origin fraud is unknown, but surging imports from China and exports from Việt Nam of key products such as wood, furniture and computer and parts have rung alarm bells, forcing the Vietnamese Government to act.

3920,'Gov’t to loosen conditions for auto imports',"'An auto manufacturing line of Thaco Group in Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in the central province of Quảng Nam. — VNA/ VNS Photo Vũ Sinh\nHÀ NỘI — The Government will soon issue a revision to Decree 116/2017 on the conditions for production, assembly, import and business of automobile warranty and maintenance services, removing a number of regulations relevant to auto imports.\nThe statement was released by Minister and Chairman of Government Office Mai Tiến Dũng at a recent conference held in Hà Nội.\nHe said the revision would\xa0include changing from the current inspection for each batch of imported vehicles to type of vehicles, which are considered to be difficult and expensive for businesses.\nWith the current capacity of auto registration centres, Dũng said the inspection of imported automobiles should change from the current pre-inspection to post-inspection.\nThe revision, drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), would now be open to opinions from businesses and the public.\n“In the past two years after the decree was issued, the domestic automobile industry has made progress, protecting the interests of consumers while State management has also been stricter in the import of vehicles,” Dũng said.\nAccording to Dũng, the revision of Decree 116 is appropriate in the context of the automobile market and the import of cars has stabilised. Evidence is that all auto businesses have confirmed the origin and type of imported cars, strictly complying with the provisions of Decree 116. Meanwhile, the number of imported vehicles has increased.\nAccording to a report by the MoIT, after the import duty was reduced to zero from 2018 under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), domestic manufacturers initially affirmed their role and position in the automobile market. Especially, Decree 116 has played an important role in protecting the production and assembly of cars in the country.\nThe report shows that after the decree was issued, some ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and other WTO members such as the US, Japan and EU raised concerns about Decree 116, saying it may create additional procedures and hinder businesses in exporting cars to Việt Nam as well as violating national treatment principles.\n“The import of cars has slowed down due to Decree 116 but has increased sharply again,” stated the report.\nThe MoIT said that the current output between domestically-produced vehicles and imported vehicles had changed significantly. In 2017, the number of domestically-produced vehicles was 2.5 times higher than imported ones. The figure was 3.72 times in 2018. In the first six months of this year, it decreased to 1.74 times.\nHowever, the ministry said that the domestic sector would not maintain its advantage in the market if it did not attempt to improve quality and lower production costs to increase competitiveness, especially against vehicles imported from ASEAN, which enjoy preferential import tariffs.\nThe ministry said it needed to issue solutions supporting and promoting the domestic automobile industry to compete with imported cars, especially those from ASEAN.\nNguyễn Minh Đồng, an expert in the automobile industry, told plo.vn that imported cars were increasingly narrowing the sales gap with domestically-assembled cars because the auto businesses had met requirements of Decree 116, increasing supply.\n“In addition, imported models are hitting the low-cost segment that used to be the playground for locally-assembled cars,” Đồng said.\nTo increase the competitiveness for domestic automobiles, Đồng said it was necessary to adjust tax and fee policies to help domestic automobile manufacturers and assemblers reduce costs.\n“But the most important thing is that domestic automakers must strive to improve quality and lower production costs to enhance competitiveness. The price of domestically-manufactured and -assembled cars is still high, making it difficult to promote the industry,” he added.\nTo solve the problem, the MoIT proposed the Government not apply special consumption tax for automobiles which are locally-produced, as part of efforts to reduce the price of cars.\nThe ministry also expected the Government to adjust import tax on the principle that the import tax rate on components, spare parts and raw materials must be lower than the import tax rate on completely built-up cars, or at floor level according to international commitments in each period.\nIn addition, the tax rate will be reduced to zero per cent for items on cars with nine seats or fewer, such as engines and gearboxes, which are valid until 2025. — VNS'",2

Photo quochoi.vn\nHÀ NỘI — Although the number of criminal cases has been decreasing, work is needed to rein in social crime, attendees heard at a meeting organised by the National Assembly (NA)’s Judicial Committee held in Hà Nội yesterday.\nA total of 14,228 cases relating to economic management have been recorded so far this year, a decrease of 11 per cent over last year’s figure, Lieutenant General Lê Quý Vương, Deputy Minister of Public Security said while delivering a government report on crime prevention and combat for 2019.\nDuring the period, competent forces solved 33,470 criminal cases or 84.2 per cent of the total cases. About 2,167 organised crimes had been discovered and 137 victims of human trafficking had been rescued.\n“The investigation of cases under the direction of the Central Steering Committee on Anti-Corruption has been accelerated to meet the schedule,” Vương said.\n“Difficulties in asset evaluation have been solved as well as assessment of evidence, identifying crimes and recovering assets.”\nHowever, despite a decline in the number of criminal cases, an increase in complicated crimes and rampant violations in land planning, management and use have become a new challenge for law enforcement across the country, Vương said.\nAccording to Vương, the number of murders has increased. Many murders or intentional attacks were carried out by people with mental illness or those affected by the use of drugs, causing concern among the public. New methods of human trafficking have been recorded, including surrogacy or foetus trafficking.\nEconomic crimes and corruption have become more sophisticated and occurred in many sectors, with the use of high technology to dodge tax or lengthen toll collection at Build-Operate-Transfer booths.\nPetty corruption in settling administrative procedures still took place in many localities, causing outrage for residents and enterprises.\nViolations relating to land planning, use and management were also common, he said, saying it was the main reason leading to long-standing disputes.\nWhile agreeing with the government’s report, NA deputies pointed out shortcomings in crime prevention and combat and made proposals to increase the effectiveness of the work in the future.\nNguyễn Duy Hữu, a member of the NA’s Judicial Committee, proposed the Government strengthen the handling of violations of environmental laws. Although this kind of crime left long-term consequences and took a lot of time to recover, the criminal penalty was far too lenient. Most of the cases only received administrative punishments.\nHoàng Văn Hùng, an NA deputy, said although traffic accidents had declined in the number of cases, injuries and deaths, about 22 people died each day on average.\nThe deputy suggested the government set forth preventive solutions.\nThe punishments for violations relating to traffic safety regulations should be tightened, he said.\nMany NA deputies proposed that measures to enhance the competence of State management, inspection work in construction, commerce and information and technology to restrict violations as well as detect and strictly deal with crimes in these fields.

He had to check on the phone every night in order to handle any problem emerged at the oil rig quickly.\n“With just a moment of distraction, if a problem suddenly happens and we cannot handle, it would leave severe consequences,” he said.\nDuring the day, it often took Phúc and his colleagues at least two hours to meet and discuss working plans and results every day.\n“That became part of my life,” he said.\nWhen the drilling for the Biển Đông 01 project successfully ended in 2016, that rhythm of life no longer existed but Phúc could not forget that period and was still proud of working during it.\nThe Biển Đông 01 project is considered an important achievement of the oil and gas industry of Việt Nam in the East Sea. The project was developed by the group to exploit two gas and condensate fields – Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh with duration expected to be 25 years and a capacity of 8.5 million cubic metres of natural gas per day. Its success proved the potential of the industry and contributed to partly ensuring the national energy security.\nDrilling at Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh gas and condensate fields was considered as a decisive factor for the success of the Biển Đông 01 project because these areas have special complicated geology.\nIn 2009, there was no rigs in Việt Nam that could meet drilling conditions at Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh gas and condensate fields. As a result, the PV Drilling Company had two options – hiring a drilling rig from abroad or building a new one.\nHowever, at that time, there were only seven TAD drilling rigs in the world but no rigs meeting conditions of high temperature and high pressure at the two gas fields. If these rigs were hired, they needed to be upgraded to meet the drilling requirements. Meanwhile, each rig was leased at a cost of US$500,000 per day.\nThe decision was made to build their own. This was considered a plan with the best economic efficiency. The building of the PV Drilling V would not only serve the drilling of the Biển Đông 01 project but also for other oil exploitation projects in the future.\nThe PV DRILLING V is considered the most modern TAD drilling rig in the world at present with many new, modern and complicated equipment and technology. — VNS'",2

2838,'The untold story behind Chu Dau ceramic world record',"'The impressive plate featuring the word “Long” (Dragon) written 1,000 times in calligraphy created by Chu Dau Ceramic JSC, which was awarded a Guinness world record in September, was created from the love for the country as well as national sovereignty, the dream of a flourishing future, and the pride of being Vietnamese.\nMore than 200 days with pottery\nThe ceramic plate\xa0is a unique product from Chu Dau Ceramic JSC under the Hanoi Trade Corporation (Hapro), a member of BRG Group, and is a source of pride not only for the company but also for the Vietnamese ceramic industry. The world record is also a worthy honour for Chu Dau Ceramic’s artisans and potters, who love pottery as much as they love to breathe.\nThe plate has a diameter of 1.2m with the two main colours of blue and yellow. Photo courtersy of BRG Group\nAlmost a decade ago, Hapro received an order from the city of Ha Noi to produce a special product to mark the occasion celebrating the 1,000-year Thang Long-Ha Noi. It was both an honour and a challenge for the company, making it anxious to discover new ideas in order to create a unique artwork representing both Vietnamese culture and Ha Noi’s history.\nVu Thanh Son, Vice Chairman of Chu Dau Ceramic JSC said: “Thang Long-Ha Noi means ‘rising dragon’ and a round ceramic plate symbolises heaven. So, we came up with the idea of making a large ceramic plate with dragon written in calligraphy, representing 1,000 dragons flying in the sky.”\nAll the artists at Chu Dau Ceramic were excited with the idea and the enthusiastic atmosphere of the workplace was like a festival. But to manually craft a ceramic plate of such a size, the largest ceramic plate in Viet Nam at that time, was no small challenge for any worker.\nIn each stage of making the record-breaking plate, every step required the meticulous know-how of the workers. First of all, the moulding for the plate and ceramic bone were created. To produce a giant mould, the workers at Chu Dau Ceramic had to experiment several times to come up with the desired result. Several artisans pondered how to mix white clay and kaolin to make ceramic bones strong enough to withstand the heat of a large kiln.\nAfter tens of batches were created over more than four months, the artists finally came up with the formula to make the toughest piece of the largest ceramic plate in Viet Nam. In total, it took nearly seven months to complete the plate.\nHonouring Vietnamese creativity\nThe special feature of the Chu Dau ceramic plate is the word “Long”, or dragon, written in calligraphy in 1,000 different configurations by famous calligraphy writer Le Thien Ly. He had created two new ways of writing calligraphy, namely “Nhan Dien Thu” and “Vat Dieu Thu”.\nThe plate is a symbol of unique creation and talent of contemporary Vietnamese calligraphy. Combining traditional and new calligraphic forms, the 1,000 symbols create a fascinating continuous picture.\nLe Thien Ly wrote “Long” 1,000 times in calligraphy on the Chu Dau ceramic plate.\nIn “Nhan Dien Thu” calligraphy, each “Long” word describes a human portrait. There is a brave soldier protecting Thang Long citadel; a scholar; a soldier holding a gun to defend the Fatherland; naval soldiers sailing on the sea; students reading a book, and many more.\nMeanwhile in the “Vat Dieu Thu” style, each word describes an object. There are leaves, flowers, fish, books, ceramic pots\xa0and even a guitar. The word is also transformed unpredictably in the shape of varied dragons – hidden, dancing, flying and more. They also portray Viet Nam’s map with the two archipelagos of Hoang Sa and Truong Sa. According to Le Thien Ly, the writing for the plate itself took two months to finish.\n“This is the first time I have teamed with Chu Dau Ceramic, the ancient ceramic group with nearly 600 years of history,” said Ly. “The plate not only represents the intellect and talent of Vietnamese people but also is a meaningful gift for the capital of Ha Noi and its thousand-year-old culture.”\nAfter the painting was complete, the product was covered with a natural enamel layer extracted from rice husk ash. Ultimately, the special plate of great artwork demonstrates the quintessence of Vietnamese culture in both ceramic and calligraphy arts, with strong affirmation of the country\'s sovereignty and national cultural identity.\nDedicated to preserving and promoting the cultural and historical values of Chu Dau Ceramic, Madame Nguyen Thi Nga, Chairman of BRG Group reaffirmed: “This artwork shows the continuous development and creativity of Chu Dau Ceramic in a historical flow of nearly 600 years. BRG Group is proud to be in charge of developing Chu Dau Ceramic, to preserve the quintessence of Vietnamese culture and promote Chu Dau Ceramic to be well-known all over the world.”\nIn September, Chu Dau Ceramic JSC, a member of BRG Group, was honoured to be awarded the Guinness world record for its ceramic plate featuring 1,000-word “Long” in calligraphy – a masterpiece of Vietnamese handicrafts. Previously, in 2013, the plate was awarded a certificate from the Association of Vietnamese Records for the largest plate with ""Long"" written 1,000 times in calligraphy.\nThe plate not only honours the talent of Chu Dau Ceramic artisans, but also glorifies the Vietnamese ceramic industry, which was worthy of the 10 golden words that Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc bestowed on the company – “Chu Dau Ceramic - Vietnamese national character, shining over five continents”.'",2

Four smart registration kiosks have been installed to help people quickly carry out registration procedures without requiring the guidance of medical staff.\nBy simply inserting a medical insurance card or a flashcard supplied by the hospital to the infrared eye for identification, all patient information will be recorded.\nAfter patients choose the content of examination, the screen will immediately display the clinic they need to go for check-up and treatment.\nThese kiosks can check the validity of a health insurance card, capture patients' image with the front camera, and work closely with the hospital's overall management software to receive patients’ feedback\xa0on service quality.\nA patient is using smart registration kiosk at Eastern People Military Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo\nThe hospital has also implemented a range of other IT applications such as Room Access Control System, Disabled Robot Arm, and smart medical record cabinets.\nLê Thị Mến, a 72-year-old patient living in District 9’s Long Bình Ward, said she was surprised by the changes in the hospital over the years.\n“I am very interested in the machines that the hospital has been equipped with from the lobby to the toilet. Auto technology products are everywhere to give us instructions,” she said.\nExplaining about the information technology development at the hospital, Colonel Việt said the hospital was the first to be given financial autonomy in the country, so it faced various difficulties.\nOld and degraded facilities as well as a shortage of medical staff has reduced the quality of medical examination and treatment. Therefore, the number of patients coming to seek medical treatment was very few.\n“We were concerned about how to improve the hospital’s quality while maintaining the cost of treatment and the number of staff,” Việt said.\n“There was only one way - application of information technology to solve the problem.”\nThat’s when the Information Technology Centre was founded.\nThe hospital’s Board of Directors had constantly developed creative ideas to improve the medical examination and treatment process based on the actual operational needs of the hospital.\nA series of innovative ideas have been nominated by hospital staff and the centre helped turning them into high technology products.\nColonel Trịnh Ngọc Chí, deputy director of the hospital, said thanks to high-technology products, more people came to the hospital, rising from 700-800 patients in recent years to 1,800 patients at the peak per day.\nThe hospital’s management has also been easier. Chí said the board of directors would know what toilets needed to be cleaned and what areas were overloaded with patients via smart medical monitoring system.\nChí said the hospital would continue promoting the application of information technology in hospital management and operation, especially artificial intelligence to give the best services to patients. — VNS\n3D Printing technology is already being in use at\xa0Eastern People Military Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo",1

The meeting is\xa0themed\xa0 \'For professional and innovative journalism\'. — VNA/VNS Photo Minh Quyết\nHÀ NỘI — The rapid proliferation of so-called fake news had\xa0led to a\xa0decline in public trust in news media, so countries around the world needed to take drastic action to change the status quo.\nThis was agreed by participants at the 44th Executive Board Meeting of the Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA) that\xa0officially opened in Hà Nội on Friday.\nThis year’s event saw the attendance of\xa040 international delegates, including influential news agencies such as\xa0Azertac (Azerbaijan), TASS (Russia), Xinhua (China), Kyodo News (Japan), Yonhap (the Republic of Korea) and\xa0AAP (Australia).\nHosted by the Việt Nam News Agency (VNA), the meeting focused\xa0on three main subjects:\xa0strategies of news agencies in response to changes in information use behaviour\xa0which focus on video clips and the YouTube platform; fake news and fact-checking; and regaining trust for mainstream news.\nIn his opening speech, VNA General Director Nguyễn Đức Lợi, who is also a member of the Communist Party of Việt Nam\'s Central Committee (CPVCC), said in the last five decades since it became an OANA member in 1969, the VNA had\xa0been an active member of the organisation and made various contributions to enhance\xa0the development of journalism in the Asia-Pacific.\n“The hosting of the 44th OANA Executive Board Meeting once again affirms the role and voice of the state news agency of Việt Nam in this multilateral press forum, the largest of its kind in the region,” he said.\nAccording to Lợi, the world’s population now stands at 7.7 billion, of whom 52 per cent are internet users. They use\xa0the internet not only to communicate but also to provide information. This has\xa0created fierce competition against mainstream news.\n“As such, press agencies are\xa0not only competing\xa0with each other, but also with their own traditional readership who are using social networking platforms to spread information. While the press needs to verify information, conduct interviews and\xa0collect relevant data to provide\xa0objective information to the public, many organisations and individuals are using\xa0social media accounts to spread unlimited amounts of unchecked and subjective information with only one click, some with negative intentions of making profits and causing social chaos,” Lợi said.\n\nFurthermore, the co-existence of real and fake information across many communication platforms had\xa0made the public lose faith in mainstream news, he said.\nAddressing the opening ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam, a member of the CPVCC, said in recent years, in the wake of numerous forms of communication\xa0based on modern technologies as well as fast and widespread fake\xa0news, the OANA not only served\xa0as a direct channel to provide information to news organisations and partners but also as a fact checker to help bolster public trust in the traditional press.\nĐam said since the renewal era, Việt Nam had\xa0made development efforts\xa0which had\xa0been recognised and appreciated by the international community.\nDuring that journey, the Vietnamese press had\xa0been standing side by side with the country, he said, adding there were currently almost 100 news organisations in Việt Nam that employed 41,000 workers, of which 19,000 were journalists.\n“The\xa044th OANA Executive Board Meeting in Hà Nội has significant meaning as it marks the 50 year\xa0the VNA has been part of the OANA. We believe the 44th OANA meeting will bring a breath of fresh air to the development of the organisation as well as member agencies,” Đam said.\nOANA President Aslan Aslanov, who is also Chairman of the Board of the Azerbaijan State News Agency (AZERTAC), said the VNA was one of the most active members of OANA and its Executive Board.\nBy organising the\xa0meeting and demonstrating its commitment to excellence and professionalism in the news industry, the VNA had once again proved itself to be a\xa0leading media outlet in the region, he said.\nFake news storm\nAccording to VNA Deputy General Director Lê Quốc Minh,\xa0Việt Nam is not an exception in the fake news storm.\n“It is worrying that Facebook newsfeeds, YouTube channels and Google\xa0are full of fake news, while users naive enough to like and share them, and even the mainstream media runs this\xa0false information,” Minh said.\nViệt Nam was in the world’s top 10 countries with the largest number of social media users, Minh said, adding that Vietnamese people spend on average 2 hours 37 minutes every day on\xa0social media.\nAccording to Minh, thousands of websites were booming to feed hungry audiences with sensational and fake news. When a typhoon was hovering offshore Việt Nam, a number of Facebook users live-streamed videos with captions like “Typhoon No\xa06 Live”, “Typhoon is destroying my home village” or “Typhoon is so horrible”. In fact, they\'d used a video of a typhoon in the Philippines.\nIn June 2016, a number of newspapers and news websites ran a story about an eleven-year-old boy in Gia Lai Province who committed\xa0suicide because he did not have a new T-shirt for the school year. There was no such incident but the massive coverage on mainstream media led to an outcry about\xa0ethnic discrimination.\n“To regain the audience’s trust in mainstream news, we need to come back to the core values of journalism, professionalism, balance and multi-dimension. Journalists need to verify information carefully, especially amidst the spread of\xa0fake news, and improve the quality of their products, enhance professional ethics, and master new technologies in the working process,” Minh said.\nOANA president\xa0Aslanov\xa0remained steadfast that members\xa0with their long-standing reputations as premier news services\xa0served as “a\xa0shield” against unverified information and news that plagued and confused\xa0society.\n“Our principles of identifying and fact-checking before publishing have earned us high confidence. That’s why OANA is truly a team of the most reliable news producers,” he said.\n“As long as there are news agencies that hold on to the principles of journalism, society can feel safe, because although fake news is widespread, we are capable of retaliating with accurate and reliable news,” Aslanov said.\nLee Dong-min, a representative of the Yonhap News Agency, said the Republic of Korea’s media outlets were improving their fact-checking mechanisms to prevent spreading fake news and allowing\xa0readers to decide what the facts were when there were conflicting versions of stories.\nShe spoke about Yonhap’s fact-checking team, which was officially launched in April 2018 as part of the newsroom and its video fact-check service named ""Weekly Fact Check"" to deal with fake news on YouTube. Yonhap had\xa0tried to monitor the spread of fake\xa0news on the internet and distorted articles in the media, Lee said.\nAt the closing ceremony, the Executive Board announced the OANA Award for Excellence in News Agency Quality, which is designed to further experience exchange between OANA members and to improve the quality of making news.\nThe Việt Nam News Agency and Xinhua News Agency (China) shared the first prize for their Chatbot apps on e-newspaper Việt Nam Plus and AI Media Brain.\n\nTASS news agency of Russia won second prize for the\xa0Astronauts database project and the Azertac State News Agency of Azerbaijan secured third prize for its knowledge portal for children Portal.azertag.az.\nThe OANA was established on December 22, 1961 as an initiative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). It aims to facilitate information dissemination and exchange between news agencies in Asia-Pacific – a dynamic region that makes up more than half of the global population.\nOANA members, including many major agencies, are responsible for two-thirds of information circulated throughout the world.

The city consumes more than 10,000 pigs a day.\nHowever, there are still many difficulties in this sector such as poor management and the traditional nature of the pork trading market with small farms and manual slaughter.\nPork must go through many intermediaries to reach customers, causing high prices.\nBased on projects such as for tracing pork origin and building a safe food supply chain in the Southern Key Economic Region, we found that \xa0production and processing of agricultural products and foods have great potential for growth.\nSo the Department of Industry and Trade sought permission from the People's Committee to trial a pork trading floor before replicating it for other agricultural products and foodstuffs.\nIn my opinion, its establishment can help the city to meet many objectives at the same time such as restructuring agricultural production, adoption of technology including biotechnology\xa0and market stability.\nCan you describe the organisational structure and operating mechanism of the trading floor?\nIt can operate in the form of a joint stock company like most agricultural trading floors in countries with a similar agriculture sector as Việt Nam’s.\nThe State will only support the setting up and development of the floor initially and issue appropriate regulations.\nIt will monitor and supervise instead of directly investing or managing.\nBuyers and sellers will directly trade while quality inspection of pork after slaughter will be assigned to an independent quarantine unit.\nWith the support of foreign experts, especially from the British and Dutch consulates in the city, the department proposes to study more trading models for pigs and other agricultural products to choose suitable solutions for the city’s model.\nWhat are the likely benefits of this model compared to the current system?\nAccording to the evaluation of research teams, this model will bring great benefit to society as well as all the participants.\nFarmers can deal directly with buyers and decide the selling price without intermediaries. Therefore, farmers can build their brands and know the needs and market demand to have a consistent and steady production and business plan.\nCustomers will be able to buy clean and safe food at [farm] prices without intermediary costs.\nWhat were the difficulties faced by the department in researching and developing this model?\nThe department had difficulty in persuading small farms and manual slaughterhouses to participate.\nHowever, this problem has been solved thanks to the project for tracing pork origin.\nThanks to the direction of the People's Committee and support and co-ordination by related departments, cities in the Southern Key Economic Region and the two wholesale markets of Hóc Môn and Bình Điền, the preparatory steps have gone smoothly.\nCan you tell us about the schedule for the project?\nWe expect that by the end of 2020 specific models will be proposed as well as complete preparatory steps for pilot operation in early 2021. —VNS",2

The Vietnamese Party and State had exercised restraint and a policy of peace and friendship but the regime escalated their invasion activities forcing Viet Nam into a defensive war.\nOn January 7, 1979, the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation with the support of the people, and the great and timely help of Vietnamese volunteer soldiers overthrew the Khmer Rouge genocidal regime, bringing a bright future to the country.\n“The victory was meaningful as we could not only protect our country’s territory, but also save Cambodian people from the genocidal regime, helping them gain back the right to live, to step into a period of real freedom,” Nghĩa said.\nMajor General\xa0Nguyễn Hoàng Nhiên,\xa0Director\xa0of the\xa0Việt Nam Institute of\xa0Military History, said the fight against Pol Pot was a necessary and just defence move of the Vietnamese army.\n“Many people had different views on this matter, but many also approved of Viêt Nam’s action and condemned the genocidal regime,” Nhiên said.\nHe said the matter was again confirmed by the convictions given out by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the former leaders of the Cambodia’s Democratic Kampuchea.--VNS'",0

VNS Photo Bồ Xuân Hiệp\nBồ Xuân Hiệp\nHONG KONG — Vietnamese manufacturers need “integrated marketing solutions” comprising both online and offline platforms to gain access to buyers in both traditional and emerging markets, experts have said.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the Global Sources Lifestyle and Fashion show last week in Hong Kong, Ronald Ng, general manager of Global Sources Lifestyle Group, said Việt Nam had become a manufacturing hub in the Southeast Asian region.\nVietnamese exporters, mostly SMEs, who benefit from operating in one of the world’s fastest growing economies with stable governance and ease of doing business, are very likely to succeed in joining global trade.\nTo build their corporate image, generate sales leads and win orders from global buyers, Vietnamese suppliers should engage in more trade promotion platforms to strengthen linkages with global buyers.\n“In addition to trade shows, online platforms are considered one of the most effective [ways] for them to boost exports to global markets,” he said.\nSince China has moved up the manufacturing value chain, a significant number of international buyers now consider Việt Nam an alternative supply market.\nThe number of orders shifting from China to Việt Nam has increased remarkably.\n“The price advantage is becoming less obvious while the gap in export communication between global buyers and suppliers is growing.”\nOnline platforms are the most convenient channel, providing year-round exposure for buyers to check and learn about suppliers’ capability and then submit online inquiries.\nMeanwhile, offline platforms enable suppliers and buyers to meet face-to-face and gain credibility.\n“Combined, online-to-offline (O2O) is the most comprehensive marketing mix for Vietnamese suppliers to win more business.”\nA recent survey by Global Sources, the event organiser, found that 80 per cent of global buyers preview product and supplier information online before they decide to go to the show\xa0to meet with targeted suppliers.\nSwandi Wikassa, a buyer from Indonesia, said: “Before coming to the show for sourcing, we spent a great deal of time learning about the product and supplier online.”\nAccording to Phạm Thị Hương, former managing director of Việt Nam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex), many Vietnamese products have\xa0good quality and\xa0competitive prices, but global buyers are not even aware of them since they are not available online.\n“Participation in exhibitions helps Vietnamese suppliers promote their products, but it is not enough. They should also look to promote their products via online platforms to reach more global buyers.”\nManufacturers should also study prices, consumer tastes and trends in potential markets, and have labels and packaging in English and the local language, she said.\nTo meet the requirements of global buyers, Vietnamese manufactures should also focus on building brands, using technology in production and improving designs, she added.\nExperts said in choosy markets like the US, the EU, Japan, and South Korea, exporters should be prepared to face technical barriers that could change unexpectedly.\nA number of Vietnamese SMEs have little experience in digital or online marketing and lack\xa0information about the\xa0field and quality human resources, according to the experts.\nMore than 35 leading Vietnamese manufacturers of garments, textiles and fashion accessories and garment-related industries, many members of\xa0the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association and Vinatex, participated in the show.\nLast year Việt Nam’s textile and apparel exports were worth US$36 billion, up 16 per cent year-on-year, making the country one of the world’s three largest exporters.\nThe sector has set itself a target of $40 billion for this year and more than $60 billion by 2025.\nThe country’s economic growth is forecast to be 7.05 per cent for this year on the back of robust FDI and manufacturing exports, according to the Việt Nam Institute for\xa0Economic\xa0and Policy Research.\nThe Hong Kong expo was organised by Global Sources, a B2B platform that connects buyers and suppliers online and offline.\nThe platform includes more than 1.5 million global buyers, including 94 of the world’s top 100 retailers, in\xa0more than\xa0190 countries. — VNS'",2

The aim of the event was to promote Vietnamese goods, and further, the image of Viet Nam.\nThey were served by thirty-year-old Vietnamese chef Vũ Ngọc Đức, who is one of 45 Vietnamese businesspeople travelling to Bangkok to bring their products to the food-focused event and hoping to fill up the shelves of Thai supermarkets.\nSpanning a small patch of the fair’s 1,000-square-metre exhibition area, Đức’s booth was buzzing with hundreds of visitors every day. After just two out of a total of five days, Đức and his team sold a total of more than 500 bowls of Phở, which was an incredible figure.\nDeputy Minister of Industry and Trade Đỗ Thắng Hải told Việt Nam News that Vietnamese agricultural products and foodstuffs, which were thought to face fierce competition when coming to Thailand, have witnessed positive growth over the years.\nHowever, the popularity of Vietnamese food is still modest in Thailand, where there is a rich culinary history and consumers are rather picky when it comes to foreign food.\nLast year, bilateral trade between Việt Nam and Thailand reached US$17.5 billion. However, Việt Nam\'s exports to Thailand were only one third of Việt Nam\'s imports from Thailand.\nIn the first eight months of 2019, trade between the two countries reached US$11.9 billion, of which, Việt Nam\'s exports to Thailand were only half of Việt Nam\'s imports from Thailand.\nThanks to increasing collaboration with Thai distributors and retailers, more and more Vietnamese businesses are exporting to the neighbouring country.\nThe “Vietnamese Week in Thailand 2019” showed the vision and determination of Việt Nam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade and Central Group in strengthening economic relations, connecting investment and businesses by exchanging products and services, said Thai Deputy Prime Minister Jurin Laksanavisit.\nOn shelves\nTops Market, the supermarket chain under Central Group, have imported and distributed Vietnamese food commodities on their shelves across Bangkok for years.\nPimjai Navanukroh, Tops Market General Manager, told Việt Nam News their system had imported about 500 food products of all kinds from Việt Nam. The best sellers were instant Phở (noodle) and coffee.\n""Our imports of Vietnamese food products increase 10 per cent every year. Thai consumers like Vietnamese Phở as it has a similar taste to Thai traditional noodles. Spring rolls also taste good but need changing a little bit to match Thai tastes. Vietnamese dragon fruit is also favoured by Thai consumers as they are sweeter than local dragon fruits,” Pimjai said.\nAt a Tops Market supermarket in Huai Khwang district, a pack of Vietnamese VIFON branded Phở costs 17 baht (VNĐ13,000 or US$0.5), a kilogramme of Vietnamese dragon fruit goes for 75 baht (VNĐ59,000 or $2.5). Each day, this supermarket sells about 100-200 packs of VIFON Phở and 50 kilogrammes of dragon fruit.\n“To penetrate the Thai market, last year we participated in the Vietnamese Week to introduce our products and survey consumers. Attending this event enabled us to approach premium supermarket chains’ consumers in Thailand,” said Bùi Phương Mai, chairwoman of VIFON.\nChomphunut Engkarawa, a Thai IT technician, told Việt Nam News he liked Vietnamese coffee and cashew nuts. “Vietnamese coffee has a strong flavour and competitive prices, cashew nuts are sweet and crunchy, I often buy Vietnamese coffee and cashew nuts as gifts for my colleagues,"" he said.\nReturning from the Vietnamese Week, Nguyễn Huỳnh Phú Lâm, general director of Hải Bình Cashew Joint Stock Company, said his company had its first consignment of cashew nuts to Thailand.\nThanks to its tie-up with giant Thai distributor Central Group, he said exporting is now easier for his company.\nInitially, Hải Bình sold its products at Big C and Go! retail chains in Việt Nam through a small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) support programme launched by Central Group in Việt Nam, he said.\n“SME is a meaningful programme to support small and medium-sized enterprises in Việt Nam and to draw Thailand and Việt Nam closer in terms of diplomacy and trade.”\n“When Hải Bình cashew products were introduced to Big C and GO! supermarkets in Việt Nam, they were well received for their high quality and eco-friendly design.”\nThen Hải Bình was selected to participate in the “Vietnamese Week” event for the first time last year. The company signed a deal with Central Group to execute its first export order this year.\nBesides Hải Bình, there were also Bà Tư cashew, Thanh Quốc fish sauce, Tinh Nguyên salt, Đạt butter, and Dakmark coffee.\nBe outstanding\nNick Reitmeier, Executive Vice President, Food Halls, International Food and Alcohol Buying, Central Group, told Việt Nam News that branding and design are key factors, besides quality, that Vietnamese companies need to focus on when exporting to Thailand.\n“Some brands are well-known in Việt Nam, but here you are not recognised, so you must be outstanding to attract customers. You are selling goods to the customers that know nothing about your brands,” Reitmeier said.\nSome packaging designs would work effectively in Việt Nam but they may not work in the international market because of the differences in language, hobbies and styles, Reitmeier added.\n“Sometimes, we run into some cases where the products do not have usages on their labels. For example, I bought a pack that looks like rice crackers or corn crackers, but when I opened it, they were uncooked. They need to be fried, but there is no instruction guiding the time or temperature,” Reitmeier said. — VNS'",2

1649,'China funds planning of new railway in northern Việt Nam: ministry',"'The Lào Cai-Hà Nội-Hải Phòng railway is due to be 392km long with 38 stations and can run both passenger and freight trains. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — China had funded 10 million yuan (US$1.4 million) for the preliminary planning of a controversial train project in Việt Nam that would connect the northern border region all the way through to a busy eastern port, the transport ministry announced on Monday.\nThe Ministry of Transport in its public statement said that the Lào Cai-Hà Nội-Hải Phòng train line was planned years ago in the Việt Nam Railway Development Strategy towards 2020, which was signed off by then Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng in 2008.\nChina in 2015 agreed to provide a non-refundable aid package worth 10 million yuan to help Việt Nam conduct surveys and map out the first blueprint for the line following high-level meetings between the two governments, according to the ministry.\nChina Railway Fifth Survey and Design Institute Group – the project consultant – just finished its preliminary planning for the line. The railway is due to be 392km long with 38 stations and can run both passenger and freight trains.\nThe transport ministry said it was working with localities that the train was set to run across to consult on the exact locations of the stations.\nIn the meantime, the project consultant was preparing for its final report before the project was to be submitted to the National Assembly, who would vote on whether the project could be carried out.\nKey to transport network\nThe ministry first announced the VNĐ100 trillion ($4.2 billion) project last week which immediately sparked criticisms and doubts over the necessity and the practicality of such project, especially the Government’s ability to fund and deliver the project on time.\nThe concerns came from the fact that Việt Nam was already planning to build the North-South High Speed Railway – a trans-Việt Nam mega project estimated to cost more than $55 billion and deemed an enormous burden on the already strained national budget.\nMeanwhile, a number of urban railway projects in Hà Nội and HCM City had their investment capitals shot through the roof and were seriously delayed for years.\nThe transport ministry, however, reaffirmed the need for the northern line on Monday, saying that the railway was “key to establish a transport network in the north of the Hồng River, connecting the northwest region to the delta and Hải Phòng seaport – one of biggest maritime centres in Việt Nam.""\nAccording to the project planning, the line is set to go east through eight provinces and cities, with the starting station in the border mountainous province of Lào Cai and runs towards Yên Bái, Phú Thọ, Vĩnh Phúc, Hà Nội, Hưng Yên and Hải Dương, before ending in Lạch Huyện Port in Hải Phòng.\nNotably, there will be a 5.6km cross-border rail line connecting Lào Cai with China’s Hekou Railway in Yunnan Province.\nThe new railway is estimated to transport up to 10 million tonnes of cargo a year.\nThe railway will have the international standard track gauge of 1,435mm instead of the centuries-old gauge of 1m that was used in the existing Hà Nội-Lào Cai train line.\nThe old Hà Nội-Lào Cai line, meanwhile, will stop running after the new line is open, according to the ministry.

In 2017, bad loans under Government Decision 67 accounted for just 3 per cent, but that figure had risen to 17 per cent at the end of last year. An SBV report put the figure now at a staggering 27.8 per cent.\nThe report pointed out a number of factors that had resulted in the disastrous outcome of the scheme. Among them was fishermen’s reluctance to meet their financial duties as they believed they had received the money as part of a Government grant.\nIn order to address the issue, the SBV has made recommendations to the Prime Ministerial Office to co-ordinate efforts across ministries and agencies to support both fishermen and commercial banks.\nFishermen unable to make payments for reasons beyond their control such as poor quality of vessels, significant damage due to natural disaster, sickness or traffic accidents would have their payments and interest rates readjusted.\nCommercial banks were told to help fishermen, who no longer wanted to or were unable to afford the vessels to find potential buyers. There has been some success in this approach with more than ten vessels finding new owners.\nIt has not been smooth sailing for many who took out loans to upgrade their fishing vessels under the Government's initiative. Complaints have been made over the quality of fishing vessels, poor catches and lack of manpower, all contributing to dismal economic results for boat owners.\nFor cases in which fishermen refused to honour agreements made with commercial banks without justifiable causes, legal action could be considered after all attempts to settle had failed. — VNS",2

The household poverty rate was reduced to 5.54 per cent.\nMeanwhile, 218 of the province’s communes, around 50 per cent, had been recognised as new-style rural areas by the end of last year.\nParty building and the consolidation of the political system have been enhanced and had a positive impact. The political system has been re-organised towards a lean, efficient and effective apparatus. Activities of local Vietnam Fatherland Front committees and socio-political organisations have also been improved.\nHowever, Vinh admitted, it is hard for Nghệ An to achieve its targets for economic growth, per capita GRDP and budget revenue. Infrastructure, especially in the western areas, has yet to meet development demand, while some social issues have not been resolved in a timely manner.\nHe also pointed out certain problems in Party building, political system consolidation and the performance of some local governments.\nHighlighting some major targets in the implementation of the resolution, the official said his province will work harder to develop quickly and sustainably so as to deserve its position as an integration and development driver of the north-central region.\nAddressing the meeting, Party General Secretary and President Trọng said that in the last five years, Nghệ An has made efforts to move forward and has made considerable achievements in economy, culture, society and defence-security. He also recognised the strides taken in Party building, political system enhancement and building new-style rural areas.\nHe attributed the failure to reach some of the targets set in the resolution partly to a lack of determination and breakthroughs in leadership, as well as shortcomings in institutions, infrastructure and human resources.\nThe province boasts a rich history, numerous forest and marine areas and industrious and intelligent people. Therefore, it needs to show stronger ambition, capitalise on its traditions and overcome difficulties to become one of the leading localities in Việt Nam, the leader said. – VNS",0

Two lawyers Phạm Ngọc Trung and Lại Huy Tùng represented her in the court.\nPhấn, 72, also former chairwoman of Phú Mỹ Development Investment Joint Stock Company, was charged with appropriating over VNĐ1.38 trillion (US$57.8 million) from Trust Bank.\nPhấn’s five accomplices consist of Bùi Thị Kim Loan, accountant of Phú Mỹ Co Ltd; Lâm Kim Dũng, former director of Lam Giang Real Estate Co Ltd; Huỳnh Thị Xuân Dung, former director of Phúc Nguyễn Real Estate Investment Co Ltd; Lâm Hứa Quỳnh Trinh, former deputy head of Treasury Office of Trust Bank in HCM City; and Phạm Hồng Hảo, a member of staff at Trust Bank, were also charged with “abusing trust to appropriate property”.\nMany others, including Phạm Công Danh, Phan Thành Mai, Hoàng Văn Toàn and Trần Sơn Nam, were also summoned to court.\nA representative of VNCB attended as a civil plaintiff. The State Bank of Việt Nam's representative attended as a legal entity with related rights and obligations.\nAccording to the indictment of the Supreme People’s Procuracy, in 2007, Phấn had taken advantage of holding 84.92 per cent of Trust Bank’s charter capital and being the biggest shareholder of the bank in order to direct the bank’s board of directors and staff to invest VNĐ1.03 trillion ($44.8 million) in four real estate projects in which three companies of Phấn were investors. The three companies include Phú Mỹ Development Investment Joint Stock Company, Lam Giang Real Estate Co Ltd and Phú Mỹ Co Ltd.\nHowever, Phấn did not use the money to invest in the projects following the contracts. She used all the money for private purposes and then denied all responsibility to pay back the Trust Bank.\nAdditionally, Phấn also ordered her staff to buy four properties in districts 1, 3 and 10 in HCM City and another in Nha Trang City, Khánh Hòa Province. She directed the Trust Bank’s board of directors to re-buy the properties at much higher prices. As a result, Phấn appropriated about VNĐ437 billion ($18.9 million) from Trust Bank.\nPreviously, in the first phase of the case, the court sentenced Phấn to 30 years in prison for “deliberately violating State regulations on economic management, causing severe consequences” and “abusing trust to appropriate property” in May 2018. The Trust Bank was determined to suffer a loss of over VNĐ6.3 trillion ($272 million) in the first phase of the case.\nAccording to the schedule, the trial will continue until November 25. — VNS",1

The US is expecting GDP to increase by 2 per cent this year, much lower than the forecast of 3 per cent.\n""Việt Nam\'s growth of 6.8 per cent in 2019 and possibly higher, is a great effort. Of which, the main momentum was the manufacturing industry and domestic consumption,"" Huệ said.\nRegarding the agricultural sector, he highlighted the huge losses caused by African swine fever (ASF).\nASF has resulted in the loss of 5.5 million pigs, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of the total stock. This is why the agricultural sector has only increased 2.02 per cent in the first nine months while the Government was looking for a 3.5 per cent gain.\nHowever, the rapid growth of the manufacturing and processing industry and an increase of domestic consumption by nearly 12 per cent has helped offset the loss in agriculture as well as exports.\nThe Deputy PM said the economic situation in 2019 would continue to evolve in 2020 and might be even worse if conflicts between major economies couldn’t be handled.\nMaster plan\nA master plan on socio-economic development in ethnic minority mountainous and disadvantaged areas was also discussed by NA deputies yesterday.\nHoàng Văn Cường, a deputy from Hà Nội, said the master plan would be effective, changing the status of people in these areas because they held great potential.\nThe project has set a goal of doubling the incomes of ethnic minorities in these areas by 2025.\nIt has also suggested offering free cows and chickens to poor families to help develop the economy.\nThe project needed to set forth appropriate ways to support and explore potential in new fields and help people achieve a breakthrough, he said.\nGiàng A Chu, a deputy from Yên Bái Province, said: “For ethnic minority people, livelihoods and production development are fundamental elements. There should be a plan which helps local residents boost economic development.""\nPolicies to attract investors and the business community should also be implemented in disadvantaged areas.\nHoà Bình Deputy Trần Đăng Ninh agreed.\nHe said all possible resources, particular those in locality, should be mobilised to implement the plan with a view to improving the lives of local people and shortening the financial gap between regions. — VNS'",0

2571,'Việt Nam needs more active prevention of natural disasters instead of passive response',"'Trần Quang Hoài, general director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s General Department of Disaster Prevention and Control and deputy head of the Central Steering Committee on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control talks to\xa0Hà Nội Mới (New Hà Nội) newspaper about the importance of active prevention in dealing with increasingly extreme weather.\nMany natural disasters that occurred nationwide this year have been blamed on climate change. What is your opinion about the issue?\nI totally agree. Climate change has led to rising sea levels, the frequency and severity of natural disasters, the decline of river water resources, prolonged heat waves that caused severe droughts in the south central region and saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta.\nIn addition, climate change has led to heavy rainfall in a short time, causing floods and landslides in HCM City, Quảng Ninh, Thanh Hoá and Kiên Giang.\nAs forecast, nearly 40 per cent of the Mekong Delta, more than 10 per cent of the Red River Delta, 2.5 per cent of the central region and 20 per cent of HCM City are at risk of being underwater if sea levels rise by a metre.\nEarly this month, heavy downpours were recorded with severe flash floods and landslides. The natural disasters and their impacts are factors that hinder the sustainable development of the country.\nIn the past 20 years, annual natural calamities have killed more than 400 people. The economic losses for Việt Nam are estimated at 1-1.5 per cent of GDP.\nSince the beginning of this year, there have been 12 types of natural disasters nationwide, causing more than 60 fatalities and economic losses of over VNĐ1.5 trillion (US$64.5 million).\nIs climate change the only reason?\nI think there are many other reasons apart from climate change.\nMany river dykes and sea dykes have substandard designs that fail to meet the requirements of flood and storm control, especially dykes and sea embankments in the southern region.\nMany reservoirs are degraded and fail to ensure safety, especially small reservoirs managed by local authorities.\nIn addition, residents in many localities still live along the riverbanks, in low-lying areas which are at high risk of landslides and flash floods, threatening people’s lives and property.\nOver-exploitation of natural resources also contributes to the frequency of natural disasters.\nWhat is your evaluation of the current system of natural disaster prevention and control in Việt Nam? What is the solution to mitigate the losses caused by natural disasters?\nThanks to the Party and the State and the people’s support, we have built a relatively strong system of natural disaster prevention and control in all regions of the country. However, due to the strong impact of climate change, the system still needs to be improved to deal with super typhoons.\nThe community’s proactive prevention and response to natural disasters is a vital solution to reduce the losses.\nThis year, Deputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng, head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control launched the National Week for natural disaster prevention and control with the aim of reducing natural disasters from the community.\nIt means the capacity of natural disaster prevention and control from the community needs to be boosted.\nIn order to do this, information, as well as response and aftermath plans, must be available to support the community.\nIt is very important to set up disaster response teams in the community. This is also the priority of this year.\nDamage caused by natural disasters at sea has fallen in recent years. However, damage on the mainland seems to be unimproved. So what is the priority of the authorised agencies?\nBased on the forecasts of the meteorological and hydrological agency and the actual response capacity of the authorised agencies, the prevention of flash floods and landslides in mountainous areas will be the top priority this year.\nThis type of disaster has caused great damage to people and property in recent years.\nOn the other hand, we must also prevent and respond effectively to river and sea erosion. On average, river bank and sea erosion takes away about 300 hectares of land annually.\nWhat solutions does the capital city of Hà Nội need to implement to reduce losses caused by natural disasters proactively and sustainably?\nIn recent years, Hà Nội has spent huge resources to invest in infrastructure for natural disaster prevention and control and climate change adaptation. As a result, the level of damage caused by natural disasters has greatly decreased.\nHowever, in my opinion, the city needs to pay more attention to non-structural measures such as early warning, evacuation planning and emergency response preparedness.

At the same time, Việt Nam has not issued any regulations to punish localities who aren't transparent.\n“It is essential to create pressure and instruct local authorities to improve the availability of budget-related information. This is a legal loophole outside of the report’s scope that needs addressed in the long term,” he said.\nPOBI is a national initiative\xa0implemented independently by non-profit research institutes. The 2018 POBI report was conducted by two members of BTAP including VEPR and the Centre for Development and Integration (CDI) under the framework of the Promoting transparency, accountability and people participation in managing the state budget project sponsored by the EU Delegation to Việt Nam through Oxfam.\n“POBI along with other indexes such as PCI (provincial competitiveness index) has become a tool to enhance openness, democracy and transparency as well as help Việt Nam demonstrate international commitments of an open government,” said VEPR director Nguyễn Đức Thành.\nThe full report can be found at www.ngansachvietnam.net. — VNS",0

He was 99.\nHe was the last general that partook in all major battles of the country to pass away, including the anti-French war, the American war, and the wars to defend the southwestern and northern borders, according to Deputy Minister of Public Security Bùi Văn Nam.\nTo former Minister of Defence Phạm Văn Trà, General Lê Đức Anh was a brave and fair leader who dared to make decisions and take responsibility for his actions during difficult times.\nHe allowed everyone to speak up during discussions of military strategies and encouraged them to defend their opinions until the end, Trà said.\n“I stood up against him twice. At first I thought he wouldn’t listen to me, but he did,” Trà said.\n“Our most-heated discussion was at the beginning of 1978 during the Battle of Phú Cương Mountain against Pol Pot’s regime in the southern province of An Giang. His tactics were different to what we were used to, so I said to him we couldn’t do it.\n“He resented it at first, saying if we don’t want to do it, then don’t do it. But I said to him it was his responsibility to make that decision, we would do whatever he said. Finally, he gave in and opted for our tactics. During that battle, the Khmer Rouge ran away.”\nGeneral Lê Đức Anh was born in 1920 in the central province of Thừa Thiên-Huế.\nSince he was young he had had the opportunity to meet with patriots and revolutionists, and read about Communism and about the activities of Nguyễn Ái Quốc (President Hồ Chí Minh) in France.\nIn 1938, at 18 years old, he became a member of the Communist Party of Việt Nam. He served as a commander in Thủ Dầu Một City in the southern province of Bình Dương during the August Revolution in 1945, and later joined the anti-French resistance in the southeastern region.\nHe took part in several major battles as Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Việt Nam People's Army, Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Command of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, and Commander of Military Zone 9.\nHe was the second-in-command of the Hồ Chí Minh Campaign, the military offensive that put an end to the three-decade conflict in Việt Nam and unified the country on April 30, 1975.\nIn 1984, he was promoted to the rank of General, then served as Chief of General Staff of the Việt Nam People's Army (1986), Minister of Defence (December 1986 – December 1991).

As a defence minister, General Lê Đức Anh started to implement Operation Smile – an initiative that repairs childhood facial deformities – and ran a search of American soldiers declared as missing-in-action during the war, which was considered a new approach to normalising relations with the US.\nIn July 1991, he visited China as a Politburo envoy, creating a foundation for an official visit of the then Party General Secretary Đỗ Mười and then Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt to the country in November of the same year. The two countries later issued a joint statement and signed an official agreement to normalise relations as the result of the visit.\nHe said about the process of building the diplomatic relations: “It’s a process that we must take caution every step of the way, and it must serve our nation’s independence and interests.\n“The independence and interests of our nation and the sacred sovereignty of our fatherland must always be our first priority.”\nPresident Lê Đức Anh and his wife visit a manufacturing plant in Subic Bay during their official visit to the Philippines in 1995. — VNA/VNS Photo Cao Phong\nLê Đức Anh’s devotion to the country was highly appreciated by former Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt.\nHe once said: “After all these years, whether as a soldier in the battlefield or a State leader, Lê Đức Anh has always been a great officer and a leader of dignity, bravery and responsibility.\n“As a defence minister, he made drastic changes to the organisational structure of the Việt Nam People’s Army and People’s Armed Forces, and he was a leader of great influence in the period of national renewal.\n“If I am to be honest, we don’t have many leaders like him.”\nDeputy Minister of Public Security Bùi Văn Nam said: “I’ve heard a lot of stories about him having an outstanding vision when it comes to handling issues of national defence, security, foreign affairs, economics and society.\n“He was also a great child of the central province of Thừa Thiên-Huế.

5202,'Time for businesses to develop eco-friendly products',"'Eco-friendly products are displayed at an exhibition held by the Ministry of Health in Hà Nội on August 16. Photo Vietnamplus\nDirector of the Environmental Technology Centre under the Institute of Environmental Technology Phùng Chí Sỹ speaks to Hải quan (Customs) newspaper about measures to help business tap opportunities to develop eco-friendly products\nThe Government has recently called on the business community to raise its social responsibility, particularly in reducing plastic waste. Is this an opportunity for businesses to produce environmentally-friendly products?\nThe Government, ministries and\xa0sectors have found different ways to reduce plastic waste. Many businesses have started to produce environmentally-friendly products. However, some businesses just add more ingredients such as corn and cassava flour to help their products\xa0decompose more easily. These products, however, still contain plastic components.\nPlastic waste reduction policies may not encourage the production of eco-friendly products.\nBut there is now a trend in reducing the use of plastic products so all production eco-friendly or bio-products will have opportunities to develop such as straws made of bamboo, metal, glass, green grass or rice flour.\nWe need to understand environmentally-friendly products are products that can be reused many times and do not harm the environment when disposed of. Particularly, the production process of these products should not cause\xa0environmental pollution.\nSo in this period of green economic development or sustainable economic development, the production of eco-friendly products will have much room to develop.\nWhich policies are needed to support businesses producing eco-friendly products to fulfil the country’s target of reducing plastic waste?\nThe cost to produce an eco-friendly nylon bag may be double that of a normal nylon bag. So to create conditions for businesses to produce eco-friendly products, production costs\xa0must be competitive with normal products.\nRegarding policies, the law on environmental protection tax has a regulation imposing an environmental tax on the production of normal nylon bags.\nThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has criteria on bioplastic bags that are easily broken down and will permit eligible businesses to produce eco-friendly products. Accordingly, these businesses will enjoy preferential policies.\nThe Vietnam Environmental Protection Fund also provides support for these businesses to get access to credit at\xa0low interest rates.\nHowever, shortcomings remain between legal documents and the implementation so many businesses find it hard to benefit from these preferential policies. In fact, these businesses have to go through “many doors”\xa0to get access to the preferential policies, which has discouraged them. Some business say it is easier to complete procedures to get loans from banks than applying for such financial support.\nSo it can be seen that supporting policies tailored for businesses must comply with real conditions and have transparent mechanisms.\nWhat should businesses do to tap the opportunities to develop eco-friendly products?\nThe consumption market will act as a decisive factor in the development of eco-friendly products so businesses must learn from the markets of developing countries.\nWe have had eco-friendly products to replace plastic bags for a while, such as using banana and lotus leaves to wrap products, but this has not been developed into a big market. So businesses need to base their actions on real demand to produce appropriate products.\nTo make eco-friendly products of high competitiveness, businesses should invest in eco-friendly technology which discharges fewer exhaust fumes and consumes less energy.\nWith appropriate technology and\xa0reasonable production costs and consumer prices, eco-friendly products can compete with normal plastic products.

Photo MoF\nHÀ NỘI The Vietnamese Ministry of Finance (MoF) on Wednesday said Moody's Investors Service’s decision to confirm Việt Nam’s rating at Ba3 but change the outlook to negative was not appropriate, given it is grounded on an isolated incident and does not adequately recognise the Vietnamese Government’s instituted policies and procedures to ensure smooth and timely debt repayment on government guaranteed borrowings.\nOn Wednesday, Moody's released the latest rating action on Việt Nam, confirming the Vietnamese Government’s Ba3 local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings, and changed the outlook to negative, concluding the review for downgrade that was initiated on October 9, 2019.\nEarlier, on October 9, Moody's announced to place the Ba3 local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings of the Vietnamese Government under review within three months for downgrade, saying the decision was driven by institutional deficiencies that have come to light. In particular, Moody's became aware of delayed payments on an obligation by the Government.\nUnder the new rating action, Moody’s said the confirmation of the rating reflects its assessment that enhanced attention by the administration on forthcoming payments of all the government's debt obligations, direct and indirect, reduces the risk of renewed payment delays.\nThe Ba3 rating is underpinned by strong growth potential and economic diversification, supporting the economy's capacity to absorb shocks, including a prolonged slowdown in global trade. The rating also reflects Moody's expectation that the government's direct debt burden will decline gradually, from moderately high levels, and debt affordability will improve.\nMoreover, while the rapid build-up of a large and diversified manufacturing sector denotes policy effectiveness, Moody's assesses the country's institutions and governance to be relatively weak, including administrative deficiencies revealed in the delayed debt payments. And although the financial health of Vietnamese banks has improved over recent years, the banking system remains the chief driver of overall event risks for the sovereign.\nThe negative outlook reflects some ongoing risk of payment delays on some of the government's indirect debt obligations, in the absence of more tangible and significant measures to improve the coordination and transparency around debt management within the administration.\nAccording to the MoF, Moody’s acknowledged in its press release that with a coordinated focus on ensuring that the payments are planned for and processed promptly, the risk of renewed delays has significantly receded. Nevertheless, the MoF believes Moody’s signal to keep monitoring Việt Nam’s credit profile with a negative outlook is incommensurate with the strong and timely directives of the Government, as well as the set of drastic measures which the Government of Việt Nam, the MoF and competent authorities have implemented to improve administrative coordination and to immediately address the payment delays on the Government’s contingent liabilities, ensuring no loss for creditors.\n“On this occasion, the MoF affirms that the Government of Việt Nam always honours all debt obligations in a reliable and timely manner as per commitments pledged with development partners and international financial institutions. This principle has been unambiguously demonstrated as the Government of Việt Nam has proactively performed the guarantor’s obligation in debt servicing even in the absence of an official demand from the creditors,” MoF said in a statement.\nAccording to the MoF, to prevent potential future payment delays on contingent liability of the Government, which may cause unnecessary misconception in the investor community about the Government’s debt repayment capacity and adversely affect the country’s reputation and national image, the Prime Minister has directed the MoF and competent authorities to allocate sufficient resources to ensure timely payments on both direct and indirect debt obligations.\n“In the coming years, the Government of Việt Nam shall continue to pursue enabling policies to ensure macro-economic stability, improve the country’s competitiveness, accelerate institutional reforms and utilise resources to ensure debt repayment capacity and debt sustainability,” MoF noted.\nThe MoF and competent agencies are willing to provide information to underline the Government’s firm commitment to fulfilling debt obligations in a transparent manner, the MoF said, expecting that Moody’s, other rating agencies as well as international organisations shall have adequate information and concrete evidence to form a more accurate assessment of Việt Nam’s strong credit profile\nAt the latest rating of Moody’s, Việt Nam's long-term foreign currency (FC) bond ceiling at Ba1, its long-term FC deposit ceiling at B1 and its local currency bond and deposit ceilings at Baa3 were unchanged. The short-term FC bond and deposit ceilings also remained unchanged at Not Prime. VNS",2

source codes for Microsoft products, such as the popular Windows operating system and Office suites; technical data about Microsoft’s products and cloud services; and access to Microsoft's engineers to address specific topics.\nWhat are\xa0the Ministry of Public Security’s plans for\xa0the future?\nCurrently, the Vietnamese Government is aggressively directing the implementation of e-government\xa0towards a\xa0digital government and\xa0digital economy, which has achieved positive results.\nIn the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) and information technology increasingly being applied by\xa0ministries, departments, State agencies and localities, this\xa0creates a momentum for the strong development of the economy and society.\nGSP cooperation between Microsoft and the department include dissemination to the community, implementing application and enhancing State management of\xa0network security.\nThis\xa0helps raise awareness and promotes the\xa0application of\xa0new technology, replacing old software and removing non-copyrighted software.\nIn addition, through this cooperation, we will also strengthen the fight against all kinds of crimes including software piracy in Việt Nam.

Groups that gather ASEAN and other partners were also suggested with the most likely ones being European nations and the US.\nIn his speech, Bình said since the CACJ was officially recognised as an entity of ASEAN connectivity, cooperation among courts within the council’s framework has become increasingly vibrant and effective. Given this, the ASEAN governments have been showing their support for multilateral judicial cooperation activities within this framework, as well as bilateral cooperation between member courts.\nCourts of ASEAN countries have found a right direction, and the CACJ is greatly contributing to the solidarity, mutual understanding, cooperation and sharing in the ASEAN Community, he said.\nBình said the CACJ now has more and more ideas and activities, illustrating the member nations’ demand for judicial and legal integration. The council has also been making unceasing efforts to affirm its centrality in the judicial and legal integration process of the bloc.\nHe added that the Supreme People’s Court of Vietnam is a CACJ member that is always ready to make more contributions and efforts, with the highest sense of responsibility and goodwill, for the common success of the council and for a cohesive, rules-based, people-oriented and people-centred ASEAN Community.\nAt the meeting, participants approved some new initiatives and welcomed Việt Nam’s hosting of the 8th meeting of the CACJ. — VNS'",0

The draft law revision was submitted to the National Assembly (NA)’s Standing Committee on Wednesday for a final review before it was due to be voted through by the NA on November 20.\nThe ministry – which was in charge of drafting revisions to the code – decided to pick Family Day following suggestions by NA deputies to add a public holiday\xa0to the calendar. They offered a choice\xa0between School Opening Day on September 5 or Vietnamese Family Day.\nThis was not the first time the labour\xa0ministry considered creating a new national holiday. The War Invalids and Martyrs’ Day July 27 was initially its first pick, though objections from some NA deputies eventually made the ministry withdraw its proposal.\nViệt Nam currently has 10 official public holidays.\nIn its latest report on the draft amended labour law, the ministry kept its proposal to raise the retirement age to 62 for\xa0men and 60 for women.\nIt means female labourers will have to work five more years before they can retire and receive pensions compared to the current age cap of 55.\nFor men, it is an increase of two years over the prevailing retirement age of 60.\nThe Government, however, said that it would conduct research on 1,810 jobs and occupations which were physically demanding or ones that posed health risks and dangers to the workers, which might possibly subject them to\xa0an earlier retirement.\nWhile the draft law encourages companies to let employees work less than 48 hours a week, it also set a ceiling for overtime of no more than 40 hours a month. — VNS'",1

Then, my brother and sister-in-law were also affected. I am the fourth person in my family to get the disease,” she said.\nThe four patients received treatment at the virus and parasitology department of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.\nThe Department of Infectious Diseases of Việt Nam National Children’s Hospital has recorded many cases of transmission from children who had chicken pox to their mothers.\nNguyễn Văn Lâm, director of the department, said most chickenpox cases are benign but the disease is highly contagious and can have life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis.\nSomeone with chickenpox can spread the virus through droplets in the air by coughing or sneezing as well as contact with fluid from the blisters, making it important to monitor and isolate infected patients, avoiding spreading the disease among the community.\nAlong with chickenpox, rubella and mumps also have mechanisms of transmission through the respiratory tract or mucus that has viruses.\nIn the first months of this year, the number of rubella and mumps cases increased in some countries around the world. The US’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a warning about a hike in mumps as more than 700 cases were recorded in the country.\nHoàng Đức Hạnh, deputy director of Hà Nội’s Health Department, said conditions were ripe for a lot of epidemics from other localities to enter Hà Nội.\nPreventive measures\nPhu, the director of Preventive Health Department, said the ministry has learned from previous disease prevention and combat efforts.\nPriority has been given to early detection of infections from international border gates and at community and health care centres.\nOnce a suspicious case was detected, the infected people must be isolated for immediate treatment, he said.\nNguyễn Nhật Cảm, director of Hà Nội Disease Control Centre said the city had five mobile teams for disease prevention and combat and each district had its own teams.\nUpon receiving information about suspected cases of infection, the team would arrive at the scene and employ appropriate measures, he said.\nThe city also monitors passengers entering through Nội Bài airport, especially those coming from disease-affected areas.\nTo prevent the epidemic from spreading, localities should launch campaigns to raise knowledge for enterprises and people on the diseases, Cảm said.\nWhen infections were detected among students, teachers and school employees, hygienic disinfection is a must to minimise the spread of germs, he said.\n""Strict punishment will be imposed on any individuals or units who are found hiding epidemics or failing to comply with supervision measures and isolation,” Cảm said. — VNS'",1

They explained that Việt Nam has many e-commerce companies with strong financial potential in the top ten list and the rankings of the companies are not too far from each other.\nThis competitiveness motivates the companies to continue to maintain multi-channel activities, including website channels, to reach customers continuously. Meanwhile, in countries like Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia, the competition is almost only between Lazada and Shopee, the representatives said. VNS",2

However, the ministry has not evaluated the three complexes\xa0individually due to a lack of\xa0regulations.\nThis has harmed the environment during and after the limestone mining process, he said.\nHưng said there were 10 quarries in Phước Tân quarry complex in Biên Hoà City, along the two sides of the Buông River. All of the quarries are legal and were evaluated the environmental impact assessment.\nThese quarries were licensed to operate between four and 25 years on\xa0403ha. The total amount of exploited limestone was estimated to be 130 million cu.m to a depth of up to 80m.\nHưng said five out of 10 quarries were only 50m\xa0from the river and each quarry was hundreds of metres long.

During the last ten months of 2019, Việt Nam’s wood exports to the US hit nearly $4.2 billion, a 34.5 per cent increase from the same period in 2018, and accounting for almost half of the country’s total wood export.\nSuch rapid growth, however, is not without risks, as Vietnamese firms can expect stricter regulations in the future as US agencies ramp up efforts to counter trade fraud, especially in relation to product origin.\nWhile concrete steps have been taken by the Vietnamese government to prevent foreign goods being falsely labelled as Made-in-Vietnam, trade authorities have warned Vietnamese firms against taking part in fraudulent activities to ensure healthy growth for the industry in the future.\nExperts also advised firms to take action as soon as possible to build sustainable value chains, saying they would play a crucial part in the success of the industry. The industry’s value chain, which includes numerous tasks from planting forests, processing and commercialisation of wood products to export must be linked and integrated into firms’ long-term sustainable development strategies. — VNS'",2

Meticulously thought out expressions dropped into interviews and press conferences with the one simple aim, to rattle the hell out of the opposition.\nAnd boy could he rattle.\nKevin Keegan famously lost his rag on television after a particular back and forth with Sir Alex, and who can forget Benitez’s famous ‘fact’ rant at his United rival?\nGuess what?

Facebook and other social media sites are the same.\nIn this modern age we live in, everyone is a pundit, everyone an expert, and everyone has an opinion they want to share whether you like it or not.\nLiverpool are eight points clear (granted, after a 94th minute stroke of good fortune against Leicester on Saturday) but there is still a long way to go and a lot of football to play.\nLiverpool are still to face Manchester City, home and away, and after the international break they play Manchester United, at Old Trafford.\nOn paper it should be men against pre-school toddlers, but despite United’s atrocious start to the season so far, the players and fans will be looking to dent Liverpool’s chances.\nBut once again I’ll say this, there is still a long way to go, and Liverpool do have a habit of giving up leads late on in the season.\nIsn’t that right Steven Gerrard?\nAnd without sounding like some bloke from Game of Thrones, winter is coming. And with it means a packed fixture list and for Liverpool, the World Club Cup Competition in the Middle East.\nNo one wins the Premier League at Christmas, and no one certainly wins it in October.\nLiverpool have had a good start, but that’s all.\nThere are still 30 games left to play, that’s 90 points up for grabs, and both City and Liverpool have to play each other, twice.\nSo to your so-called experts, and I’m talking about those paid to talk on TV as well as keyboard warriors still living with their parents and sat in their bedrooms with nothing better to do, I say this: “Give it a rest.”\nRegular readers of this column will know full well I would be singing from the roof tops if Liverpool were to win the prize that has evaded them for so long.\nBut I’m not booking my tattoo just yet. That will only happen if, and when, Liverpool top the league with more points than the team below and with no matches left to play.\nUntil then, I’m just enjoying the rollercoaster ride that is the English Premier League.

817,'OANA members commit to fight fake news with modern technology',"From June 17-18, 1989, the Vietnam News Agency organised the 10th OANA Executive Board Meeting, the 10th Technical Group Meeting and the sixth Editorial Workshop. VNA/VNS File Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Members of the Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA) agreed that it’s time to use every advantage to develop mechanisms in the fight against fake news, and all media outlets should not compromise truth, accuracy and accountability for speed.\nGiven the context that fake news is spreading and harming nations, the Bahrain News Agency (BNA) affirmed that it does not compromise in its quest for honest reporting of the events in the country and around the world.\n\nAs local, regional, and international events require regular and prompt coverage in the news, the BNA assumes the responsibility of contributing effectively to keeping the international community well-informed on events and conferences, as well as on contexts and outcomes.\n\nThe agency shared its experience in keeping to the golden rule of not falling for fake news stories, no matter how genuine they are made to look or sound.\n\nIt also has created win-win situations to exchange credible news with other agencies in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe, and signed agreements with some universities and research centres in order to boost chances of dealing with only factual news and analyses.\n\nThe BNA has also trained its staff on the best practices to verify all news that it receives via email, fax, phone calls, and messages or that its monitoring team spots on websites.\nFirst Deputy Director General of Russia’s TASS news agency Mikhail Gusman\xa0said that the first step\xa0would\xa0be forming close ties among news agencies, possibly in a traditional alliance like the OANA, he suggested, stressing on the need to give a clear definition of “fake news”, along with legal arguments and regulations.\n\nAccording to Gusman, the OANA is not only a venue for news agencies to share experience, but also to make important decisions affecting the stability of the global information space.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republic of Korea (RoK)’s Yonhap news agency shared that the country’s media outlets are strengthening their fact-checking mechanisms to prevent damage from spreading fake news and to allow the readers to decide what the facts are when there are conflicting versions of stories.\n\nYonhap, the RoK’s premier newswire service, set up a fact-checking committee and has since made it a permanent team in an effort to contribute to a virtuous cycle in the local media market and to provide news that is fast, precise, and balanced.\n\nYonhap’s fact-checking team was officially launched in April 2018 as part of the newsroom. Foreign correspondents and reporters can pitch in by writing articles tagged with “fact check” to highlight issues that require the separation of facts from untruths. The aim is not to limit fact-checking to specific sections or issues.\n\nFact-checking has now become one of the most important concerns for Korean media. Broadcasters and newspapers have separate teams of people focused directly on this issue.\n\nYonhap’s fact-checking team filed 140 articles over the one-year period following its launch, identifying the facts in the coverage of politics, business, society, culture, science, and other areas of news. To deal with fake news on YouTube, Yonhap launched a video fact-check service named “Weekly Fact Check” on March 8 this year, it said.\nNurini Kasssim, CEO of Bernama News Agency from Malaysia, said it was important for the mainstream media, which is slowly losing out to social media as the main source of news and information, to regain the trust of the public, especially the younger generation.\n“It is not an easy task for the mainstream media to regain the trust of the public.\n“Nevertheless, it is not a battle that cannot be won. We have to innovate and\xa0come up with the right strategies,” she said.\nDespite the transformation in the field of information dissemination, many people still yearn for truth in the news they digest.\n“News agencies must engage in constructive journalism and not just harp on\xa0negative issues that can turn away consumers,” she said.\nSharing measures to win global public trust, Director General of Turkey’s Anadolu Agency Senol Kazanci said that news agencies should grow continuously, increase production and keep up the quality of its services.\n\nHe shared that AA is the dominating primary news source for the Turkish media, which proves that the agency has won the public trust as the mainstream news source in Turkey.\n\nTo that end, AA has increased its broadcast languages up to 13, positioned itself in a global photo distribution network with its high quality photos, increased the number of its worldwide offices to 41 and representatives to 100, signed cooperation agreements with 70 leading news agencies and gained subscribers from 76 countries.\n\nPresently, the agency is providing news services with the staff from 124 different nationalities, he added\nThe D-Watch\nAs part of efforts to verify information circulating on the internet and make it useful for news coverage, Kyodo News created the “D-Watch” team in the summer of 2012. Since then, the team has been monitoring various websites and social media, like Facebook and Twitter, every day from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. and regularly reports to the News Department’s nerve centre, called the News Center, about newsworthy information. The D-Watch team is operated independently from the newsroom by young people familiar with social media, including part-time university students.\nIf the News Center judges that it is better to cover something, based on information from the D-Watch team, it instructs news sections to send reporters to the spot where the news is happening. Reporters verify the information on the spot, and write news articles and take photos as well as videos if necessary. Kyodo reporters directly contact witnesses or information providers via social media and obtain more details, photos and videos. On the other hand, news sections may ask the D-Watch team to closely monitor information on websites and social media when a big accident or a huge natural disaster happens.\nInformation from the D-Watch team has sometimes resulted in breaking news stories. For example, the team detected information in June last year that a man with a knife was attacking passengers on a “shinkansen” bullet train. Based on the information from the D-Watch team, the City News Section and the Yokohama Bureau dispatched reporters and they were able to report news stories about the incident earlier than other media outlets. When a man rammed his car into pedestrians on Takeshita Street in Harajuku, a popular tourist destination in Tokyo, in January this year, injuring eight people, reporters from the City News Section were able to contact some witnesses with the help of the D-Watch team.\nIn addition to monitoring information on websites and social media by itself, the D-Watch team is now using an AI-assisted system called “FASTALERT”. The system, developed by JX Press Corp., detects accidents, disasters and other newsworthy things at an early date, collecting information posted by witnesses on social media.\nTwitter and Facebook platforms\nMeanwhile, the Montsame News Agency of Mongolia said to cope with the shift of new content consumption behaviour, focusing on video content and YouTube platform, the agency has successfully broadcasted news content through Twitter and Facebook platforms from September 2017.\nNoting that the main criterion for broadcasting information using YouTube is speed, especially in breaking news, and quality issues, the agency stressed the importance of increasing breaking news and video news. Video news is taken from the original source and there will be no chance for it to be fake. And it would help to solve such issues as fake news and verified news, and how to win back trust of costumers who often trust basic information, the agency said.\nTo consolidate the position of the OANA member agencies in the global news network, the agency suggested improving the usage of the OANA’s website, increasing the supply of video news to OANA websites, and paying attention to developing Facebook and Twitter pages.\nFact checking\nThe Australian Associated Press (AAP), meanwhile,\xa0is using its strong culture of innovation to create new opportunities and new products.\nAAP's news diaries and planning platform reduce unnecessary duplication of work for its subscribers.\nTo ensure the newswire is relevant, AAP has developed strong usage analytics for its content to understand who takes its stories, how they are used and how deeply the subscribers’ audiences are engaged in AAP content. This information can influences decisions on news coverage.\nAAP has grown in photographic business and generated strong income.\nAAP also launched\xa0initiatives such as\xa0Fact Checking, which holds political figures to account as it highlights false claims make in public statements.\nMobile, visual, intelligent and digital products\nSun Yong, President of Xinhua’s Asia-Pacific Bureau, said the agency has been working hard to innovate their news products, changing from mainly serving traditional media to various types of users and their different needs.\nIt has rolled out different services for new media and short video media, and increased mobile, visual, intelligent and digital products and so on.

4391,Colombia's Munoz pulls out playoff win at Sanderson Farms event,"'Sebastian Munoz celebrates winning the Sanderson Farms Championship on Sunday. — Photo sportinglife.com\nLOS ANGELES — Sebastian Munoz parred the first playoff hole on Sunday at the Sanderson Farms Championship to beat Im Sung-jae and earn his first US PGA Tour victory.\nMunoz birdied the last hole in regulation to force the playoff, then returned to 18, where he rolled in a four-foot putt to pull out the victory over the 2019 tour rookie of the year.\n""I am speechless. This is crazy,"" said Munoz, who becomes just the second Colombian to win on the tour, joining Camilo Villegas.\n""The putts weren\'t going in but I just stayed confident. It was awesome.""\nThe 26-year-old Munoz fired a closing round of two-under-par 70 for an 18-under 270 total to tie Im, who closed with a 66 on Sunday at The Country Club of Jackson in Mississippi.\nIm\'s South Korean compatriot An Byeong-hun finished in third, one shot back of the leaders, after a 69 in the fourth round.\nMunoz\'s three prior professional wins have all come in Colombia -- including the 2016 Colombia Championship on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour.\nHe was coming off a tie for seventh at The Greenbrier last week. Munoz, who started the fourth round with a one-shot lead, becomes the seventh first-time tour winner of this event in the past eight years.\nThe last time Munoz had a 54-hole lead he finished tied for third at The Greenbrier in 2017.\nOn the playoff hole, both players landed in the rough, on either side of the fairway off the tee.\nHitting out of the left-side rough, Im flew his second shot over the flag stick and into the grandstand.\nThat opened the door for Munoz, who had found the right rough off the tee. But Munoz left his 166-yard second shot well short of the green.\nMunoz then made a nice chip to four feet and claimed the victory after Immissed badly from six feet on his first putt.\nMunoz had birdies in regulation on three, 11 and 18 and a bogey on 15. He forced the playoff by making a slow roller from 15 feet over an uphill slope.\n""We decided on a line and tried to make it as simple as we could,"" he said of the clutch putt.\nMunoz is the second South American in as many weeks to win after Chile\'s Joaquin Niemann captured his first title by six shots at The Greenbrier.\n""Jaco\'s win gave me the belief I needed, the little extra belief I\'m good enough,"" said Munoz.\nMunoz, from Bogota, was in the final group with his former teammate at the University of North Texas, Carlos Ortiz, but the Mexican needed an eagle on\xa0 18 to get into the playoff and settled for a par.\nOrtiz shot a final-round 71 to finish in a tie for fourth with American Kevin Streelman at 272, two shots back of Munoz and Im.\nIm\'s burgeoning career gathered more steam as he charged to the finish with three straight birdies on 14, 15 and 16 to get to 18 under overall.\nLike Munoz, the 21-year-old Im was gunning for his first tour title after winning the 2019 rookie of the year award. His best previous finish was a tie for third at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March.\nDefending champion Cameron Champ shot a two-under 70 and finished in a tie for 28th. — AFP'",3

International start-ups, digital nomads and freelancers seeking affordable workplaces could also consider relocating to Việt Nam to grow their business.\n“This growing demand from both domestic and overseas occupiers called for a more advanced solution than the traditional leasing service, which explains the introduction of Workthere in Việt Nam.”\nCal Lee, founder and global head of Workthere, said: “Việt Nam has seen phenomenal growth in the flexible workspace sector, with many new venues coming to the market.

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — A Japanese organisation on Tuesday announced\xa0 it was ready to pay all costs to clean\xa0the heavily polluted Tô Lịch River and West Lake in Hà Nội following a remark by an environment official saying the firm's sewage treatment technology had failed.\nThe Japan Environment and Business Organisation (JEBO), which was behind a pilot project to clean up the river and lake this summer, said it was prepared to pay in full for the treatment technologies and would rent them to Hà Nội authorities once they were proved to be successful.\nHà Nội would then take charge of the management and operation of the cleansing system, JEBO said.\nJEBO, in co-ordination with the Japan Việt Nam Environment Company (JVE), kicked off a pilot project in May to clean a short section of the Tô Lịch River and part of\xa0West Lake using Japanese nano-bioreactor technology.\nThe project was run for three months before being wrapped up with a stunt when a project member immersed himself in the filtered water from the\xa0river to prove the success of the project in August.\nHowever, Lê Văn Dục, director of the Hà Nội Department of Construction which oversees the capital’s sewage system, said JVE had been invited to carry out the pilot project in the capital city but “it failed”.\nThe comment sparked a protest from JEBO which claimed on Sunday that what the construction director said was “baseless”, and “opposite to the conclusion by the city People’s Committee”.\nThe Tô Lịch River has been a symbol of environmental pollution in the capital for decades despite several efforts to save it since the 1990s.\nThe blame has been placed on the 150,000 cubic metres of raw sewage released daily into the 14km-long river, according to statistics by the municipal Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\nApart from the Japanese\xa0project using nano-bioreactor technology to remove contaminants, Hà Nội authorities were also working on two other solutions to clean\xa0the river.\nOne was to build a system to collect the sewage which would then be transferred to the Yên Xá wastewater treatment plant. Construction of the system, however, has lagged behind schedule and won't be ready\xa0until 2021.\nThe other solution was to treat the water chemically using Redoxy-3C,\xa0a strong oxidizer which can degrade almost all inorganic and organic impurities in water.\xa0It\xa0has already been used in 87 lakes in Hà Nội since 2016.\nThe Redoxy-3C treatment, however, was being inspected following complaints over a\xa0lack of\xa0transparency in Hà Nội's\xa0purchase\xa0of the chemical. The city\xa0Inspectorate was due to release the inspection report on July 15 but so far nothing has been published.\nThe city inspector chief Nguyễn An Huy told the reporters on Wednesday morning that the inspectors were still in the middle of the work and would announce the conclusion as soon as it was available.
