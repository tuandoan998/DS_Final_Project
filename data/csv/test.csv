It marked\xa0the mid-term review of the ASEAN Community’s Master Plan 2015-25, while\xa0Việt Nam would\xa0celebrate its 25th\xa0anniversary as a member of the bloc.\nHighlighting that Việt Nam’s Chairmanship was\xa0a major responsibility that could provide many\xa0opportunities for\xa0Việt Nam, he said: “Việt Nam will spare no efforts to successfully act as ASEAN Chairman 2020, making contributions to building a cohesive and consolidated ASEAN Community.”\nHe said Việt Nam had\xa0selected the theme “Cohesive and Responsive” for ASEAN 2020. The two elements were interdependent and complimentary to each other, he added.\nViệt Nam’s Chairmanship 2020 will put focus on upholding ASEAN’s responsibilities and positive roles in maintaining regional peace, security and stability on the basis of strengthening the bloc’s solidarity and unity.\nViệt Nam will promote regional connections and enhance the region’s ability to adapt to and take advantage of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, deepening economic ties and comprehensive connections within the bloc and with other partners.\nThe other priorities of Việt Nam’s Chairmanship 2020 are to promote ASEAN awareness and identities; strengthening partnerships for peace and sustainable growth with countries around\xa0the world to uphold ASEAN’s role\xa0and contributions to the global community.\nThe ASEAN Chairmanship 2020 would\xa0aim at enhancing the ability to\xa0adapt\xa0and the effective operation of the\xa0ASEAN apparatus, Dũng said.\nViệt Nam had\xa0been preparing for the role since the establishment in December last year of the National ASEAN 2020 Committee led by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Phạm Bình Minh, he said.\nResponding to a question regarding the\xa0challenges Việt Nam would face\xa0taking over two roles at the same time next year – being the ASEAN Chairman and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Dũng said the roles complemented\xa0each other. As ASEAN Chairman, Việt Nam represented\xa0ASEAN at\xa0the UN and also acted\xa0as a bridge between ASEAN and the UN to carry out ASEAN plans in synchronisation with UN\xa0goals.\n“We have to focus on the\xa0diversified viewpoints of many groups as well as protect ASEAN's interests. Việt Nam will have to collaborate with ASEAN members the\xa0UN Security Council\xa0to ensure balance, and pay due attention to the interests\xa0of different sides in accordance with global trends.\n“These are heavy\xa0responsibilities and Việt Nam will try its\xa0best to accomplish them,” he told reporters.\nAt the press briefing, Deputy Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Lê Quang Tùng said the ministry had\xa0plans to promote the image of the Vietnamese land and people in 2020.\nThere would\xa0be art performances to celebrate ASEAN 2020 summits, the ASEAN film week and exhibitions and sporting\xa0events, he said. — VNS",0

Việt Nam has failed to be upgraded to the secondary emerging market status in the latest FTSE Russell classification review. - Photo vnreview.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Global provider of benchmarks, analytics and data solutions FTSE Russell last week kept Việt Nam on its watch list as a frontier market.\nViệt Nam was added to the watch list a year ago for possible reclassification to secondary emerging market status.\nThe market “continues to fail the ‘clearing and settlement – T+2/T+3’ criterion which is currently rated as ‘Restricted’, due to the market practice of conducting a pre-trading check to ensure the availability of funds prior to trade execution,” FTSE Russell said in its statement.\n“Additional improvements are sought with regard to the registration of new accounts where market practice can extend the registration process and also the introduction of an efficient mechanism to facilitate trading in securities that have reached, or are approaching, their foreign ownership limit between non-domestic investors.”\nFTSE Russell also acknowledged Vietnamese market regulators have made “constructive interaction” in the last twelve months to develop and improve the capital market while it also looked forward to “continuing the engagement”.\nThis failure had been widely expected.\nAccording to Bảo Việt Securities Company (BVSC), no big improvements have been made since FTSE Russell’s last review in September 2018.\nOne big problem is the amended Law on Securities, which has not been approved by the National Assembly.\nCompared to the previous interim review on March 2019, Việt Nam meets seven of nine criteria required for its upgrade to the secondary emerging market status.\nBesides the “clearing and settlement” criterion, Việt Nam needs to improve the “settlement – rare incidence of failed trades” but it needs further information for assessment, according to FTSE Russell.\nAccording to FTSE Russell, Việt Nam needs to follow the international practice of delivery and payment, meaning an investor will pay for shares after he receives them.\nUnder Article 7.2 of Circular 203/2015/TT-BTC dated December 21, 2015 by the Ministry of Finance, an investor can only place a buy order after he proves to have a sufficient amount of cash in the account.\nIf the investor has a deposit at a bank, the bank must have the confirmation letter or the letter of credit on his placed order before he can execute the transaction. This can help institutional investors trade without proving they have a sufficient amount of cash.\nHowever, very few banks can offer institutional investors a letter of confirmation or a letter of credit as there are no specific instructions for this activity. Besides banks, securities companies can provide the same thing to investors if they are allowed by the State Securities Commission.\nViệt Nam will be reviewed for possible reclassification as a secondary emerging market within the FTSE country classification scheme at the annual review in September 2020, FTSE added. – VNS'",2

She attributed the situation to the increase of unilateral actions that are not based on legal orders regulated in universal international conventions and violate the common principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which are threatening peace that humankind has been striving to maintain.\n\nThe situation needs coordination at multiple levels, including the engagement of multilateral institutions and particularly the IPU, the Vice Chairwoman said.\n\nShe applauded the IPU-141’s theme, which highlights the union’s resolve and actions to enhance the role of international law – the principle to regulate international relations and the basis to boost global governance and equal cooperative ties among countries, regardless of how big or small they are.\n\nThe official emphasised that Việt Nam persistently pursues a foreign policy of independence and self-reliance, and respects multilateralism, the rule of law and the common principles of international relations. It pays special attention to the maintenance of international order based on rules, common agreements and conventions among countries.\n\nThe country always adheres to regulations of universal international agreements such as the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and settles disputes by peaceful measures on the basis on international law, Phóng said, adding that it has also taken part in many multilateral treaties within the framework of the UN and other international organisations.\n\nViệt Nam will serve as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2020-21, ASEAN Chair in 2020 and Chair of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA) for 2019-20, she said.\n\nTherefore, the country will continue helping to promote multilateralism and fair and equal dialogue, settle global issues and regional conflicts, and foster peace on the basis of international law, while enhancing regional cooperation in perfecting mechanisms for ensuring equitable and balanced interests for all relevant parties, the Vice Chairwoman noted.\n\nSuggesting ways to boost respect for international law, she said respect for the UN Charter, as well as compliance with international law and common principles and standards of conduct, must be reinforced at global, regional and national levels.\n\nIt is necessary to expand and bring into play the role of cooperation, dialogue and information sharing mechanisms to improve mutual understanding, trust and respect to seek peaceful solutions to regional disputes and urgent challenges, Phóng said.\n\nParliaments should also step up the ratification and participation of international treaties and agreements and multilateral legal documents; align their countries’ laws with international treaties they have engaged in; and increase monitoring the implementation of important agreements reached through multilateral negotiations, she said.\n\nPhóng also called for parliamentary diplomacy to be supported and the IPU’s role to be further promoted for the sake of global peace and democracy.\n\nAdditionally, she underlined the need to strengthen the IPU’s cooperation mechanisms with its member parliaments, the UN and international organisations, with a focus on sustainable development, poverty reduction, nutrition, gender equality, youth participation, management and sustainable use of natural resources, and connectivity among countries and parliaments in making policies on climate change response.\n\nSharing the Vietnamese official’s view, other delegates at the IPU-141’s plenary session also highlighted the importance of international law while condemning the violations and disregard for it, saying those actions are harmful to peace, security and development co-operation.\n\nThey stressed the IPU’s tasks and role in supervising and maintaining international law, asking the union to form sustainable mechanisms and solutions to ensure strict adherence to international law, especially the UN Charter, the International Human Rights Conventions, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the UNCLOS, because it is the only legal tool to resolve conflicts and disputes. — VNS'",0
2311,"'New housing policy for low-, mid-income households\xa0needed in HCM City'","'The average housing area per person in HCM City is 19.9 square metres. VNS Photo Gia Lộc\nHCM CITY— Housing development is of paramount importance to HCM City as the city is expected to see an increase of one million people every five years in the 2021-35 period, according to Võ Văn Hoan, vice chairman of the city People’s Committee.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a conference on housing solutions held yesterday in HCM City, Hoan said that housing development should correspond with economic growth and transport infrastructure development in the southern economic zone and southwestern and eastern regions.\n“More attention should be paid to low-income people,” he said, adding that many commercially housing projects had been carried out.\n""The city needs more apartment buildings with parks and entertainment areas that are important for residents’ life,"" he said.\n“Housing quality should be high for low-income people also,” Hoan said.\nCity authorities plan to call on the private sector to invest in low-income housing, according to Hoan.\nThe committee is also working with the city’s Department of Construction to review and amend policies to create favourable conditions for enterprises to invest in such housing and for residents to be able to buy them.\nThe city has 1.9 million units of housing (including apartments) covering 182 million square metres.\nWithin the 2016-2020 period, the city aims to build an additional 40 million sq m of floor space, raising the average housing area per person to 19.8 sq m by 2020 from 17.32 sq m per person in 2015.\nAs of June, the average housing area per person was 19.9 square metres.\nCommercial housing projects, social housing, and buildings for workers and dormitories for students are all part of the city’s housing stock.\nThe department forecasts that the city will need 45 million square metres of floor space between 2021 and 2025.\nLê Hoàng Châu, chairman of the HCM City Real Estate Association, said: “The city’s biggest and most difficult problem is to solve housing needs for a large number of low-income and middle-income people, including state officials, students, workers, and migrants, to ensure social welfare and sustainable development.”\nThe city has nearly 476,000 households who do not own their own homes and live with relatives, accounting for 25 per cent of its total. Of the 476,000 households, more than 20,000 live on and near canals and 35,000 in old apartment buildings that need to be improved.\nMany of them buy apartments in social housing projects which they can buy on hire-purchase or buy units in commercial housing valued up to VNĐ1 billion (US$43,049). They also need to rent apartments at inexpensive prices.\nLê Hữu Nghĩa, general director of Lê Thành Real Estate Company, said that red tape was the barrier for real estate companies to invest in social housing projects.\nHis company, for instance, applied for approval for a new social housing project in Bình Chánh District in March, but the application has not been submitted to the city’s People’s Committee.\n“It could take five years to complete legal procedures for the implementation of the project,” Nghĩa said.\nThe Government should develop separate policies for approval of\xa0social housing projects and commercial housing projects, he said.\nYap Kioe Sheng of the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand said that cities in developing countries were growing rapidly as a result of natural growth due to relatively young populations and of rural-urban migration triggered by urban economic growth and rise of economic opportunities in cities.\n“The challenge for those cities is to see that the growing population is adequately housed,” Sheng said.\nAn urban housing policy needs to deal with the housing demand of both the local population, particularly low- and middle-income, and migrants, and the demand for both homeownership and rental housing, according to Sheng.\n“Given the diversity in demand from the low-income population, it is necessary to diversify the supply of affordable housing in terms of house type, location, tenure, adaptability and financing,” he said.\nEach of the locations should offer one or more housing types, Sheng said.\n“Such a diverse low-income housing programme is a complex operation which cannot be implemented by the public sector or the private sector on its own,” he added.

We expect it from us that we fight for everything,"" he said.\n""The boys did really well, they fought really hard. It is completely normal that you come under pressure but we defended well.\n""That is how it is in the top six and in the Premier League. You will never win at Chelsea without putting a proper shift in and we did that today.""\nAfter City\'s astonishing 8-0 demolition of Watford on Saturday, this was the perfect response from Liverpool as they try to dethrone Pep Guardiola\'s champions.\nChasing a first English title since 1990, Liverpool are on a club-record run of 15 successive league wins and have lost just once in 45 top-flight matches, going unbeaten in the last 23.\n""It is exceptional. What can I say? We have to keep on going. It is never looks as easy as it did for City yesterday but we have not had these games yet.\nWe have to work for it,"" Klopp said.\n""We knew how good City were before the game yesterday. I really believe they are the best team in the world.\n""They are brilliant. We are not bad as well. We have to be ready for each opponent. They are want to give us a knock, rightly so.""\n\'Character and spirit\'\nThe only worry for Klopp was an injury to Senegal winger Sadio Mane that forced him off in the second half.\n""It is a knock on the bone around the knee and a dead leg,"" Klopp said.\n""He\'s OK, but we took him off, he wasn\'t limping but I didn\'t like how he was running.""\nChelsea had a greater share of possession, managed 13 shots to Liverpool\'s six and won six corners to their opponents\' four.\nBut those encouraging signs were undermined by poor defending and a lack of cutting edge, leaving Lampard as the first Chelsea manager to remain winless in his first four home matches since Bobby Campbell in 1988.\nLampard claimed Chelsea deserved more from their spirited effort, but he \xa0conceded his young side aren\'t mature enough yet.\n""No home wins, we want to change that and I believe we will if we play like that,"" he said.\n""Performance wise we were the better team. We had more energy in our game, character and spirit. That\'s why the crowd applauded at the end.\n""The difference between us and Liverpool is we aren\'t consistent enough. To work towards those levels is hard. It is a daily thing.\n""That is what we have to aspire to. The reality is younger players have come into the team.""\nChelsea were denied a first-half equaliser when Cesar Azpilicueta\'s effort was ruled out for offside against Mason Mount and Lampard admitted it was a momentum changer as Firmino bagged the second goal moments later.\n""I like to think we might get a couple in our favour. But you can see Mason is a tiny bit offside,"" he said.\n""It changes the atmosphere in the crowd, on the pitch. We are slightly deflated and they get a boost."" — AFP'",3

In the meantime, the land fund for transport infrastructure rises by less than 1 per cent per year.\nIt results in worse traffic congestion and lack of parking for city residents, online newspaper Dân Việt (Vietnamese People) reported.\nĐào Ngọc Nghiêm, vice president of Hà Nội’s Urban Planning Association, said there needs to be close co-ordination between traffic and planning.\nHowever, Hà Nội issued construction planning in April 2011 but didn’t approve the transport planning until March 2016, he said.\n“It’s inadequate from the first step, so, now the city has suffered consequences,” he said.\nFor example, more than 40 high-rise buildings have been constructed in Lê Văn Lương Street since 2011.

The earth moved. I was experiencing a euphoric feeling I’d only ever felt once before,\xa0during a house party in Liverpool when I’d just turned 16.\nBut this minute was the best ever. Better than any other minute I had enjoyed in the past.\nNeighbours of mine in Times City would have been left wondering what on earth was happening on the\xa019th floor of one of the tower blocks as a crazy English voice could be heard shouting from the balcony.\nWhy? Well because for those 60 seconds, Liverpool were champions of England.\nBut all good things must come to an end, and they did, with a bang. Manchester City, despite going a\xa0goal down away at Brighton did what all good champions do. They won at a canter and deservedly lifted\xa0the trophy on Sunday.\nI’ve written before in the pages of this newspaper how I feel City are a team manufactured, not created.\nThey are a team whose unparalleled success is largely down to the fact they are owned by one of the\xa0richest families in the world who have a bottomless pit of cash to spend.\nBut that said, on the pitch, they are truly magnificent and while Liverpool have had their best season\xa0ever, in the end it just wasn’t good enough and they fell short by a single point.\nFinishing second to an amazing team by just one point is a fabulous achievement, but at the same time,\xa0quickly forgettable.\nOther than a bit of extra cash, there is no prize for coming second. In fact the only thing it really achieves\xa0in a place in the Champions League the next season, which is same the team that finishes fourth and\xa0third also get.\nIn the top flight this season Liverpool have lost only once. They have kept the most clean sheets and two\xa0of their players, Sadio Mane and Mohammed Salah, are joint top scorers in the Premier League.\nIt’s been a season to remember for Liverpool fans, and one that everyone else in the Premier League will\xa0quite quickly forget once the new campaign kicks off.\nRemember who finished second to Manchester United when they won the league in 2013? Nope,\xa0neither do I. Or who finished runners-up to Chelsea in 2010? No, I’ve no idea of that one either.\nSo despite the fact that in every season in the history of the Premier League bar two, Liverpool’s points\xa0tally of 97 would have been enough to win the prize, the Reds have once again slipped up.\nI was planning on getting a tattoo to mark the occasion. It was going to be a mix of Liverpool and\xa0Vietnamese and spell out their achievement this year, but sadly the inking will have to go on hold. Until\xa0when I’ll never know.\nLiverpool fans on the whole, and I include myself in that bracket, are famously and foolishly optimistic.\nSince sometime in the mid-90s I, along with most other Liverpool supporter, have been declaring that\xa0“next year will be our year” and once again, that was exactly my reaction after the season drew to a\xa0close.\nThere is however one game still to play.

3263,'Private sector’s public goods provision: necessary but needs supervision',"'Võ Trí Thành*\nIn early October, an unusual scene unfolded in a modern part of the capital: hundreds of thousands of Hanoians were queuing up to collect clean water from a tanker.\nThis wasn’t a throwback to the bad old days when water shortages were common. It was due to a polluted supply of tap water.\nDespite knowing that oil waste had been dumped at the source, the supplier\xa0–\xa0Vinaconex Water Supply Joint Stock Company (Viwasupco)\xa0–\xa0continued to pump water into family homes. At a press conference, the company’s CEO even said: “Viwasupco was the biggest victim in this case.”\nThe case has raised questions about who is responsible\xa0for checking water quality\xa0and ensuring it is safe for use, and whether the participation of the private sector in delivering public goods is as necessary and efficient as expected.\nEconomists have for a long time pointed out that providing public goods is one of the key roles the State has to play in the development process.\nBy nature, public goods have certain characteristics that make it difficult to charge for them, and therefore private suppliers generally choose not to provide them. They are non-rival which\xa0means\xa0consumption by one user does not reduce the supply available for others, and non-excludable meaning users cannot be prevented from consuming the goods.\nClean water, power and infrastructure are among them.\nBesides, the market has some imperfections. One of them is the existence of positive and negative externalities, but the externalities are not often captured in the price, so some goods may be underprovided while other overprovided from a social point of view.\nInfrastructure projects related to transport, electricity and water supply or public services like education and healthcare normally have greater social returns than private benefits, so tend to be underprovided. Meanwhile, the price of goods often does not cover negative externalities such as environmental pollution caused by production, therefore they are overprovided from a social point of view.\nThe State needs to find solutions to correct imperfections by curbing negative externalities and promoting positive externalities.\nThe State also has a critical role to play in protecting the vulnerable and ensuring an equitable distribution of public goods. Growth could be hampered by civil unrest and political instability caused by lingering poverty and inequality.\nHowever, the State also has some failings. Especially in developing countries, corruption, principal-agents and conflicts of interest are just some of the issues that prevent states from performing their functions properly.\nHence, there has been an increasing trend in public goods provision toward contracting out to the private sector and encouraging the form of “public-private partnerships” which is expected to solve both market and state failure. Still, the model is not a nostrum.\nEfficiency of private sector\nIn Việt Nam, there was a period when the State held the monopoly over public utilities such as electricity, water and telecommunications. But facts have shown that direct interference of the State in such markets does not mean efficiency due to a shortage of human and capital resources, and poor performances at State-owned enterprises.\nThe development of the Vietnamese telecommunications market over the past two decades is clear evidence of the efficiency of the private sector’s participation after the State contracted out the service and promoted competition to improve the delivery of the service. As a result, people are enjoying good quality telecommunications services for reasonable prices.\nHowever, water is a special field as it relates to environmental issues and people’s health.\nIn principle, competition in a free market should be the motivation for private goods providers to enhance quality. In the case of the water sector in Việt Nam, enterprises only compete when they bid for projects, not for the interest of consumers.\nThe risky problem lies in that, unlike telecommunications services in which users can change their provider, water consumers have no choice. The areas they live in have only one supplier. Once the water source is polluted, thousands of people suffer and struggle, as the case of Viwasupco shows.\nPrivatisation of water enterprises started in 2005 and gathered pace in recent years with only a few enterprises remaining State-owned, transforming the water sector from a social to a business focus.\nBut the Government’s process of privatising water companies “has not yet had the impact that may have been intended”, the Asian Development Bank said in its working paper 2010 on ‘Việt Nam Water and Sanitation Sector Assessment, Strategy and Roadmap’.\n“Private ownership of a share of the system assets was not backed up by clearly defined\xa0and verifiable performance indicators"", and therefore did not lead to efficiency gains or performance improvement, but a loss of management control and no benefit to consumers,\xa0the report said.\nIn the UNDP Global Centre for Public Service Excellence’s publication titled “Is the private sector more efficient? A cautionary tale”, by examining cases of various countries, authors concluded that privatisation is often, but not always, associated with improved efficiency.\nThe publication showed the findings of a study on the French water supply sector in 2009 that having taken the environmental indicators into account, public management was more efficient than private management.\nAnother study on Malaysia’s water privatisation in 2012 found there was little overall improvement in terms of water revenue loss through leakage and theft.\nThough efficiency is assessed based on different definitions or approaches, the common conclusion drawn in the publication is that the efficiency of public goods provision under all ownership models depends on factors like competition, regulations, autonomy and wider issues of institutional development.\nLesson learnt\nFrom what happened last month and from recommendations made by international organisations, the private sector’s participation in providing public goods, particularly water, would only bring targeted results if there were good regulations and institutions in place.\nTo resolve market failure and ensure the State performs its functions well, the participation of related agencies and communities is necessary to supervise public goods providers based on criteria like security, health and the environment.\nIn the water sector, to ensure tap water is safe to use, the State must issue standards and supervise the water supply system, as well as publicising test results on a regular basis.\nPublic goods have an influence on a large scale, thus any incidents related to their delivery can easily cause a crisis. The State must be active in taking preventive measures and respond to incidents promptly, drastically and responsibly, restoring faith in the people.\nInformation disclosure, transparency and accountability are factors that create healthy competition among private enterprises. We will not be able to encourage the private sector’s engagement if we let cronyism exist.\nBesides encouraging private participation though incentives, the State must have strict penalties for those who violate regulations. That’s the “carrot and stick” principle.\nFinally, when more and more public services from building roads to education and healthcare are provided by the private sector, the State should focus its resources on delivering pure public goods that enterprises are not able to, such as ensuring the air is breathable, better social order, safeguarding property rights and guaranteeing the rule of law. — VNS\n* Võ Trí Thành is a senior economist at the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council.

Metro Line 1 in HCM City as part of\xa0one of the biggest ODA projects that JICA has implemented in Việt Nam. — VNA/VNS Photo Trần Xuân Tình\nHÀ NỘI — Delays to disbursement of\xa0official development assistance (ODA)\xa0for HCM City’s Metro Line 1 project pose a\xa0danger of\xa0setting a bad precedent and negatively affecting the implementation of other Japanese-funded projects in Việt Nam.\nSpeaking at an\xa0annual press conference held by the\xa0Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Việt Nam Office on Thursday, Senior Representative Takahashi Junko said if the project total investment could not be adjusted from VNĐ17 trillion (US$731 million) to VNĐ47 billion ($2 billion) by November 2019, the situation would be worsened.\n“Because Metro Line 1 is a very significant project that has attracted a lot of attention even from Japan, its implementation will affect the mindset of the Japanese government, especially at the moment, when Việt Nam\xa0is preparing for the next medium-term investment plan from 2021 to 2025” said Takahashi.\nThe project was first approved in 2007 with an\xa0initial budget of VNĐ17 trillion. However, in 2011, the city asked the Government to increase the budget to a massive\xa0VNĐ47 trillion.\nAccording to the Ministry of Transport, planning\xa0for the project started in 2006.\xa0At that\xa0time, Việt Nam had not embarked a project of this kind, hence the estimate being well below the actual cost.\nIn July, HCM City People’s Committee also asked the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to revise the cost of its first two metro lines. This adjustment has yet to be approved, so ODA\xa0disbursement has been delayed.\nThe first route connecting Bến Thành Market and Suối Tiên Water Park is more than 60 per cent complete.\nAlthough Takahashi\xa0refused to reveal the amount of money withheld from\xa0contractors, including Japanese firms, the JICA representative said: “It's quite large”.\n“I think this is the biggest project we have which has ever been delayed,” she added.\nAccording to Takahashi, the problem was the central Government was being slow to issue\xa0instructions to HCM City, while the city authorities had\xa0raised the\xa0budget several times to support payment for\xa0the project.\n“I hope that by November everything will be settled,” she said.\nAccording to Konaka Tetsuo, JICA Việt Nam Office Chief Representative, the agency was working closely with Vietnamese partners to accelerate ODA projects in the country.\n“The disbursement performance of 2018 was slow\xa0due to payment delays in ongoing projects, HCM City Metro Line 1 for example. This is not only a problem for\xa0JICA and the Japanese government;\xa0it's a problem for\xa0other international organisations and sponsors that are experiencing the same situation,” he said.\n“Việt Nam’s economy has been growing and rapidly supported by the development of large-scale infrastructure projects which\xa0take a long time to finish, therefore\xa0if we are reluctant to push the implementation in the\xa0early stages,\xa0it will affect future economic growth. This is our biggest concern.”\nHowever, Konaka appreciated\xa0government and agency efforts to address these\xa0problems. In June 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Phạm Bình Minh\xa0chaired a\xa0meeting of the ODA Steering Committee to identify challenges and come up with solutions for ODA projects. Moreover, the decline in\xa0Việt Nam’s public debt\xa0and the Government’s increased focus on\xa0improving the\xa0efficiency of\xa0public spending had highlighted the need\xa0to improve conditions for ODA project\xa0implementation\n“Việt Nam should be careful not to excessively carry out public debt control\xa0as it might restrain the economy’s growth and negatively impact development projects,” he said.\nFrom April to September 2019, JICA’s total disbursement for ongoing projects in Việt Nam\xa0reached\xa0JPY8.8 billion ($80.87 million).\nIn the near future,\xa0the agency will also\xa0support Việt Nam’s long-term strategies and provide\xa0input for\xa0the Socio-Economic Development Strategy by 2030.\n“Japanese\xa0ODA policy to Việt Nam\xa0has\xa0to be adjusted to catch up with changes in\xa0the global economy and political landscape as well as Việt Nam’s rapid growth. JICA has piloted several new assistance projects in terms of elderly care in co-operation with World Bank, public-private-partnerships in infrastructure development, e-government and cybersecurity,” he said. — VNS",1
4960,'Why Emma isn’t the right ‘man’ for the job just yet',"IN LINE: Emma Hayes, manager of Chelsea Ladies is being considered for the job of managing the men’s team. AFP Photo\nBy Paul Kennedy\nI don’t know much about Emma Hayes other than what I’ve read about her in recent weeks.\nFor those of you as much in the dark as I was, she is the coach of Chelsea FC Women. And if you believe what you have read in the newspapers of late, she is in contention to take charge of the men’s team after the imminent departure of Maurizio Sarri.\nThe 42-year-old led Chelsea to third in the Women's Super League and to the semi-finals of the Women's Champions League this season.\nIn the previous season she won the double for Chelsea and during a spell coaching in America, won manager of the year.\nNot too shabby for sure, but in my mind, she has nowhere near the credentials required to take charge of the men’s first team and the reasons have got absolutely nothing to do with her sex.\nIn my career that this month topped the 30 year mark, I have been lucky enough to work for some great and talented people, a lot of them women.\nMy first news editor when I was a ‘wet behind the ears 18-year-old thought he knew it all trainee journalist’ was a woman. She quickly knocked the arrogance out of me and put me firmly in my place.\nI later worked for a woman who at the time was the youngster editor of a regional newspaper and she really knew her stuff, was determined, focused and super talented. Then in more recent years, the manager of a television station I worked at was up there with the best journalists I’ve ever known.\nAll women and all got their jobs through hard work, experience and climbing up the leadership ladder to get to the top. None of them, as far as I’m aware, were given the job purely on the basis of their sex.\nNot for one minute am I suggesting that if Hayes gets the job, it will only because of her gender because she is clearly an exceptionally talented football coach, but for me she is simply not ready.\nIn the future, five, 10, 15 or even 20 years from now, women will manage Premier League teams. But just not today at Chelsea and here’s why.\nFor Hayes to even be considered the right person for the job, she needs to take charge, and prove herself, in the male dominated sport at a lower level.\nLook at Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard as examples.\nBoth of them had amazing football careers and were nothing short of brilliant with a ball at their feet. Now the two of them have taken their first steps in management and they are doing it the right way.\nLampard and Gerrard both have legendary status at the clubs they made their names at, but after hanging up their boots neither of them considered immediately becoming the boss of Chelsea or Liverpool.\nBoth took the decision to ‘cut their teeth’ with lesser managerial positions at Derby County and Glasgow Rangers respectively.\nWhile Hayes has enjoyed success with Chelsea FC Women, she has never coached a professional men’s team at any level.\nLike Gerrard and Lampard have done, she needs experience at a lower league club where she not only needs to prove herself to the fans of that team, but also to the footballing world. All eyes will rightly or wrongly be focused on her.\nOnce she does, then sure, step up and move to a bigger club if the job is offered.\nBut right now, all the reasons to choose her to run Chelsea are wrong. And it would, in my opinion, be an insult to women’s rights if she is given the job just because the powers that be think it would be the PC thing to do.\nChelsea are a top team. This season they have qualified for the Champions League and will have played a Europa League final by the time you’re reading this.\nWhy they are ditching Sarri is beyond me, but as that seems to be a foregone conclusion, Chelsea will be soon looking elsewhere for a new boss.\nThey need a top manager, one with a proven track record of managing teams in the upper echelons of European football and I’m sorry Emma but at this moment in time, that’s not you. — VNS",3

But few tools were available to support their needs, while books in Braille are\xa0costly,” she said.\nWhile she was working, she realised that merely recording books was not the best solution because\xa0it required too much time and effort.\nAs a student with\xa0background in technology at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Trang believes there could be a big pivot with technology and disabilities.\nIn 2009, when she was a professor at HUST, Trang herself\xa0organised a project to record audiobooks for visually impaired people.\nThe wishes of the blind people she met were\xa0her motivation to start a 10-year journey working on a Vietnamese reader\xa0that features\xa0text-to-speech technology. She and her two colleagues\xa0later set up a company in 2018 and named it\xa0Vbee: Vietnamese – BE your Eyes.\nText-to-speech technology has actually been researched and used around the world for many years, and is widely applied in services such as consulting, customer interaction, smart homes and\xa0smart traffic.\nWhat makes Vbee stand out is that it is the first technology developed in Việt Nam for Vietnamese people, with Vietnamese language as the output voice, Trang said.\n“The characteristics of the\xa0Vietnamese language are complex with different accents\xa0and dialects, so it is much harder to apply the technology,” Trang said.\nThe desire to have an artificial voice with the same emotion and tone of a Vietnamese human voice is the difference that the Vbee team cares about.\n“It took us a lot of time to create a voice with an intonation that is attractive and close\xa0to the user, other than the regular reading tools that Google and Microsoft provide for the Vietnamese market,” she said.\nVbee\'s text-to-speech engine also features male and female accents from the North and South, and can be trained to learn a new language in four hours.\nIt was not an easy path for\xa0Trang and her co-workers, because the process of Vietnamese speech synthesis is a complex one.\n“We have to analyse\xa0components such as sentences, words, languages\xa0and phonemes, and\xa0identify the contextual and tonal characteristics of these components. Then we have to create a model for the duration, prosody\xa0and\xa0other acoustic parameters to generate\xa0the corresponding speech,” Trang said.\nTherefore, in addition to her\xa0knowledge of computer science, Trang also had to learn about speech processing and linguistics.\nKhúc Hải Vân, who was born blind, and an user of Vbee, said he loves\xa0the app.\n“I felt like a real person with a\xa0Vietnamese voice reading information and newspapers to me,” he said.\n“I hope Vbee will develop more useful applications\xa0that can support people like me,” he said.\nMore applications\nDuring the development of the tex-to-speech reader for the blind and visually impaired, Vbee’s leaders realised the potential of its\xa0text-to-speech engine (TTS engine)\xa0in other fields, said Hồ Minh Đức, co-founder of Vbee.\nOne of these applications is VADI, a ""virtual assistant"" for\xa0drivers.\nThe first is directions and traffic warnings. Information is collected and updated by a software development team, while people with the app can send in traffic updates themselves.\nThe second function featured on VADI is audio coverage of news and directions. Compared to similar applications, virtual assistance provides information in a natural human-like voice.\n“VADI\xa0has received very positive feedback from mobile users,” Đức said.\n“We look forward to contributing Vbee solutions using artificial intelligence to the market, helping businesses and users to have new solutions to better serve customers while saving more,” Đức\xa0said.\nTrang\xa0said although there are many text-to-speech products in the market, but with products that are tailor-made for Vietnamese people built from our TTS engine, she believed\xa0Vbee has a chance to stand out.\nIn order to apply research on a\xa0product, it takes a lot of time and effort, and she was proud that her team had\xa0overcome such periods to bring our\xa0product to the market.\nWith the advantage of experienced engineers in application research, products development, marketing and sales, Vbee is constantly updating its core products and adapting them to\xa0market needs.\n“Although there are large corporations providing the same service, the advantage\xa0Vbee has is that it can respond quickly and customise well to quickly fill the niche market,” Trang said.\nVbee will focus on completing its core solution and its smart call\xa0centre product.

It would be a surprise if they did not add another victory at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.\nMadrid have momentum and the next Clasico is at the Santiago Bernabeu too.\n""We are on a great run,"" said Sergio Ramos after the game on Wednesday.\n""The dynamic is strong.

Firstly, the communities in both areas showed real enthusiasm to participate; and secondly, they lived in areas suffering from difficult economic conditions, with limited access to the technologies required for agricultural production.\nStrengthening the capacity of stakeholders at central and local levels was a key aspect of the project.\nTo improve knowledge and the sharing of information on EbA measures and activities, the project organised a series of training workshops on mainstreaming them into the development planning process.\nThe project also focused on mainstreaming EbA into the climate-change-adaptation legal framework by supporting Government agencies. For example, the Department of Land Management will implement strategic environmental assessments to collect inputs for revising national land-use planning for 2016-2020; the Department for Planning Management will mainstream EbA and climate-change issues into developing the Planning Law; and the departments of Natural Resources and Environment of Hà Tĩnh and Quảng Bình will mainstream EbA into the updated Provincial Climate Change Action Plans to 2020.\nIvo Litzenberg, GIZ expert, said after three years of implementation, the two provinces had cleaner water resources and a healthier ecological system which was less vulnerable to climate-change impacts.\nLand erosion was also reduced, which helped local people produce rice crops on slopes, said Litzenberg.\nThe project had also helped local people understand the importance of production thast was less harmful to ecological systems, he said.\nMeanwhile, according to Phan Lam Sơn, deputy head of Hà Tĩnh Province’s Natural Resources and Environment Department, the project helped people become aware of main reasons for climate change, such as improper use of natural resources, waste discharge and polluting the environment.\nViệt Nam was assessed as one of nations worst affected by climate change.\nIf the sea water level rise by one metre, 40 per cent of land area in Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta, 11 per cent of land in the Hồng Delta, and 3 per cent of land areas along other coastal regions would be submerged.\nAbout 10-12 per cent of population would be affected and losses would account for 10 per cent of the country’s GDP, said experts.\nUnderstanding the consequences, the Government has issued several legal documents to deal with the situation, including a National Programme on Climate Change Preparedness, National Strategy on Climate Changes, National Strategy on Natural Calamity Reduction by 2020. — VNS'",4

Many firms operating in the domestic market face severe obstacles preventing their expansion, with the most pertinent being access to credit. Photo baoquocte.vn\nHÀ NỘI — Although progress has been realised by Việt Nam in recent years, the country is still unable to finance all the needs of its hungry productive sector, including private firms and SOEs.\nAccording to Taking Stock, the World Bank (WB)’s economic report on Việt Nam which was released on Tuesday, many firms operating in the domestic market face severe obstacles preventing expansion, with the most pertinent being access to credit.\n“Addressing the financing constraint of firms should receive the greatest attention from policy makers if Việt Nam wants to continue on its trajectory of rapid and inclusive growth and reach high-income status in the coming decades,” said Ousmane Dione, WB Country Director for Việt Nam.\nViệt Nam’s success over the past twenty years has been financed by a substantial increase in banking activities, as the ratio of credit to GDP jumped from 17 per cent in 1996 to more than 130 per cent in 2018, according to Jacques Morisset, WB’s Lead Economist and Programme Leader for Việt Nam, Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment.\nWhile this expansion has allowed the financing of productive activities, sustained long-term financing for many domestic private firms may be constrained moving forward.\nAt present, the financial market in Việt Nam has a limited range of long-term products due to excessive concentration around the banking sector, as stated in WB’s report.\nOther instruments (bonds and equities) accounted for approximately 40 per cent of total finance activities at the end of 2018, which reflects a rapid increase over the past few years, but still far from the amount reported in more advanced countries, not only globally but also regionally.\nIn Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, the size of the local bond market and of the market capitalisation of listed companies far exceeds the value of domestic credit provided by the banking sector.\nIn Việt Nam, bonds issued by the government represent close to half of the bond and equity markets, leaving a smaller share to private instruments.\nThe provision of long-term credit by banks to businesses has been held back by the short-term nature of their deposits (more than 80 per cent are one year or less), and by relatively high transaction costs due to the lack of information, lack of sufficient collateral, and a weak insolvency regime. This limits the extent to which the real sector can transact trade, insure, and manage risks and save or invest in the long term.\nThe report advocates for the development of well-functioning capital markets as a foundation for Việt Nam’s future prosperity.\nAs experienced by many countries in the world, including in East Asia, well-functioning debt and equity markets can help finance the domestic productive sector and complement lending from the banking system and diversify sources of financing. They also contribute to the resilience of the financial system as a whole by ensuring deeper liquidity and diversifying risks.\nWhile capital markets have expanded rapidly in Việt Nam over the past few years, they remain 1.5 to 2 times smaller than in Thailand and Malaysia respectively, and are largely dominated by a few big players, including the government.\nThe report suggests five areas policy makers should focus on to advance the development of the capital markets: modernising the legal and regulatory foundation, improving governance and information disclosure, broadening the investor base, developing innovative products and strengthening the government’s role in development of long-term finance.\nGrowth momentum\nAccording to WB’s report, Việt Nam’s economy has performed well in 2019, with GDP expanding by an estimated 6.8 per cent, public debt reduced by almost 8 percentage points of GDP since 2016, and a trade balance surplus for the fourth year in a row.\nGDP growth has continued to be driven by a strong external sector with exports increasing by about 8 per cent in 2019, nearly four times faster than the world average.\nThe country has also remained an attractive destination for foreign investors, with foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows averaging US$3 billion per month.\nPrivate consumption has emerged as an important contributor to GDP growth as the result of an expanding middle-income class and rising wages. Private firms also increased investment by 17 per cent during the same period.\nProspects for the short to medium term are goods as the WB forecasts a GDP growth of around 6.5 per cent over the next few years. Việt Nam’s economic fundamentals appear robust, and the government has built some fiscal space through its prudent fiscal policy.\nHowever, Việt Nam is not completely immune to external shocks as demonstrated by the gradual decline in export growth from 21 per cent to 8 per cent between 2017 and 2019. This decline has been even more pronounced in non-US markets, up by only 3.6 per cent during the first 11 months of 2019.\nGreenfield FDI has also slowed by about 30 per cent over the past two years, even if it has been compensated by an increase in mergers and acquisitions. — VNS'",2

The clinics will\xa0improve the quality of\xa0primary care for local people.”\n“Expanding covered healthcare services for insured patients will be\xa0good if the health fund has enough to cover the\xa0expenditures,” Hương said.\nHowever, she noted\xa0that the low cost for\xa0health insurance cards may not be\xa0sufficient for the national health insurance fund to cover.\xa0In addition, hospital fees have increased, she said.\nDr Nguyễn Minh Tùng, deputy head of the Bạc Liêu Province's Department of Health, said that the current cost to\xa0buy\xa0health insurance is equal to 4.5 per cent of basic wages for people employed in companies.\nUnder the regulations, the costs are staggered, with the fee\xa0for one person in a family higher than the fee\xa0for the other members of the family.\nHowever, Tùng said the\xa0costs should be increased to 20 per cent of the basic wage instead of 4.5 per cent.\nHương\xa0said this would not affect the\xa0poor and near-poor whose coverage\xa0would be\xa0paid by the local health insurance\xa0fund.\nLê Văn Khảm, director of the Health Insurance Department under the Ministry of Health, said the\xa0health insurance fund would\xa0ensure sufficient\xa0funds\xa0for\xa0insured patients’ medical examinations and treatment next year.\nPhạm Văn Toàn, deputy head of the insurance department, said the cost for buying health insurance, however, would\xa0have to increase in the future to achieve a balanced fund.\nOther issues discussed at the meeting concerned problems related to Việt Nam Social \xa0Security’s payments for insured patients to health facilities and independent health insurance assessments.\nDelegates said that an independent health insurance assessment agency\xa0separate from\xa0Việt Nam Social Security should be created\xa0to address this issue.\nAccording to the department, the number of insured people this year is 89.8 per cent of the population, compared to 71.3 per cent in 2014. The figure\xa0has already exceeded the Government's goal, which was to have\xa080 per cent of the population covered\xa0by the end of 2020.\xa0—\xa0VNS",1

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI - Party General Secretary, President Nguyễn Phú Trọng chaired a meeting of the Politburo yesterday to examine two projects to develop Huế and Buôn Ma Thuột cities.\nAfter listening to the Party Central Committee’s Economic Commission report on the key contents of two projects to develop the cities,\xa0the Party Central Committee Office’s presentation of opinions from agencies and opinions of Politburo members, Party General Secretary, President Trọng commended the Economic Commission for their work in preparing the projects, and said the Politburo basically approved the contents of the projects.\nThe Politburo said Thừa Thiên-Huế Province, home to Huế\xa0City, had made great efforts in renewing its thinking, optimising local\xa0advantages for development. Huế had been recognised as Việt Nam’s city of festivals, and ASEAN’s cultural and tourism city, while the complex of historical relics and landscapes had been preserved and upgraded. The poverty rate in the city had dropped significantly, and living conditions had improved.\nHowever, the province’s economic development had not matched potential, the Politburo said, pointing out that urban development was slow and infrastructure remained uneven. Urban planning and management\xa0failed to match the pace of development, while administrative reform, Party building and apparatus building work had not been up to snuff.\nTo develop\xa0Huế into a centrally-run city, the Politburo agreed to issue a resolution and asked the province’s Party organisation, administration and people to seriously implement it.\nFor Buôn Ma Thuột, the Politburo recognised the city’s efforts to tap its potential, resulting in economic growth. The city had become a first-level city of Đắk Lắk Province and was advancing in the direction of a modern city. Living conditions had improved, Party building work received attention, and the administrative apparatus was shifting toward streamlined organisation and\xa0efficient operation. National defence and security in the city had been ensured.\nAt the same time, the Politburo said the city’s economic growth had not been on par with its\xa0advantages. Buôn Ma Thuột had yet to become the central city of the Central Highlands region. Poverty reduction in the city was not sustainable, and there remained complications in security and social order in some areas. Local infrastructure was poor, and transport links with other provinces were slow to be upgraded.\nAiming to turn Buôn Ma Thuột into a green and smart city, the central hub of the Central Highlands and a growth pole of\xa0the Việt Nam-Laos-Cambodia development triangle, the Politburo issued a conclusion on building and developing Buôn Ma Thuột.\nAlso at the meeting, the Politburo made decisions on\xa0personnel matters and gave opinions on other issues.

Four smart registration kiosks have been installed to help people quickly carry out registration procedures without requiring the guidance of medical staff.\nBy simply inserting a medical insurance card or a flashcard supplied by the hospital to the infrared eye for identification, all patient information will be recorded.\nAfter patients choose the content of examination, the screen will immediately display the clinic they need to go for check-up and treatment.\nThese kiosks can check the validity of a health insurance card, capture patients' image with the front camera, and work closely with the hospital's overall management software to receive patients’ feedback\xa0on service quality.\nA patient is using smart registration kiosk at Eastern People Military Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo\nThe hospital has also implemented a range of other IT applications such as Room Access Control System, Disabled Robot Arm, and smart medical record cabinets.\nLê Thị Mến, a 72-year-old patient living in District 9’s Long Bình Ward, said she was surprised by the changes in the hospital over the years.\n“I am very interested in the machines that the hospital has been equipped with from the lobby to the toilet. Auto technology products are everywhere to give us instructions,” she said.\nExplaining about the information technology development at the hospital, Colonel Việt said the hospital was the first to be given financial autonomy in the country, so it faced various difficulties.\nOld and degraded facilities as well as a shortage of medical staff has reduced the quality of medical examination and treatment. Therefore, the number of patients coming to seek medical treatment was very few.\n“We were concerned about how to improve the hospital’s quality while maintaining the cost of treatment and the number of staff,” Việt said.\n“There was only one way - application of information technology to solve the problem.”\nThat’s when the Information Technology Centre was founded.\nThe hospital’s Board of Directors had constantly developed creative ideas to improve the medical examination and treatment process based on the actual operational needs of the hospital.\nA series of innovative ideas have been nominated by hospital staff and the centre helped turning them into high technology products.\nColonel Trịnh Ngọc Chí, deputy director of the hospital, said thanks to high-technology products, more people came to the hospital, rising from 700-800 patients in recent years to 1,800 patients at the peak per day.\nThe hospital’s management has also been easier. Chí said the board of directors would know what toilets needed to be cleaned and what areas were overloaded with patients via smart medical monitoring system.\nChí said the hospital would continue promoting the application of information technology in hospital management and operation, especially artificial intelligence to give the best services to patients. — VNS\n3D Printing technology is already being in use at\xa0Eastern People Military Hospital in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo",1

Photo quochoi.vn\nHÀ NỘI — Although the number of criminal cases has been decreasing, work is needed to rein in social crime, attendees heard at a meeting organised by the National Assembly (NA)’s Judicial Committee held in Hà Nội yesterday.\nA total of 14,228 cases relating to economic management have been recorded so far this year, a decrease of 11 per cent over last year’s figure, Lieutenant General Lê Quý Vương, Deputy Minister of Public Security said while delivering a government report on crime prevention and combat for 2019.\nDuring the period, competent forces solved 33,470 criminal cases or 84.2 per cent of the total cases. About 2,167 organised crimes had been discovered and 137 victims of human trafficking had been rescued.\n“The investigation of cases under the direction of the Central Steering Committee on Anti-Corruption has been accelerated to meet the schedule,” Vương said.\n“Difficulties in asset evaluation have been solved as well as assessment of evidence, identifying crimes and recovering assets.”\nHowever, despite a decline in the number of criminal cases, an increase in complicated crimes and rampant violations in land planning, management and use have become a new challenge for law enforcement across the country, Vương said.\nAccording to Vương, the number of murders has increased. Many murders or intentional attacks were carried out by people with mental illness or those affected by the use of drugs, causing concern among the public. New methods of human trafficking have been recorded, including surrogacy or foetus trafficking.\nEconomic crimes and corruption have become more sophisticated and occurred in many sectors, with the use of high technology to dodge tax or lengthen toll collection at Build-Operate-Transfer booths.\nPetty corruption in settling administrative procedures still took place in many localities, causing outrage for residents and enterprises.\nViolations relating to land planning, use and management were also common, he said, saying it was the main reason leading to long-standing disputes.\nWhile agreeing with the government’s report, NA deputies pointed out shortcomings in crime prevention and combat and made proposals to increase the effectiveness of the work in the future.\nNguyễn Duy Hữu, a member of the NA’s Judicial Committee, proposed the Government strengthen the handling of violations of environmental laws. Although this kind of crime left long-term consequences and took a lot of time to recover, the criminal penalty was far too lenient. Most of the cases only received administrative punishments.\nHoàng Văn Hùng, an NA deputy, said although traffic accidents had declined in the number of cases, injuries and deaths, about 22 people died each day on average.\nThe deputy suggested the government set forth preventive solutions.\nThe punishments for violations relating to traffic safety regulations should be tightened, he said.\nMany NA deputies proposed that measures to enhance the competence of State management, inspection work in construction, commerce and information and technology to restrict violations as well as detect and strictly deal with crimes in these fields.

Natural disasters have contributed to destruction of the environment, living conditions, and socio-economic activities, he said.\nReports from the ministry’s Water Resource Directorate show that natural disasters in recent years have resulted in the deaths of 300 people and caused losses of roughly US$900 million annually, accounting for 1.5 per cent of the country’s GDP.\nNatural disaster prevention measures have shown good results in reducing loss of life and property. The average number of dead or missing, which reached an annual average of 478 people between 2006 and 2011, has decreased to 226 between 2012 and 2015. Most of the recent tropical storms have not led to deaths at sea.\nHowever, climate change has been extreme and unpredictable. Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Hoàng Văn Thắng, said unsustainable socio-economic development activities, such as deforestation and illegal sand mining, have contributed to the negative effects of natural disasters.\nIn recent years, extreme natural disasters such as super storms, typhoons in the East Sea, droughts, prolonged salinity intrusion, torrential floods and riverside landslides have affected lives and agricultural production, especially in coastal and mountainous areas.\nTherefore, Thắng said, agricultural cultivation must be linked to the protection of ecological systems and sustainable development.\nIn 2015, Việt Nam joined the Paris Agreement Accord with roughly 200 other countries to begin implementing national plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe ministry has set up an action programme to deal with climate change in the period of 2016-20, targeting reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent every ten years.\nFor cultivation, the ministry has targeted effective rice cultivation in response to climate change and development of drought or saline-resistant plants. For animal husbandry, the ministry is planning a switch from the small-scale animal farms to bio-safety farms. For forestry, it will keep implementing the payment programmes for forest environmental services and boosting the management of irrigation systems and water use, he said.\nAccording to the Crop Prospects and Food Situation report released by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Việt Nam is expected to be the world’s fifth largest rice producer in 2017, with an average yield of 28.2 million tonnes annually. The FAO forecast that the biggest rice producer this year will be China with 142.3 million tonnes, followed by India with 110.4 million tonnes, Indonesia and Bangladesh.\nCrop diversification solution\nCrop diversification is an effective measure to help agriculture become more climate resilient in Việt Nam and other Mekong countries, experts told the Việt Nam News on the sidelines of a conference on Thursday in Hòa Bình Province.\nThe conference was designed to discuss with community and social organisations ways to facilitate climate resilience of agriculture and forestry in the Mekong Subregion.\nVietnamese farmers, many of whom rely on a sole agro-product, are highly vulnerable to extreme weather events. “Producing a variety of crop and other agro-products in just one farm would help reduce both climate risk and the risk stemming from market fluctuation,” said Đỗ Trọng Hoàn from the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF).\nHoàn said the solution was particularly suitable for mountainous regions where monoculture is often the tradition, citing an ICRAF project in the northwestern mountain region that helps farming households combine growing agricultural and forestry products.\n“Farmers can both grow grass as feed for animal husbandry, corn, timber and orchards,” he said, explaining that this would help them reap economic benefits and lessen the pressure on the environment due to deforestation and land degeneration.\nPromoting agricultural diversification and mixed farming systems is also an objective of an on-going project in Laos’ Saravan Province to adapt to climate change, said Hongnapha Phommabouth, a representative of the Vientiane-based Green Community Development Association (GCDA).\nLike other countries in the region, climate change has hit the land-locked Southeast Asian country in recent years with often-occurring drought and flood. The frequent drought resulted in low yields for farmers in the rural areas of Saravan Province who used to grow only rice.\n“The GCDA project has helped them shift from rice to bamboo, and in the upcoming second phase of the project, we will ask them to combine it with growing organic vegetables and raising fish,” Phommabouth said.\nYadana, director of Myanmar’s Braveheart Foundation, said the Myanmar government was also introducing the crop diversification system to help farmers increase yields and incomes.\nNguyễn Đức Tố Lưu from Pan Nature agreed that crop diversification is part of the solution, but said it was more suitable for large-scale farming. “Small-scale agriculture production makes it difficult for farmers to cope with the impacts of climate change,” he said. “That’s why farmers should come together to form a community for coordinated activities.”\nLưu added that there is no single solution for all regions in response to climate change. Solutions differ depending on the natural and socio-economic conditions of each region.\nAccording to Lưu, one of the major challenges was the lack of awareness by farmers and local authorities on climate change.\nIn addition, rigid socio-economic targets set by higher authorities like district or provincial authorities, mostly focussed on quantity rather than long-lasting solutions, also discourage farmers and commune authorities from applying new climate-resilient methods. — VNS'",4

2066,'Vietnam’s first female billionaire inspires younger generations to reach for the stars',"'Billionaire Nguyễn Thị Phương Thảo\nMost Vietnamese might assume that the country’s first female billionaire would be standoffish and difficult to know. But Nguyễn Thị Phương Thảo, who is one of 25 women on Forbes’ 2019 Asia’s Power Businesswomen’s list, is admired for her friendly manner and desire to support and inspire younger generations.\nBorn in Hanoi in 1970, Thảo, CEO and president of Vietjet Air, is known in Southeast Asia as a powerful female leader with internationally renowned achievements in the aviation sector.\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in finance and credit and a PhD in economics from universities in Russia, Thảo began trading commodities in Eastern Europe and Asia.\nWhile working as a trader, Thảo predicted that demand for air travel would rise dramatically in Vietnam. In 2011, she\xa0launched the\xa0budget airline VietJet Air\xa0and\xa0took it public in February 2017. Since its launch, the airline has been a roaring success, and has helped put air travel within the reach of millions of Vietnamese.\nAs the only woman to have started and run her own commercial airline, Thảo epitomises the values of the “Powerful Businesswoman” who defies stereotypes and breaks barriers.\nBesides her renown in the aviation sector, Thảo, with her knowledge and enthusiasm in finance and banking, has greatly contributed to improving HDBank, a private joint-stock commercial bank, where she is the permanent vice chairwoman of the board of directors.\nAs a key shareholder of the bank, she was instrumental in helping HDBank become one of the top 40 banks in Vietnam. Prior to her work with HDBank, she was one of the founders and leaders of Techcombank and VIB.\nHer stunning achievements are no surprise to those who have known her since she was a student in Russia.\n“Our young years are filled with memories about a lovely girl with a sweet Hanoi accent and an energetic singing voice that kept the cold away in Russia through the song ‘A Million Roses’,” a businessman recalls.\n“At that time, we all could see that she had a talent in business, which would help her career in the future. Years later, we were not surprised to see that she began work at Techcombank and VIB, and then had great achievements at HDBank,” he adds.\nFor Thảo, who was also on Forbes’ Asia’s Power Businesswomen 2016 list, “nothing is impossible”.\n“I have always aimed big and done big deals. I have never done anything on a small scale. When people were trading one container of goods, I was already trading hundreds of containers,” she says.\nInspiring leader\nDespite her great achievements and fortune, Thảo is modest and easygoing, especially with young students and the poor. She\xa0often stops to chat with customers and spends a great deal of time and money on charity activities.\nWith a desire to create connections between owners of large enterprises and younger generations, Thảo often meets and shares experiences with\xa0young people to send the message that they play a vital role in the bright future of Vietnam.\nShe also devotes time to many charity programmes such as “Wings of Love”, which each year offers scholarships to\xa0poor students\xa0and gives clothes to children living in remote areas.\nFor the past 10 years, Thảo has been a sponsor of the HDBank International Chess Tournament where the world has been introduced to top Vietnamese players such as Quang Liêm and Trường Sơn. She is also a sponsor of HDBank Chess Cup and the HDBankFutsal tournament, which promotes the physical fitness of Vietnamese youth.\nThrough her frequent meetings and visits with local and international students, she continues to support and nurture future generations of leaders. At meetings with Thảo at HDBank and Vietjet, many international students at Imperial College London, Harvard Business School, and Tuck School of Business at\xa0Dartmouth College have all expressed their admiration of Vietnam, calling it “an Asian dragon that has awakened”.\nWhat international students admire most is Việt Nam’s culture and dynamic society, its creativity, and its breakthroughs in private businesses in an emerging Asian economy, Thảo says.\nWith a staff of nearly 30,000 people at Vietjet, HDBank and HDSaison, Thảo is viewed\xa0as a “captain” whose philosophy of business is trusted and admired by her employees.\nHer lasting philosophy is to create jobs and employee happiness and advancement, as well as better serve customers, contribute to the State budget, and develop the economy to achieve a civilised and prosperous community.\nThảo also takes seriously her corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, with her desire to contribute to charities and make a better community. She has organised, for example, a series of praying ceremonies and has built historical monuments that follow the motto “when you\xa0drink water, think of its\xa0source”, to pay tribute to the people who have sacrificed their lives for the homeland during wartime.— VNS\nNguyễn Thị Phương Thảo, CEO of Vietjet Air, Viet Nam’s first self-made female billionaire, is well known in Asia and has been named one of 25 women on Forbes’ list of Asia’s Power Businesswomen 2019.'",1

The Vietnamese Party and State had exercised restraint and a policy of peace and friendship but the regime escalated their invasion activities forcing Viet Nam into a defensive war.\nOn January 7, 1979, the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation with the support of the people, and the great and timely help of Vietnamese volunteer soldiers overthrew the Khmer Rouge genocidal regime, bringing a bright future to the country.\n“The victory was meaningful as we could not only protect our country’s territory, but also save Cambodian people from the genocidal regime, helping them gain back the right to live, to step into a period of real freedom,” Nghĩa said.\nMajor General\xa0Nguyễn Hoàng Nhiên,\xa0Director\xa0of the\xa0Việt Nam Institute of\xa0Military History, said the fight against Pol Pot was a necessary and just defence move of the Vietnamese army.\n“Many people had different views on this matter, but many also approved of Viêt Nam’s action and condemned the genocidal regime,” Nhiên said.\nHe said the matter was again confirmed by the convictions given out by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia for the former leaders of the Cambodia’s Democratic Kampuchea.--VNS'",0

The draft law revision was submitted to the National Assembly (NA)’s Standing Committee on Wednesday for a final review before it was due to be voted through by the NA on November 20.\nThe ministry – which was in charge of drafting revisions to the code – decided to pick Family Day following suggestions by NA deputies to add a public holiday\xa0to the calendar.

The War Invalids and Martyrs’ Day July 27 was initially its first pick, though objections from some NA deputies eventually made the ministry withdraw its proposal.\nViệt Nam currently has 10 official public holidays.\nIn its latest report on the draft amended labour law, the ministry kept its proposal to raise the retirement age to 62 for\xa0men and 60 for women.\nIt means female labourers will have to work five more years before they can retire and receive pensions compared to the current age cap of 55.\nFor men, it is an increase of two years over the prevailing retirement age of 60.\nThe Government, however, said that it would conduct research on 1,810 jobs and occupations which were physically demanding or ones that posed health risks and dangers to the workers, which might possibly subject them to\xa0an earlier retirement.\nWhile the draft law encourages companies to let employees work less than 48 hours a week, it also set a ceiling for overtime of no more than 40 hours a month. — VNS'",1

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — According to experts at a\xa0forum on water resource management yesterday, Việt Nam is facing a severe water crisis.\nIn a report by the International Water Association, a country with inland surface water output of less than 4,000 cu.m per head per annum can be considered as lacking water.\nViệt Nam has an average surface water volume of about 830 billion cubic metres per year, but two thirds of that figure comes from other countries. With a population of over 90 million, each Vietnamese citizen receives only 3,370 cu.m of water per year.\nHighlighting the importance of water resources and the role of civil societies in water resource management at a forum held yesterday, experts raised concerns on issues related to water resource reduction, water pollution, misuse and mismanagement.\nĐào Trọng Tứ, vice chairman of Việt Nam Irrigation and Drainage Association and head of Việt Nam Rivers Network, said that the construction of hydropower plants along rivers was blocking the flow, causing water shortages for people living downstream.\nOn the 100-km-long Mã River, there were five hydropower plants, Tứ said.\nIn Hà Nội alone, at least six rivers are polluted, he said, adding that untreated wastewater from households, industrial zones or trade villages was flooding into the rivers and impacting people’s health.\n“Vietnamese people usually used groundwater for drinking, but now, the groundwater resources are polluted and exhausted because of improper management,” he said, adding that efforts were needed to tackle the problem.\n“Việt Nam has a relatively good legal framework on water resources, but the enforcement is not as good as it should be,” he said.\nNguyễn Hồng Khanh, head of the Irrigation Works Management Department under the agriculture ministry said that impacts of climate change and extreme weather were also affecting the country’s water resources.\nThis year, the volume stored in Việt Nam’s reservoirs was comparable to previous years, but still would not stretch for the spring-summer crop season.\n“At least three record heat waves hit the country this year, with the longest lasting from June 3 to July 1. The average temperature rose to 40 degrees Celsius, with low humidity and hot wind from Laos,” he said.\n“Freshwater is a limited resource, playing an important role in life and socio-economic development, but it is very susceptible to changes in weather,” he said.\nTrần Tuấn, Director of Hà Nôi-based Research and Training Centre for Community Development said that water shortages occurred when people did not protect and use water resources properly.\n“It’s necessary to optimise the exploitation and use of water,” he said, adding that the Government’s role in orientation is paramount.\nThe Government has made efforts to protect water resources but some industries hindered results, he said, emphasising that it was important to prevent activities that diminish water resources, by imposing heavier taxes, for example.\nKhanh, from the Irrigation Works Management Department, said it was very important for policy makers to consult people, organisations and civil society so that they could collect diversified points of view, which could help produce effective policies.\n“This goes for water resource policies too,” he said.\nThe forum yesterday was co-organised by Đại biểu nhân dân online newspaper and non-governmental organisations Information Centre under the Việt Nam Union of Science and Technology Associations. — VNS'",4

Besides, it had handled sea-related differences by peaceful means and in line with international law, including the UNCLOS.\nUnder this policy, Việt Nam had held negotiations on and signed treaties on maritime delimitation with neighbouring countries like Thailand, China and Indonesia. It was also promoting talks on the delimitation of the sea area beyond the mouth of the Gulf of Tonkin with China, the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone with Indonesia, and the maritime delimitation with other neighbours, he said.\nDũng added the country had stepped up maritime co-operation in a diverse and substantive manner so as to optimise the sea’s potential and deal with emerging challenges and create a peaceful and stable environment in the East Sea.\nHe pointed out many recent complex developments in the East Sea that seriously violated the rights of Việt Nam and other regional countries which are stipulated in the UNCLOS.\nViệt Nam had persistently respected and complied with the UNCLOS, respected diplomatic and legal processes, and not wrongly interpreted or intentionally played down the significance and role of the convention, he stressed, adding that when there are differences relating to the interpretation and application of the UNCLOS, concerned parties need to solve those issues via negotiations or other peaceful measures in line with international law, including the UNCLOS.\n""When differences haven’t been resolved, relevant parties need to respect and fully implement the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC); exercise self-restraint; not take unilateral actions that may complicate the situation, elevate tensions or jeopardise regional peace and stability; and take part in negotiations in a constructive\xa0manner\xa0to soon finalise an efficient and practical Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC)\xa0in conformity with the UNCLOS,"" Dũng said. — VNS'",0

Rhinos, serow, helmeted hornbill, gaur, leopards and turtles round out the list of endangered species that are openly sold in a region that is Ground Zero in the illegal wildlife trade.\nThe list is based on surveys by WWF of illegal wildlife markets, shops and restaurants, and reports from TRAFFIC and the Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network. The listed species are those most often seen for sale in a criminal trade that threatens wildlife across Asia and into Africa.\nThe report also pointed out African rhinos are being poached at the rate of three per day to feed the demand for their horns in places such as Việt Nam, where the horns are mostly consumed as a symbol of wealth, as well as for traditional medicine.\nAnother species covered in keratin is the pangolin, which is in high demand in China and Việt Nam for its scales and is considered the most trafficked animal in the world. — VNS'",4

The pork\xa0will be sold under the city’s price stabilisation programme.\nIn addition, Co.opmart, Co.opXtra and Co.opFood are also selling chilled pork products using European production technologies and herb-fed pork to offer customers more choice, he said.\nSaigon Co.op has also prepared a large volume of chicken and duck meat, and fishery and aquaculture products to serve customers during\xa0the peak shopping season.\nLive pig prices up\nVũ Văn Tư, director of Trường Giang Phát One Member Co., Ltd in Đồng Nai Province’s Biên Hòa City, said the price of live pigs has fluctuated strongly, with prices in the afternoon higher than in the morning.\nHe attributed the situation to a lower supply due to the impact of African swine fever\xa0and a higher demand for pork since businesses have sped up production of pork-based products for\xa0Tết.\nBut while large pig breeding companies offered live pig price at VNĐ79,000 (US$3.4) per kilo, in some areas traders had to pay up to VNĐ90,000 ($3.88) to buy pig from farmers, he said.\nAccording to enterprises, large pig breeding farms are offering good prices to large customers who regularly buy their pigs at a large quantity, while small breeding farms and household farmers expect\xa0that pig prices will increase\xa0in the near Tết, so they have reduced selling the pigs, pushing up prices.\nTứ said after the peak production for Tết ends, the price gap between large breeding companies and the market price will shrink because such a high price will affect consumption demand.\nThiệu from Sagrifood said\xa0that the current high price of live pigs was\xa0only temporary since the price would affect consumption\xa0and live pig prices would\xa0fall soon.\nRepresentatives of some wholesales markets in the city said the volume of pork in\xa0the market\xa0has fallen\xa0significantly,\xa0while the volume of fresh fishery and aquaculture products have increased compared to last month. — VNS'",2

The water was now deemed safe for consumption and other living activities, the company said.\nTap water was\xa0turned back on the night of October 16.\nNo response plan\nVIWASUPCO finally broke its silence with the press release since its deputy director appeared at\xa0a press conference on October 17. He there refused, twice, to send an apology to affected residents, saying\xa0“everyone\xa0should wait till the authorities reach a conclusion (on the investigation).”\nThe worst water crisis Hà Nội has\xa0seen in decades began early this month when several households using tap water supplied by the Đà River water plant reported a strangely irritating smell like melted plastic or oil in the water.\nTests conducted by authorities came back with bad news. Styrene, an organic compound often used to produce plastic and might cause cancer after\xa0long exposure, was found in the water at levels between 1.3 and 3.65 times higher than those permitted.\nIn response, the city immediately issued a warning telling\xa0people living across eight districts to refrain from using\xa0tap water. It was estimated that at least 700,000 people in the southwest of Hà Nội were affected by\xa0the unprecedented crisis.\nAuthorities also discovered that\xa010cu.m\xa0of waste oil had been illegally dumped near\xa0the plant and had made\xa0its way into the sole reservoir and polluted the whole plant.\nVIWASUPCO continued\xa0pumping the toxic water to the city despite being well aware of the pollution.\nPolice have already arrested three people who allegedly disposed of the waste oil.\nAccording to the press release, the company had to send its own staff as well as hire more workers and the SOS Environment company to clean up the pollution. They collected scum oil using absorbing buoys and poured\xa0charcoal into a\xa03km channel running into the reservoir, as well as dredging the whole area.\nVIWASUPCO also flushed its pipe network and water tanks at the plant as well as at the affected households.\nThe company said that it had “failed to have an appropriate response plan in place for\xa0a human-made emergency” at the time of the\xa0incident, which “resulted in confusion in first response, and interrupted the lives of people in the southwestern part of Hà Nội”.\nIt committed to build response plans for all types of emergencies\xa0and to recruit and train staff in order to ensure a stable supply of standard quality water to\xa0residents.\xa0— VNS",1

4407,'A chance to prove their worth',"YOUNG GUN: Chelsea's Mason Mount (right) celebrates with teammate Olivier Giroud. — AFP Photo\nChelsea’s comfortable victory against Wolves last weekend was extremely significant for a number of reasons.\nFirstly, it was a much needed away win in what has been an average start to the season for Frank Lampard’s team.\nBut what may have gone unnoticed were the scorers in that match, Tammy Abraham (3), Fikayo Tomori and Mason Mount, are all 21-years-old or younger.\nThis season in the Premier League, Chelsea have scored 11 goals so far, all of them by players under the age of 21, and all English – although Abraham is eligible to play for Nigeria.\nThe cynical among you may point out that really and truly, this isn’t a case of Lampard introducing youth into the first team, but more a case of he didn’t really have much choice.\nA transfer ban has stifled the normally big spenders and Frank hasn’t had any other option but to start with a younger team.\nDuring the BBC’s Match of the Day programme on Saturday evening, it was pointed out that in the past, one pundit famously said a youthful Manchester United wouldn’t ‘win anything with kids’ and he was proven wrong.\nBut let’s face facts here, the chances of Chelsea winning the league this season are less than zero, but maybe the transfer ban could be a blessing in disguise.\nIt is pretty obvious that Abraham, Tomori and Mount are all decent players but would they be in the starting 11 if Roman Abramovich had been allowed to spend his cash? Probably not.\nFrank’s had his hand forced, and so far, things are working out well and the young trio are showing no signs of feeling the pressure.\nHe should know a thing or two about that. He was part of a very young midfield at West Ham alongside Michael Carrick and Joe Cole.\nThough they didn’t win anything at Upton Park, the three of them all went on to much bigger and better things.\nThat midfield trio, with a youthful Rio Ferdinand playing behind them in the back four, were the heartbeat of West Ham at the time.\nThey went on to forge amazing club careers, Carrick and Ferdinand at Manchester United and Lampard and Cole at Chelsea.\nBetween the four of them, they have 17 Premier League winners’ medals.\nIf they had started their careers at the clubs they finished with, they may not have been given such a chance. West Ham under Harry Redknapp was the perfect place to begin.\nWill Chelsea’s young trio collect a similar haul in the game? Only time will tell. But at least for now, due to circumstances beyond their control, they are getting a chance.\nThe west Londoners have been big spenders since Abramovich took over, but now for the first time in a long time, they have to lean a little bit more on their youngsters.\nAnd it’s so far, so good.\nSure, there have been a few hiccups and this week’s home defeat in the Champions League against Valencia didn’t help, but I’ll stick with my original pre-season prediction that Chelsea will finish in fourth place.\nOn Sunday they play Liverpool at home, and that will be a real test for the young team.\nMason Mount limped off on Tuesday night, so he may not be available to play, but as for their other two starlets, a game against the current league leaders is a chance to show their mettle. — VNS",3

3566,'Plastics industry confident of achieving export target of $3.2b',"'Plastic products at a supermarket in HCM City. The plastic industry is very hopeful of meeting this year’s export target of $3.2 billion. — VNS Photo Xuân Hương\nHCM CITY — With solid growth in shipments, the plastics industry will surely meet its full-year export target of US$3.2 billion, according to the Việt Nam Plastics Association.\nSpeaking to Việt Nam News, Hồ Đức Lam, its chairman, said exports saw impressive growth last year to $3 billion while overall revenues jumped to $12 billion.\n“Exports in the first nine months of the year increased by 5 per cent and will continue to enjoy good growth in the rest months of the year.\n“The US-China trade war has offered opportunities to Vietnamese plastics firms to boost exports.”\nAccording to the association, exports go to more than 150 countries and territories, with the US and Japan being key markets.\nIn the domestic market, some industries, even those such as aerospace which use high-grade materials, are shifting to plastic products, and as a result sales have grown rapidly, Lam said.\nLocally-made plastic\xa0products are confidently taking on imports from Thailand, Malaysia and China, he said.\nThe industry has stepped up investment in technology and facilities and co-operation with foreign partners to make more products meeting local and export demand, he said.\nBut it also faces challenges, he said.\n“Many countries have put up safeguard measures to protect their domestic plastics industry from imports. Some producers have shifted their production to Việt Nam, which requires the Government and business groups to ensure transparency in the manufacture of products in Việt Nam, and accurate certificates of origin.\n“Another challenge is that we are importing 60-70 per cent of raw materials.\n“The world commodities market has been volatile, affecting the industry. Besides, the Government plans to raise import tariffs on some raw materials, which will affect producers.”\nForeign investors are enamoured of Việt Nam’s plastics industry due to its high growth rates, increasing exports and enormous potential, he said.\n“But huge investments by foreign investors also pose challenges to Vietnamese firms since they have to face fierce competition, requiring them to transform and invest in new technologies to improve productivity and cut costs.”\nAccording to the Việt Nam Plastics Industry Development Plan for the period until 2020 approved by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the industry is expected to achieve average annual growth of 17.5 per cent in 2011-20.\nThe industry also targets to become a key sector by 2020 with a high and sustainable growth rate.\nIt seeks to gradually build a complete supply chain encompassing all stages from raw material production to final processing, increasing the ratio of locally sourced raw materials to reduce reliance on imports.\nPhạm Thị Huệ Anh of the University of Economics - Technology for Industries said plastics firms need to further improve designs, models and quality, restructure, invest in advanced technologies, develop local sources of raw materials and cut costs to improve competitiveness.\nThe Government needs to have policies to encourage investment in raw material production and develop supporting industries, she added.\nThe plastics industry has nearly 4,000 enterprises, most of them small and medium-sized ones. — VNS'",2

Of the figure, nearly 10,000ha are planted under Vietnamese good agricultural practices (VietGAP) standards and more than 260ha under GlobalGAP standards.\nHowever, the country’s dragon fruit production is largely unsustainable since many farms are small-scale and there is a lack of co-operation among stakeholders and seedling management.\nMost dragon fruit growing areas are scattered and few of them use advanced farming techniques. In addition, the quality of seedlings has not been managed properly.\nEvaluation of growing areas also needs to be done to identify the variety of dragon fruit suited to each area.\nMai Thành Phụng of the HCM City-based Tropical Agricultural Research and Consultancy Center said that localities should set up zoned growing areas and improve management to ensure sustainability.\nFarmers should also establish co-operatives and work together to reach quality standards, and involve other stakeholders so that buyers and outlets can be guaranteed.\nMore trade promotions and favourable conditions for investment in dried dragon fruit and dragon fruit wine are needed as well.\nUp to 80 per cent of the country’s dragon fruit is sold fresh and unprocessed.\nThe country produces an annual output of 660,000 tonnes of dragon fruit. — VNS'",1

5788,"'Bắc Giang favours forestry firms, ignores residents: investigators'","'A forest in Yên Thế District in the northern province of Bắc Giang. The province has discovered a number of violations related to forest protection and management. — Photo baobacgiang.com.vn\nViet Nam News\nBẮC GIANG — A move by the northern province of Bắc Giang’s administration to lease 1877ha of forest land to a State-owned forestry company with a track record of violations and mismanagement has evoked strong protests from local residents.\nThe protestors said they were native caretakers who had been managing parts of it for decades and their livelihoods were threatened by this move.\nMore than 600 households from 10 communes and townships of Yên Thế District in Bắc Giang Province protested against a decision issued in January 2015 by Vice Chairman of the provincial People’s Committee, Lại Thanh Sơn, to lease the land to Yên Thế Forestry One-member Ltd Company.\n“We are native residents. Our livelihood is the forest. We are the ones who have been carrying out the State and Party’s policy on ’Greening the Barren Hills.’\n“Now, if the province’s People’s Committee takes away our forestland and gives it to the Yên Thế company, what will we live on?” asked Bùi Thị Hoè, a resident of Tam Hiệp Commune.\nWhile the area leased to the company and those managed by the locals seems to be clearly delineated on a map, it is harder to distinguish this on the ground.\nVũ Thanh Hiền, head of Centre of Research and Development in Upland Areas (CERDA), a Vietnamese NGO, said dispute was “unavoidable” in this case since many local residents say their families has been living off these lands for four generations. It is natural that they feel their legitimate rights are being stripped off, he said.\nA Vietnam News Agency report has noted that the overlapping of forestland leased out to State forest enterprises (SFEs) and those managed by natives are not a rare occurrence across the country.\nResponding to local people’s concerns, Chairman of Bắc Giang Province’s People’s Committee Nguyễn Văn Linh had in late July this year, signed a decision to form a working group – headed by Ngô Văn Xuyên, deputy director of the provincial environmental department – to “thoroughly investigate the management and use of forestry land in the Yên Thế District.”\nSeries of wrongdoings\nTwo months later, the working group delivered its report to the chairman of the provincial People’s Committee, pointing out a series of wrongdoings committed by the Yên Thế District People’s Committee and the Yên Thế Forestry One-member Ltd Company.\nAccording to the report, the company handed 246.8ha of forestry land then under its management and use to local-level governments. However, large portions of this 246.8ha are plantations that have not been harvested, making it difficult for commune administrations to proceed with their plans.\nIn previous years, the handing over of forestland completely failed to refer to cadastral records, the report said, adding that the work was done purely “on paper,” without any field trips to verify the information. This has led to the current ambiguity over forest land allocated to the company and the land that natives have been managing.\nThe report also said that because due process was not followed, some communes that were supposed to receive forest land were unable to determine how much land they’ve got.\nThe working group also pointed out the Yên Thế company has demonstrated “negligence” in its forest management tasks for a long time.\nIt has been seen that after the company exploits the resources of a natural forest, including its trees, it has failed to designate it as an off limits area to allow re-growth. This, in turn, has allowed locals to further destroy tracts of natural forest to grow crops.\nThe report also criticised Yên Thế District authorities for negligence in forest management, especially its failure to maintain accurate maps and update cadastral records.\nThe group recommended that the disputes with local resident be settled clearly in line with existing regulations.\nResidents’ rights ignored\nMany protestors have noted that in all of the State’s afforestation programmes, like the “Greening the Barren Hills” Programme 327, the World Food Organisation-supported PAM afforestation programme, or the 5-million-hectare reforestation Programme 661, the guiding principle has been to make locals the main protectors of the forest, and that in this process, they use the natural resources sustainably.\nIn addition, forest use permits were to be issued to households to ensure stability and evoke a natural desire to protect the source of their livelihood, the forest.\nBut the perception that this guiding principle has been ignored to favour companies is further strengthened by another recent decision by Bắc Giang Province to lease 1,400ha of forestland to the Trường Lộc Company for a mind-boggling VNĐ43.2 (less than US$0.002) per sq.m per year, not to mention a land lease waiver for 15 years, the Tài nguyên & Môi trường (Natural Resources and Environment) newspaper reported.\nIn light of this information, the public have raised concerns about major wrongdoings in the implementation of the forestland allocation policies and policies that trample the rights of residents of remote and disadvantaged areas who directly live off the forests. — VNS'",4

3086,'Tourism helps more airlines take off in Vietnam',"Domestic tourists increase\xa0from 20 million in 2009 to 80 million in 2019. — Photo dulichvietnam.com\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam's booming tourism industry has led to growth in the aviation sector, with more routes and airlines creating a new landscape for the industry.\nAccording to data from the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT), the number of international tourists visiting the country grew from 4.25 million in 2008 to 15.5 million in 2018, while the number of domestic tourists rose from 20 million in 2009 to 80 million this year. In the last ten years, total revenue from tourism has climbed more than ten times from VNĐ60 trillion (US$2.59 billion) in 2008 to VNĐ620 trillion in 2018, accounting for 7.8 per cent of the country's GDP.\nViệt Nam's aviation market had developed strongly during that time, with average revenue growth of 17.4 per cent, two times higher than the 7.9 per cent average in Asia, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\nData from the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam shows that Vietnamese airlines transported 50 million passengers last year, five times higher than in 2008. By December 2018, Vietnam's aviation market had 68 foreign airlines from 25 countries and territories, along with five domestic airlines.\nOver the past decade, the number of aircraft has from 60 aircraft to 192 aircraft. The flight network has been expanded about three times with 60 domestic and 130 international routes currently operating. Together with major airports Tân Sơn Nhất, Nội Bài and Đà Nẵng, other airports such as Vân Đồn, Cát Bi, Cần Thơ, Liên Khương and Phú Quốc have contributed to the development.\nIn the latest report, IATA also ranked Vietnam the fifth fastest growing aviation market in the world and the fastest in Southeast Asia, and forecast average growth of nearly 14 per cent in the next five years, reaching 150 million passengers by 2035.\nPotential is still huge\nGiven the geographical area and a population of 100 million, there is still room for the local aviation to grow. Currently, Việt Nam has five airlines but only Vietnam Airlines, Jetstar Pacific, Vietjet Air and newcomer Bamboo Airways have been commercially exploited.\nVietstar Airline only operates light aircraft.\nCompared to the current 13 regular airlines and nearly 10 charter companies operating in Thailand, there is still a lot of room to grow. The number of airlines operating in Việt Nam is much smaller than Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Cambodia and Myanmar, and five times less than Indonesia.\nIn a letter to the Prime Minister in mid-2018, TAB said that despite having only 72 per cent of Việt Nam's population, Thailand had four times more airlines and three times more international tourists. According to the Vietnam Tourism Advisory Board (TAB), together with low tour prices, the variety of aviation services was a pull for Thailand.\nTAB said that by expanding the local aviation industry, Việt Nam could compete and use its advantages.\nSeeing the potential of the market, Malaysia and Thailand Air Asia submitted proposals to establish a low-cost airline in Việt Nam. Not commenting on whether it would continue to apply after four unsuccessful attempts over years, a representative of Air Asia told\xa0Việt Nam News: “We will continue to expand our network to connect Vietnam with ASEAN and beyond.”\nThe airline is now running 17 routes connecting Vietnam with international routes. AirAsia sees heavyweight competitors from local airlines in Vietnam which are rapidly expanding their networks into international markets. However, the airline representative told\xa0Việt Nam News: “The competition offers more benefits to travellers as they have more choices.”\nThe most recently approved airline, Kites Air, is being developed by famous tourism firm Thiên Minh Group. Knowing the market, Kites has set its bases in Chu Lai and Đà Nẵng, saying it would focus on connecting small and medium airports, especially those with limited infrastructure.\nWith tested tourism products as well as the largest online travel agency in the domestic tourism market, iVivu, Kites is expected to help connect Thiên Minh Group's products.\nKites plans to launch flights in the summer next year to serve domestic routes to the central and southern regions of Việt Nam, then expand the network to Indochina, Southeast Asia and then Northeast Asia.\nSimilar to Kites, one of the leading travel firms in Việt Nam Vietravel also plans to launch its own airline in Q1, 2020.\nVũ Đức Biên, general director of Vietravel Airlines, said the airline would mostly operate as a charter airline to serve Vietravel's customers as well as other passengers.\nVietravel recognised the opportunity in the charter market in Việt Nam when 51,000 charter flights were recorded in 2017. Since 2015, Vietravel has been working with local airlines to provide about 300-400 flights each year, which was far below the demand.\nA Vietravel representative said: “There is more room in the market.”\nIn April, Vingroup established Vinpearl Air with registered capital of VNĐ1.3 trillion and plans to buy 30 aircraft to operate on international routes. —\xa0VNS",2

451,'Korean scholar says states should not resort to force',"Việt Nam rejects China’s statement on sovereignty over Trường Sa islands\nChina asked to withdraw ships from\xa0Việt Nam’s territorial waters\nViệt Nam voices concern over developments in East Sea at AMM-52\nViệt Nam consistently exercises, safeguards sovereignty by peaceful measures\nVN consistently protects sovereignty in East Sea: spokeswoman\nPresident of the Geopolitics Institute of Korea, Professor-Doctor Lee Woong-Hyeon, talks to Vietnam News Agency correspondent\xa0Mạnh Hùng\xa0in Seoul\xa0about\xa0the recent activities by China\xa0in the East Sea.\nProfessor-Doctor Lee Woong-Hyeon (R) answering VNA correspondent Mạnh Hùng in Seoul\nAs an expert on international relations, can you give us your general assessment on the current security situation in the East Sea and speak about the China's intentions?\nAs far as I know, the Chinese geological survey vessel’s activities in this area are\xa0not new. The Chinese survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 entered waters near the Việt Nam-controlled Vanguard Bank on July 3, with the first encroachment of China’s oil rigs five years ago. The first intrusion of a Chinese oil rig triggered fierce anti-China protests in Việt Nam, without any special international reactions. But this time, the incident upset Việt Nam, the Government and people, and went further to make the United States criticise Beijing for “bullying behavior” in the area. This means that July’s action came from the desire to demonstrate\xa0China’s presence in this area and reflected the recent the US-China relations including economic conflicts.\nAs the result of the trade war with the US, China’s economy is reported to continue to stall, and the Chinese government may want to incite nationalism to distract the public’s attention from some difficult diplomatic situations. Of course, China’s political and military intention in this area should not be excluded. China has remained the power with the upper hand over its neighbours, along with about 25 to 30 military outposts from the Paracel islands to the Spratlys. The dominant status in this area will give China a lot of diplomatic cards at the\xa0negotiating table with the other great powers and with the states in this area including Việt Nam. China’s intention is said to originate from its ‘national interests, virtual or real’, territorial [maritime], military, economic, diplomatic gains\xa0and desire for recognition (in the Hegelian term), which are pursued by all the states in general, especially by the rising great powers.\nIn your opinion, what are legal frameworks necessary for ensuring the security and freedom of aviation and navigation in the sea?\nPersonally, I cast doubts on the capability and possibility of the international law in solving the international territorial problems. But I think, for the peace and prosperity of people, we should not resort to only\xa0naked power or military force. We should not give up the efforts to cite, utilize\xa0and adopt\xa0international norms for the peaceful solving of the problems among states. There is a legal framework for security and peace in this sea besides the general and traditional principle of free navigation.\nThe Vanguard Bank, the westernmost reef of the Spratly islands, hosts Việt Nam’s strategic DK1 oil rigs which are called ‘ocean fortresses’, and sits well within the 200 nautical miles of Việt Nam’s exclusive economic zone. The exclusive economic zone, set by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is the foremost legal frame of reference with which the Hà Nội Government can strengthen its own position. Although the Chinese government has contested the UNCLOS rule, especially as interpreted by Việt Nam and other countries around this sea, Beijing’s method of justification for its action, the nine-dash line, cannot be said to be an international legal frame consented to by other states.\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) dismissed the nine-dash line claim as groundless in 2016, which has not been respected by the Chinese government. But PCA, like other international courts, has no realistic power to\xa0enforce of its own decision. This is the limitation of international norms and legal judgments we\xa0sometimes look to. But a legal frame would be a weak state’s good weapon for criticizing the illegal action of the stronger state\xa0and for getting the world’s opinion support.\nCan you predict developments relating to the security situation in the area in the coming time?\nConsidering the salami-slicing tactics of China\xa0in this area and Hà Nội’s cool (this means ‘reasonable’) and wise policy reaction even under the pressure of Vietnamese people’s anger and protests, we can forecast that outright and armed conflicts will not happen. But every statesman should be careful not to escalate an incident into a serious confrontation or conflict especially in a crisis\xa0which is stirring public protests like this. Crisis management is a statesman’s vital virtue.\nWhen a claimant intrudes into the area which it claims as ‘its area’ or as having an interest in it, its actions are\xa0apt to make itself a recurrent pattern, though not going up to the extreme line. That is the salami-slicing or grey-zone tactic. Of course, those activities threaten\xa0the security situation in the area, provoking the concerns of people. This kind of tactic\xa0will be witnessed for the foreseeable future in this area.\nIn your opinion, what should the Việt Nam authorities do to protect its legitimate sovereignty and interests in the Vanguard Bank in particular and the East Sea in general?\nViệt Nam, sharing a dozen hundred kilometre border with China and having experienced a war with China in 1979, is evaluated as a state with high tolerance of strategic risk, including during the confrontation with China in 2014. At\xa0the end of a very dangerous and collision-possible period of two-month stand-off, China eventually backed down and pulled its energy rig in that year. This is the diplomatically and strategically wise course to be taken in the coming time.\nIn an international crisis threatening the state’s security and sovereignty, the most important stance a state should take is to maintain strategic, theoretical and policy consistency, which could gather\xa0international support and could get the normatively stronger position. And it is needed for academics to study and research the related maritime history of this area, preparing for the possible debate on who the historically and internationally legitimate sovereign of this area should be. Sometimes the pen is mightier than the sword. — VNS",0

Their home meeting with France in Reykjavik on October 11 will be crucial for them.\nFrance are unlikely to be too concerned about that trip, however, not least because the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Paul Pogba and N'Golo Kante may be back by then.\nTuesday's starting line-up featured only four of those who took to the field in last year's World Cup final win over Croatia.\nComan scores again\nInstead it was the Lille winger Jonathan Ikone -- making his first international start -- who did well to set up Coman for the opener, the Bayern Munich man holding off the last defender and rifling high into the net.\nComan now has three goals in two games having previously netted just once in 17 for his country.\nWith the half-hour mark approaching Griezmann won a spot-kick, but this time his attempt was saved by Andorra goalkeeper Josep Gomes.\nHowever, Griezmann redeemed himself in the 52nd minute as he sent in a free-kick from just outside the area for Lenglet to head in his first goal for France on the occasion of his third cap.\nGomes then did wonderfully to keep out a Coman header before Moussa Sissoko and Coman both hit the bar.\nA third goal did come in stoppage time, however, as substitute Ben Yedder of Monaco pounced to score after Gomes had blocked a Nabil Fekir free-kick. — AFP",3

He’d lost the previous six.\nBut in the early hours of Sunday morning Vietnamese time, Klopp’s trademark grin was as wide as it has ever been as he\xa0dished out hugs to all and sundry. And there were plenty of takers in red.\nFor Klopp’s Liverpool the game could not have started any better.\nJust 30 seconds in, a cross from the left by Sadio Mane struck the outstretched arm of Tottenham’s Moussa\xa0Sissoko and the ref pointed to the spot.\nHarsh maybe, but the decision was backed by VAR and Salah made no mistake from 12 yards.\nIf Mauricio Pochettino’s game plan was to let Liverpool have the majority of possession and catch them on the break, then he needed a plan B. His players couldn’t deliver.\nThe onus was now on Spurs to hunt for an equaliser, but with a clearly half-fit Harry Kane upfront, they created nothing in the opening period.\nIn fact the only real excitement of the first half after the early goal was the appearance of a scantily clad female pitch invader who sprinted past Liverpool’s Vigil van Dijk, a feat not many have managed this season.\nAfter the break Tottenham continued to dominate possession but had nothing to show for it.\nIt wasn’t until the last 15 minutes Liverpool goalkeeper Allisson Becker was called into action making neat saves from Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura.\nTime was running out for Spurs and on 87 minutes substitute Origi hammered the final nail into Tottenham’s coffin putting Liverpool two in front.

5248,'Scientific reseach\xa0and policy making connect\xa0to\xa0tackle plastic pollution',"The volume of plastic waste released by human each year, including 13 million tonnes dumped into seas, is enough to cover the earth’s surface four times. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — There must be close ties\xa0between scientific researching\xa0and policy making to tackle plastic pollution in Việt Nam, environmental campaigners have said.\nA workshop held recently by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in collaboration with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE)\xa0raised the issue of plastic waste pollution as a serious threat\xa0to the global environment and\xa0development.\nParticipants at the event, part of the IUCN’s MarPlastics project, included policymakers from\xa0ministries, representatives from Vietnamese and international environmental\xa0organisations, scientists and environmental campaigners.\nThey discussed policy and knowledge loopholes, sought effective solutions and proposed policies to minimise marine plastic pollution.\nA report from the IUCN said along with solutions on policy, technology, finance and public awareness improvement, it is necessary to conduct further research\xa0on the impacts of plastic waste pollution on the economy, environment and society.\n“It is important to have clear messages basing on scientific evidences to convey the results of such researches to State agencies, business enterprises as well as the community so that they can support the building and implementation of policies and laws on environmental protection,” the report said.\nDirector of the MoNRE’s Legal Affairs Department Phan Tuấn Hùng said plastic waste is a global environmental problem. Each year, the volume of plastic waste released by humans, including 13 million tonnes dumped at sea, is enough to cover Earth’s surface four times.\n\nReports from international environmental organisations revealed Việt Nam throws away about 1.8 million tonnes of plastic every year, standing 17th among 109 countries in terms of plastic waste volume released. Of that amount, some 730,000 tonnes is released to the oceans, accounting for 6 per cent of the world’s plastic volume dumped at sea. That has made the country the fourth biggest polluter of ocean plastic waste.\nHùng noted it is very easy to see such key words like “plastic waste” and “fight plastic waste” in the media at present, showing\xa0public awareness of plastic waste in Việt Nam has been improved.\n\nMany anti-plastic movements and initiatives have been launched. Several supermarkets have replaced plastic bags\xa0with environmentally friendly materials, while some\xa0restaurants and coffee shops have eliminated single-use plastic products.\n\nHowever, the official said, there remains much that needs to be done in terms of plastic waste management policies. Plastic is currently managed like\xa0other types of waste, and there aren't specific regulations on plastic waste management, except for some on taxes for plastic bags.\n\n”Existing policies and laws on plastic waste management have yet to be on par with its impacts on the environment and human health, as well as public attention to this issue. Therefore, it is necessary to step up making policies and laws in this field,” according to Hùng.\n\nHe said these policies and laws should take into account the life cycle of plastic, from design, production, packaging and consumption to emission, collection, treatment and recycling.\n\nAside from economic tools like taxes and fees on plastic products, it is also a need to set technical standards, support\xa0the recycling of environmentally friendly plastic products\xa0and promote\xa0producers and importers’ sense of responsibility, he added. — VNS",4

Foreign investors are not allowed to participate in the auction.\nThe shares are equivalent to nearly 53 per cent of CAG. SCIC is expected to collect VNĐ723 billion through the sale.\nAn Giang Port, formerly known as An Giang Mỹ Thới Port, was established in 1985.\nThe company was equitised in 2011 with charter capital of VNĐ138 billion, and the People's Committee of An Giang Province owned nearly 53 per cent of the capital.\nIn 2015, the State capital at An Giang Port was transferred to SCIC.

The VN-Index is forecast to continue floating between 980 and 1,000 points. — VNA/VNS Photo Trần Việt\nHÀ NỘI — Concerns about the US-China trade talks have\xa0lifted for now, and investors are turning their attention to third quarter earnings reports and how listed companies will perform in the last three months of the year.\nLocal markets have already factored these events\xa0in, and foreign investors remain\xa0cautious about\xa0ongoing\xa0international disputes, so stocks are not expected to react strongly over\xa0the next few weeks.\nViệt Nam’s benchmark VN-Index on the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange finished last week at 991.84 points, up total 0.43 per cent from the previous one.\nThe minor HNX-Index on the Hà Nội Stock Exchange ended last week at 105.26 points, nearly unchanged from the previous week’s end of 105.16 points.\nBoth indices were weighed down by market caution as investors waited\xa0for statements from\xa0the two-day US-China trade talks\xa0which closed on Friday (local time) in Washington. The two sides reportedly came up with a deal to postpone\xa0their dispute, but analysts and businesses remained uncertain about the feasibility of the\xa0agreement.\nBut positive reactions from the US and China last weekend helped boost\xa0local market sentiment, easing investor\xa0concerns\xa0about the potential for a\xa0global economic recession.\n“The two economies have overcome the most uptight stage of their relationship. They have clearly been willing to sit down and talk to reach an agreement,” Nguyễn Trung Du, director of investment services at VNĐirect Securities Corp,\xa0said.\nThe developments of the US-China trade relations would\xa0definitely have some impact on the Vietnamese market, Ngô Thế Hiển, vice director of the market analysis department at Sài Gòn-Hà Nội Securities Corp (SHS), said.\n“If a deal is struck, both domestic and international markets will be boosted. If not, it wouldn’t be a disaster for the markets as long as the tensions don’t escalate,” Hiển said.\nIn recent months, the Vietnamese stock market had\xa0not been affected that\xa0much by the developments of the US-China trade row, so the VN-Index may hang\xa0between 980\xa0and 1,000 points, he added.\nForeign investors would continue to be\xa0net\xa0sellers in\xa0risky markets and shelter in safe assets such as government bonds and gold, so it’s difficult to expect a strong wave of capital flowing\xa0into the market like the late 2017-early 2018 period, Du from VNĐirect said.\nNet foreign selling last week reached VNĐ265 billion (US$11.4 million) on the Vietnamese stock market. Despite the figure being\xa0down 75 per cent on a weekly basis, it still indicated caution among foreign investors.\nInvestors were still focused on several listed companies whose stocks were highlighted by their earnings such as banks, consumer firms, retailers and tech\xa0companies, he said.\n“But those firms’ stocks have been priced in earlier, so they won’t make a big impact on the market when the news is delivered,” Du said.\nInvestors were eyeing companies’ fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, and those with good nine-month performances were likely to grow in the last quarter, he added.\nThe banking, retail and tech\xa0sectors had provided the momentum in recent weeks. The VN-Index has gained 3.12 per cent since September 11 when investors began looking at\xa0companies’ third-quarter profit reports.\nDuring that\xa0period, Vietcombank\xa0(VCB) has\xa0increased\xa010.5 per cent, tech group FPT Corp (FPT) by\xa07.4 per cent and dairy producer Vinamilk (VNM) by\xa06.6 per cent.\nThe level 1,000-point mark would\xa0remain a “mental” challenge for the VN-Index, Du said.\nThere would\xa0be no big difference on how the VN-Index would\xa0move in the short term because investors were still doubtful about the strength of the Vietnamese stock market, Nguyễn Hoàng Việt, senior market analyst at Vietinbank Securities Co, said.\nIn a bad scenario, the VN-Index may settle at 975 points\xa0if it failed\xa0to conquer the 1,000-point milestone, he forecast. — VNS'",2

No one knows the duration or full impact of the US-China trade war.”\n“We do know the tariffs are affecting American businesses in China, as well as US businesses trading with China.

And a big part of Việt Nam’s dynamism is the innovation that takes place on\xa0social media, according to the director.\nAs manufacturing and supply chains are relocated across the region, the development of Vietnamese SMEs and their increased participation in global supply chains becomes vital.\nHải\xa0said trade between the two countries had\xa0risen from a modest US$220 million in 1994 (the year the US lifted its economic embargo against Việt Nam) to $58.8 billion last year.\nThe figure reached $35.4 billion in the first six months of the year.\xa0“The US has been the leading trade partner for Việt Nam in the last 10 years,” he said.\nViệt Nam had\xa0joined global supply chains, causing\xa0the country to\xa0leap from 12th place in 2018 to ninth\xa0place in early\xa02019 as one of the largest exporters to the US, he said.\nThe country had also become the 27th largest market and the 16th largest trading partner of the US, he added.\nThe trade forum\xa0attracted more than 300 delegates, including government officials, local leaders, and Vietnamese and US business executives.\nThemed ""Global Supply Chain\xa0Movement – Opportunities to Promote Bilateral Trade and Investment"", it was organised by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. — VNS'",2

The net-covered model is now being used on nearly 55 ha of jujube, accounting for 5.3 per cent of the province's total jujube area, according to Phạm Dũng, head of the department’s Plant Cultivation and Protection Sub-department.\nVõ Hiếu, who uses nets to cover his 2,000 sq.m jujube orchard in Ninh Phước District, said that irregular weather had led to large quantities of Medflies which could not be eradicated by pesticides.\nTo protect his orchard from pests, Hiếu spent VNĐ20 million (US$860) to buy frames and nets last year.\nBesides controlling pests, the nets also protect the fruit from strong winds and rains and the impact of strong sunshine.\nThe fruit quality has improved also because farmers now let the jujube ripe properly before harvesting them, he added.\nThe cost of nets is VNĐ10 – 20 million ($430 - 860) per 1,000 sq.m. The net can be used for three to five years.\nJujube is one of the province’s 12 key agricultural products. The fruit has a light yellow colour when ripe, and is crunchy and sweet.\nNew variety\nThe province is piloting the cultivation of a new jujube variety called Táo Bom NT 05, which was created by the Nha Hố Research Institute for Cotton and Agriculture Development.\nThe new variety has a green colour when ripe and is two to three times larger than a normal jujube.\nFarmer Trão Thị Tạo, who is growing Táo Bom NT 05 in Phan Rang–Tháp Chàm City, said that harvesting is done after one year.\nThe new variety has a yield of 4 tonnes per 1,000 sq.m a crop, which is 1 to 1.2 tonnes higher than normal jujube varieties.\n“It offers a profit nearly two times higher than normal jujube varieties,” she said.\nThe Nha Hố Research Institute for Cotton and Agriculture Development is teaching farmers how to grow the new variety.

The city's authorities have launched a new project encouraging plastic waste recycling. Photo zing.vn\nHCM CITY – To reduce the plastic waste released into the environment, especially to the ocean, HCM City has approved a project that encourages the recycling of waste, especially plastic waste picked up by private garbage collectors.\nEach Vietnamese person uses an average of 1.2kg of waste per day, of which 16 percent is made of plastic, Trần Thanh Lam, an environmental expert, said at a seminar at the Plastics Recycling\xa0 Networking event on Thursday in HCM City.\nWith nearly 12.8 million tonnes of waste released to the ocean every year. Việt Nam is one of Asia’s five worst polluters of ocean plastic waste.\nFigures from Việt Nam’s Association of Plastics illustrate the scale of the problem. In 1990, each Vietnamese consumed 3.8kg of plastic per year, but 25 years later, the figure had hit 41kg.\nAs many as 1,000 plastic bags are used each minute, but only 27 per cent of them are treated and recycled.\nThe Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment estimates that about 80 tonnes of plastic waste and bags are thrown away every day in Hà Nội and HCM City combined.\nThe HCM City project called “3Rs” stands for “Reduce – Re-use – Recycle”, focusing on plastic recycling. It will also create networks for private garbage collectors in HCM City and throughout Việt Nam.\nIn addition, it will improve private garbage collectors’ working conditions, reducing health risk factors and raising public awareness about their work.\nThe project aims to have at least 70 per cent of plastic waste of the 582 tonnes per day of domestic waste collected by 4,000 private garbage collectors for recycling.\nWhen the project ends, 50 private garbage collectors’ organisations will sign public service delegation contracts with local authorities or set up community-based waste pre-collection and recycling systems.\nSeventy per cent of targeted private garbage collectors are expected to increase their income from 25 per cent to 40 per cent.\nThe 50 private garbage collectors’\xa0organisations in HCM City will identify the main factors of risk and reduce the risk of accidents and disease under the project.\nAt least 50 per cent of targeted private garbage collectors will improve their access to adequate health insurance or services.\nThe treatment after collected plastic waste is also a significant problem. Most solid waste in Việt Nam as well as in HCM City is treated by burning or dumped in landfills.\nHowever, these methods are said to have low environmental and economic values because landfills cause pollution and burning emits toxins.\nLê Trọng Thanh, an environmental expert, said that HCM city should study methods to use technology in making environmentally-friendly materials from waste.\nUsing high-tech applications to limit landfills is an urgent task, he said.\nViệt Nam recently succeeded in turning waste to energy or organic carbon, a compound used to improve soil and applied in organic agriculture.\nThe energy generated from waste has been used for the national grid in HCM City.\nThe organic carbon soil has been certified to have higher nutrition levels than cow and chicken manure, and is two times higher than organic bio-fertiliser. – VNS",4

We face extreme weather, environmental pollution, smog, toxic emissions that led to a much higher risk of occupational diseases than drivers of other means of transport.”\nSên said drivers should be earning VNĐ150 million ($6,450) instead of the current VNĐ100 million($4,300) before they pay income tax.\nMany other drivers agree with Sên.\nSpeaking on the Facebook page, Hà Nội\xa0Grab\xa0Driver Community, many voiced their opinions about the amount they pay in tax.\nDương Thành, whose sons are aged 11 and five, said: “I earn VNĐ9 million ($390) per month and it is just too hard to afford the schooling of my two sons. With the tax, how can I manage? ”\nThành, in cầu Giấy District, Hà Nội added: “I also hope they will raise the income tax exemption limit. Now it is in HCM City, but if they apply it there, it\xa0should be applied in Hà\xa0Nội\xa0soon.”\nSome drivers even asked for complete\xa0removal of\xa0such tax on motorbike taxi driver as they were already in the ""bottom of society"" income.\nSince their income is considered business revenue rather than salary, ride-hail drivers will not enjoy tax reduction based on family dependents, which is pegged at VNĐ3.6 million ($155) per month for each qualified dependent, for their personal income tax.\nSên’s petition was passed to other drivers to sign for support. He told his colleagues they need to fight for change from Government.\nOn August 26, Grab started collecting a fixed sum of VNĐ60,000 ($2.6) daily from drivers, whom it estimates have an annual income of VNĐ100 million or higher, to fulfil its tax obligations on their behalf.\nAfter facing immediate opposition, Grab cancelled the collections the next day.\n“[We] will also refund any amount already collected to the e-wallets of these partner drivers,” Grab said in the statement on August\xa027.\nAt the meeting, Nguyễn Văn\xa0Thiện - Head of Public Relation Department of HCM City Tax Department confirmed they instructed Grab to collect taxes according to the law, adding “however, if there are unsuitable points, we will listen, record then make recommendations to the General Department of Taxation, the Government to change for better tax policy.”\nGrab representative also said they always did their best to obey the local laws and also work with the tax authorities to find a softer tax solution for its driver partners.\nThere are more than 400,000 drivers riding with three major ride-hailing firms of Grab, Go-Viet and Be.\xa0 — VNS'",2

A plan should also be put in place to monitor water from other sources, such as the Đuống River.\nLast Thursday, residents in some districts west of Ha Noi detected an unpleasant smell coming from their tap water. Many of them have stopped using tap water and are buying bottled water instead.\nHà Nội's Health Department subsequently took water samples for testing. The test results showed the levels of styrene in the water were higher than normal, meaning it was unsafe, said Hoàng Đức Hạnh, deputy head of the department.\nHowever, it was not clear how styrene affected people’s health, he said.\nThe reason for the smell was caused by a significant amount of used oil illegally dumped into an upstream section of the Đà River in Phú Minh Commune, Kỳ Sơn District.

3883,'Việt Nam to gain $11b from wood and forest product exports this year',"Workers produce export products at the Woodsland Tuyên Quang JSC. — Photo hanoimoi.com.vn\nHÀ NỘI —\xa0Việt Nam is likely to reach its export turnover target of US$11 billion from wood and forestry products this year as the main season for business is in the last six months of the year, according to an official of the Việt Nam\xa0Timber\xa0and\xa0Forest Product Association.\nBusinesses also have enough orders for production by year-end, said Nguyễn Tôn Quyền, Vice Chairman\xa0and\xa0Secretary-General\xa0of\xa0the association.\nDeputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Hà Công Tuấn also said to meet this goal, the Government has committed to creating favourable conditions for businesses, including domestic and foreign-invested enterprises, to develop and have solutions for origin fraud in the timber industry.\nAccording to the association, Việt Nam is expected to export timber and wood products to the EU valued at over $700 million this year, higher than the $680 million achieved in 2018.\nBefore 2018, the EU market mainly imported outdoor wooden furniture, while since early this year this market has increased imports of indoor wooden furniture at a much higher value. This trend will continue in the future, it said.\nViệt Nam's exports of timber and wooden products to the EU market have good prospects thanks to the advantages from the Voluntary Partnership Agreement on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (VPA/FLECT) and the Việt Nam-EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA).\nTo seize opportunities in the EU market, Vietnamese businesses should invest in equipment, technology and materials following market demand, according to the association.\nFor the Japanese market, besides wooden furniture, Japan has a policy of producing wood pellets to replace fossil energy sources such as coal, oil and gas which are gradually running out. The wood pellets are used as fuel for thermal power plants replacing coal and oil and used as heating equipment in the industrial sector and civil activities.\nRecently, Japanese enterprises have invested in three wood pellet production factories in Nghệ An Province, producing wood pellets for export to Japan.\nTherefore, it expects that Việt Nam's export turnover of wooden products to Japan will surpass the EU, reaching over $1 billion.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Import and Export Department has warned that the rapid increase of Việt Nam’s timber and wood products exports to the US at present may cause the US to pay more attention to the exports of those products to this market. Therefore, local enterprises exporting wood and forest products should actively update information from their partners and authorities to avoid this risk.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's Administration of Forestry, the export value of wood and forest products in the first eight months of 2019 was estimated at $7.08 billion, up 18.6 per cent year on year, including $1 billion in August, up 16 per cent.\nPhạm Văn Điển, deputy director-deneral of the administration, said 87 per cent of the national export turnover from wood and forest products was to traditional markets, such as the US, Japan, the EU, China and South Korea.\nQuyền said the US is the largest export market of Việt Nam's timber industry, accounting for 45 per cent of the industry's total export value. The average growth rate of exports to this market is from 15-17 per cent each year. The export value of timber and wooden products in the first seven months of 2019 was $2.7 billion, up 32.8 per cent over the same period in 2018.\nMeanwhile, Việt Nam’s exports of wood and wooden products to Japan have increased sharply since the beginning of the year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\nViệt Nam was the largest kitchen furniture supplier for Japan in the first half of 2019, reaching 12,800 tonnes, up 19.8 per cent year on year. Kitchen furniture from Việt Nam accounted for 54.4 per cent of Japan's total kitchen furniture imports. —\xa0VNS",2

VNS Photo Bồ Xuân Hiệp\nBồ Xuân Hiệp\nHONG KONG — Vietnamese manufacturers need “integrated marketing solutions” comprising both online and offline platforms to gain access to buyers in both traditional and emerging markets, experts have said.\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the Global Sources Lifestyle and Fashion show last week in Hong Kong, Ronald Ng, general manager of Global Sources Lifestyle Group, said Việt Nam had become a manufacturing hub in the Southeast Asian region.\nVietnamese exporters, mostly SMEs, who benefit from operating in one of the world’s fastest growing economies with stable governance and ease of doing business, are very likely to succeed in joining global trade.\nTo build their corporate image, generate sales leads and win orders from global buyers, Vietnamese suppliers should engage in more trade promotion platforms to strengthen linkages with global buyers.\n“In addition to trade shows, online platforms are considered one of the most effective [ways] for them to boost exports to global markets,” he said.\nSince China has moved up the manufacturing value chain, a significant number of international buyers now consider Việt Nam an alternative supply market.\nThe number of orders shifting from China to Việt Nam has increased remarkably.\n“The price advantage is becoming less obvious while the gap in export communication between global buyers and suppliers is growing.”\nOnline platforms are the most convenient channel, providing year-round exposure for buyers to check and learn about suppliers’ capability and then submit online inquiries.\nMeanwhile, offline platforms enable suppliers and buyers to meet face-to-face and gain credibility.\n“Combined, online-to-offline (O2O) is the most comprehensive marketing mix for Vietnamese suppliers to win more business.”\nA recent survey by Global Sources, the event organiser, found that 80 per cent of global buyers preview product and supplier information online before they decide to go to the show\xa0to meet with targeted suppliers.\nSwandi Wikassa, a buyer from Indonesia, said: “Before coming to the show for sourcing, we spent a great deal of time learning about the product and supplier online.”\nAccording to Phạm Thị Hương, former managing director of Việt Nam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex), many Vietnamese products have\xa0good quality and\xa0competitive prices, but global buyers are not even aware of them since they are not available online.\n“Participation in exhibitions helps Vietnamese suppliers promote their products, but it is not enough. They should also look to promote their products via online platforms to reach more global buyers.”\nManufacturers should also study prices, consumer tastes and trends in potential markets, and have labels and packaging in English and the local language, she said.\nTo meet the requirements of global buyers, Vietnamese manufactures should also focus on building brands, using technology in production and improving designs, she added.\nExperts said in choosy markets like the US, the EU, Japan, and South Korea, exporters should be prepared to face technical barriers that could change unexpectedly.\nA number of Vietnamese SMEs have little experience in digital or online marketing and lack\xa0information about the\xa0field and quality human resources, according to the experts.\nMore than 35 leading Vietnamese manufacturers of garments, textiles and fashion accessories and garment-related industries, many members of\xa0the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association and Vinatex, participated in the show.\nLast year Việt Nam’s textile and apparel exports were worth US$36 billion, up 16 per cent year-on-year, making the country one of the world’s three largest exporters.\nThe sector has set itself a target of $40 billion for this year and more than $60 billion by 2025.\nThe country’s economic growth is forecast to be 7.05 per cent for this year on the back of robust FDI and manufacturing exports, according to the Việt Nam Institute for\xa0Economic\xa0and Policy Research.\nThe Hong Kong expo was organised by Global Sources, a B2B platform that connects buyers and suppliers online and offline.\nThe platform includes more than 1.5 million global buyers, including 94 of the world’s top 100 retailers, in\xa0more than\xa0190 countries. — VNS'",2

1928,'Bạc Liêu to expand 2 sustainable shrimp farming models',"BẠC LIÊU – The Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province of Bạc Liêu plans to expand its efficient and sustainable super-intensive shrimp farming and shrimp-rice farming models.\nThe former model was first developed by companies in 2017 and later expanded to households, according to the province’s Agriculture Extension Centre.\nThe province has 1,845ha of super-intensive shrimp farming ponds, including 950ha belonging to companies and 324ha to households.\nThe model requires large initial investment of VNĐ1-1.6 billion (US$43,100-69,000) per hectare, but offers profits of VNĐ600 million-1 billion ($25.900-43,100) a year.\nUnder the shrimp-rice farming model, farmers grow rice in the rainy season and breed shrimp in the dry season on the same rice fields.\nThe rice yield is 4.4-5 tonnes per hectare per crop and the shrimp yield is 230-350 kilogrammes.\nThe shrimp-rice farming model is friendly to the environment as farmers use few pesticides and chemicals and it adapts to climate change.\nThe province has 37,700ha under the model, and, according to its Agriculture Extension Centre, has the capacity to expand it to 50,000ha.\nSpeaking at a seminar in Bạc Liêu on Thursday, Dương Thành Trung, chairman of the province's People’s Committee, instructed local agencies to co-operate with research institutions to finalise the farming processes for the two models and train farmers.\nWaste treatment facilities should be included in the super-intensive model to protect the environment, he warned.\nThe growth of shrimp co-operatives and co-operative groups that use advanced farming techniques should be fostered, he said.\nThe province encouraged farmers to breed shrimp to quality standards like Vietnamese good agricultural practices (VietGAP) and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), he added.\nLưu Hoàng Ly, director of the province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the province was quickly building infrastructure for a hi-tech agriculture zone to develop shrimp farming.\nThis would help to develop the province into the country’s shrimp industry hub, he said.\nThe province plans to have four hi-tech aquaculture areas, including one for producing fry, by next year, and 10 by 2025.\nIt targets exports of $750 million worth of shrimp next year and $1 billion by 2025.\nBạc Liêu expects to produce 155,000 tonnes of shrimp this year, 15.1 per cent more than last year, according to the department. – VNS",1

My knowledge of marine species and the ocean help me act as a local guide for tourists as well,” he said.\nMarine protection\nThe Chàm Islands-Hội An World Biosphere Reserve, which covers over 33,000ha including the ancient town of Hội An, has 1,500ha of tropical forests and 6,700ha of sea featuring a wide range of fauna and flora.\nThe islands, which include eight islets with 2,400 inhabitants, have been one of the most popular destinations in Quảng Nam Province since UNESCO recognised Hội An ancient town and the Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary as World Heritage Sites.\nA report has revealed that more than 80 per cent of the population have switched from fishing to the eco-tourism sector and doubled the income per capita to VNĐ42 million (US$1,800).\nThe islands are the only location in Việt\xa0Nam\xa0promoting the non-use of plastic bags and the ‘3Rs’ (reduce, reuse and recycle) programmes since 2011, as well as fighting over-fishing for decades.\nThe 2,400 inhabitants earned US$3.6 million per year, 65 per cent of which is from tourism and service.\nTrần Hoàn, a 53-year-old fisherman, initially protested the non-use plastic bag campaign in the Chàm Islands Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2011.\nBut he then voluntarily joined a community-based team to prevent illegal and over-fishing activities.\n“At first, we protested the ban on plastic bags because they were seen as the most convenient way of transporting food every day,” Hoàn recalled.\n“Now we all know that plastic bags have killed the coral reefs – a safe shelter for fish and other species. Islanders now use environmentally-friendly packaging or reusable bags for their daily market trips,” he said.\nThe local community is continuing to protect the environment by promoting ""Say No to single-use plastic cups and straws"".\nDr Chu Mạnh Trinh from the MPA said islanders offered tourists hand-made paper packaging instead of nylon bags.\nFishermen have also set up teams to check for illegal fishing or pollution such as fishing by electric shock and netting small marine species.\nChallenges\nDirector of the MPA Centre Trần Thị Hồng Thúy warned that booming mass tourism would result in over-exploited natural resources in the Chàm Islands.\nShe said the islands hosted only a mere 17,000 tourists in 2009, but about 400,000 visited in 2018.\n“At least 33ha of the seaweed has been destroyed in the past decade due to over-fishing and mass tourism. About 102ha of forest – 10 per cent of the total forest area on the islands – has also been cleared for the construction of roads and buildings,” she said.\nShe said water off the islands docked regularly more than 700 boats in serving for fishing and tourist transport.\nLê Ngọc Thảo, an expert from the MPA pointed out that the Chàm Islands-Hội An biosphere reserve site would be threatened in the near future by fishing using electric shocking, pollution, lack of freshwater and rapid urbanisation in the basin of the Thu Bồn River.\nHe said 7ha of nipa palms in Hội An itself, the Thu Bồn River basin or in the transition area of the biosphere reserve – was cleared to make way for Cửa Đại Bridge.\n“The bridge, which connects Hội An and the districts of Duy Xuyên and Thăng Bình as part of the area\'s socio-economic development plan, cuts through a 40ha nipa palm forest, just 5km away from ancient town of Hội An,” Thảo said, adding the forest remained a safe shelter for marine species and fish reproducing before migrating to waters of the Chàm Islands,” he said.\nSolutions\nTo promote biodiversity protection, the MPA and Hội An will continue to allow only 3,000 tourists to visit the islands per day.\nThe strict control of mass tourism will help the marine ecological system recover for sustainable development.\nProfessor Chu Hồi suggested afforestation and replanting nipa palms in the Thu Bồn River basin as well as rejecting mass construction of beach hotels and resorts as well as sound management of waste and water would be key factors in supporting the sustainable development of the Chàm Islands-Hội reserve.\nProfessor Nguyễn Hoàng Trí from the Man and the Biosphere Programme – an intergovernmental scientific programme launched by UNESCO, said the islands should set a lower limit for the number of tourists to promote the sustainable development of the islands.\nHe said biodiversity protection and improving awareness among the community about environmental protection will be the key to building the islands into a national brand in the context of a community-based eco-tourism site rich in biodiversity. — VNS\nA corner of Chàm Islands, off the coast of Hội An city.

In addition, farmers breed giant river prawns in Thoại Sơn District.\nLast year, large-scale rice fields on a total area of 33,531ha were active in the province.\nNguyễn Sĩ Lâm, director of the An Giang Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said to develop the specialised farming areas sustainably, the province had set up zones and applied advanced farming techniques.\nThe province had improved the operation of co-operatives who work in these specialised farming areas, he said.\nIn Sóc Trăng Province, local authorities have instructed and given financial support to farmers to rotate rice and other crops on the same rice fields so they can improve profits and stop the spread of rice disease when rice crops are planted without interruptions.\nTrần Xều Họt, who takes part in the Việt Nan Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project in Sóc Trăng (VnSAT-ST), has rotated growing rice and watermelon on his rice field in Mỹ Tú District’s Phú Mỹ Commune.\nHọt uses organic fertiliser to grow watermelon, which has reduced the use of urea fertiliser by 30 per cent and improved yield by 20-30 per cent compared to other watermelon fields that do not participate in the VnSAT-ST.\nHe earned a profit of VNĐ14 million (US$600) per 1,000 sq.m of water melon a crop, he said.\n“The rotation has helped reduce rice pests and diseases significantly,” he said.\nThe delta has reduced rice farming areas and increased the cultivation of fruit, aquaculture and animals in agriculture restructuring in recent years.\nThe delta’s 12 provinces and Cần Thơ City have developed farming models that adapt to climate change such as a shrimp-rice farming model and a model to breed aquatic species in mangrove forests.\nIn Bến Tre Province, farmers have turned more than 10,000ha of ineffective rice fields to breed aquatic species and other high value crops, according to the province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\nBến Tre, the country’s largest coconut producer, has also increased its coconut growing area from 68,200ha in 2015 to nearly 71,000ha last year.\nNguyễn Văn Buội, deputy director of the Bến Tre Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the province’s agricultural restructuring had been done properly and is suited its ecological and irrigation conditions.\nIn Kiên Giang, one of the delta’s coastal provinces affected by rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion, the area of shrimp-rice farming model increased from 71,500ha in 2014 to 89,000ha last year.\nUnder the shrimp-rice farming model, farmers breed shrimp in the dry season and grow rice in the rainy season on the same rice field.\nThe model produces a rice yield of 4-5 tonnes per hectare a crop and 300-370kg of shrimp per hectare a crop, offering farmers a profit of 2-4 times higher than monoculture of rice, according to the Kiên Giang Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\nThe model also helps protect the environment as farmers use few chemicals to cultivate rice and shrimp. Rice and shrimp produced under the model are clean products.\nHowever, the delta’s sustainable farming models are mostly implemented on a small scale and in a scattered fashion, according to local authorities.\nIn addition, erosion, subsidence, flooding and saltwater intrusion caused by climate change have affected the delta’s agricultural production.\nDevelopment\nTo develop the delta’s sustainable agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has planned agriculture orientation for its upper, middle and coastal sub-regions to 2030.\nThe upper sub-region will develop diversified agriculture, focusing on rice and\xa0tra\xa0fish, on a sustainable basis.\nThe upper sub-region holds an important role in regulating and draining the delta’s floods caused by the rising level of the Mekong River in the rainy season.\nIn the middle sub-region, horticulture will be the focus in an aim to develop the country’s largest fruit growing area.\nIn addition, the middle sub-region will develop concentrated rice growing areas, vegetables, industrial trees and freshwater aquaculture and brackish water aquaculture with moderate brackish level.\nThis sub-region plays a role in regulating freshwater for the coastal sub-region.\nThe coastal sub-region will develop agriculture based mainly on saline and brackish water and promote its advantage for aquaculture.\nIt will also develop areas for specialty rice and plants that need less freshwater and are resistant to saline water.\nThe coastal sub-region, which has the largest forest area in the delta, will develop an agro-forestry system towards ecology, organic agriculture and ecotourism, according to the ministry.\nThe delta will continue to reduce its rice growing area, increase areas of fruit and aquaculture, and develop breeding animals with advanced techniques and on a large-scale.\nIt will also develop mangrove forests and forest-based livelihood models, as well as ecotourism. — VNS'",1

VNA/VNS Công Mạo\nCẦN THƠ — In response to climate change, amendments to some parts of the 2014 Law on Environmental Protection are necessary, said Trương Đức Trí, Deputy Director of the Department of Climate Change under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.\nHe made\xa0the statement at a workshop entitled Improvement of Policies and Legislation to Respond to Climate Change in Việt Nam, organised by the Committee of Science, Technology and Environment (CSTE) and the German Corporation for International Cooperation\xa0(GIZ) on Monday.\nThe workshop is aimed at identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the legal framework, hearing the opinions of relevant ministries, provinces and experts and consulting on the proposed amendments and supplements to the Law on Environmental Protection from 2014 in terms of climate change-related issues.\nResponding to climate change has been integrated in the policies, legislation, programmes and development plans of the country, Trí said.\nThe Law on Environmental Protection was approved by the National Assembly in 2014.\n“It was the first time climate change response was enshrined in law, with 25 provisions in 10 articles in Chapter IV.”\nHowever, after five years of implementation, the legal framework for responding to climate change should be further improved to meet the demands of the new situation, he said.\nTrí suggested supplementing two clauses to Article 39 of the law. These clauses consist of climate change response, including human activities to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; climate change response associated with sustainable development and strengthening the resilience of the natural and social systems.\nHe also proposed adding some other clauses including those encouraging the collection, recycling, use or destruction of ozone depleting substances or controlled by the Montreal Protocol in civil and industrial refrigeration appliances when they are no longer in use.\nAddressing the workshop, Đào Anh Dũng, vice chairman of Cần Thơ City’s People’s Committee, said, like other localities in the country, the city was suffering from the impacts of climate change. It was reflected in the fact that extreme weather occurred more regularly.\n“High tides and river bank erosion has seriously affected the lives and production of local residents,” he said.\nMarcel Reymond, head of the Economic Cooperation Embassy of Switzerland in Việt Nam, said due to climate change, the Mekong Delta region suffered from US$130 to $190 million in damage every year.\n“It was essential for Việt Nam to further strengthen its legal frameworks and policy as well as improve technical standards to have an integrated implementation process,” he said, adding that the integration must be done separately at different levels from the Government, scientists, experts and communities.\nLâm Văn Bi, vice chairman of Cà Mau Province’s People’s Committee, proposed the Government allow the province to pilot the capital mobilisation of enterprises involved in climate change response and erosion control in the province. Accordingly, enterprises could exploit a certain land area to compensate the construction of the works they invested in the locality. — VNS'",0

Many banks had to sell bad debts to VAMC so they could take the debts off\xa0their balance sheet to have a bad debt ratio of below 3 per cent as required by the central bank and could continue their operations as normal banks.\nBy selling the debts to VAMC, instead of money, banks received five-year special bonds from VAMC. During the five years, banks had to make provisions of 20 per cent for special bonds each year. In principle, this affects banks’ annual profits.\nCurrently, the list of banks which have cleared all bad debts at VAMC includes\xa0Vietcombank, VIB, Techcombank, TPBank, MB, OCB, Nam A Bank and Kiên Long Bank.\nWhen the on-balance sheet bad debt ratio at banks is low and banks have gained fairly high profits in recent years, the trend of buying back bad debts to clear debts at VAMC is becoming more popular.\nIn the first nine months of the year, Kiên Long Bank’s core businesses were positive, with total assets rising by 10.8 per cent against the end of last year to VNĐ46.87 trillion and pre-tax profit up 6 per cent year-on-year to VNĐ236 billion.

Since nearing the 1,025 point level on November 11, the VN-Index has fallen a total of 4.6 per cent.\nIn the last three trading weeks, investors tried to earn profits from stocks’ rally, especially large-caps, Trần Đức Anh, director of macroeconomics and market strategy at KB Vietnam Securities Co (KBSV), said.\nThe VN-Index had rallied between the end of October and the beginning of November, with strong growth of large-cap firms, he told tinnhanhchungkhoan.vn.\nIn addition, negative developments of US-China trade relations and the crisis in Hong Kong impacted both Vietnamese and regional stock markets, Anh added.\nIn the large-cap VN30 basket, which tracks the performance of the 30 largest stocks by market value and trading liquidity, top listed firms such as dairy producer Vinamilk (VNM), Vietcombank (VCB), brewer Sabeco (SAB) and Vingroup (VIC) saw their prices fall from the previous week’s ends.\nVinamilk shares dropped total 2.3 per cent, Vietcombank shares shed 6.0 per cent, Sabeco shares tumbled 7.1 per cent, and Vingroup shares lost 2.8 per cent.\nThe declines of large-cap stocks had brought them to more attractive price levels and the market trading would improve\xa0in the coming week, Anh said.\nNguyễn Trung Du, director of investment services at VNDirect Securities Corp (VNDS), said the market had suffered cumulative losses for the last three trading weeks and that interrupted the market’s uptrend.\nAs the market entered its correction phase, any gains would only be technical and temporary, he warned.\nInvestors had taken a cautious stance as they worried the global economy would struggle in 2020, Du said.\nThat concern forced them to act early to prepare for any potential risks, therefore, selling pressure would drag the domestic market down in the short term, he said.\nToo soon for Q4 earnings hunt\nOne of the factors that could drive the market back to its uptrend is the hunt for listed firms with fourth-quarter earnings prospects.\nBut it was too soon for investors to do so, KBSV expert Anh warned. “Hunting stocks based on the companies’ Q4 earnings prospects is too risky.”\n“It is only possible if investors have concrete access to corporate information and assessment that show companies are likely to grow in the last quarter of the year,” he said.\nPhan Dũng Khánh, director of investment consultancy at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said as the VN-Index had lost its important support levels of 1,000 and 980 points, any rebounds would be the chances for investors to re-shape their portfolios.\nIt meant selling pressure would remain strong in the short term as investors would try to balance their cash-asset ratios and keep them secure, especially those using large volumes of margin lending, he said.\nIt would be safer if investors waited for the market to settle down after the short-term downtrend ended, Khánh said.\nIn its weekly report, Bảo Việt Securities Co (BVSC) said: “The market is expected to face declining pressure early next week and retest the support of 965-971 points, where a recovery is expected toward market close.”\n“After the recent plunge, the market’s downward momentum remains high, therefore, the market’s rebounding efforts will face various challenges from previous breakout zones.”\nThe VN-Index might drop to the strong medium support zone of 940-945 points, BVSC forecast. — VNS",2

1523,'Việt Nam needs little more time to achieve 90-90-90',"'Eamonn Murphy (middle) meets with patients receiving\xa0methadone treatment at a health clinic\xa0in Tân Yên District, Bắc Giang Province.\xa0— VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nViệt Nam News reporter Khoa Thư talks to Eamonn Murphy, Regional Director of UNAIDS, Asia and the Pacific, about the opportunities and challenges facing the elimination of HIV as a public health threat by 2030\nOver the past decade, Việt Nam has witnessed a decline in the number of new HIV cases and AIDS-related deaths. 2020 is the deadline set for the ambitious goal of 90-90-90 by the UN. How do you assess the country’s performance in the fight against HIV/AIDS and its chances to achieve the goal?\n90-90-90 is a set of treatment-focused targets to move the agenda faster, saying 90 per cent of those living with HIV know their status, 90 per cent are receiving treatment and 90 per cent on treatment have viral suppression which stops forward transmission.\nYes, these are ambitious targets. But if we don’t set ambitious targets we are not pushing the agenda.\nWith a communicable disease like HIV, we need ambitious targets to get community control.\nViệt Nam has set these targets and is doing very well in terms of working toward these targets. Viral suppression is very high, you may achieve the target there.\nViệt Nam is also innovative in testing; self-testing for example.\nIf you are afraid to go to health services, to a doctor or healthcare worker, even sometimes to an NGO, having a test at home means you know your status and if you’ve got HIV then you know you can access treatment.\nSocial health insurance is another innovation to make treatment available locally and with subsidised costs so more people can get it.\nThe viral suppression and the message about U=U (Undetectable=Untransmittable) are to encourage people why they should access it early.\nViệt Nam has set in place the right, sustainable programme to achieve these ambitious targets.\nIt just needs a little more time than 2020.\nViệt Nam wants to put an end to the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Based on your evaluation, what are the challenges facing Việt Nam?\nViệt Nam recognises that the epidemic is changing. In response, the country is innovating and changing its programmes including bringing in PrEP(pre-exposure prophylaxis).\nThailand was the first country in the region to use PrEP. Việt Nam is overtaking Thailand because it recognises the importance of the new tool of prevention as we don’t want people to be on HIV treatment for life.\nThe social dynamic of young people has also been well recognised. A community participation organisation (CPO) in HCM City, for example, found up to 77 per cent of approached young MSM (men having sex with men) have never accessed testing or services.\nWith the support of the Government, they can improve the programme to reach people.\nIt is also critical to have political leadership and services to continue to innovate across the board and to maintain that leadership and service innovations.\nViệt Nam’s achievements have been built on a sustainable base. There are some countries with better outcomes but it’s all thanks to foreign donors. That’s why I think Việt Nam can achieve the end of HIV as a public health threat by 2030.\nA patient gets ARV HIV drugs. — VNA/VNS Photo\nSince March 2019, HIV sufferers in Việt Nam have been switching to ARVs covered by social healthcare insurance, making Việt Nam one of a few countries in the world that allocates social insurance funds to pay for HIV/AIDS treatment. What do you think about the change in terms of efficiency and sustainability?\nThe move has made HIV treatment and hopefully later some of the prevention available through the public system through insurance.\nBecause your economy is thriving, foreign funding is now moving to more disadvantaged countries.\nThe government needs to both encourage and support people to continue treatment.\nIt is also important to set the goal of having a separate HIV programme in the general health system that fights against stigma and discrimination, as healthcare workers need to understand the issue to make sure clients are comfortable to come and stay in the services.\nOtherwise, we’re going to push people underground and the epidemic will rebound.\nIt has been not even a year since the change and the Government reviews how it is operating every month. We should be aware of the need to continually refine and change the nature of the programme to best serve clients and push back HIV.\nThe World AIDS report 2019 released on November 26 stressed upon the role of communities in prevention and control of HIV/AIDS. What are your recommendations for Việt Nam’s society to accelerate their involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS?\nViệt Nam needs to further strengthen its partnership with communities via social contract which is not just for HIV but many other health issues.\nThe Government should start funding CPOs working in this field which support HIV-infected people who need lifetime treatment and accelerate HIV/AIDS prevention.\nSuccessful countries have shown many experiences in building partnerships with communities, non-profit and private sectors in helping deliver services because it cannot be done solely by the Government’s health system. — VNS'",1

Among them, 6,136 were at least the third child\xa0in their families, rising by 254 compared to the previous year.\nGender inequality was\xa0falling but the third-child birthrate had shown\xa0an increase, said Tạ Quang Huy, the director of the municipal Department of Population and Family Planning.\nDistricts with high birthrates\xa0included\xa0Hoàng Mai, Đông Anh, Hoài Đức and Cầu Giấy.\nThe country's basic policy encourages parents to have two children per family.\nWith a long-standing cultural preference for boys, couples who have only daughters always want\xa0a son because many believe that only sons can\xa0be responsible for worshipping their ancestors and maintaining\xa0lineage.\nIn fact, many Vietnamese families want to have more children, especially due to better economic conditions, so they\xa0decide to have a third child.\nIn many cases, these\xa0families are cadres or civil servants who are familiar with the State’s policies and laws.\nNguyễn Thế Mạnh (not his real name), 59, a construction engineer from Hà Nội’s Ba Đình District, said he was very happy when he had\xa0a son.\n“I have three daughters already. But I still want to have more\xa0children and especially a son. Seven years ago, my wife gave birth to our\xa0fourth child at the age of 47, and I was so happy because it was a boy,” Mạnh said.\n“I was demoted in my job but it did not make me sad. I had the son I wished for.”\nThe third child ratio was a problem as\xa0the city was looking to maintain a\xa0reasonably low birth rate and control\xa0the gender ratio at birth, according to Huy.\nDr Nguyễn Đình Cử, former director of the Population and Social Affairs Institute at the\xa0National Economics University, said for a long time, people thought that the imbalanced\xa0sex ratio at birth was mainly due to poor and\xa0uneducated mothers, but in fact, this is\xa0not true.\nMany rich families and well educated parents found\xa0out the sex of the babies while the mothers were pregnant and decided whether\xa0to continue the pregnancy depending on the results, generally meaning they were\xa0hoping for\xa0a boy, according to Cử.\nHà Nội Mới (New Hà Nội) newspaper reported that recent census results conducted by\xa0the General Department of Population and Family Planning at the\xa0Ministry of Health\xa0showed\xa0the lowest sex ratio at birth among\xa0illiterate mothers was\xa0about 107 boys per 100 girls.\nThis rate gradually increases to 114 boys per 100 girls among more educated mothers. In rich families, the sex ratio at birth is 112:100, while the\xa0rate in\xa0poor families is 105:100.\nThe surveys also showed the gender imbalance particularly increases among\xa0families with a third child.\nFor the first birth, the sex ratio is 109.7:100,\xa0while this rate rises to\xa0111.9:100 for\xa0the second birth. But at the third birth, the sex ratio stands at 119.7:100.\nAlthough appreciating the achievements of\xa0the city's population and family planning efforts\xa0over the years, Dr Hoàng Đức Hạnh, deputy director of Hà Nội's Health Department, said it was necessary to continue implementing measures to control the gender imbalance, particularly the third-child birthrate.\nRaising\xa0awareness of the problem and changing\xa0public attitudes was also needed to ensure families only had two children, he said.\nSupervision at all levels regarding the sex selection\xa0at health facilities, especially non-public health facilities, should also be strengthened.\nThe municipal Department of Population and Family Planning would\xa0continue\xa0to focus on communication campaigns, counselling and direct dialogue with couples of reproductive age, while\xa0supplying contraceptives, according to Huy.\nThe steering committee for population and family planning in districts and\xa0towns would\xa0also strengthen supervision in\xa0localities with a high rate of third child births.\nNguyễn Thị Ngọc Lan, deputy director general of the General Department of Population and Family Planning, said\xa0that a key solution to preventing the gender imbalance at birth was to promote gender equality and women's empowerment\xa0as well as men's participation in\xa0gender equality.\nIn particular, actions were needed to show\xa0children they are equal, whether they are boys or girls.

In addition, it also creates a gap between the domestic price for fuel and that of the international market which may encourage certain fraudulent activities and cross-border smuggling.\nThe Government, however, has always maintained that the fund serves as a tool to manage the domestic fuel price and is a necessity to make sure the interests of consumers and businesses are protected. The fund is part of efforts to keep fuel prices in line with market mechanisms under the State management and help control inflation and stabilise the macroeconomy.\nIn the last five years, the domestic fuel price had been well-regulated as fuel trading activities became more transparent and efficient, said Tuấn, adding that the new decree was to continue building on the existing legal mechanisms while trying to address a number of shortcomings and limitations.\nIn order to do so, the ministry would carry out large-scale surveys among fuel traders to gather inputs and opinions on how to improve current regulations. Business conditions would also be cut to help new players gain entry to domestic fuel trading market and minimise resource waste.\nAccording to a ministry report, the fund spent over VND1.7 trillion (US$73 million) to maintain a stable fuel price during the second quarter of 2019 alone. — VNS'",2

She, however, kept screaming “I am wronged, I am wronged” after the jury delivered its verdict.\nTrần Thị Hiền (middle) was found guilty of dealing narcotics at\xa0a trial on Wednesday. VNA/VNS Photo\nBùi Văn Công, 44, Lương Văn Hùng, 28, Vì Thị Thu, 37 and her husband Vì Văn Toán, 37, admitted the same offence, which meant the former receive a 20-year jail term while the other three were handed lifetime sentences.\nThe court heard that Hiền met Công in May 2017 asking to buy four packs of heroin, which was quoted by Công at a total of VNĐ640 million (US$27,800).\nThe man later went to the drugs supplier Thu to order the drugs, but she only managed to bring home two packs from the Việt Nam-Laos border and asked her husband Toán to look after them.\nIn late May, 2017, Công and Hùng dropped by Thu’s house to take the heroin and delivered them to Hiền. She at the time paid Công VNĐ290 million in cash and owed him VNĐ30 million.\nWhile Toán, Công and Hùng already received life sentences for drug offences, they should also face another trial for their murder of Hiền’s daughter – the 22-year-old Cao Mỹ Duyên – that shocked the entire nation earlier\xa0this year.\nĐiện Biên People’s Procuracy last week decided to prosecute nine people for separate crimes of kidnapping, rape and murder in the case. The prosecutors said they were seeking the death penalty for six defendants.\nAccording to police investigation, Công, driven by a wish to get his VNĐ30 million back from Hiền, decided to take an offer from Toán to kidnap Duyên.\nToán, whom Hiền alledgely owed VNĐ300 million for drugs since 2009, thought the woman would have paid him the money in order to save her daughter. Hiền refused to do so.\nOn January 4, 2019 – Lunar New Year's eve, after taking the girl to his house, Công and his gang, including Phạm Văn Nhiệm, 43, Lường Văn Lả, 26, Lường Văn Hùng, 28 and Phạm Văn Dũng, 47, were believed to have taken turns to repeatedly rape Duyên for three consecutive days.\nTwo other men, Vương Văn Hùng, 35 and Cầm Văn Chương, 45, alledgedly raped the victim once in the early hours of February 7 before she was strangled to death and left at an abandoned house near Công’s house.\nCông’s wife, Bùi Thị Kim Thu, 44, witnessed the girl being raped and killed by the men, but kept silent and did not call the police. She was prosecuted for failure to report criminals.\nThe date for the trial is yet to be confirmed. — VNS",1

The delegation of 50 Swedish firms wishes to discuss not only business partnerships but also sustainable development, she said.\nChairwoman Ngân noted that Sweden is an important partner of Việt Nam in the EU, with bilateral trade reaching $1.5 billion in 2018. Meanwhile, Sweden now has 67 investment projects worth $364 million in Việt Nam.\nThese figures remained modest and had yet to match the full potential of co-operation, she said, noting her hope that the businesses accompanying the Princess would have opportunities to learn about the local investment-business climate.\nThe NA leader said she believed once the EU-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) is signed and ratified, bilateral trade would increase.\nThe host also affirmed that Việt Nam was reforming its legal and administrative systems to create a solid legal framework and fair environment for foreign businesses, including Swedish firms, to operate.\nAt the meeting, members of the Swedish delegation noted more than 50,000 tourists from their country came to Việt Nam last year, and Swedish companies have created more than 120,000 jobs here.

Photo VietinBank\nHÀ NỘI The Vietnamese insurance market is heating up with many high-value bancassurance deals and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) unveiled recently.\nRoughly half a dozen big names, including Allianz, Nippon Life, MS&AD Insurance, Sun Life Financial and Manulife Financial Corp are vying to buy the Vietnamese and Singaporean businesses of Britain’s Aviva, Reuters cited people with knowledge of the matter as saying last week.\nAccording to the sources, who declined to be named as the talks are confidential, the combined deal value for the businesses is estimated to be between US$2 billion and $2.5 billion. Talks were at an early stage and terms could change, they said.\nIn Việt Nam, Aviva started operating in the life insurance in 2011. It was formerly known as VietinBank Aviva – a joint venture between Aviva and Commercial Joint Stock Bank for Industry and Trade of Vietnam (VietinBank).\nAs of April 2017, Aviva completed the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in VietinBank and officially wholly owned the unit. It signed an exclusive 18-year agreement to distribute life insurance products through VietinBank’s network. Thus, if the transfer is successful, VietinBank will have a new partner.\nCommercial Joint Stock Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (Vietcombank) is also likely to announce an insurance distribution agreement with a foreign partner in the near future as it was reported that Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li’s FWD Group has surpassed many rivals, including Prudential, to co-operate with Vietcombank.\nVietcombank is expected to receive an initial payment of about $400 million from the deal and could get more based on the performance of the business. Previously, Bloomberg estimated that the total agreed value may reach $1 billion, the biggest bancassurance deal to date.\nMeanwhile, it was reported that Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam (BIDV) is also exploring selling its stake in a life insurance joint venture with MetLife Inc.\nIn early September, two life insurance firms with large market shares in Việt Nam, including Prudential and Manulife, also officially announced their new banking partners.\nOn September 9, Asia Commercial Joint Stock Bank (ACB) and Manulife held a signing ceremony for a co-operation agreement on the distribution of insurance products. Accordingly, during the initial rollout, ACB customers will have access to Manulife’s two key life insurance products – one unit-linked and the other a critical illness product called ‘Enhance’.\nOn the same day, Prudential Vietnam Assurance also signed a bancassurance agreement with Korea’s Shinhan Bank Vietnam Ltd to distribute its life insurance solutions. Shinhan is the seventh bank in Prudential’s bancassurance network.\nExperts have so far remained upbeat about the Vietnamese insurance industry’s health in the coming years, forecasting that it would maintain an annual double digit growth rate. The insurance industry expects a growth rate of 20 per cent this year.\nThe fast-growing domestic insurance market should thrive thanks to rising living standards and a high gross domestic product (GDP) growth of more than 6 per cent annually over the next three years, experts said.\nThe growth potential is great as the country has one of the world’s lowest life insurance penetration levels at less than 1 per cent of GDP. The average insurance premium in Việt Nam stands at $30, much lower than the global average of $595 and Southeast Asia’s average of $74.\nThe Ministry of Finance’s Insurance Supervisory Authority reported that the country has 64 insurance companies, including 30 non-life insurers, 18 life insurers, two reinsurance companies and 14 insurance brokerage companies.

The central bank’s HCM City office has kept up with the movement of gold prices to deliver proper responses but actual demand and sales of gold and gold products are quite weak.”\nIn the remaining months of the year, international gold prices might not reach $2,000 an ounce while it might continue falling in a short period before going again in medium and long terms, investment consultant Phan Dũng Khánh at Maybank Kim Eng Securities Co said.\nGold might move between $1,500-1,600 an ounce or VNĐ42-45 million per tael. It was unlikely that gold would soar in the remaining period of the year, he said.\nBut the future movement of gold prices was still uncertain, analysts have said. Investors should not jump in the gold market at the moment especially if they had not kept a close watch on the gold prices. — VNS'",2

It chaired the negotiations and compilation of the council’s resolution on women and security peace.\nAs a representative of Asia, Việt Nam pushed the peaceful settlement of regional issues as well as matters in other regions like Africa and the Middle East.

It\'s important to be top in May.""\nCity\'s defensive deficiencies have been much publicised without the injured Aymeric Laporte so far this season and they crumbled as Liverpool scored with their first two attacks of the game.\nBut the visitors were furious with some justification at the move that led to the opening goal when a dangerous foray into the Liverpool box ended with the ball striking Trent Alexander-Arnold on the arm.\nInstead of City being awarded a penalty, the hosts broke down the other end and the ball fell to Fabinho on the edge of the area.\nThe Brazilian is not renowned for his goalscoring, but when invited to shoot by a hesitant City back line, he arrowed a strike beyond stand-in goalkeeper Claudio Bravo.\n""Ask to the referees, don\'t ask me,"" said City boss Pep Guardiola on the controversial opener. ""I would like to talk about our performance. It was one of my proudest performances as (Man City) manager.""\nThe visitors had more of the ball and plenty of chances even in between Liverpool\'s early blitz as Raheem Sterling headed wide Kevin De Bruyne\'s in-swinging free-kick.\nBut it was Liverpool who were ruthless as a pinpoint cross by Andy Robertson was headed home on the bounce by Salah.\n""I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a goal like it,"" said Klopp of his side\'s second. ""It was wild, intense from the first second.\n""You could sense it was really important for both teams. We scored two incredible goals, but we had to suffer in moments because of the way City played.""\nDamage done\nCity went on to enjoy the better of the play in the remainder of the first half, but the damage was already done.\nA purposeful burst forward by Angelino saw his deflected shot come back off the post before Sergio Aguero then dragged City\'s best chance of a reply before the break wide after great work by De Bruyne.\nAny hope of a City comeback was eliminated six minutes into the second half when Jordan Henderson\'s teasing cross was met with a diving header by Mane, although Bravo could have done better to stop the ball creeping over the line.\nGuardiola\'s mood was not improved when another VAR check went against his side after Sterling went down in the area under pressure from Mane.\nCity finally got the goal much of their approach play had threatened when Bernardo Silva swept home Angelino\'s cross 12 minutes from time, but it was too little, too late.\n""Today we showed in the most difficult stadium in the world the reason why we are champions,"" said a defiant Guardiola.\n""There are three teams in front of us that have more chances to win the Premier League than us, but hopefully we can sustain this mentality and try it.""\nLiverpool agonisingly missed out on the title by a solitary point last season as City ended the season on a 14-match winning run to edge a titanic tussle.\nGuardiola\'s men will need to produce something similarly spectacular in the months to come, but after quickly making up for the disappointment of the title race by wining the Champions League last season, Liverpool look destined to go one better this time round. — AFP'",3

The US’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a warning about a hike in mumps as more than 700 cases were recorded in the country.\nHoàng Đức Hạnh, deputy director of Hà Nội’s Health Department, said conditions were ripe for a lot of epidemics from other localities to enter Hà Nội.\nPreventive measures\nPhu, the director of Preventive Health Department, said the ministry has learned from previous disease prevention and combat efforts.\nPriority has been given to early detection of infections from international border gates and at community and health care centres.\nOnce a suspicious case was detected, the infected people must be isolated for immediate treatment, he said.\nNguyễn Nhật Cảm, director of Hà Nội Disease Control Centre said the city had five mobile teams for disease prevention and combat and each district had its own teams.\nUpon receiving information about suspected cases of infection, the team would arrive at the scene and employ appropriate measures, he said.\nThe city also monitors passengers entering through Nội Bài airport, especially those coming from disease-affected areas.\nTo prevent the epidemic from spreading, localities should launch campaigns to raise knowledge for enterprises and people on the diseases, Cảm said.\nWhen infections were detected among students, teachers and school employees, hygienic disinfection is a must to minimise the spread of germs, he said.\n""Strict punishment will be imposed on any individuals or units who are found hiding epidemics or failing to comply with supervision measures and isolation,” Cảm said. — VNS'",1

That good relationship is constantly being strengthened and developed which is shown in positive economic data.\nTo date, Việt Nam has established diplomatic relations with 69 of 70 countries in the Middle East – Africa region and has economic ties with all countries with two-way trade turnover of more than US$17.5 billion in 2018. This number represented a 300 per cent growth compared to 2008.\nVietnamese businesses have invested about $2.6 billion in this region and received more than $7 billion capital in form of foreign direct investment from these countries.\nThe two sides have also successfully set up many effective cooperation models including bilateral, tripartite and four-sided collaboration with support of a number of developed countries and international organisations.\nBright spots in economic cooperation between the two sides include agriculture, labour, telecommunication, healthcare and education.\nFurther deepening the cooperation with the Middle East – Africa region has always been one of the priorities in Việt Nam’s foreign policy.

The change could facilitate the introduction of a direct flight route from\xa0Việt Nam to the US.\nHowever, Bình pointed out some shortcomings in the first six months of the year.\nSome incidents still occurred such as thefts, passengers carrying weapons and dangerous items, the use of\xa0improper documents for flights, public disorder\xa0and assaults on\xa0aviation personnel.\nHe said the incidents were caused by legal loopholes,\xa0the failure to follow procedures and a\xa0shortage of airline staff.\xa0Lax management has also led to flight schedule violations and inadequate rest time for crew members between flights.\nMany airlines have been hiring foreign pilots, making it more difficult to standardise the employment of pilots.\nBình said State-trained pilots were a national\xa0resource.

Meanwhile, the rate of 9.35 US cents will be maintained for rooftop solar power projects.\nSpeaking with local media at the Energy Week 2019 which took place in Hà Nội on Tuesday, Deputy Director of the MoIT’s Renewable Energy Department Đỗ Đức Quân said the FiT is applied for a certain number of years in order to encourage renewable energy development in each period.\nHe said if the Prime Minister approved the MoIT’s new FiT programme, it will remain effective until December 31, 2021.\nThe new FiT rate is extremely important for Việt Nam’s renewable energy industry, challenging policymakers, Government ministries and agencies to head towards long-term research and assessing investment volume, which must harmonise benefits for all participants, ensuring the industry’s sustainable development.\nTo enjoy the Government’s price incentives, which ended on June 30 this year, the country witnessed nearly 90 solar power plants being put into operation with a total capacity of over 4,500MW in May and June, far exceeding the plan of only 850 MW of solar power in 2020 approved in the Power Development Master Plan VII (PDP VII), causing overloading on the national grid at certain distribution lines and at certain period of day time.\nAccording to Nguyễn Đức Cường, Director of the\xa0National Load Dispatch Centre (EVN NLDC), investors have been made aware of the overloading in a public and transparent manner.\n“We want to generate all power from renewable energy, because the price is high but it is still cheaper than thermal power sources,” Cường said.\nWe have put all efforts into ensuring solar plants are put into operation and add power to the national grid, however these plants have to reduce capacity due to the grid overload, which is something we did not expect,” Cường said.\nInsiders say that the first thing that needs to be done immediately is to find solutions for power transmission projects. If the overloading lasts for too long, all participants, including investors and power purchasers, will be impacted.\nIn the future, it is necessary for the MoIT, local governments, investors and the Vietnam Electricity to work together to solve this problem, especially in terms of site clearance to accelerate the progress of transmission projects, thereby freeing up the capacity of the plants and supplementing the country's electricity.\nThe MoIT has recently proposed the Government supplement the PDP\xa0VII, building power grid projects in the southern provinces of Bình Thuận and Ninh Thuận, which are the solar energy hubs of the country.\nIt’s expected that more projects will receive investment later this year and early next year.\nThe overloading of the grid is only one of the key challenges facing the Government and relevant ministries in building a sustainable renewal energy industry.\nAccording to Nguyễn Anh Tuấn, Director of the Renewable Energy Centre under the Institute of Energy, there are many things that must be solved to speed up the development of renewable energy as the country faces exhaustion of natural resources such as coal, oil and gas.\nHe said Việt Nam has significant potential to develop renewable energy, including small hydro, wind power, solar power, biomass, biogas, municipal solid waste and geo-thermal electricity. The assessment for investment must be based on three pillars of theoretical, technological and economic potential.\nThe potential of solar power is high because its price is good for investors. As for wind power, the potential of onshore wind power is relatively moderate because its buying price is low, while offshore wind potential has not yet been subject to scientific assessment and accurate figures because the cost of wind measurement is very high.\n“Understanding the potential and accurate assessment is relatively insufficient and the reliability is not high, leading to difficulties for the investors,” Tuấn said.\nTuấn said the biggest and most important challenge for renewable energy is production cost, which is still higher (without subsidy) than the traditional technologies used by coal, oil and gas industries.\n“The evidence is in solar power. We previously set development goals but did not have a good buying price mechanism, making it difficult to develop the sector. But since 2017, the Government issued the FiT at a price of 9.35 cents per kWh, and we saw booming construction of solar power plants and selling power to the State,” Tuấn said.\n“With other types of renewable technologies, if you have a reasonable electricity purchase policy, that ensures economic feasibility for investors, you will also see an increase in development,” Tuấn said.\nIn terms of technology, he said the development of infrastructure would be necessary. Most advanced technologies are currently imported, while the operation and supply service\xa0chains are not yet available.\n“The technologies are very expensive, but it's difficult for businesses to access capital sources. They can get investment capital from banks, however it is difficult for banks to assess the value and evaluate risks in renewable energy projects,” Tuấn said.\nUnder the Strategy of Renewable Energy Development to 2030, Việt Nam will engage all of its social resources for investment in renewable energy development, encouraging the development and use of renewable energy, and striving to raise the share of renewable energy in the national energy sector.\nThe strategy aims to reduce GHG emissions, as pledged under the Paris COP21 Agreement, by 5 per cent by 2020 and, with international assistance and support, by 25 per cent by 2030. It sets the target to increase the electricity output produced by renewable sources from approximately 58 billion kWh in 2015 to 101 billion kWh by 2020, and 186 billion kWh by 2030, as well as increasing the rate of households with solar energy equipment from 4.3 per cent in 2015 to approximately 12 per cent and 26 per cent by 2020 and 2030, respectively. — VNS",2

However, only 23 firms made it to the final assessment and those firms were the largest companies by market value.\nSome of the finalists were the Vietnam Dairy Products JSC (Vinamilk), insurer Bảo Việt Holdings and the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV).\nAccording to Nguyễn Viết Thịnh, CEO of the Vietnam Institute of Directors, only 11 companies last year had independent sustainable development reports, which was almost double the number recorded in 2017.

The country’s ambassador to Việt Nam, Elsbeth Akkerman, speaks to Việt Nam News about the visit and the bilateral relationship between the countries.\nWhat is the significance of the visit to Việt Nam by the Dutch Prime Minister?\nIn addition to PM Rutte, his delegation will include the Minister of Infrastructure and Water, Vice Minister of Agriculture, State Secretary of Finance, and more than 100 business representatives representing 70 companies in a number of areas in which the Netherlands and Việt Nam have close ties. And the purpose of the PM’s visit is to strengthen and broaden these ties.\nThe purpose of the visit also allows us to underline the economic relationship that goes way beyond 45 years. These economic ties have so far been in the field of agriculture, food security,\xa0water and climate change. These are topics that are very close to the hearts and minds of both Dutch and Vietnamese people because we are both open economies and delta countries, so for the large part the Netherlands and Việt Nam are below sea level and that very much heightens the impacts of climate change.\nThe visit will be an opportunity for him to underline the importance of the partnership with Việt Nam in a broader context. We are both committed to achieving the sustainable development goals and our ambitions in climate change. I found that Việt Nam is very focused on this, very dedicated and committed to this. I assume that our Prime Ministers will also talk a lot about these very important ambitions, not only for the Netherlands and Việt Nam but also for the rest of the\xa0world as these are global issues that matter to everybody.\nWill the Netherlands share with Việt Nam new ways to better adapt to climate change?\nWholeheartedly, yes. The Netherlands is and will continue to be partner of Việt Nam in climate change, both in mitigation as well as adaptation. And in relation to the latter, Prime Minister Phúc and Prime Minister Rutte will have a dialogue on agricultural transformation and the lessons that Việt Nam might take from our experiences. In that context, we will very closely work on circular approaches of agriculture and the adaptation of smart technologies so we are a partner for Việt Nam in that. It is so necessary that we exchange these experiences because this is part of global development and global challenges that we both have to face.\nThe Netherlands’ PM has initiated a movement to start an alliance of countries that are very much dedicated to climate change adaptation and the Prime Ministers and the ministers of both sides will have dialogue on Việt Nam being one of the partners in this coalition for climate change adaptation.\nCould you please highlight focal points in bilateral ties?\nWater and agriculture are the most visible. We have worked with the Vietnamese government, research institutes, provinces and localities on the drafting of the Mekong Delta Plan. And PM Phúc ordered Resolution 120 for the implementation of that plan, and that’s a great joint achievement. We are looking forward to taking on board the implementation of both the plan and the resolution. Other topics we are currently working on include maritime issues. You can see both in Hải Phòng and in HCM City, there are large facilities on shipbuilding, port management, inland water transport. If you use inland waterways instead of road transport, the impacts on the environment will be less. So in that sense we are working on smart ways of transport, and also achieving mutual ambitions to lessen negative pressure on the environment.\nThe population of Việt Nam is big and growing and there is an enormous flow of people from the countryside to urban areas. The Netherlands is a small country and we don’t have as many people as Việt Nam but we also know about dense population and urbanisation so here we seek cooperation with Việt Nam as a whole and with large cities like HCM City and Hà Nội. So we talk about lighting, urban mobility, and access to services. These are also the future fields of co-operation where we can find help from smart technologies.\nWhat are your priorities during your term to further promote the bilateral relationship?\nIt’s very important of course to foster the bilateral relationship, but in such a way that companies and private actors contribute to public goals. The explicit policy of the Dutch Government is that companies do their business in a sustainable way. There is nothing wrong with making profit, but not at the cost of people and the planet. So do it in a balanced way and make sure that when you earn your money you take care of the environment, both the natural and societal environment.\nThis will be the cause of my involvement. It is very necessary to engage businesses, research institutes, Government officials, representatives of civil society organisations so that we come up with smart and sustainable solutions.\nFor me as an ambassador, I have an eye for talent and skills development of young people to ensure that young people can use their talent and creativity to contribute to the further development of Việt Nam; and an eye on inclusiveness and diversity.

The province now has about 95 solar power investors. — VNA/VNS Photo\xa0Nguyễn Thanh\nViệt Nam News\xa0talks to Vietnamese and Danish lawmakers and experts about barriers that Việt Nam has faced in energy transition to reach sustainable development goals, experience from Denmark and the two countries’ partnership in the field.\nLê Hồng Tịnh, vice chairman of National Assembly’s Committee of Science, Technology and Environment\nViệt Nam has followed the global trend of developing renewable energy. Located in the equatorial zone, Việt Nam has a natural advantage in solar power. In the context that hydropower potentials are\xa0running out and imported coal pollutes the environment, it is a priority of Việt Nam to implement wind and solar power policies.\nHowever, if solar power develops at a too rapid speed, it will cause an imbalance in the power system. A cloud blocking the sun can interrupt the system.\nEuropean countries have their power system connected to a general European network. When the grid of one country is interrupted, they buy electricity from the general regional power system. Unlike Việt Nam, the power system is not connected to any regional network. Therefore in case of interrupted transmission, it is difficult to find alternative sources of energy.\nViệt Nam has revised the Law on Electricity, Law on Economical and Efficient Use of Energy and related laws to attract and encourage the public to engage in using renewable energy.\nThe Vietnam Electricity has offered assistance of VNĐ1 million (US$43) for each household installing solar-powered water heaters. Now we have to adopt policies in which families can sell extra solar power on their roofs to integrate into the national grid.\nWe need also an electricity tax policy. The National Assembly has conducted studies to work with the Ministry of Industry and Trade to make amendments and supplements to related laws.\nProfessor Trần Đình Long, full member of International Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences, vice president of Việt Nam Electrical Engineering Association\nViệt Nam has not mapped out an appropriate plan for national electricity structure in the long term. Việt Nam used to target a low proportion of renewable energy in the plan. After that, following the global trend, the proportion of renewable energy has been adjusted to increase.\nThe percentage of renewable energy accounted for in the national electricity structure needs comprehensive planning on power sources and grids.\nExperience from around the world including European countries, China and\xa0India shows renewable energy policies start from feed-in tariff and preferential treatment for clean energy. Việt Nam needs to conduct insightful research to adopt a general appropriate feed-in tariff policy. This must answer questions of how electricity prices are supported, through loans or preferential import-export policies.\nDr Vũ Minh Pháp, Institute of Energy Science, Việt Nam Academy of Science and Technology\nThe barrier of Việt Nam is weakness in technology quality inspection. Technologies of solar and wind power from global manufacturers have entered Việt Nam at a rapid speed. However, there is no Vietnamese unit in charge of inspecting these devices to check whether the technologies are well suited to the Vietnamese environment. Another barrier is that there has been no study in Việt Nam that finds proper answers to the question of how to treat waste after solar and wind power projects reach their end of life.\nSteen Gade, former member of Danish Parliament, former chairman of the Climate, Energy and Building Committee\nI think Việt Nam needs to combine energy politics with climate issues. Việt Nam needs to combine economic growth with a very strong environmental and climate agenda.\nDenmark has experience in involving people. It has been the centre in Denmark when we need high prices of energy, we discuss in public, in media, in organisations, among ordinary people to find out the best\xa0solution.\nIn Denmark, local farmers in rural areas made co-operatives where they own wind mills and they can sell wind power to the grid. That means it was an economic benefit for farmers, at the same time, it started the process of renewable energy. We combine economy and environment and we focus on renewable energy. We have developed action between people, topic discussions, media, education and politics.\nAton Beck, director of global co-operation, Danish Energy Agency\nWe have very good co-operation with the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade and the electricity of renewable energy authority on how to ensure more renewable energy in Việt Nam's system. On November 4th, we will launch a new Việt Nam’s energy outlook that will look into different kinds of scenarios for the long-term transition in Việt Nam. There is definitely a huge potential for wind, solar energy and biomass in Việt Nam.\nNext year, Denmark will have more than 50 per cent of our electricity consumption based on wind. We can integrate it into our system. In 2028, we will have 100 per cent of electricity consumption based on wind.\nDenmark has some good experience and we would like to share with Việt Nam.\nViệt Nam has\xa0very successful economic growth but it also creates challenges in the energy sector including higher energy demand, higher dependence on coal, higher emissions of greenhouse gases and higher dependence on importing energy with dramatic increase in energy import.\nWe have good co-operation with the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade to ensure that Việt Nam has the right framework for having international developers coming to Việt Nam to invest. That is really important that you have transparent and simple framework conditions for renewable energy developers. — VNS",4

3731,'Renewable sources must be close to consumers',"'Visitors at the Vietnam Solar Power Expo 2019 held on September 25-26. - Photo Vietnam Solar Power Expo\nHÀ NỘI — Renewable power facilities should be built in localities where strong consumption exists and electricity transmission is direct to avoid power loss, business leaders said on Wednesday.\nRising demand for renewable energy in Việt Nam has sometimes overloaded the national power grid as power is connected to the grid but not distributed immediately to consumers.\nPhan Ngọc Ánh, Director of Alena Energy Co Ltd, said Việt Nam has its own 500kV grid but the expansion of the grid network cannot meet the development of renewable energy.\nRenewable energy facilities are often built in areas where no industrial zones exist, which is a big source of output consumption, he said.\n“Renewable energy sources, especially solar power, should focus on industrial hubs so power is consumed constantly,” he told Việt Nam News at the Vietnam Solar Power Expo 2019.\nIn addition, the Government should construct the grid that connects power sources to the nearest consumers to make sure power is transmitted and used efficiently, he said.\n“Power storage is not a usual thing for solar farms because of high expenses, which will affect the projects’ operation.”\nProject developers and government agencies should think about how to maximise the use of renewable energies, not lower the prices to boost consumption, he suggested.\nSharing the view, Vũ Thắng, Vietnam Country Manager of Sungrow Power Supply Co Ltd, said investors must be smart when choosing the location of their projects.\nRenewable energy projects should be executed in areas that are not too distant from consumers, he said, adding investors must be able to optimise their resources.\nRegarding the feed-in-tariff (FiT) rate, which was 9.35 US cents as of June 30, 2019, both executives said the rate is quite attractive to investors because it ensures developers are profitable when building solar power projects in the country.\nBidding will make the price more beneficial to the national power group Electricity of Vietnam, given that the consumption of rooftop solar power is guaranteed for the next 20 years, Thắng said.\nThe Government must improve the transparency of its power purchase power agreements (PPAs) and contract expirations so that renewable energy developers, mostly private firms, are able to implement their projects quickly, Ánh said.\n“Building a solar power plant is fast compared to the policy making process. If the policy making is slower than plant construction, the development of the industry will lag behind its potential,” Ánh said.\nViệt Nam’s renewable energy industry is increasingly getting more attractive to investors.\nVincent Chan, international sales’ regional manager at Clenergy (Xiamen) Technology Co Ltd, is confident that there is still room for the growth of renewable energies in Việt Nam.\n“The Vietnamese Government has done very well and it will continue having very good policies,” he said.\nWhat will benefit the industry is less taxes imposed on imported components and devices used for solar power development, which will encourage the growth of solar projects in Việt Nam and lower the cost of construction for the projects, he added.\nTô Ngọc Sơn, deputy director of Asia-Africa Markets Department at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said at the two-day expo there are 82 solar power projects across the country with total capacity of 4,460MW, accounting for 10 per cent of total power production. Thirteen other projects are being completed and plan to begin operations in late 2019, adding 630MW to the country’s total output. — VNS'",2

The rates are higher than 27.4 per cent and 26.9 per cent in the previous survey conducted in June.\nThe survey also indicated many banks saw a reduction in credit risk in the third quarter. — VNS",2

VNA/VNS Photo Ánh Tuyết\nCẦN THƠ — A method that involves parents holding their babies to their bare chests has helped triplets born prematurely at the Obstetrics Hospital of Cần Thơ City gain weight and survive.\nThe Kangaroo Care method allows for warm skin-to-skin contact which helps maintain body temperature, respiration and digestion.\nDr Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Hà, deputy head of the hospital’s Neonatal Department, on Monday told Việt Nam News Agency that the babies, including one girl and two boys, were born via vaginal birth after 27 weeks of pregnancy on September 5. They weighed 1,100 grammes, 1,240 grammes and 1,200 grammes.\nBabies born prematurely and at such a low weight face risks such as respiratory failure, low blood glucose, neonatal infection and others, according to Hà.\nInitially, the hospital’s doctors used various methods including continuous nasal positive airway pressure before taking the babies to the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. Their respiration improved two days after treatment.\nAfter that, the newborns were taken to their mother’s room where doctors gave instructions in the Kangaroo Care method to their parents and grandparents.\nThe method improved the immunity of the babies, which were fed breast milk. The babies are now at a reasonable weight.\nThe hospital uses the Kangaroo Care method for premature babies as soon as possible after birth, according to Hà.\nThis method helped raise the survival rate of premature babies with low weight, she said. Doctors recommend the use of the Kangaroo Method until the children are nine months and 10 days old.\nMany obstetrics hospitals in the country have been using this method in an aim to reduce the neonatal mortality rate. Fifty per cent of all deaths in Việt Nam are from premature births.\nPremature newborns are born with immature organs, which lead to a high risk of mortality and difficulty adapting to the environment.\nEach year, more than 10,000 neonatal deaths occur in the country, according to UNICEF Việt Nam.\nIn 1997, Từ Dũ Obstetrics Hospital in HCM City set up a unit called Kangaroo Mother Care which has been used for more than 10,000 premature babies. This kind of care was initiated in 1978 by doctors in Colombia to solve a shortage of incubators. However, many countries, including developed countries, began to use it later. VNS'",1

Midfielder Đỗ Hùng Dũng broke through HCM City’s defence to send a perfect ball to captain Nguyễn Văn Quyết, whose close-range finish was blocked.\nMidfielder Phạm Đức Huy took his chance in the 13th minute but his shot was not strong enough to beat goalkeeper Nguyễn Thanh Thắng.\nHCM City answered with attempts by Đỗ Văn Thuận and Trần Phi Sơn. But goalie Phí Minh Long, who has just signed a three-year contract with Hà Nội, parried the shots.\nThe controversial goal happened in the 35th minute when Nguyễn Văn Dũng collided with keeper Thắng in front of his goal. Pape Omar Faye took the ball and opened the score for the hosts.\nHCM City players objected to the decision as they said Dũng brought Thắng down. But referee Nguyễn Đình Thái allowed the goal to stand.\nAll visiting players left the field in protest. After a few minutes they accepted the decision, returned and continued the game.\nJust a minute after the interval, former national player Quyết passed a ball to his young teammate Ngân Văn Đại who made it 2-0 for Hà Nội with a tap-in.\nSkipper Quyết scored a goal himself at the 75th\xa0minute after a one-two situation with Faye near the box.\nIt should have been more for Hà Nội if the crossbar did not deny two straight shots by Papa Ibou Kebe.\nHà Nội will play Quảng Nam in the final, searching for the only domestic title they don’t have in their collection.\nQuảng Nam came from behind against Becamex Bình Dương after their 2-1 win in an earlier semi-final match on Sunday.\nHà Minh Tuấn and Rodrigo Da Silva Dias shone in the match that they had to play away at Gò Đậu Stadium.\nBình Dương received strong home support but it also piled on the pressure that prevented them from opening attacks throughout the game.\nFormer V.League champions Quảng Nam dominated most of the first half with Nguyễn Anh Hùng and Hoàng Vũ Samson testing Bình Dương goalkeeper Trần Đức Cường many times but their finishes did not find the net.\nIt was, however, Bình Dương who opened the score with one of their rare attempts a minute before the break.\nA defender opened the attack from the left wing and provided a ball in the box where Wander Luiz just needed an easy touch to score.\nA short interval did not help Bình Dương change the situation, they still played in defence under Quảng Nam’s consecutive threatening attempts.\nStriker Tuấn stole the ball after a mistake by Bình Dương’s defence and levelled the score with a low finish in the 76th minute.\nEight minutes later Dias jumped high and nodded home the second goal for the visitors.\nBình Dương pushed up the pace of the match but it was too late to overthrow Quảng Nam.

VNA./VNS Photo Nguyễn Cường\nHÀ NỘI — The Politburo of the Communist Party of Việt Nam will continue implementing the 9th Party Central Committee’s Resolution 24-NQ/TW on ethnic affairs to boost development of minorities and mountainous areas.\nWhile progress has been made in the implementation of the resolution, there’s still room for improvement, according to the Politburo’s conclusion issued recently.\nThe execution of the resolution has resulted in positive changes in the local socio-economic situation and the lives of local people.\nThe income of ethnic minority people has been improved and the health and education sector in remote areas has been enhanced at the same time. Strong efforts have been made by locals preserving their culture and national identity.\nHowever, the Politburo also pointed out shortcomings in the implementation. Ethnic people still faced huge difficulties in their daily life. The rate of poor and near poor households remained high and the gap between the rich and the poor was increasing.\nThe Politburo blamed it on the fact that some policies enacted have failed to give priority to the socio-economic development of people in ethnic minority and mountainous areas.\nDue attention has not been paid to promote the potential and advantages of each region.\nThe lack of coordination between agencies in the implementation of some projects was also a problem.\nTo boost sustainable development, the Politburo emphasised the need to determine that ethnic tasks are important in the strategy of developing society and the economy of Việt Nam.\nLocal authorities and agencies were urged to complete the legal system relating to ethnic minority people.\nThey were asked to shift economic structure in line with market demand and mobilise resources to fully tap the potential of the relevant localities to reduce the gap with other regions.\nIt was necessary to enhance the quality of education in these areas.\nAccess to healthcare services for ethnic minority people should also be improved. A strategy on malnutrition prevention and combating should be set up as well as the one on enhancing health and stature among ethnic minority youth.\nAttention should be paid to strengthen human resource quality with a view to boosting the proportion of officials and employees who are from ethnic minority families in public administrative agencies. — VNS'",0

Việt Nam’s national pig herd has\xa0fallen 20 per cent compared to the same period last year.\nThe deadly swine disease was\xa0expected to continue depressing pork supplies towards the end of this year when many big festivals take place, including the New Year\xa0and Lunar New Year\xa0holidays, Ngọc said.\nIn addition, gasoline and oil prices which rose 2.22 per cent in October also contributed significantly to rising CPI. After two adjustments in October, A95 gasoline price increased VNĐ650 (three US cents) per litre, and E5 gasoline went up VNĐ360 per litre, contributing 0.1 per cent to the overall CPI rise.\nSince early this month, the domestic gas price has\xa0also increased to VNĐ24,000 ($1.03) per 12kg cylinder, up 7.6 per cent against September, following rises in the world gas prices which surged $72.5 per tonne to average\xa0$427.5 in October.\nGSO\xa0data revealed 10 out of 11 groups of commodities saw prices increase compared to the previous month, of which food and foodstuff grew 1.04 per cent; housing and construction materials was up 0.53 per cent; and traffic up 0.99 per cent.\nOther commodities including beverages and cigarettes,\xa0garments, footwear and hats,\xa0education,\xa0culture, entertainment and tourism,\xa0medicine and healthcare,\xa0and household appliances and goods\xa0increased by less than 0.3 per cent.\nOnly the price\xa0of postal services and telecommunications decreased by 0.06 per cent.\nIn October, the gold price index was down 0.57 per cent, in line with downward global trends which fell 1.26 per cent in the\xa0month due to positive signs from the US-China trade negotiations and the Fed\xa0possibly cutting rates to support the domestic economy. The domestic gold price is hovering around VNĐ42 million per tael (1.2 ounces).\nMeanwhile, the US dollar increased slightly by 0.03 per cent compared to the previous month thanks to abundant foreign currency reserves at\xa0the State Bank of Việt Nam.

The Government has issued a clear mechanism to encourage renewable energy development through an attractive feed-in tariff (FiT) pricing mechanism with long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and subsidies on related taxes to facilitate the mobilisation of funds for renewable energy projects.\nHowever, they also said the policy on electricity users has not yet been given due attention. The current PPAs are currently limited to signing with only one buyer of the Vietnam Electricity. Other contracts that allow power plants to sell their renewable-based generated electricity directly to large power consumers are only at the pilot implementation stage. They also said the existing FiT pricing mechanism in Việt Nam did not reflect the market price.\nThus, they recommended Việt Nam create attractive financial mechanisms to attract renewable energy power plants to participate in the energy balance and ancillary service market; specific regulations and mechanisms to control grid congestion, limiting curtailment of renewable energy sources in line with the trend of integrating high proportion of renewable energy; as well as regulations and mechanisms to encourage the installation of an energy storage system and to allow the participation of auxiliary service providers to increase the flexibility and reliability of the electricity system.\nRepresentatives of the workshop also suggested financial mechanisms to implement the Demand Response Programme (DR) and attractive financial regulations and mechanisms to enable the realisation of the virtual power plant (VPP) model.\nERAV Deputy Director Trần Tuệ Quang told the workshop that ERAV expected to receive ideas, comments\xa0and suggestions from technical experts as well as consultants, to evaluate and propose a suitable legal framework for the actual development of Việt Nam’s smart grid and electricity system. —\xa0VNS'",2

In just the last 12 months, WWF has fundraised US$40 million to work on circular economy projects in cities in Thailand, Việt Nam, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nAn estimated 60 per cent of plastic marine debris derives from urban centres is\xa0often carried to the ocean by rivers. While cities will rapidly increase their populace to account for two-thirds of the global population by 2050, they must urgently adopt smart solutions that reduce the collective impact of their prospering communities. This means preventing, minimising and managing plastic. Many good examples and initiatives are already underway; WWF seeks to accelerate these existing efforts by empowering cities around the world to become Plastic Smart.\nAt the Responsible Business Forum Singapore 2019, which was held on November 19, chairman of the People’s Committee of Phú Quốc Island District, Mai Văn Huỳnh; advisor to mayor of Patong Municipality, Thailand, Kumnung Sing-Eaim;\xa0and Mayor of Donsol, Philippines, Josephine Alcantara have signed the Declaration of Intent into WWF’s Plastic Smart Cities programme on behalf of their cities.\nThrough Plastic Smart Cities, WWF is building cities’ capacity to eliminate plastic pollution by 2030.

Plastic Smart Cities will strengthen action when it comes to preventing, measuring, and managing plastic waste at a local level. Our goal is to promote best practices around the world and to make sure that smart measures on plastic reduction and waste management are widely shared. With strong commitments from cities, governments and industry, we can end additional plastics in nature and ensure the safety of our communities and the environment.”\nAccording to key statistics on plastic pollution given by WWF, eight million tonnes of plastic pollution ends up in the ocean every year.\nOverall carbon emissions from the plastic life cycle are expected to increase by 50 per cent, while the carbon increase from plastic incineration is set to triple by 2030, due to wrong waste management choices.\nAn additional 104 million metric tonnes of plastic is at risk of leakage into our ecosystems by 2030 without a drastic change in approach.\nSince 2000, the world has produced as much plastic as all the preceding years combined, a third of which is leaked into nature.\nMore than 270 wildlife species have been documented as having been harmed by entanglement, while more than 240 species have been found to have ingested plastics, according to WWF. — VNS'",4

The fruits are harvested two or three times a year, and the average annual yield is 40 – 50 tonnes per hectare.\nAt the current price of VNĐ10,000 per kilogramme, the annual income per hectare is VNĐ400 – 500 million (US$17,300 – 21,600), according to farmers.\nNguyễn Thi, who has a 2,000sq.m orchard in Ninh Phước District’s Phước Dân Town, said he harvested nine tonnes in the last crop and earned VNĐ70 million ($3,000).\nTraders came to his farm and bought the fruit at VNĐ8,000 – 12,000 per kilogramme, he said.\nThe initial cost of farming 1,000sq.m of jujubes is around VNĐ25 million ($1,080), including the cost of seedlings and input materials.\nThe province has 1,020ha under the fruit, mostly in Ninh Phước, Ninh Sơn and Ninh Hải districts and Phan Rang – Tháp Chàm City.\nIt plans to increase this to 1,200ha next year and annual output to 54,000 tonnes, according to its Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\nPhạm Dũng, head of the province’s Plant Cultivation and Protection Sub-department, said value chains comprising co-operatives and co-operative groups are being developed.\nThe province is also zoning areas that grow the fruit to Vietnamese good agricultural practices (VietGAP) or organic standards, he said.\nMany farmers use nets to cover their orchards during their fruiting period to protect them from pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly, or Medfly.\nThe insect causes severe damage to jujubes by laying eggs in them. When the eggs develop into larvae, they eat the fruits.\nBesides controlling pests, the nets also protect the fruits from strong winds, rains and sunshine.\nThe quality of jujubes in net-covered orchards is vastly superior since farmers are not afraid of pests and let them ripen properly on the tree before harvesting them.\nThe department in co-operation with localities encourages farmers to adopt this technique and transfers techniques to farmers for growing Táo Bom NT 05, a new jujube variety.\nThe variety, created by the province’s Nha Hố Research Institute for Cotton and Agriculture Development, is green when ripe, crunchy and two to three times larger than other varieties.\nTo diversify jujube products, the province has support policies for businesses producing syrups, jams, wines, and juices.\nIt is developing a tourism model that involves visits to jujube orchards, which will also enable farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers and get extra incomes from providing tourism services.\nThe province has identified the fruit as one of its 12 key products. – VNS'",1

""You cannot concede three goals in every game.""\nIn a first half of precious little good football it was fitting the opener arrived in scrappy fashion as Ogbonna\'s attempted header came off his shoulder and deflected off Martinelli to wrong-foot Bernd Leno in the Arsenal goal.\nBut one moment changed the course of the game when Sead Kolasinac burst down the left and crossed low for Martinelli to slot home his eighth goal of the season after impressing in the League Cup and Europa League.\nSuddenly the confidence which Emery and Ljungberg bemoaned had drained away from their players in recent times was restored, none more so than in Pepe, who cut inside onto his favoured left foot and curled into the top corner.\nPepe then turned provider for Aubameyang to slide in for his 13th goal of the campaign.\n""At half-time, Freddie told us to play with a higher tempo,"" said Aubameyang.\n""We have the quality in the squad, and if we believe in ourselves, we can go forward and win games.

The United Nations estimates that we have only 11 years left to head off irreversible damage to the Earth’s ecosystems.\nAnd it’s true that Greta does not try to sugarcoat the environmental crisis humans have created – she does sell fear – the fear that not only kids like her should have, but the fear adults themselves should come to terms with. We’ve seen the impacts of climate change already: more killer heat waves, more melting glaciers, more storms and droughts, and rising levels of greenhouse gases\xa0raising temperatures worldwide.\nIsn’t that\xa0scary?\nMany world leaders have acknowledged the science.\nOn September 23, in a video played at the Leaders for Nature and People Event hosted\xa0by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in New York, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc joined other leaders from around the globe in voicing their support for an emergency declaration for nature and people\xa0ahead of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly this month.\nIn his message, PM Phúc said Việt Nam always put\xa0climate change response, natural resources management and environmental protection in an important position in its resolutions\xa0and policies for development.\nIt is an urgent challenge, especially for Việt Nam, which is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.\nAccording to findings published last month by geographer Philip Minderhoud (Deltares/Utrecht University), land subsidence and rising sea levels\xa0threaten to submerge large parts of the Mekong Delta in the next century. In recent years, he has found that the delta is just eighty centimetres above the local sea level, about two metres lower than international researchers often thought on the basis of freely available satellite data.\nThat makes related problems like salinisation and flooding even more pressing for the 18 million inhabitants of the delta.\nThe devastating consequences of the climate crisis have already been observed\xa0in the area. Vegetation has dried up and wilted from saltwater intrusion, and local residents say\xa0none of the fruit is as plump or juicy as it was\xa010 years ago. That's a massive environmental disaster already\xa0for a region that has\xa0been teeming with plants, fish and wildlife for thousands of years.\nIn the past few years, the people of Việt Nam have seen extreme weather events\xa0hitting\xa0faster than anticipated;\xa0more intense, more frequent and more difficult to predict. The losses have been\xa0huge.\nIs that the legacy\xa0we’re going to leave\xa0our children – who we say we love and would do anything for?\nAre we going to sit here and watch them taking to the streets to defend their future all by themselves? Are we leaving them to deal with the fight\xa0against ignorance and complacency?\nWhile it’s good that you think of switching to high-efficiency light bulbs or using electric cars, it’s not enough to tackle climate change. Many people have already started\xa0using natural climate solutions – but we need to do it on a massive scale.\nWe have to voice up to persuade individuals, policymakers and businesses to reduce our carbon footprint, as a whole.\nAs Prime Minister Phúc\xa0said, the climate policy framework of Việt Nam is quite comprehensive at national and local levels. The National Climate Change Strategy in 2011 sets a number of targets that after every 10 years, it will reduce GHG emission from agriculture by 20 per cent,\xa0 and increase the national forest coverage rate to 44-45 per cent by 2020.\nFor mitigation of GHG emissions, Việt Nam has committed\xa0that by 2030, it will reduce 8 per cent of GHG emissions compared to the Business-as-Usual (BAU) levels when using its own resources, and up to 25 per cent when receiving international support.\nThey're\xa0aggressive commitments, but in order to be able to reach that target, Việt Nam has a lot to do.\nFor instance,\xa0coal currently accounts for 35 per cent of the country's primary energy supply, 15 per cent higher than in 2000. By 2035, Việt Nam's coal demand is likely to grow nearly 2.5 times. As few\xa0substitutes are being adopted, the country will rely more on imported coal and it will be difficult to achieve the 8 per cent reduction target by 2030.\nHowever, given the rising demand for power, the Ministry of Trade has started to offer favourable conditions for renewable energy in Việt Nam, which now only plays a small role in the country’s energy sector.\nDieter Billen, a principal consultant at\xa0Roland Berger, told Reuters that if government policy continued to support renewables and wind and solar become cheaper and better, renewables could even challenge coal as Việt Nam’s biggest electricity source by 2030.\nWill Việt Nam be able to complete its promise? It’ll take the whole nation to act.\nLet’s act in any way we can\xa0to spread the message,\xa0whether it’s cutting down on food waste, restoring our forests, building more solar farms or flying less. Let’s not make it beautiful talk and initiatives – \xa0because climate inaction is violence, when our children’s lives, air and future are on the line. —\xa0VNS",1

More Vietnamese fruits are finding their way to Australia. —\xa0VNA Photo\nSYDNEY —\xa0Longan has become the fourth kind of Vietnamese fruit to be exported to Australia after litchi, mango and dragon fruit. However, experts say there is still a lot of work needed for Việt Nam to secure a firm foothold in the market.\n\nTrương Ái Quốc, founder of Aus Asia Produce, a fruit distributor in Victoria State, said that at the Vietnamese longan festival in Australia, 500kg of longan was sold in just an hour.\n\nHoàng Luật, the owner of an Asian food supermarket in Western Australia, said that his chain sells about 1-1.5 tonnes of fresh Vietnamese fruit each week.\n\nAccording to Australian Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources David Littleproud, the Vietnamese agricultural sector has the potential to earn billions of dollars from exports. The strategic partnership agreement between Việt Nam and Australia has opened up new investment and trade partnership opportunities for both sides, he added.\n\nAustralia is one of the 20 most developed economies in the world. Customers in the 25 million-strong market love fresh fruit. A community of about 300,000 Vietnamese people living in the country also provides a good source of customers for Việt Nam.\n\nThanks to the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the majority of Vietnamese goods exported to Australia enjoy zero tariffs and many other advantages.\n\nHowever, Việt Nam’s fruit export revenue to Australia has remained modest.\n\nStatistics from the General Department of Vietnam Customs showed that trade between the two countries in the first nine months of 2019 reached over US$5.9 billion, up 9 per cent year on year. Crude oil alone accounted for over $2.5 billion.\n\nAlthough Việt Nam’s export revenue from fruit and vegetables hit more than $31 million, a rise of 15 per cent over the same period last year, the figure accounted for only a small part of Australia’s total spending on these products.\n\nOne of the major obstacles for Vietnamese farm produce is strict quarantine regulations.\n\nHoàng Vỹ\xa0Cao, head of a fruit importer in Sydney, said that Vietnamese businesses in Australia always prioritise Vietnamese products, but not many Vietnamese exporters manage to meet Australian standards.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoàng Luật said that production and transport costs also affect the competitiveness of Vietnamese farm produce.\n\nAnna Lê, director of Green Path Australia, the first importer of Vietnamese longan in the market, said that shipping by air has pushed the price of the fruit up dramatically, though the quality is ensured.\n\nTrịnh Đức Hải, Vietnamese Consul General in New South Wales, said that the Consulate General of Vietnam is ready to support Vietnamese firms and connect them with Australian partners by providing them with information about market demands and developments.\n\nMinister Littleproud suggested that Vietnamese and Australian agencies coordinate more closely to deal with requirements on biological safety for imported farm produce and broaden the scope for agricultural cooperation between the two countries. —\xa0VNS'",2

VNA/VNS Photo\nHCM CITY — The programme on vocational training for workers in rural areas should be modified amid changes caused by rapid urbanisation, the HCM City's Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs has said.\nSpeaking at a recent conference, Nguyễn Văn Lâm, the department’s deputy head, asked all district officials in the city to consider how the programme should change, and whether vocational training in non-agricultural areas become the focus.\nHe said the districts should conduct surveys of farmers, enterprises and young people to identify specific demands and needs in rural areas.\n“The most important thing is that people get a job after vocational training. That is the main goal,” Lâm said.\nIn many rural areas, workers and farmers often fail to apply what they have learned in courses. They are usually sent to vocational courses by local labour officials who must reach a yearly quota of workers sent to vocational training.\nPhan Đỗ Huy Thông, vice rector of the Củ Chi Vocational Training School, said that workers in rural areas viewed vocational training as ineffective and were reluctant to participate.\nA representative from the department’s division in Nhà Bè District said that work in logistics and at industrial parks in the district would require vocational training to meet enterprises’ demands.\nDr Lê Ngọc Đức of the Hi-tech Agriculture Training Centre said that although agriculture accounted for only 0.9 per cent of the city’s gross domestic product growth, nearly 1 million people were still employed in the sector in the city.\nVocational training in agriculture is still necessary for these workers, Đức said, adding that the centre this year co-operated with local farmers’ associations to open three short courses in technologies that could be used in farming.\nPhạm Văn Chiến, deputy head of the department’s labour division in Cần Giờ District, said the department should co-operate with relevant agencies and scientists on researching the most suitable farming or breeding activities for localities.\nBased on the research, the labour division would then work with vocational training centres to train farmers more effectively, Chiến said, adding that farmers would be eager to follow effective farming or vocational training models.\nIn the 2010-2019 period, more than 717,100 workers in rural areas received vocational training.

3965,'Digital economy for an inclusive ASEAN Community',"Source: World Bank\nVõ Trí Thành* & Đỗ Lê Ngọc Bích**\nVõ Trí Thành\nA few days ago, ride-hailing firm Grab unveiled an ambitious plan to invest US$500 million in Việt Nam over the next five years, just a month after it announced an investment of $2 billion into Indonesia.\nGrab’s investment decisions are manifestations of the potential development of the digital economies of the two ASEAN countries which have “similar characteristics” as stated by Grab’s president.\nThese two nations are seen as holding the most promise due to their youthful, internet-savvy population and emerging middle-class.\nIndonesia is set to become Southeast Asia’s largest digital economy over the next few years while Việt Nam is also working on a project of national digital transformation which will position itself as a leading digital economy of ASEAN by 2030. The project is scheduled to be submitted to the Government for approval in November this year.\nThe signs of digital transformation are not only evident in Indonesia and Việt Nam. Other countries in the ASEAN region have already embraced this digital revolution.\nOn a national scale, Malaysia established the world’s first Digital Free Trade Zone in 2017; Singapore has implemented its own Smart City initiative; while Thailand also has plans to develop digital capacities in all economic sectors.\nOn a regional scale, all member countries signed several agreements to drive ASEAN toward the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Notably, the first e-commerce agreement, reached in 2018, is expected to realise the region’s potential growth of digital economy.\nThe region’s digital economy is projected to hit $200 billion by 2025 while the e-commerce sector alone is forecast to reach $88 billion.\nAccording to research published in 2018 by Bain & Company, the proportion of the digital economy in ASEAN’s GDP is 7 per cent, compared to China (16 per cent of GDP), the EU-5 (27 per cent of GDP) and the US (35 per cent of GDP).\nA report by ATKearney company also shows that despite lagging behind in the digital economy, ASEAN has the potential to enter the top five digital economies in the world by 2025. Implemen\xadtation of a radical digital agenda could add $1 trillion to the region’s GDP over the next 10 years.\nDigitisation and digital transformation is an obvious path for ASEAN countries to catch up in Industry 4.0 and leapfrog their economic growth as no single country could now count on the advantages of natural resources or cheap labour. To move up the ladder of development, they have to pursue a knowledge, technology and data-driven growth model.\nInclusiveness\nHowever, it does not make sense to reach a faster growth rate but create more inequality. The application of digital technology must be for inclusive development, which is embedded with “the leave no one behind” principle.\nOn the one hand, digital technology creates new ways for people within one country and people within ASEAN to connect with each other, to do business, to trade and to access services more easily.\nPhysical distance is now shortened thanks to high-speed broadband and 5G technology. People living in remote areas can access new sources of information and new opportunities such as telemedicine and online education. This could result in more inclusive forms of growth, given the high cost of moving goods and services around disadvantages and isolated communities.\nOn the other hand, the target of leaving no one behind is challenged by technology. While the fear of widespread job losses may be exaggerated, the future economy will inevitably require greater human capital. Demand for skilled workers will increase their wages, encouraging skill acquisition.\nBut the region needs concrete steps to increase access to skills training for everyone within ASEAN by developing modern educational and training infrastructure. Some low-skilled workers may be unable to survive slower growth in low-skilled jobs, which will require social protection policies.\nInvesting in education and upskilling or retraining is one of the indispensable ways to ensure the impact of new technologies will not lead to greater inequality.\nOther means to engender inclusive growth are building infrastructure for digital connectivity, promoting the gig economy and supporting dynamic micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).\nStill, there are concerns over the digital gap between urban and rural areas in a country as well as between the more developed and the less developed ASEAN countries.\nThe digital divide is prevailing not only in terms of online infrastructure but also in the adoption of digital technology in public and private sectors.\nSource: International Monetary Fund\nAccording to World Bank’s latest report ‘The Digital Economy in Southeast Asia: Strengthening the Foundations for Future Growth’, the number of internet users in ASEAN countries tripled, from 127 million in 2011 to 390 million in 2017, but 90 per cent of ASEAN’s internet users are from five countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Việt Nam.\nThe region is also experiencing a significant broadband divide. The 4G mobile broadband penetration is highest in Singapore and Malaysia, but lowest in Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines.\nOn the adoption of digital technology, there is also a difference. For example, not all 10 ASEAN member countries are applying the National Single Window (NSW) – an e-customs mechanism that helps shorten customs clearance time and reduce costs of shipment. Therefore, so far eight of ten ASEAN member countries have officially connected to the ASEAN Single Window – a regional initiative that connects and integrates the NSW of all ASEAN members.\nIn the financial sector, according to data from Tracxn – a research company that operates an analytics platform to track start-up data, Singapore holds the biggest share of fintech firms in ASEAN (at 39 per cent), followed by Indonesia (20 per cent) and Malaysia (15 per cent). The number of fintech firms in Việt Nam accounts for just 6 per cent of the sector.\nPromoting the gig economy means creating more jobs which are mostly task-based and seasonal. The workers are usually freelancers who are not bound by labour laws such as drivers working for ride-hailing services like Grab or food delivery app Now.\nDespite enjoying flexibility, employees in the informal sector are more vulnerable than those in formal, traditional employment as they are not covered by social protection and welfare policies. Thus, governments must ensure that vulnerable employees are protected, without stifling innovation. Appropriate policies and structural reforms are needed to reduce social inequality.\nThe growth of MSMEs is also a major channel for inclusiveness and robust growth, as MSMEs account for more than 90 per cent of all firms and more than half of total employment in most member economies. The digital revolution helps MSMEs address two key obstacles, namely, access to market and access to finance.\nMore incentives and robust policy environments are needed to facilitate the development of e-commerce (to enlarge businesses’ customer base) and fintech (to help MSMEs seek more financial sources) sectors.\nIn conclusion, digital for development is more critical than digital development. It is high time for ASEAN countries to cooperate to address the digital gap within a country and between countries to ensure an inclusive Digital ASEAN by 2040. — VNS\n* Võ Trí Thành is a senior economist at the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM), a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council and Chairman of Vietnam National Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation (VNCPEC) .\n**\xa0Đỗ Lê Ngọc Bích is Việt Nam News's Deputy Editor-in-Chief",2
2905,'THACO sets up major auto parts industrial park',"Overview of THACO's factories in Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Quảng Nam Province. — Photo courtesy of THACO\nHCM CITY — Developing supporting industries to increase the use of locally produced parts is an urgent requirement if Việt Nam's automobile industry is to be developed, and this will also help grow other industries.\nIn the context of the country’s increasingly deeper integration and facing fierce competition from car imports from ASEAN member countries and elsewhere in the world, investment in supporting industries to increase the rate of use of locally made parts and gradually enter the global supply chain is the direction chosen by many businesses to improve their competitiveness and ensure sustainable growth.\nTrường Hải Auto Corporation (THACO) is one of the pioneers and largest investors in supporting industries.\nBased on the situation on the ground in the automobile industry and the company’s production and business, THACO developed a strategy for increasing the use of local parts and participation in the global value chain right at the beginning when it invested in the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in 2003.\nIn addition to investing in new auto manufacturing and assembly plants and upgrades to existing plants to increase automation and digital management for mass production to meet customers' specific requirements, THACO has built Việt Nam's largest automobile parts manufacturing industrial park at the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone in Quảng Nam Province. It is almost 100 hectares in size.\nIt has 12 factories producing automobile parts, a mechanical engineering complex, not only supplying THACO's auto assembly factories and other companies but also exporting to Southeast Asian markets and elsewhere.\nThe products made in these factories include interior and exterior items for buses, trucks and passenger cars; composite components; leaf springs; glass; air-conditioners; bumpers; auto frames; seats and seat covers; wire harnesses; chassis; and many others.\nThe factories have acquired technology from Japan and South Korea and installed modern equipment and use intelligent management systems throughout the production chain from ordering, to manufacturing and distribution.\nFor instance, the automotive springs plant uses production technologies transferred from South Korea’ s Daewon Group with a modern machinery system such as heat treatment line, ram line, shot blasting line, zinc coating line and quality control equipment on each stage.\nThe plastic components plant is equipped with a 3,200-tonne-injection moulding system and the most advanced plastic coating technology in Việt Nam with paint robots and an automatic paint feeding system.\nThe automobile seat plant has modern, automatic machines imported from Europe and South Korea, which produce seats for many different models and brands.\nTo master its own technologies and designs, THACO has invested in an R&D centre.\nIt also promotes joint ventures and collaborates with partners to acquire new technologies to improve their products and receive technical support for manufacturing spare parts and components for trucks, buses and passenger cars from Korea and Japan.\nTHACO has completely mastered the technologies used in manufacturing components like glass, seats, springs, wires, mechanical engineering components (passenger cars’ moving parts, trunks, exhaust pipes, hydraulic cylinders, bus frame, and punching components), plastic components (bumpers and interior components), air conditioning, composite components and others.\nIncreasing local parts rate, exports\nBy investing in spare parts manufacturing plants, THACO has achieved a local parts use rate for certain auto models of over 40 per cent, meeting the regional value content (RVC) criterion and enjoying the zero tax rate when exporting to ASEAN countries while also exporting components to other countries and gradually joining the global value chain.\nThe largest exports are of car bumpers, passenger car wiring kits, leaf springs, and seat covers for passenger cars, with Korea, Japan, Russia, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Germany being the main export markets.\nTHACO’s component exports were worth over US$20 million last year and are expected to rise to $25 million this year. The company plans to expand its exports to the Europe and America in the coming time.\nIt plans to invest further in building new supporting industries plants to enhance automation, establish joint-venture components factories for Mazda vehicles when the output reaches 50,000 vehicles a year and acquire technology from companies who supply components to Mazda.\nIt will also continue to enter into joint ventures and partnerships with foreign companies to build factories for manufacturing products for export in the THACO Chu Lai Industrial Park, tie up with Kia Motors’s suppliers to produce high-tech parts, and enter the Kia and Foton OEM component supply chain in Việt Nam.\nTHACO also plans to develop non-auto products based on its existing technology platforms with appropriate quality and competitive prices to meet customer needs. — VNS",2

He said he would strive for the goal of completing all delimitation and marker planting work within the Cambodian government’s sixth tenure.\nParty General Secretary and President Trọng said he rejoiced at the constant development of the relations between the two parties, States and people. He welcomed the two countries’ activities to mark 40 years since the day the two nations fought side by side against the genocidal regime of the Khmer Rouge.\nTrọng spoke highly of the co-operation between the two governments over recent years and the efforts of the two countries’ ministries, agencies, sectors and localities to implement agreements signed between the two governments.\nHe valued the outcomes of the talks between the two PMs, particularly the organisation of a conference reviewing land border delimitation and border marker planting, and the signing of two legal documents recognising the results of the work in the field.\nThe signed documents would serve as an important foundation for the two countries to work toward full completion of land border delimitation and border marker planting, thus building a borderline of peace, friendship, cooperation and development between Việt Nam and Cambodia, the Vietnamese Party and State leader said. — VNS'",0
3488,'Credit slowdown causes concern about\xa0access to bank loans',"As of September 24, credit growth had expanded 8.64 per cent compared to the end of 2018, the lowest increase in recent years. VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI Việt Nam's credit growth is slowing and can fall behind the central bank’s target of 14 per cent for 2019, causing concerns that it could make it difficult for businesses to access bank loans during the remaining months of the year.\nAccording to the State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV), as of September 24, credit growth had expanded 8.64 per cent compared to the end of 2018. The rate was the lowest increase in recent years, even lower than the 9.52 per cent rise during the same period in 2018.\nIn the SBV’s September survey on business trends at credit institutions, many credit institutions also forecast that 2019 credit growth would increase by 13.61 per cent this year, lower than the central bank’s 14 per cent target.\nGrowth has been slow in recent months. At the end of June, credit had increased by 7.33 per cent. The figure only inched up to 7.48 per cent by the end of July, then to 8 per cent at the end of August.\nThis seems to contradict lending reports from some banks which say they have nearly hit their credit growth quotas set by the central bank.\nThe central bank has also approved an increase to the credit growth limit in 2019 for banks that have met Basel II standards, such as ACB (13 per cent to 17 per cent), VPBank (12 per cent to 16 per cent), Techcombank (13 per cent to 17 per cent) and MBBank (13 per cent to 17 per cent).\nHowever, the banks, which posted the highest credit growth in the first half of the year were mainly small- and medium-sized.\nCredit growth at large banks, especially BIDV and VietinBank which account for nearly 25 per cent of outstanding loans in the entire banking system, was very low. VietinBank, for example, witnessed its credit increase by only 2.38 per cent in the first six months of 2019.\nThe reason why State-owned commercial banks cannot boost credit growth is that their capital adequacy ratio was close to the minimum threshold set by the SBV while they were unable to raise capital.\nThe credit slowdown was also due to banks’ plans to restructure their balance sheets. Instead of raising credit growth as in previous years, many banks have been forced to reduce credit scale to meet the central bank’s Basel II standards.\nThis cut to credit supply has made many people worried, especially businesses. However, experts say banks are only tightening credit with highly risky industries and sectors, such as real estate.\nNguyễn Quốc Hùng, director of the SBV’s Credit Department, said that bank loans for the Government’s priority sectors had still increased significantly, of which credit for high-tech applicable firms increased by 22.04 per cent; exports, 13.2 per cent; and small- and medium-sized enterprises, 11.42 per cent.\nDespite the credit slowdown, the country’s GDP growth hit a nine-year high of 6.98 per cent in the first nine months of the year. It was a positive signal as the credit slowdown did not hit economic growth, meaning the economy has become less dependent on bank credit and relying more on other channels such as the securities and corporate bond markets.

A Standard Chartered's report shows Việt Nam among countries with the most potential for growth around the world. - VNA Photo\nHÀ NỘI - Việt Nam has been named one of the rising stars of global trade with the sixth position among the top 20 markets with the greatest potential for future trade growth, according to a recent report by Standard Chartered.\n\nWith this ranking, the country is also the best performer among the ASEAN nations, the Trade20 index, which examined 66 economies, shows.\n\nStandard Chartered said the country shows the strongest progress in trade growth potential of all the ASEAN markets in the report, driven by improvements to its trade readiness and economic dynamism.\n\nThe market’s improving strength in trade readiness is attributed to infrastructure enhancements and improvements to its ease of doing business score, while its economic dynamism is driven by healthy growth, particularly in terms of export volumes.\n\nAccording to the report, economic and political reforms over recent decades have spurred Việt Nám economic growth, bolstered by strong domestic demand and manufacturing-led export success. The market has solid foundations for growth: it is politically stable, well-located for global supply chains and has a relatively young population.\n\nThe government has built on these foundations, focusing on business reforms and deregulation, investing in human capital and infrastructure, and embracing trade liberalisation, Standard Chartered noted.\n\nIt said the country's growth is likely to continue to be driven by FDI-led manufacturing and export growth. Rising tourism inflows and stronger domestic demand, supported by higher wages, are also likely to sustain strong growth.\n\nThe banking group added amidst the ongoing US-China trade dispute, the country may also be well-placed to benefit if it can absorb demand diverted to other locations as suppliers relocate from China. It forecast FDI inflows will remain strong in 2019 and 2020 to approximately 15 billion USD. - VNA/VNS",2

Limits must be removed to help household businesses get access to resources,” Tuấn said.\nOther specialists raised concerns about the risks that household businesses may face if they are regulated by the amended enterprises’ law.\nAccording to CIEM’s former director Nguyễn Đình Cung, if household business is regulated by the amended law or a separate law, it will be hard for government agencies to fully execute the regulations.\nFamily members will be divided into different sides and legal rights will destroy family relationship. If worse, the sector will be ruined because households are no longer free to do business in their own way. — VNS",2
3080,'Diverse skillsets come together to make flying pleasurable experience',"'Việt Nam News talks to Executive Sous Chef of VACS Nguyễn Thanh Vũ and Hải Âu Aviation\'s pilot Nguyễn Bá Hải.\nExecutive Sous Chef of VACS Nguyễn Thanh Vũ\nI have been with Vietnam Aviation Cartering Services (VACS) for 23 years, where my daily joy comes not only from research, creation and processing of delicious food, but also from teaching and imparting knowledge to students.\nThe cook is often short-tempered with a strong personality because of the nature of work. An excellent chef must have his own nuances and opinions, always protecting the dishes he creates. When working with colleagues, I often select good words to contribute food ideas and share experiences with them. I developed a clear but gentle and harmonious discipline so that everyone listens to each other.\nThe biggest difficulty for me is to control the input materials to ensure quality. To solve this problem, my colleagues and I usually discuss and make choices before negotiating with suppliers. The main goal is to ensure the correct menu as well as nutritional ingredients, while keeping the price affordable. With my creation and experience, I will create attractive and valuable dishes with delicious flavours to satisfy customers.\nTo convey the Vietnamese culinary soul to both domestic and international guests, I create frugal, high-fiber and low-fat dishes. Spicy flavours should not be mixed into dishes, but separated so that diners can add to their taste. The soul of Vietnamese food often lies in various types of sauces. Thailand also uses fish sauce, but Vietnamese fish sauce has a lot of flavours, from North to South, each area has different ways of mixing, each style has its own unique taste.\nChefs are like artists. Chefs need to have emotions when cooking. The systems of formulas, processes and standards are set to help control about 80 per cent of the quality, while the remaining 20 per cent is due to the ""fire watch"" of each chef. It must be fun to have more interest in doing the job, but just cooking without feeling is very quickly boring.\nDespite having nearly 30 years of experience and being one of the main people responsible for 25,000 aviation meals every day, I still keep track of customer feedback after each flight. With each year passed, everything went smoothly, I am very happy.\nHải Âu Aviation\'s pilot Nguyễn Bá Hải.\nFlying to Hạ Long Bay is like flying into a beautiful painting where you are surrounded by blue sky and the green water of the bay.\nAt 34-years-old I switched careers from a diplomat, to a bush pilot and nobody at the time believed I could do it.\nNow, six years later, I am still flying with Hải Âu Aviation, the first and only seaplane service in Việt Nam and after six years and I am one of the first Vietnamese commercial seaplane pilots.\nI tried to follow my dreams after high school, but the time wasn’t right and I failed to become a pilot so instead took a job with the Government.\nBut in my heart of hearts I knew more than anything else, I wanted to fly.\nAt that point I took a chance and moved to France for two years to gain my aviation qualifications, finally my dreams were in my sights.\nIn 2014 I returned home and was fortunate enough to get a position with Hải Âu Aviation when they opened their seaplane service. It was all I had wanted to be, so when the job offer came I jumped at the chance.\nI spent three years as a first officer moving up to captain.\nI have spent more than 2,000 hours flying and each day I make six trips between Hà Nội and Hạ Long.\nTo the passengers, I’m sure they don’t really see that big a difference between flying a seaplane opposed to a regular plane, but for me, the difference is huge.\nLanding on the water feels more free. There is no one there to prepare the landing site for you. Often you could come across boats, or even small canoes.\nAt that point you have to make split second decisions to change your landing spot.\nRunways are made of concrete, they are stable, secure, but when you land on the water it is a whole different ball game. Conditions can change at the drop of a hat, winds, waves, all have to be taken into consideration.\nIt is challenging but rewarded.\nHa Long Bay is regarded the world over as one of the most beautiful places on the planet, and for me, I am blessed to be able to call this spectacular place my office.\nEach day when I come in to land and I look out of the cockpit window, I just know that following my dreams was the best decision I ever made. —\xa0VNS'",2

2672,"'Wood exports to hit $11.5 billion, exceeding target in 2019'","'Workers at HCM City-based Duc Thanh Wood Processing JSC. — VNA Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s wood exports this year are set to reach up to US$11.5 billion, exceeding the industry’s own target of $10.5 billion, a 20 per cent increase compared to last year, according to the Vietnam Timber and Forest Product Association (VTFPA)\nĐỗ Xuân Lập, chairman of the VTFPA, said Vietnamese firms had been able to enter and gain footholds in numerous markets around the world, overcoming their shortcomings and limitations.\nExports of wood products to the US have seen a sharp rise this year, as well as robust growth to markets including Japan, the UK, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands, said the department of import-export under the Ministry of Industry and Trade.\nWith Japan and Canada partners in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the department said Vietnamese firms were starting to take advantage of the trade deal’s reduced tariffs to penetrate these markets.\nAs the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) is set to take effect in 2020, Vietnamese firms can also look forward to similar tariff cuts and trade advantages from the EU, one of Việt Nam’s major export markets of wood products.\nThe department has set a target of $12 billion for wood exports in 2020, saying the fast growth of large markets such as the US and the EU are major drivers for the industry.\nNguyễn Quốc Khanh, president of HCM City’s handicraft and wood processing business association, said the country’s wood sector, which had maintained a stable growth rate for the last two decades, was gearing up to become a leading player in Southeast Asia.\nKhanh said with even more trade deals coming into effect, increased demand for Vietnamese products and large foreign investments flowing into the industry, Việt Nam’s wood exports looked likely to achieve the growth target of 20 per cent next year.\nIndustry experts said the US would likely remain Việt Nam’s largest export market in 2020. During the last ten months of 2019, Việt Nam’s wood exports to the US hit nearly $4.2 billion, a 34.5 per cent increase from the same period in 2018, and accounting for almost half of the country’s total wood export.\nSuch rapid growth, however, is not without risks, as Vietnamese firms can expect stricter regulations in the future as US agencies ramp up efforts to counter trade fraud, especially in relation to product origin.\nWhile concrete steps have been taken by the Vietnamese government to prevent foreign goods being falsely labelled as Made-in-Vietnam, trade authorities have warned Vietnamese firms against taking part in fraudulent activities to ensure healthy growth for the industry in the future.\nExperts also advised firms to take action as soon as possible to build sustainable value chains, saying they would play a crucial part in the success of the industry. The industry’s value chain, which includes numerous tasks from planting forests, processing and commercialisation of wood products to export must be linked and integrated into firms’ long-term sustainable development strategies. — VNS'",2

What is your opinion about the issue?\nI totally agree. Climate change has led to rising sea levels, the frequency and severity of natural disasters, the decline of river water resources, prolonged heat waves that caused severe droughts in the south central region and saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta.\nIn addition, climate change has led to heavy rainfall in a short time, causing floods and landslides in HCM City, Quảng Ninh, Thanh Hoá and Kiên Giang.\nAs forecast, nearly 40 per cent of the Mekong Delta, more than 10 per cent of the Red River Delta, 2.5 per cent of the central region and 20 per cent of HCM City are at risk of being underwater if sea levels rise by a metre.\nEarly this month, heavy downpours were recorded with severe flash floods and landslides. The natural disasters and their impacts are factors that hinder the sustainable development of the country.\nIn the past 20 years, annual natural calamities have killed more than 400 people. The economic losses for Việt Nam are estimated at 1-1.5 per cent of GDP.\nSince the beginning of this year, there have been 12 types of natural disasters nationwide, causing more than 60 fatalities and economic losses of over VNĐ1.5 trillion (US$64.5 million).\nIs climate change the only reason?\nI think there are many other reasons apart from climate change.\nMany river dykes and sea dykes have substandard designs that fail to meet the requirements of flood and storm control, especially dykes and sea embankments in the southern region.\nMany reservoirs are degraded and fail to ensure safety, especially small reservoirs managed by local authorities.\nIn addition, residents in many localities still live along the riverbanks, in low-lying areas which are at high risk of landslides and flash floods, threatening people’s lives and property.\nOver-exploitation of natural resources also contributes to the frequency of natural disasters.\nWhat is your evaluation of the current system of natural disaster prevention and control in Việt Nam? What is the solution to mitigate the losses caused by natural disasters?\nThanks to the Party and the State and the people’s support, we have built a relatively strong system of natural disaster prevention and control in all regions of the country. However, due to the strong impact of climate change, the system still needs to be improved to deal with super typhoons.\nThe community’s proactive prevention and response to natural disasters is a vital solution to reduce the losses.\nThis year, Deputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng, head of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control launched the National Week for natural disaster prevention and control with the aim of reducing natural disasters from the community.\nIt means the capacity of natural disaster prevention and control from the community needs to be boosted.\nIn order to do this, information, as well as response and aftermath plans, must be available to support the community.\nIt is very important to set up disaster response teams in the community. This is also the priority of this year.\nDamage caused by natural disasters at sea has fallen in recent years. However, damage on the mainland seems to be unimproved. So what is the priority of the authorised agencies?\nBased on the forecasts of the meteorological and hydrological agency and the actual response capacity of the authorised agencies, the prevention of flash floods and landslides in mountainous areas will be the top priority this year.\nThis type of disaster has caused great damage to people and property in recent years.\nOn the other hand, we must also prevent and respond effectively to river and sea erosion. On average, river bank and sea erosion takes away about 300 hectares of land annually.\nWhat solutions does the capital city of Hà Nội need to implement to reduce losses caused by natural disasters proactively and sustainably?\nIn recent years, Hà Nội has spent huge resources to invest in infrastructure for natural disaster prevention and control and climate change adaptation. As a result, the level of damage caused by natural disasters has greatly decreased.\nHowever, in my opinion, the city needs to pay more attention to non-structural measures such as early warning, evacuation planning and emergency response preparedness.

The difference lies in science and technology as it becomes increasingly important as the natural resources are being depleted fast,” Phúc said, adding that the resources Việt Nam should rely on are its ‘brainpower’ and creativity in order to foster our growth and development.\nWithin the framework of the ceremony, an exhibition featuring the science-technology sector’s development in the past six decades was held, introducing products and services used for mechanical engineering, electronics and telecommunications, medicine and pharmaceuticals, among others, along with materials reviewing the history of the sector with important milestones. — VNS'",1

We will focus on the investment in infrastructure of tourism services to make Bình Thuận a national tourist area.”\nNguyễn Lan Ngọc, deputy director of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Department, said Mũi Né was approved to be developed as a national tourism area last year, which helped the province attract big investors.\nNgọc said: “They will make Mũi Né one of the leading destinations in the Asia Pacific region.”\nTân said: “We will choose strategic investors with strong financial and investment capacity and high technology in projects which positively impact people\'s lives and promote the socio-economy of the province.”\nIn detail, Tân said of tourism investment, Bình Thuận called for luxury tourism projects with high-end entertainment and recreation areas, commercial projects and urban and residential areas, adding that the projects should develop both the tourism and the resident community, fostering the well-known tourism brand of ""Hàm Tiến- Mũi Né.""\nIn the field of processing industry, Bình Thuận called for investment in agro-forestry-aquatic-seafood processing, minerals processing, electronic equipment manufacturing and assembly, and clean energy.\nCurrently, the construction and processing industry contributes 31 per cent to local GDP, according to Tân. As Bình Thuận is designed as a national energy centre with a total capacity of over 12,000MW by 2020, it aims to complete the infrastructure system to catch the wave of businesses with international investment redirected to Viet Nam from the current US-China trade war. It will prioritise enterprises which use high tech and environmentally-friendly technology.\nIn the field of agriculture, Bình Thuận calls for smart agricultural projects with the application of modern technologies. At the same time, the province is building a value chain for cultivation and husbandry with international standards and climate change adaption.\nAccording to provincial leaders, the same conference in 2017 played an important role in attracting investment for the period 2017-19, creating jobs and improving incomes and lives of local people. As the result, in the first half of 2019, the provincial economy increased by 8.5 per cent, budget revenue reached VNĐ 4.7 trillion ($202.8 million) as much as the increase of 30.9 per cent over the same period in 2018. Last year, the province received 5.7 million tourists, 12 per cent higher than in 2017.\nBased in the southern key economic region of Việt Nam, Bình Thuận has 192 km of coastline with high and stable hours of wind and heat radiation, which is suitable to the development of tourism, industry and energy.\nBy year end, construction on three expressways, Dầu Giây-Phan Thiết, Phan Thiết-Vĩnh Hào and Vĩnh Hào-Cam Lâm, will start in the province while an international airport will be built there in the near future. — VNS'",2

But the committee’s inspection teams found that these entities still have to consult management agencies.\nIn response, Minister Tiến said that the autonomy mechanism for public hospitals was indispensable and in line with the trend of public financial reform in the market economy.\n“However, the implementation of the mechanism needs\xa0attention\xa0because the sector’s activities were directly related to people,” she said.\nThe Health Ministry would co-operate with other sectors to help hospitals gradually overcome the hurdles, she added.\nAt the meeting, representatives of the Ministry of Finance said they would draft and issue circulars guiding financial independence for district-level healthcare centres.\nThe ministry also recommended revisions on the Law on Health Care to encourage people to use services at clinics and hospitals at grass-roots level. – VNS",1

People can and must do more to prevent plastics from polluting the oceans,” she said.\nShe called on everyone to play a role by reusing plastic bags, separating food waste from other garbage, and rejecting the use of plastic cups and straws at restaurants and plastic bags at supermarkets.\nChallenges\nViệt Nam\xa0dumps 1.8 million tonnes of\xa0plastic waste into\xa0the\xa0ocean\xa0each year, according to Quách Thị Xuân, director of the Đà Nẵng Consultancy on Sustainable Development Centre and a co-founder of Vietnam Zero Waste Alliance (VZWA).\nChina, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Việt Nam are the main sources of about 60 per cent of plastic waste entering the oceans, according to research.\nThe waste piles up on beaches and is taken into the ocean by tides, resulting in between 4.8 million and 12.7 million metric tons of plastic floating in the ocean in 2010.\n“Everyone uses several plastic products so we need efforts from the entire community to address the problem,” Xuân said.\nVZWA’s solutions focus on a “zero waste movement”, which calls for eliminating waste sent to dumps, minimizing waste that needs to be recycled, and turning waste into a useful product such as compost for fertilizer.\nShe emphasised the five Rs: refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and redesign.\nReports have documented that more than 180 animal species have eaten or absorbed plastic in their bodies, mostly birds, fish, turtles and marine animals, according to Nguyễn Thị Hoài Linh, the country manager for Environmental Development Action in the Third World (ENDA) Việt Nam.\nPlastic waste, which also occurs in canals and sewers, causes foul odours and emits methane gas. It can also act as a disease vector.\nLinh said that the public must be better educated about the need for waste separation at source and the harm of plastic waste.\nShe urged the government to work with independent waste collectors as well as the private sector on plastic recycling solutions.\n“However, waste sorting at source is the biggest challenge because it needs a change of thought and behaviour among the public. Behavior change always needs a long time,” she said.\nViệt Nam still lacks sufficient regulations on plastic waste and policies that call for investment in plastic recycling companies, she said.\nLinh said policymakers should revise or issue rules on solid waste collection systems from the national to community level.\nHCM City dumps about 250,000 tonnes of plastic waste each year, including 48,000 tonnes at landfills, while other kinds of waste are either recycled or released into the environment, according to a report of the city’s Department of Natural Resources and Environment.\nIf 48,000 tonnes of plastic were recycled each year, the city could save about VNĐ15 billion (US$658,640), it said.\nThanks to prodding from NGOs, some governments in Asia are taking action.\nFor example, Indonesia has committed to reduce plastic waste to a certain level, while Sri Lanka has banned the use of single-use plastic\xa0items like shopping bags.\nAt the workshop, Dr David Saiia, CEO of the US-based Reuse Everything Institution Inc. (REII), described the use of ultra-high technology used in a REII-developed machine that solidifies standard 500ml plastic bottles into composite plastic building bricks.\nHe said that the technology would give reuse entrepreneurs another product to sell and help them become more efficient in what they collect. — VNS'",4

We hold very high expectations on the results of the summit.\n“If there would be any statement on the denuclearisation of the Korea Peninsula and an official end of the Korean War at the summit, it would bring about peace for the Peninsula and contribute to world peace and the development of humankind.”\nYoon said he hoped the day would come when there were no longer two Korean countries, but instead just one nation.\n“I strongly believe there will come a day when there is no longer a South Korea and North Korea, but just the single name, Korea,” he said.\n“However there are still many obstacles to overcome to reach that day. With the upcoming summit, however, I believe it will come sooner.”\nOne thing that is guaranteed from this month’s meeting is the positive impact hosting the event will have for Hà Nội and Việt Nam.\nLê Hồng Hiệp believes the capital city is the perfect choice.\n“Hà Nội is where North Korea has the embassy,” he said. “And it’s a very important condition for North Korea to have the embassy where the summit takes place because they need to communicate back to Pyongyang.\n“Hà Nội is also famous for its ability to host major international events without incidents in the past. It is also within the range of North Korea’s aircrafts. So it’s quite convenient for North Korea to hold the meeting in Hà Nội.\n“The US side indicated that the summit should be held in Đà Nẵng. And now they have agreed to hold the summit in Hà Nội, meaning they have made a concession to North Korea. But it’s not a bad idea for the US, either, because Hà Nội can meet the demands of security, logistics and media for the summit from a US perspective.”\nHiệp, who is a fellow with the Singapore-based ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute, thinks the summit is a great opportunity to showcase Hà Nội to the world.\nHe added: “This event will be a good chance for Việt Nam to promote its international standing. It can be a very good opportunity for Hà Nội and Việt Nam to sell its success story to the world and thereby attract more tourists and investors to the country.”\nSung-Yoon Loon, an expert on North Korea at Tufts University in Massachusetts, America, told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper: “Việt Nam, as Singapore did, will gain much in publicity, image, tourism.\n“Việt Nam will come across as a cosmopolitan, peace-seeking state that is a legitimate neutral ground for this historic moment.\n“The summit pageantry will cast Việt Nam in a very positive light around the world. The summit will not only enhance Việt Nam’s international stature but also its leverage vis-a-vis China and the US in the short-term.”\nThe exact location of the venue for the summit is yet to be announced. — VNS'",0

When the dry season comes, the delta thus faces a freshwater shortage.\nLê Anh Tuấn, deputy head of the Cần Thơ University’s Research Institute for Climate Change, said the delta should not build any more closed flood control dykes so that it could retain the water that flows in during the flooding season.\nBesides, it should reduce its rice growing area, especially for the third rice crop planted in the flooding season, he said.\nMeasures\nLocal authorities in the delta, which comprises 12 provinces and Cần Thơ City, have earmarked many measures to deal with this year’s flooding and then drought and saltwater intrusion in the dry season.\nThey include reducing cultivation of the third rice crop and instead releasing the floodwaters into rice fields to improve their fertility and retain water.\nIn their flooded rice fields, farmers can raise aquatic creatures or plants to ensure an income during the flooding season.\nAn Giang and Đồng Tháp provinces in the upper delta plan to stop growing the third rice crop in many areas and instead open the flood control dykes and let the waters in.\nĐồng Tháp’s Tháp Mười, Hồng Ngự and Tân Hồng districts have stopped building dykes to protect the third crop.\nThey have introduced other farming models during the flood season such as raising shrimp and lotus plants in rice fields.\nIn An Giang Province, authorities plan to allow floodwaters into 26,500ha of rice fields in An Phú, Phú Tân, Châu Phú, Châu Thành, Tịnh Biên, and Tri Tôn districts and Tân Châu Town.\nVõ Thị Thanh Vân, deputy director of the An Giang Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the department had told these districts and town to stop growing the third rice crop.\nFarmers should raise aquatic creatures and plants in their rice fields to earn an income during the flooding season, she said.\n“Districts and towns should step up inspection of flood control works for safety before allowing the floodwaters into rice fields.”\nTrần Anh Thư, deputy chairman of the An Giang People’s Committee, said though the forecast is for low flood levels this year, local authorities should not neglect the task of flood control.\nThe province will review the number of households living along rivers, canals and low-lying areas at risk of erosion and flooding and make plans to relocate them to safer areas, according to the An Giang Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\nHậu Giang, Bạc Liêu, Sóc Trăng, and Kiên Giang provinces have decided to switch to crops adapted to drought and saltwater in affected areas during the upcoming dry season.\nSóc Trăng, for instance, has instructed farmers to use more than 1,800ha of sugarcane farms for raising aquatic creatures and grow other short-term crops on low-yield rice fields.\nMai An Nhịn, deputy chairman of the Kiên Giang People’s Committee, said rice fields with low yields in the dry season were increasingly used to breed shrimp then.\nThe province’s biggest concerns now were coastal and river erosion and keeping out saltwater from rivers, he added. – VNS'",4

However, the ministry has not evaluated the three complexes\xa0individually due to a lack of\xa0regulations.\nThis has harmed the environment during and after the limestone mining process, he said.\nHưng said there were 10 quarries in Phước Tân quarry complex in Biên Hoà City, along the two sides of the Buông River. All of the quarries are legal and were evaluated the environmental impact assessment.\nThese quarries were licensed to operate between four and 25 years on\xa0403ha. The total amount of exploited limestone was estimated to be 130 million cu.m to a depth of up to 80m.\nHưng said five out of 10 quarries were only 50m\xa0from the river and each quarry was hundreds of metres long.

Existing people’s councils in pilot wards will end their 2016-2021 term on June 1, 2021.\nThe proposal needs\xa0approval from the National Assembly before it can come into effect.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs has sent a draft resolution of the National Assembly allowing the pilot restructuring to the Ministry of Justice to review legal procedures.\nThe justice ministry is due to have a review meeting on the draft resolution on Thursday.\n3,500 staff cut\nFor now, Hà Nội’s People’s Council institutions have three levels –\xa0city, district/township and ward.\nThe number of members in the People’s Council in each level varies with the largest being in the city level, standing at 102. Each district/township People’s Council has between 30 and 40 members while the number ranges from 25 to 30 at ward level.\nHà Nội’s attempt to eliminate 117 ward people’s councils will mean a mass downsizing of between 2,925 and 3,510 staff. Most of them are retired public employees and now serve in people’s councils. The rest are ward officials with dual jobs.\nAssessments by Hà Nội indicated that ward People’s Councils failed to handle socio-economic issues in their own localities but mostly acted as a rubber stamp to decisions already made at higher levels.\nA purpose of setting up people’s councils was to supervise their counterpart people’s committees. However, that monitoring job in reality was done only as a\xa0legal formality, according to city reports.\nFollowing the pilot, the city plans\xa0to reorganise the People’s Councils in urban areas into two levels\xa0–\xa0city and districts, and three levels of city, districts and communes in rural areas.\xa0— VNS",1

3943,'Cybercriminals turning their focus on healthcare: conference',"'A Q&A section at the fifth Cybersecurity Weekend held by Kaspersky in Myanmar on Thursday. — VNS Photo\nYANGON — Healthcare organisations collect and store vast amounts of personal information but are not tech-savvy, making them a sitting duck for cybercriminals, the fifth Cybersecurity Weekend held by Kaspersky in Myanmar on Thursday heard.\n“Cybersecurity: Healing the Healthcare Sector” discussed the past, present and future of the medical industry’s threat landscape.\nStephan Neumeier, managing director of Kaspersky, Asia Pacific, said: “As rapid digitalisation penetrates the healthcare sector, cybercriminals are seeing more opportunities to attack this lucrative and critical industry, which is honestly not equipped enough to face this virtual danger.”\nAttacks against hospitals and pharmaceuticals have been happening worldwide, especially in the more advanced countries in the west, but in recent years the threat has been creeping towards the Asia-Pacific, he said.\nReports have even projected the region’s medical industry incurring losses of US$23.3 million from cybersecurity incidents, he added.\nDelegates said Singapore, the highly-connected technology and business hub of Asia, suffered four data breaches at healthcare organisations in just the last 12 months. One even involved the health records of the country’s prime minister.\nThe infamous Wannacry ransomware has crippled several medical establishments in the region, especially in mainland China, Hong Kong and Việt Nam, they added.\nSeongsu Park, security researcher at Kaspersky, said:\xa0“With the healthcare sector lagging a bit in terms of its cybersecurity capabilities, we observe that hacking groups are now off to exploit this fact by adding medical information and hospital attacks to their services list publicly available on the dark web. Any organisation, individual and company can be their potential customer since these cybercriminals are offering various services.”\nHe pointed out medical records are more valuable than a simple credit card because a hospital generally requires a patient’s personal and financial credentials before a check-up or admission.\n“Based on the indications and patterns we have seen and are still seeing on the dark web, the main purpose of the individuals behind these hacking groups is to sell the medical information to another crime group or to any individual who aims to access confidential medical data. It is quite alarming that we are increasingly coming across such active advertisements, which can either mean this illegal practice has turned into a normal type of business or the demand for such attacks are becoming increasingly high.”\nAccording to Park, the motives of the buyers could include calling scam, identity and monetary theft or blackmailing and any derived crimes.\nWhen it comes to possible customer profiles, the anonymous nature of the dark web opens up the possibility it could be anyone, from a new hacker to an enterprise or even a nation-backed cyber espionage group, he added.\nDenis Makrushin, head of application security at Ingram Micro, said: “Given that healthcare is a very critical sector, where a matter of second dictates the difference between life and death, it is not surprising that it evolves quicker compared with other industries.\n“It is filled with advanced research and development because it is always under an emergency alert to cure and save human lives.\n“However, are these technological advances at par with its complex cybersecurity requirements? This is the question we wanted to answer in this event.\n“Because the industry may not be as targeted as banks. Not today, but given the pattern of attacks we are seeing, it will soon be.”\nYury Namestnikov, head of Kaspersky’s global research and analysis team in Russia, said: “Medical infrastructure has a lot of devices, some of them portable, most of them are becoming more and more connected to the internet. There’s even a technology being developed which will soon allow doctors to do surgeries remotely.\n“We are definitely entering the era of the ultra-connected medicine. And I have to say that, while we welcome these advancements, we cannot deny that these will open wider doors for cybercriminals. This is a truth the healthcare sector should take into consideration seriously.”\nAcknowledging the serious threat cybercriminals pose to healthcare, experts suggested medical organisations should identify the important data they are storing and figure out how they can protect them, increase education in cybersecurity, employ real-time and in-depth threat intelligence as well as holistic cybersecurity solutions. — VNS'",2

In that context, trade and investment promotion will be of great importance, he added.\nSharing the view, Bình said the two-way trade value last year of US$470 million has failed to correctly reflect the potential.\nIn the first 10 months this year, the trade valued reached $390 million, of which Việt Nam had a trade surplus.\nThe main export items of Việt Nam to Egypt included agricultural products, machinery, electronic equipment, textiles and seafood, while the imported goods from Egypt to Việt Nam included fertilisers, plastic materials, raw materials, textiles and milk.\nAt the conference, businesses of the two countries agreed that the two sides are big markets for each other.

The meeting is\xa0themed\xa0 \'For professional and innovative journalism\'. — VNA/VNS Photo Minh Quyết\nHÀ NỘI — The rapid proliferation of so-called fake news had\xa0led to a\xa0decline in public trust in news media, so countries around the world needed to take drastic action to change the status quo.\nThis was agreed by participants at the 44th Executive Board Meeting of the Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agencies (OANA) that\xa0officially opened in Hà Nội on Friday.\nThis year’s event saw the attendance of\xa040 international delegates, including influential news agencies such as\xa0Azertac (Azerbaijan), TASS (Russia), Xinhua (China), Kyodo News (Japan), Yonhap (the Republic of Korea) and\xa0AAP (Australia).\nHosted by the Việt Nam News Agency (VNA), the meeting focused\xa0on three main subjects:\xa0strategies of news agencies in response to changes in information use behaviour\xa0which focus on video clips and the YouTube platform; fake news and fact-checking; and regaining trust for mainstream news.\nIn his opening speech, VNA General Director Nguyễn Đức Lợi, who is also a member of the Communist Party of Việt Nam\'s Central Committee (CPVCC), said in the last five decades since it became an OANA member in 1969, the VNA had\xa0been an active member of the organisation and made various contributions to enhance\xa0the development of journalism in the Asia-Pacific.\n“The hosting of the 44th OANA Executive Board Meeting once again affirms the role and voice of the state news agency of Việt Nam in this multilateral press forum, the largest of its kind in the region,” he said.\nAccording to Lợi, the world’s population now stands at 7.7 billion, of whom 52 per cent are internet users. They use\xa0the internet not only to communicate but also to provide information. This has\xa0created fierce competition against mainstream news.\n“As such, press agencies are\xa0not only competing\xa0with each other, but also with their own traditional readership who are using social networking platforms to spread information. While the press needs to verify information, conduct interviews and\xa0collect relevant data to provide\xa0objective information to the public, many organisations and individuals are using\xa0social media accounts to spread unlimited amounts of unchecked and subjective information with only one click, some with negative intentions of making profits and causing social chaos,” Lợi said.\n\nFurthermore, the co-existence of real and fake information across many communication platforms had\xa0made the public lose faith in mainstream news, he said.\nAddressing the opening ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam, a member of the CPVCC, said in recent years, in the wake of numerous forms of communication\xa0based on modern technologies as well as fast and widespread fake\xa0news, the OANA not only served\xa0as a direct channel to provide information to news organisations and partners but also as a fact checker to help bolster public trust in the traditional press.\nĐam said since the renewal era, Việt Nam had\xa0made development efforts\xa0which had\xa0been recognised and appreciated by the international community.\nDuring that journey, the Vietnamese press had\xa0been standing side by side with the country, he said, adding there were currently almost 100 news organisations in Việt Nam that employed 41,000 workers, of which 19,000 were journalists.\n“The\xa044th OANA Executive Board Meeting in Hà Nội has significant meaning as it marks the 50 year\xa0the VNA has been part of the OANA. We believe the 44th OANA meeting will bring a breath of fresh air to the development of the organisation as well as member agencies,” Đam said.\nOANA President Aslan Aslanov, who is also Chairman of the Board of the Azerbaijan State News Agency (AZERTAC), said the VNA was one of the most active members of OANA and its Executive Board.\nBy organising the\xa0meeting and demonstrating its commitment to excellence and professionalism in the news industry, the VNA had once again proved itself to be a\xa0leading media outlet in the region, he said.\nFake news storm\nAccording to VNA Deputy General Director Lê Quốc Minh,\xa0Việt Nam is not an exception in the fake news storm.\n“It is worrying that Facebook newsfeeds, YouTube channels and Google\xa0are full of fake news, while users naive enough to like and share them, and even the mainstream media runs this\xa0false information,” Minh said.\nViệt Nam was in the world’s top 10 countries with the largest number of social media users, Minh said, adding that Vietnamese people spend on average 2 hours 37 minutes every day on\xa0social media.\nAccording to Minh, thousands of websites were booming to feed hungry audiences with sensational and fake news. When a typhoon was hovering offshore Việt Nam, a number of Facebook users live-streamed videos with captions like “Typhoon No\xa06 Live”, “Typhoon is destroying my home village” or “Typhoon is so horrible”. In fact, they\'d used a video of a typhoon in the Philippines.\nIn June 2016, a number of newspapers and news websites ran a story about an eleven-year-old boy in Gia Lai Province who committed\xa0suicide because he did not have a new T-shirt for the school year. There was no such incident but the massive coverage on mainstream media led to an outcry about\xa0ethnic discrimination.\n“To regain the audience’s trust in mainstream news, we need to come back to the core values of journalism, professionalism, balance and multi-dimension. Journalists need to verify information carefully, especially amidst the spread of\xa0fake news, and improve the quality of their products, enhance professional ethics, and master new technologies in the working process,” Minh said.\nOANA president\xa0Aslanov\xa0remained steadfast that members\xa0with their long-standing reputations as premier news services\xa0served as “a\xa0shield” against unverified information and news that plagued and confused\xa0society.\n“Our principles of identifying and fact-checking before publishing have earned us high confidence. That’s why OANA is truly a team of the most reliable news producers,” he said.\n“As long as there are news agencies that hold on to the principles of journalism, society can feel safe, because although fake news is widespread, we are capable of retaliating with accurate and reliable news,” Aslanov said.\nLee Dong-min, a representative of the Yonhap News Agency, said the Republic of Korea’s media outlets were improving their fact-checking mechanisms to prevent spreading fake news and allowing\xa0readers to decide what the facts were when there were conflicting versions of stories.\nShe spoke about Yonhap’s fact-checking team, which was officially launched in April 2018 as part of the newsroom and its video fact-check service named ""Weekly Fact Check"" to deal with fake news on YouTube. Yonhap had\xa0tried to monitor the spread of fake\xa0news on the internet and distorted articles in the media, Lee said.\nAt the closing ceremony, the Executive Board announced the OANA Award for Excellence in News Agency Quality, which is designed to further experience exchange between OANA members and to improve the quality of making news.\nThe Việt Nam News Agency and Xinhua News Agency (China) shared the first prize for their Chatbot apps on e-newspaper Việt Nam Plus and AI Media Brain.\n\nTASS news agency of Russia won second prize for the\xa0Astronauts database project and the Azertac State News Agency of Azerbaijan secured third prize for its knowledge portal for children Portal.azertag.az.\nThe OANA was established on December 22, 1961 as an initiative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). It aims to facilitate information dissemination and exchange between news agencies in Asia-Pacific – a dynamic region that makes up more than half of the global population.\nOANA members, including many major agencies, are responsible for two-thirds of information circulated throughout the world.

949,'Comments of experts on the summit',"'Việt Nam pulled out all the stops for media: foreign affairs spokesperson\nDPRK Chairman Kim Jong-un leaves Hà Nội\nAchieving denuclearisation needs more time\nPM says hosting DPRK-US summit was big success for Việt Nam\nReactions to the failed summit\nViet Nam News\nThe second summit between US President Donald Trump and Chairman of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un ended without any agreement signed on Thursday. Experts worldwide share their views on the outcome of the talks.\nProf Leon Sigal,\xa0Director, Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project, Social Science Research Council, USA\nLeon Sigal\nObviously, this is a big disappointment, but if the US version is correct, it’s clear that the North Koreans overreached in wanting an end to sanctions. The negotiating issue was how sanctions could be relaxed in return for steps toward denuclearisation by North Korea.\nIt was also clear from the discussion at the press conference that just because they didn’t agree this time, that doesn’t mean talks are over. I think that’s important because it seems to me this is quite negotiable.\nFrom the other things that were discussed at the press conference, it was clear that there was a pretty robust discussion of verification. The missile production issue was clearly brought up. So I think we have the basis for agreement here but the critical thing is if the US version is correct the DPRK overreached by wanting to end all the sanctions. That is not to say that the sanctions are terribly effective. It’s clearly putting some pressure on the North Korean economy. But I suspect some of the reaction would exaggerate the pressure of sanctions. The real thing about the sanctions in the North Korean view is they’re a sign of enmity and we have to move away from enmity.\nOn the other hand, to ask for the sanctions to be eliminated at this point is too big a step given what the North Koreans are prepared to do on the denulearisation side.\nSo I think it’s well worth everybody’s while to get back negotiating, have Stephen Biegun go talk to his counterpart, maybe \xa0Secretary of State Pompeo talk to his counterpart and see if we can work out a few more of the details recognising that sanctions are not going to be eliminated but they should be relaxed in return for denuclearisation steps by the DPRK. So I think it is time to get over the summit. We can do this. And it struck me that the President was keeping the door open.\nJenny Town\nJenny Town, Research Analyst, Stimson Center and Managing Editor, 38 North, a programme providing analysis of events in and around the DPRK\nIt is surprising that they didn’t come away with a preliminary deal, as they clearly had the outline for one going into the final round of pre-summit negotiations. But it\xa0seems both sides still wanted more than what the other was willing to accept. Taking more time to negotiate is not a bad development, but walking away from the summit with nothing is likely to have a deflating effect on the process as a whole.\nOf all the stakeholders in this process, the lack of movement on the DPRK-US agenda puts the Republic of Korea in a very awkward position, unable to secure the sanctions exemptions they were hoping for as part of this deal, which would facilitate the resumption of inter-Korean economic co-operation. Moreover, despite the President’s stated will to continue negotiating with North Korea, in the current domestic political environment, there is a real risk of the momentum for this issue waning in a sea of competing interests.\nLê Hồng Hiệp,\xa0Fellow,\xa0the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, Singapore\nLê Hồng Hiệp\nThe two sides’ failure to reach an agreement at the summit shows that there’s still a large difference between them regarding how to solve the North Korean nuclear issue.\nDemolishing the\xa0Yongbyon\xa0nuclear facility only will not be enough for the US to lift sanctions on North Korea, and President Trump indicated that he wants a right, not quick deal. Meanwhile, North Korea is not ready to give up more without any credible concession from the US.\nNow it’s important to see whether the two sides can make any progress by the end of the year. If not, the momentum of bilateral talks may face headwinds due to distractions generated by US electoral politics or unforeseen developments elsewhere.\nProf., Dr. Phạm Quang Minh, Dean of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Hanoi National University\nProf., Dr. Phạm Quang Minh.\nThe meetings ended without the outcome which had been highly anticipated. The result must be viewed through three perspectives: international, domestic and individual.\nFirst, regional and international affairs such as the trade war between the US and China and increasing tensions between Pakistan and India are unfavourable for success.\nSecond, the domestic issues of either country have had impacts on the two leaders, such as the congressional testimony of President Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen and the DPRK’s issues of sovereignty and nuclear weapons, which are really big pressures.\nThird, for the two leaders, this is their second meeting so the trust between the two leaders hasn’t been built up whilst their characteristics are very unpredictable. President Trump still said on Wednesday that ""we have made a lot of progress"".\nI think the result is appropriate when taking into account the three elements as mentioned above.\nVũ Văn Khanh, former head of the Department of International Affairs, the Institute for Defence Strategy\nThe outcome is not something too surprising as the dialogue/relationship between the two countries has witnessed numerous contradictions which were unresolved. One side insists the other denuclearises whilst the other is not ready yet. This results in pressure for each other.\nIt is normal that dialogues and discussions between any countries are prolonged. In this particular case, there needs to be concessions from one of the two sides. Nevertheless, we need time to take into account other parties such as China and the Republic of Korea to settle the issue and bring peace to the Korean peninsula. As what DPRK Chairman Kim Jong Un has done so far we can see that relations between the two countries has become less tense.\nThe point is that both sides need to reach an agreement and gradually reach what they wish for.\nI forecast that the situation in the Korean peninsula will come to an end but it needs time. President Trump left for the US earlier than scheduled but he still said ""We haven’t given up anything, and .. we will end up very good friends with Chairman Kim.""\nScottie Nell Hughes, RT News, US\nScottie Nell Hughes, RT Ạmerica\nI think Americans as well as anybody who wants peace in the world is disappointed that we are not walking with a deal done by President Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un, or at least a benchmark specifically given as to how that deal could be accomplished.\nI think President Trump missed an opportunity with not only the summit but also with the press conference to have at least something positive that was established during the past two days of meetings. Going into this President Trump seemed to be very positive about being able to bring about deals with Kim Jong Un. Unfortunately, it seems like none of that happened - whether you’re talking about benchmarks for the denuclearisation of North Korea or the ending of the Korean war. He walked out of the summit today with even more questions in the air than after the second summit finished.\nJonathan Karl, ABC News\nJonathan Karl, ABC News\nNot even a signing statement or a joint statement after the summit is clearly a disappointment to the American side. It seems the President was quite clear in the press conference that the issues it laid down on was that North Korea wants those sanctions lifted, they want them lifted now, they want them all lifted. And the position of the United States has been, from the previous presidents onto this president, that the sanctions don’t get lifted. It tells North Korea to take action steps to get rid of its nuclear programme. And that’s obviously not happening.\nThe President said he made no commitment about another summit. It’s possible. But I got the sense hearing him say that we probably won’t see a third summit any time soon.\nGrigory Trofimchuk,\xa0head of\xa0the expert council of the Eurasian Ideas Foundation:\n\nGrigory Trofimchuk, head of the expert council of the Eurasian Ideas Foundation\nOn the summit outcome, I think President Trump was a little bit in a rush to have said on Wednesday that the summit was going well and he hoped a series of important agreements would be signed.\nI would say Chairman Kim gained a concrete win over President Trump although Kim will face challenges ahead. The challenge is that Kim must understand from now on the US will require a concrete nuclear solution, a concrete one, not destroying a testing site.\nThe victory, first things first, is for Việt Nam which gained the chance to be mentioned worldwide.\nOn Trump, he was a little hasty and now his US opponents will dig into his abrupt exit from the summit.\nI think Russia’s viewpoints on the DPRK nuclear issue will also catch attention. Russia thinks dealing with the issue in a successful way will ensure real security when Pyongyang makes concessions. The progress leading to the outcome should be conducted step by step and not hastily.\nIn the future, I predict that there will be more approaches to the DPRK nuclear talks. One of those is six side talks. Russia might think about strengthening its role as the US did not succeed.\nOn the other hand, Việt Nam hosted the summit with excellent quality, showing the country’s prestige in international politics has been consolidated when Việt Nam has engaged in significant geo-political orientations and contributed to ensuring security in Asia.\nViệt Nam has been trusted by the world in important issues such as nuclear disarmament and has become one of the key factors in bolstering trust in the world\nProfessor Georgy Toloraya, director of Asian Strategy Centre at the Institute of Economics RAS:\nProfessor Georgy Toloraya, director of Asian Strategy Centre at the Institute of Economics RAS\nAll of us in Hà Nội are anticipating a concrete, significant deal with all related documents available. However, the summit ended without a joint statement. We are not privy to what exactly was the deal breaker, and we have only heard US President’s claims that the talks’ abrupt end was due to the DPRK’s refusal to dismantle its nuclear weapons. Now we need to hear the DPRK’s side of the story. I don’t think lifting sanctions was a precondition on the part of the North Koreans, but the point is they want the US to change its hostile attitude towards the country. To Pyongyang, as long as sanctions continue, hostility remains and there would be nothing to talk about.\nIt’s a regret that this opportunity has been wasted and the certainty of a third summit is still up in the air.\nStill, I want to emphasise the fact that the two sides have not been critical of each other and President Trump remains optimistic of another summit and respectful of the North Korean leader.\nThe summit has not resulted in any notable progress, as widely reported by international media, but it’s really not that bad, the important thing is tension hasn’t escalated, which would possibly lead to renewed rounds of missile tests or bomb detonations.\nAn agreement seems to have been reached between the two countries’ leaders that such activities will no longer happen.\nLet’s remain hopeful that while there might not be a step forward, there’s at least not a step backward.\nViệt Nam’s organisation of the summit has been perfect. Through this summit, it has managed to elevate its position in the region as a responsible nation and proved that it could pull off holding such an event. Hà Nội doesn’t need to feel disappointed missing out on the chance to be a part of history, it happens quite often. You have all done really well. — VNS'",0

Smaller SoEs tend to have made modest progress with an average score of 1.84/5 based on CIEM\'s ranking criteria\xa0while larger SoEs tend to score higher at 3.07/5. SoEs with fewer shares held by the State tend to have made more progress than others.\nNotably, private enterprises, who possess less computing power or the number of computers, tend to utilise them a lot more often than SoEs in most fields. The survey also showed most SoEs\xa0had a high level of enthusiasm and expectation regarding the digitalisation process and how it will help spur growth and business opportunities in the next five years, according to CIEM\'s survey.\nLê Hải Đăng, head of Vietnam\xa0Electricity (EVN) development strategy department, said EVN has implemented 39 projects since last year\xa0to speed up its digitalisation.\n""To focus on innovation\xa0and research and development is an innate need of a company to better serve customers and improve operational efficiency,"" said\xa0\xa0Đăng.\nDaunting challenges\nSpeaking at the workshop, experts voiced concern over the digitalisation readiness showed among SoEs, saying it would be a long shot to expect them to lead the way in terms of innovation.\nChiều said there were still many shortcomings and limitations in Việt Nam\'s\xa0digitalisation strategy, such as a lack of clear objectives and dedicated funds for SoE\'s technological research and development. Despite SoE\'s high expectation to perform, they have not been placed among the country\'s innovation ecosystem and desperately need support to access new technologies, especially small-to-medium enterprises.\nSoEs also have a hard time attracting and retain IT talents due to their much less lucrative compensation policies, which are often regulated by State\'s labour code, compared to the private sector.\n""It\'s difficult for SoEs to compete with the private sector to keep IT professionals. As it stands, we are losing them to private companies,""\xa0Đăng from EVN said.\nA representative from Petro Vietnam said another reason for slow digitalisation\xa0among SoEs was\xa0their risk-averse nature. Innovation often requires trial and error before it can produce results and failure may bring legal consequences for SoEs\' leaders as the State\'s priority is to preserve its capital. \xa0VNS'",2

VNS Photo Bồ Xuân Hiệp\nHCM CITY — Việt Nam lacks comprehensive studies on air pollution and its impacts on health, life and the economy, experts said at a conference in HCM City on Friday (April 19).\nDr\xa0Hồ Quốc Bằng, head of the air pollution and climate change office at the Việt Nam National University’s Institute for Environment and Natural Resources, said conducting studies on air pollution requires far more effort, time and advanced equipment than on water pollution.\nThere is a shortage of advanced equipment for monitoring air quality and a limited number of air monitoring stations in the country, he said.\n“Scientific research on air pollution has not received adequate attention from scientists.”\nAir pollution in HCM City in particular is caused mainly by transport activities (50 per cent) and household activities (30 per cent), with only 20 per cent caused by industrial production, he said.\n“Such research with specific figures on pollution levels as well as its impacts on people’s lives and health could help authorities come up with practical solutions.”\nDr\xa0Hoàng Dương Tùng, president of\xa0the Việt Nam Clean Air Network, said since the impact of air pollution is only evident over the long term, many people ignore it.\nAir pollution regulations need to be made more stringent, he suggested.\nCurrently several different agencies are responsible for managing the sources of air pollution such as the ministries of construction, transport, and natural resources and environment, but there should be a single agency responsible for it, he said.\nBằng, head of the air pollution and climate change office at the Việt Nam National University’s Institute for Environment and Natural Resources, recommended that people should protect themselves by using masks that can keep out micro particles and avoiding polluted areas.\nThe cloth masks many people use are not adequate, he said.\nMeasures\nHCM City has been carrying out a number of measures to minimise air pollution, according to its Sub-Department of Environmental Protection.\nThey include strengthening oversight and enforcement of laws on environmental protection and punishing violations by production, service and business establishments, industrial parks and industrial complexes.\nThe city is also implementing measures to reduce traffic congestion to reduce pollution caused by vehicles.\nLê Việt Phú, an economist at Fulbright University Việt Nam, said HCM City needs to diversify investment in energy production, shifting to cleaner sources such as solar energy and use energy-saving equipment.\nCity authorities need to establish an early warning system for air pollution to provide information to people living in high-risk areas, he said.\nThe economic losses due to early deaths caused by air pollution were equivalent to 5-7 per cent of Việt Nam’s GDP last year, or US$11.4-15.9 billion, with at least 40,000 people dying of diseases related to pollution, he said.\n“The number of deaths caused by air pollution is four times the number due to traffic accidents, which is around 11,000 a year.\n“It is estimated that the number of deaths annually due to air pollution will rise to over 100,000 by 2035.”\nĐỗ Mạnh Cường of the Ministry of Health’s Health Environment Management Agency said the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers air pollution “a silent killer” in Việt Nam.\nAccording to statistics from WHO, air pollution is one of the highest causes of death in the world with around eight million people dying each year.\nWHO data also shows that six out of the 10 diseases with the highest mortality rates in Việt Nam are related to air pollution.\nViệt Nam’s urban areas have various types of pollutants far exceeding permissible limits, especially major cities like HCM City and Hà Nội, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.\nMore than 42 people in 1,000 suffer from bronchitis and 69 complain of throat diseases, it added. — VNS'",4

The situation only improves during summer.\nIn 2007, a plan was approved to move\xa0university and college networks between 2006 and 2016 in which small-sized public universities (under 2ha) would move out to the suburbs to have bigger campuses of at least 10ha.\nAfter Hà Nội’s administrative boundaries were expanded in 2009, there was another plan on developing university and college systems.\nOne of the plan’s goals is to “solve difficulties involving space and facilities of Hà Nội’s universities and colleges and their negative impacts on the city’s development”.\nTherefore, it is set to reduce the density of students and schools in the inner city.\nFrom 2010 to 2011, the Hà Nội Department of Planning and Architecture and Ministry of Construction composed plans to move and upgrade 23 higher education institutes.\nTwelve schools planned to remove, including Hà Nội Law University, Foreign Trade University and Hà Nội Open University.\nThe\xa0schools were to be relocated in satellite areas of Gia Lâm (250ha), Sóc Sơn (600ha), Sơn Tây (300ha), Hoà Lạc (1,200ha) and Phú Xuyên (100ha), creating hubs of up to 4,500ha for each which can serve from 40,000 to 51,000 students.\nThe Hà Nội Capital construction master plan, approved in 2011, expects to restrain the number\xa0of university students in the metropolitan area at some 30,000.\nHowever, after a decade, only the University of Public Health has moved out to Bắc Từ Liêm District.\nViệt Nam National University, despite being granted a 1,000ha area in Hoà Lạc Hi-teck Park, has not followed the plan.\nThe university's vice rector Nguyễn Hoàng Hải could not confirm when the project would be completed due to difficulties in allocating investment.\nFor the past 15 years, the project has received less than 8 per cent of the initial estimated capital of VNĐ25.8 trillion (US$1.1 billion).\nThe situation is thought to be similar with the other institutions.\nAccording to Đào Ngọc Nghiêm, deputy head of Hà Nội Association of Urban Planning and Development, universities have raised student enrollment despite not moving to outlying areas, increasing pressure on the city’s traffic infrastructure.\nIn addition, while Hà Nội is overloaded with universities and colleges, the Government has not created favourable conditions to develop higher education institutes in other nearby provinces.\nTo solve the problem, besides changes in policies, the expert highlighted the need for private sector\xa0participation in mobilising resources to build infrastructure and attract students. — VNS",1

Known in Việt Nam as 'vích', the creature used to be common with dozens of thousands of turtles laying their eggs on the beaches every year prior to the 80s, but now the number of individuals is barely past\xa0500. Yet the species is still faring better than the famous đồi mồi of the same family, which has been hunted down for its shells to make decorative items to the extent there are less than 10 animals left.\nDr Vương Tiến Mạnh, an official at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Việt Nam (Cites Việt Nam), said the issue stemmed from both traditional and emerging threats.\n“In the past, when the economy was yet to develop, people consumed wild animals such as crabs, frogs, shellfish or even snakes as a way to supplement protein. This was common among people living in forest areas and the Cửu Long Delta Region,” said Mạnh.\nThis habit was part of their tradition coupled with the fact that they don’t really have a sense of protecting animals and plants or access to information that carried this message, the expert said.\nOn the other hand, there are a large number of people who consume wild animals for medical purposes.\nSeventy-one per cent said wild animals were consumed as a mean of treating diseases, while 21 per cent said they boosted health, according to a Cites’ survey, Manh said.\nWild animals and animal parts have become commercial goods and a fashionable trend with elephant tusks or rhino horn acting as a status symbol.\nCorruption and illegal protection by criminal gangs also contribute to thwarted efforts to investigate and prosecute wildlife crimes.\nInadequate regulations\nAccording to statistics from the Forest Ranger Department, since 2010, forest rangers had discovered more than 140,000 violations on forest and forestry product management, of which violations relating to wild animal management numbered 3,823.\nForest rangers seized nearly 59,000 animals, of which 3,078 were rare or endangered species.\nThe illegally hunting and trade of rare animals had been expanding across the country, but the number of cases brought to court was very low, reported Vietnam News Agency.\nFigures from the Supreme Court showed that from October 2015 to the end of July 2017, Vietnamese courts took up a total of 231 cases with 339 defendants, and nearly 90 per cent of them were brought to trial.\nHowever, only three defendants were handed prison sentences of longer than three years, while the remaining 37 received shorter terms.\nCaptain Trần Thị Kim Thanh from the Environment Police said there were many legal regulations that exposed shortcomings causing difficulties in the process of dealing with the trafficking of wild animals.\nMoreover, international co-operation in information sharing, investigation and arresting criminals remained ineffective, Thanh said.\nLarge shipments of tusks, rhino horns and pangolins originating from African countries or Indonesia were being transported through many countries before arriving in China or Việt Nam, where local use of wild animal products remains widespread among certain groups of people.\nHowever, it is difficult for enforcement agencies and NGOs from different countries to join forces to prevent trafficking or to arrest the culprits because information is not shared due to a lack of mutual legal assistance agreements or other forms of cooperation.\nMeasures needed\nAccording to Bùi Thị Hà, vice director of Education for Nature – Việt Nam (ENV), a Vietnamese non-governmental organisation, 10 urgent actions were needed to put an end to illegal hunting and trade of wild rare and endangered animals in the country.\nThe actions include stepping up investigations and issuing strict fines to those who lead illegal rings, a resolute ban on the sale of wild animal products and the destruction of any seized product, permanently closing all private tiger, bear or any other wild animal breeding farms, holding local governments accountable for the wild animal trade in their jurisdictions, and effectively deterring illegal trading on the internet.\nMeanwhile, director of the Wild Animal Conservation Centre Nguyễn Văn Thái, said: “Việt Nam needed to complete and ensure consistent legal documents related to the protection of wild animals and plants.”\n“The Government should issue policies that encourage domestic and international organisations to launch campaigns to raise awareness and dissuade people from using wild animals and plants,” Thái said.\nThe campaigns should aim at changing local habits of consuming wild animals and plants as well as urging a zero-tolerance attitude against such actions, he added.\nAuthorities should also create sustainable jobs for those whose livelihoods depend on wildlife and nature to reduce the hunting of wild animals.\nPeople living in buffer zones near national parks, conservation areas and preventive forests should be encouraged to take part in wildlife protection, said the director.\nAt present, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is drafting a decree on the management of wild, rare and critically endangered animals and plants and the implementation of international conventions to stop the trade.

Photo vietnambiz.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Việt Nam's fruit and vegetable exports dropped\xa00.6 per cent year-on-year to US$3.5 billion in the first 11 months this year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).\nThe drop was attributed\xa0to falling earnings from dragon fruit, which accounted for 31 per cent of total fruit exports, (down 9 per cent), durian (down 17.4 per cent), coconut (down 35 per cent), longan (down 56 per cent) and watermelon (down 26.4 per cent).\nMARD’s Agricultural Products Processing and Market Development Department said the strong decrease in exports to China, which accounted for 66.8 per cent of all fruit and vegetable exports, was also a reason behind the fall.\nThe rise in exports to the US, the European Union, Japan and the Republic of Korea was not enough to compensate for the reduction in the Chinese market.\nIn the same period, $1.63 billion was spent on importing fruit and vegetables, up 3.4 per cent from the same period last year. Imports from Thailand, still the biggest import market of Việt Nam, went down 24.5 per cent, while those from China picked up 10 per cent and from the US up 54 per cent.\nAccording to the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s report on exports in the first 11 months of this year, many other key products had dropped in export value due to difficulties.\nTotal export revenue of agricultural, forestry and fishery products was estimated at $23.1 billion, down 5.2 per cent over the same period of last year, including seafood (down 2.3 per cent), coffee (down 22.2 per cent), and cassava\xa0(down 5.3 per cent).\nOther commodities increased in export volume but decreased in export value due to the decrease in\xa0prices such as cashew nuts, pepper and rice.\nImprovements are needed\xa0for sustainable development, including quality control, traceability, processing capacity, preservation of agricultural products and supporting industries for the agriculture sector.\nTo remove these difficulties, the Ministry of Industry and Trade said it would study solutions and measures to develop exports and imports for important markets,\xa0seek new potential export markets and consolidate as well as expand the market share of Vietnamese goods in traditional markets and FTA partners.\nLê Thanh Hòa,\xa0deputy director\xa0of the\xa0Agricultural Product Processing\xa0and\xa0Market Development Department, said to seize the opportunity, Việt Nam needed\xa0to accelerate registration of planting zone codes and packaging\xa0codes, helping local businesses export more fruit\xa0and vegetables to the Chinese market.\nIn addition, Việt Nam's fruit and vegetable businesses needed to put investment in technology and modernisation of processing and production equipment,\xa0and also strengthen co-operation and connectivity with partners in the supply chain to improve export capacity.\nHòa was quoted by the Thời báo Kinh tế Việt Nam (Vneconomy) newspaper as saying the State should promote\xa0farming products in potential markets. Thailand exported 22 kinds of fruit and vegetables to China while Việt Nam only had nine. The nation needed\xa0three years or longer to gain\xa0export certificates for its tropical fruit to be shipped to\xa0China.\nEurope and many other countries had\xa0also set up technical barriers for imported goods. In the EU, besides the advantages from the EU-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), the\xa0market had\xa0standards that asked Vietnamese businesses to improve production and product quality and to apply high technology in production, processing, preservation, packaging\xa0and transport.\nTo achieve these standards, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development had\xa0asked the Government to offer\xa0incentives to\xa0the agricultural sector to develop production and business monitoring programmes avoid trade and technical barriers, Hòa said. - VNS",2

At present, Việt Nam has more than 730,000 businesses in operation, of which more than 97 per cent are SMEs.\nSMEs make\xa0significant contributions to the country\'s economic growth and sustainable development. They are also an important link in the value chain to enhance the competitiveness of Việt Nam\'s export products and the establishment of industrial complexes in the electronics, textile and fishery industries.\nHowever, Dũng said Vietnamese SMEs did not have the capital to invest in\xa0technological\xa0innovation or\xa0expansion of production scale. Most had poor\xa0human resources, and links between SMEs and large enterprises were limited.\nThis year, the Prime Minister has asked the Government to implement tasks and solutions for\xa0comprehensive reform in specialised inspection activities, and to reduce\xa0and simplify\xa0administrative procedures as well as business and investment conditions.\nTo deal with this, the Government has issued three decrees to reduce and simplify 106 business conditions, bringing the total number of business conditions\xa0cut to 3,451 since 2018.

Meanwhile, hundreds of bears live in captivity and many other rare and endangered wildlife species are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade.\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), before the 1980s Việt Nam’s marine turtle population was in rude health, with tens of thousands of turtles laying eggs every year.\nNow, the numbers have declined dramatically, as only 200-300 turtles bear eggs per year on Côn Đảo Island, while the provinces of Quảng Ninh, Quảng Trị, Bình Định and Ninh Thuận record only 10-20 laying turtles year each.\nThe ENV said that among the five species of sea turtles in the country, the\xa0Hawksbill sea turtle\xa0population has severely decreased due to humans hunting them for their shells, having fallen 80 per cent in the last century.\nVũ Thị Quyên, ENV director, said:\xa0“Rhino horn or other wild animal products are believed to have healing properties, but there is no scientific evidence for this.”\nDespite having no wild rhinos, Việt Nam is one of the largest markets for rhino horn in the world.

5105,'Rare deer-like species rediscovered after nearly 30 years in Việt Nam',"'HÀ NỘI —\xa0A deer-like species thought lost to science for almost three decades has been discovered living in Việt Nam, according to a new study in Nature, Ecology and Evolution.\nKnown as silver-backed chevrotain, the animal was first described in 1910 based on four specimens obtained near the city of Nha Trang.\nThe silver-backed chevrotain was last seen in 1990 when a joint Vietnamese-Russian expedition in Gia Lai province obtained a hunter-killed chevrotain in the vicinity of Đắk Rông and Buôn Luôi.\nNo record of the species has been confirmed since 1990. It was feared that the species might have been on the brink of extinction because of hunting.\nIn March 2017, members of a research team brainstormed about where to look for the chevrotain. They focused on dry coastal forested areas in the vicinity of Nha Trang, as this is the area where the original specimens were collected.\nTrần Văn Bằng,\xa0a Vietnamese biologist, who works for the Southern Institute of Ecology,\xa0and colleagues conducted interviews with local people and forest rangers in Ninh Thuận Province. Then they placed\xa0cameras where the animals were reported likely to visit.\nAfter three months, the team obtained\xa0footage of the species in 15 different places.\nHe told Việt Nam\xa0News: ""Up to now, all records from scientists in the world have shown the silver-backed chevrotain only live in Việt Nam, so this is an endemic species of Việt Nam. This makes it special.\n“The discovery is significant in many aspects. First, discovering a new species contributes a lot to our knowledge on biodiversity. The discovery of an animal which has been lost to science or extinct is confirmation that the ecosystem in that specific area is still suitable for that species.”\n“Scientists particularly care about endemic species as they are highly prone to extinction. The discovery increases the chance for us to protect Việt Nam’s nature and related species through protecting the habitat for the silver-backed chevrotain,” Bằng said.\nA still from a remote camera shows the Silver-backed Chevrotain - long considered to be near-extinct - in a forest in central Việt Nam. Photo courtesy of Global Wildlife Conservation\nAn Nguyễn, a Vietnamese biologist, who works with the Global Wildlife Conservation\xa0(GWC) and a member of the team,\xa0was quoted by AFP as saying:\n“The results were amazing. I was overjoyed when we checked the camera traps and saw photographs of a chevrotain with silver flanks.”\nThe silver-backed chevrotain is the world’s smallest ungulated-hoofed mammal and is around the size of a rabbit.\nThe most distinctive external characteristic of the chevrotain is its unique two-tone pelage coloration, with an ocherous-buff anterior and a silver or grey posterior. The grey hairs are conspicuously tipped with white, giving the posterior a grizzled appearance.\nAccording to Global Wildlife Conservation, they are shy and solitary and weigh less than 4.5kg. It is on the list of top 25 most wanted lost species.\nThe study\'s findings have implications for other species that are lost to science, said Andrew Tilker, Asian Species Officer at the GWC.\n""To the scientific world this was a lost species, but local people had known about it. It was only by utilising the local ecological knowledge that we were successful. That can be replicated for other species in other parts of the world,"" he told CNN.\nBy publishing the findings on the continued existence of the silver-backed chevrotain, the team hopes that more attention would be paid to the species together with additional surveys and protection.\n“Without immediate follow-up action, there is a risk that the silver-back chevrotain could be lost once again,” write the authors.\nBằng said: ""At the moment, our team has just identified one area where footage of chevrotains was found. We still don’t know how many chevrotains are still alive in Việt Nam and where they are.\n""The next step is to find the exact number of them and their whereabouts. We will look for them in other places like Gia Lai, Phú Yên and Khánh Hoà. We will weigh the risks that may decrease the number of chevrotains and only after that will we devise plans to protect them."" — VNS'",4

It is said that if the population of the world continues to consume natural resources at the current rate, by 2050 we will need another one and a half worlds to satisfy our appetite.\n“The consequences of such would be equally alarming. As we consume, we would produce wastes in various quantities and forms. When wastes are not properly managed, they can become problems to the environment. And plastics wastes are among them.”\nHe told Việt Nam News:\xa0“We believe the circular economy concept of make-use-return is now the only solution to replace the linear economy of take-make and dispose.”\nThe philosophy behind the circular economy is focused on making the most out of resources throughout their life cycle, from planning and designing, manufacturing and consumption to waste management and reuse or recycling, all with the aim of promoting the sustainability of the economy, society and environment.\nSixty per cent of plastic waste in the ocean can be traced to five countries in Southeast Asia, Yanaranop said.\nJim Seward, vice president, sustainability, technology and joint ventures, of global chemical company LyondellBasell, said: “We believe the time for action is now. Success will require collaboration and a co-ordinated effort across many sectors to create sustainable outcomes and impacts.”\nBrendan Edgerton, director of circular economy at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, said: “Despite the many benefits plastics bring to people around the world, unmanaged plastic waste has become a global challenge.”\nThe alliance at the event highlighted an initial set of collaborative projects that reflect a range of solutions to end plastic waste.\nIn such projects, the alliance partners with cities in the region to design integrated management systems in large urban areas where infrastructure is lacking.\nIt would also promote technologies, business models and entrepreneurs to prevent ocean plastic waste and develop an open-source data platform to provide valuable information about the sources, location and formats of plastic waste to help support waste management projects.\nThe AEPW is a global non-profit organisation that seeks to end plastic waste in the environment, especially in the oceans, in Southeast Asia.\nIt represents 40 companies that are headquartered in North and South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East\xa0and Asia.\nIt has committed almost US$1 billion worth of funds, and has a goal of investing $1.5 billion, in\xa0action-based projects over the next five years, mostly in Southeast Asia, where the need is greatest.\nAs a founding partner with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the alliance focuses its strategy on key areas such as infrastructure, innovation, education and engagement, and cleaning up.\nResearch shows nearly 80 per cent of the plastic waste in the ocean begins as litter on land, and a vast majority travels to the sea through rivers, canals and other waterways.\nAround eight million tonnes of plastic winds up in the ocean each year.\nThe event was held as part of a conference titled “Circular Economy: Collaboration for Action”, hosted by SCG, which closed on Monday. — VNS'",4

1586,'Start-ups make significant contributions to agriculture',"'Thiên Nhiên Việt Import-Export Company’s pennywort farm area in Củ Chi District, HCM City. — Photo courtesy of the company\nXuân Hương\nHCM CITY\xa0—\xa0Nguyễn Ngọc Hương of HCM City’s Củ Chi District and her collaborators have jointly set up a start-up to produce freeze-dried powders from vegetables and leaves.\nThe use of pasteurised freeze-dried technology helps retain the original flavours and natural colours. The powders are made into drinks by adding water.\nBesides, since the powders are made by grinding with granite stone mortars, they are very soft.\nIn order to ensure supply of clean produce, Hương and her partners grow them in Tân An Hội Commune in Củ Chi.\nAfter starting with pennywort,\xa0her Thiên Nhiên Việt Import-Export Company has since developed various instant powders like perilla, moringa, green tea, lotus leaf, and chameleon leaf.\n""The company\'s freeze-dried powders have been marketed around for more than three years and received positive feedback from consumers,"" Hương says.\nThey are now available at grocery stores around the country and online, and the company plans to get ISO certification to export, she said.\nHer project won the first prize at the 2019 Innovation Start-up Project Contest held by the Business Study and Assistance Centre in collaboration with the Rural Youth Committee of Central Youth Union recently.\nAnother start-up that has created a great impact is one that produces compost and breeds earthworms. It belongs to Lê Minh Vương, a graduate of the Saigon University, who won the second prize in the contest in 2015.\nVương says: “At the end of my second year and beginning of my third year at university, I realised by chance the great benefits earthworms bring to agriculture when I was doing a thesis on treating the waste in shrimp ponds.\n“Earthworms can benefit agriculture by improving soil, which is seriously degraded by chemical fertilisers. But people do not pay much attention to them.”\nSo he wants to promote the benefits of earthworms by breeding them and making various products like vermicompost, a kind of organic fertiliser.\n“The Vietnamese market knows about the benefits of vermicompost, so a lot of people are using it. And currently there is not enough to supply the market.\n“My company, the Southern Earthworm Company, has enjoyed good growth. We produce various kinds of products such as vermicompost, earthworm fluid, earthworm pellets, dried earthworms, animal feed, and bran pellets.\n“We plan to introduce a very unique product, not only for Việt Nam but also the world, by the end of this year: cosmetics produced from earthworm mucus, with the worms bred using clean technology.\n“We will set up a clean earthworm breeding area at our 3,000sq.m earthworm farm to ensure the raw material source for making the cosmetics as well as other products.\n“We will also provide services of processing pig manure for medium-sized and large pig farms that have from 10,000 to 100,000 pigs to transform waste into compost.”\nVương also says he has a 3ha farm where he has been cultivating mango, durian, sugar-apple, mangosteen, and other fruits using vermicompost for almost a year, and a few thousand square metres of land for growing green leafy vegetables.\nThese are among successful start-ups in the agricultural sector.\nEvaluating agricultural start-ups set up recently, Vũ Kim Hạnh, chairwoman of the High Quality Vietnamese Product Association and member of the Innovation Start-up Project Contest’s jury for many years, says: “Most of the projects know how to utilise their [local] advantages and technologies for growing and processing agricultural products to increase the value of these resources.\n“Young people are particularly enthusiastic about developing projects and products,” she says.\nMany start-ups understand how to develop new products that meet the needs of niche markets, which is one of the important criteria in starting a business, she explains.\nTrần Anh Tuấn, CEO of The Pathfinder, who has been a mentor for many start-up projects, says: “Starting an agriculture business in Việt Nam is quite difficult, so I appreciate the efforts of those who choose agricultural products to start a business.”\nBesides successful projects, many start-up projects have failed due to a variety of reasons, mostly due to their own faults rather than by the competition, he says.\n“Many start-ups thought their business model was great, everyone needed their products and liked them, but then their products were not accepted by the market.\n“Therefore, the message for start-ups is to never live and die with the original idea. On the contrary, they need to be flexible and ready to change to create new products with new values.\n“Owners of start-ups must constantly gather feedback from consumers to tweak their products and even strategies to meet market needs.”\nHe suggests that start-ups should link up with experts to get advice from them and with their peers to share their experiences in sales, marketing and others.\n“Without that, start-ups will find it difficult to succeed. Starting up is a journey in which you can learn from many different sources and about the successes and failures of your peers. We should not think we know everything and be open to learning.”\nĐoàn Sao Mai, another expert, concurs, saying: “Start-ups should enhance closer connection not only in trading but also in production. For example, when buying packaging, if you cooperate and make it a single order, the cost will be lower.”\nHương says: “Over the past three years I have played many roles from that of farmer growing vegetables to a producer and economic planner.\n“With many lessons I have learnt during my start-up journey, I am willing to share experience with other start-ups who also want to improve the value of Vietnamese agricultural products.” — VNS'",1

2902,'VN exporters can only take advantage of CPTPP with preparation',"Delegates discuss opportunities and challenges arising from CPTPP for Việt Nam’s garment and textile, footwear, timber products and beverage sectors at a conference held in HCM City on December 5. — VNS Photo\nHCM CITY — With preferential tariffs provided under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Việt Nam has the opportunity to increase exports of garments, footwear, timber products, and beverages to other member countries.\nBut Vietnamese enterprises’ ability to take advantage depends on their preparation, Nguyễn Thị Thu Trang, director of the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s WTO and Integration Centre, said.\nSpeaking at a conference titled 'Opportunities and Challenges from CPTPP for Việt Nam’s Garment and Textile, Footwear, Timber Products and Beverage Sectors' held in HCM City on December 5, she said: “Our exports of footwear, garment and textile, timber products, and beverages to CPTPP member countries account for 12.5 per cent, 16.04 per cent, 20 per cent\xa0and 23.46 per cent of their total exports.\n“We export a lot to CPTPP member countries, but our market share remains modest, for instance at 2-2.9 per cent of their footwear imports and 0-6 per cent of garment and textile imports. Therefore, there is still much more room for Vietnamese firms to boost exports.\n“Canada, Mexico and Peru are countries that Việt Nam does not have free trade agreement with, thus CPTPP offers great opportunities for Vietnamese firms to access these markets through preferential tariffs.”\nBut to capitalise on the opportunities, the products must meet the CPTPP’s rules of origin and conform with sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements and technical barriers to trade (TBT), she said.\n“If we do not meet their requirements, we cannot utilise the preferential tariffs that CPTPP member countries offer to us.”\nJapan, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand\xa0and Chile are countries that Việt Nam has bilateral or multilateral FTAs with.\nThe CPTPP creates another preferential tariff scheme for businesses, who, depending on which FTA offers more advantages, should choose that to export under, she said.\nKhưu Thị Thanh Thủy, general secretary of the HCM City Textile and Garment - Embroidery Association, said Vietnamese garment and textile firms have faced difficulty in meeting the CPTPP’s rules of origin since their raw material imports from countries outside the CPTPP remain high.\nLocal and foreign firms are now investing in the underdeveloped textile, dyeing and fabric segments to increase the local content rate, she said.\nNguyễn Chánh Phương, deputy chairman of the Handicrafts and Wood Industry Association of HCM City, said:\xa0“Meeting the rules of origin is not a difficult task for the wood products sector.”\nBut the sector has not benefited much in terms of tariff duties from the CPTPP because import tariffs on Vietnamese furniture were already very low and even zero in many markets, he said.\n“Most companies in the timber industry make their products in the form of OEM (according to customers’ orders). Firms mainly wait for buyers to come. With the current good market situation, for example, a strong increase in exports to the US, firms may not find new opportunities.”\nHe said local firms should do market research to appropriately target exports, adding that businesses, especially large ones, need to have market research divisions to discover new opportunities brought by FTAs and changes from competitors.\nVõ Tân Thành, director of the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s HCM City branch, said: “Tariff commitments in the CPTPP come with relatively detailed and complex rules of origin, which not all businesses know how to comply with.\n“Therefore, understanding CPTPP commitments, the conditions required to take advantage of the opportunities, their impacts on market prospects and development trends in these sectors are important for Vietnamese enterprises to take advantage of the exciting opportunities arising from the CPTPP.”\nDomestic market\nWhile offering benefits in terms of creating export opportunities and improving incomes for millions of workers, the agreement also creates competitive pressure in the domestic market since Việt Nam has also to lower tariffs on imports from other member countries.\nTheoretically, CPTPP would bring intense competition in the domestic market, Trang told the media on the sidelines of the conference.\n“But our competitiveness in these sectors is relatively strong. In addition, at least seven partners in the CPTPP have FTAs with us and we have already opened the market wide to them. Therefore, there has been competition in these sectors after the CPTPP took effect, but it is not a big shock.\n“We are very successful in exporting\xa0these products and account for rather large market shares in many foreign markets.\n“But firms did not pay much attention to the domestic market. So I hope businesses pay attention to the domestic market since many foreign companies consider our market a delicious piece of cake.”\nCompeting at home would be easier for local firms and so they should tweak their strategy to focus more on the domestic market, she added. — VNS",2

More than 65 per cent of the surveyed enterprises had\xa0only heard of it briefly.\nVũ Xuân Phong, former vice president of Việt Nam International Arbitration Centre (VIAC), said the signing of\xa0EVFTA\xa0had\xa0opened a new era for both Việt Nam and the EU as the country\xa0would\xa0have\xa0access to Europe’s\xa0500\xa0million-strong consumer market.\nViệt Nam is among the top 10 exporting countries to\xa0the EU.\xa0Within ASEAN, Việt Nam is EU’s second biggest trade partner and\xa0largest exporter of goods.\n“However, most Vietnamese enterprises still do not have a deep understanding of the major free trade agreement,” he said.\xa0“This is a worrying sign.”\nNguyễn Thảo Hiền, deputy director of the European-American Market Department under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said the\xa0EU in 2018 was\xa0Việt Nam’s second largest export partner, after the US.\xa0However, in the first 11 months of 2019 exports reached only US$38.38 billion, a slight drop of 1.26 per cent over the same period last year.\nThe signing of EVFTA would provide great opportunities for Vietnamese agricultural products, footwear, textiles, computers, plastic products, and seafood.\nOther key sectors include automobiles and motorcycles,\xa0green growth, intellectual property rights, transportation and logistics.\nThe elimination of bilateral tariffs and export taxes as well as the\xa0reduction of non-tariff barriers affecting\xa0cross-border exchanges of goods and services is\xa0expected to boost bilateral trade, she said.\nHowever, the EU has set strict criteria for product quality to protect consumers’ health, including\xa0high technical\xa0standards and regulations on\xa0packaging and\xa0labeling, she added.\n“Vietnamese enterprises must be fully aware of the commitments made by\xa0Việt Nam in the trade agreement.”\nRecommendations\nHiền, deputy director of the European-American Market Department, said that\xa0enterprises must adhere\xa0to Rules of Origin (RO), especially as\xa0traceability regulations for\xa0importing countries have become increasingly\xa0strict.\nEnterprises should also meet\xa0food safety and hygiene\xa0standards and management procedures set by the EU, as well as corporate social responsibility\xa0and transparency of information on labour and the working\xa0environment, she said.\nThe\xa0use of modern methods will\xa0ensure strict control of\xa0goods’ authenticity,\xa0quality and origin, she added.\nTo enhance competitiveness,\xa0Vietnamese manufacturers should also shift to\xa0advanced production and processing systems, according to Hiền.\nFrom a legal perspective, Châu Việt Bắc, deputy secretary general of VI-AC, said that commercial arbitration could\xa0resolve conflicts between the Government and investors or between enterprises and enterprises in\xa0trade deals.\nThanks to a\xa0simple and fast process, commercial arbitration has become\xa0effective for\xa0businesses that encounter problems\xa0in signing contracts, while\xa0helping\xa0facilitate access to the EU\xa0market.\nTrương Đình Hòe, general secretary of Việt Nam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP), said that enterprises of seafood exports had\xa0prepared all the required conditions of the EU to obtain certificate of origin,\xa0certificate of food hygiene and safety, and certified environmentally friendly products.\nVASEP\xa0in 2019\xa0failed to achieve its target of $2 billion worth of exports of seafood to the EU.\xa0The association has\xa0set the same target for 2020, accounting for 20 per cent of the country’s total seafood export, according to Hoè.\nThe EVFTA,\xa0signed on June 30 in Hà Nội, is one of the most ambitious agreements concluded between the EU and Việt Nam. Over a 10-year period, more than\xa099 per cent of tariffs on goods from both sides will eventually be\xa0removed. — VNS'",2

It is expected to vote for the agreement on January 31, 2020 and the agreement could be approved in February 2020.\nLange also pointed out other issues that have remained obstacles for both Việt Nam and the EU such as tangible areas (cars and car parts) and consumer protection.\nSpeaking highly of Việt Nam’s decision to ratify ILO’s Convention 98 on organised and collective bargaining right, the\xa0official hoped the Government and the National Assembly would soon find the way to say “yes” to two other conventions – the Convention 105 on abolition of forced labour and Convention 87 on freedom of association – at the ongoing National Assembly meeting, paving the way for EU members to vote for the European-Viet Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA).\nThe press conference was organised by the German political organisation Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, the Institute for Policy Studies and Media Development\xa0and the Centre for Integration and Development. — VNS",2

However, individuals and organisations can purchase them and resell at a higher price. Some books even are sold for several million đồng. A large amount of State assets is seriously wasted, causing a loss for the country’s precious knowledge resources,” he said.\nTrần Văn Túy, head of the NA Standing Committee’s Commission for NA Members’ Affairs, said some libraries are located at communal peoples’ committees, which are not always open and accessible to the public.\nMany books remained unopened, even though they were sent to the library a long time before.\nPresenting an assessment report on the draft law, Phan Thanh Bình, chairman of the NA Committee for Culture, Education, Youth and Children, said after 18 years of implementation, the Ordinance of Library has revealed many shortcomings and was no longer consistent with the reality and the relevant legal system.\nThe development of science and technology has created great progress of the library’s science sector, changing the way people access information in libraries, he said.\nHe said: “The system in Việt Nam, particularly the public library, is ineffective, failing to meet the demand of people. Due attention hasn’t been given to school libraries and reading culture has changed because of information accession.”\nDuring the discussion, NA deputies agreed the promulgation of the Law on Libraries would contribute to creating a legal corridor for the development of the sector, promoting reading culture and ensuring the right to access information, culture and help the lifelong learning of people.\nHowever, they pointed out people rarely went to libraries at communes and about 30 per cent of libraries at district level were not granted books.\nAlthough many provinces and districts have nice libraries, their target of attracting readers was largely ignored.\nParticipants also agreed about the need to diversify libraries, including non-state ones like those of social and professional organisations and those in the private sector. They said the building of digital libraries or digital resources were common trends of modern libraries given the change of habits and information accession in the society.\nThey said it was necessary for the draft law to have regulations on copyright relating to digital books and the digitalisation of documents to facilitate the development of digital libraries.\nDespite accounting for large numbers, the majority of school libraries failed to fulfill their role, deputies said. Therefore, they called for clarification of responsibilities of the State and relevant bodies with a view to promote the development of school libraries. — VNS'",0

5333,'Save the Red-shanked Doucs of Sơn Trà',"'Red-shanked doucs are on the Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nby Vĩnh Quyền\nSince November 2017 I often come to visit Sơn Trà Nature Reserve in Đà Nẵng. There, in the forest’s green lungs, I made friends with the red-shanked doucs, one among 287 species of fauna at Sơn Trà.\nDoucs are native to Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and southernmost provinces of China. With their five-colour coats, they stand out from the great family of primates around the world. And so, they are dubbed ""queen of primates"".\nPhotographers love red-shanked doucs because of their colours. With time, the colours of a douc transform and become complete. Doucs under eight months have a blackish-blue face, pale chestnut body, gray tail, and black arms and feet. As a young adult from eight months to three years, doucs gradually adopt their five-colour coat: pink face, black head, hands and feet, gray body, white arms and tail. Most outstanding is their reddish-brown legs from the knee to the foot.\nThe feeding budget of Red-shanked Doucs are leaves (87.8%), fruits and seeds (10.2%), flowers (1.6%) and bark/pith (0.4%).\nThe current population of doucs at Sơn Trà numbers about 1,300 and zoologists say they have the most beautiful colours of their species.\nA young douc performing this jump on its own is a sign that it is independent. Adult red-shanked doucs can jump as far as seven metres, proof of their strength and acrobatic finesse.\nWhen I look back at my photos of doucs frozen in flight, I am always reminded of this “mid-air dance”. Powerful arms help doucs move easily through the forest by swinging from branch to branch as they jump from tree to tree.\nI eagerly snap images whenever I see infant red-shanked doucs, creatures both innocent and mischievous. I am moved by the presence of infant doucs for another reason: Red-shanked doucs are on the Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). So, infant red-shanked doucs give hope for the future of this rare primate species.\n\n\nA young red-shanked douc performing this jump on its own is a sign that it is independent. Adult red-shanked doucs can jump as far as 20 feet, proof of their strength and acrobatic finesse.VNS Photo Vĩnh Quyền\nI have shot quite a lot of pictures of the leading doucs because I had to face them before I could approach the other members of their families. Red-shanked doucs live in groups. The smallest unit is a family with a male, a female, and a few infants. A male living with many females can have up to twenty members. Each family has a male leader. He guards the other members as they eat and play, and alerts them when danger is near. He also helps his mate to rear their children.\nOther groups comprise several small families with blood relations. Each group has its own territory and does not enter that of its neighbours.\nRed-shanked doucs eat almost constantly, though they are not a gluttonous species. On the contrary, they are quite fussy about what they eat. Among the more than 1,000 species of plants at Sơn Trà, only about 150 species are consumed by doucs.\n\n\nDoucs’ sexual behavior begins at three years of age. Females first gave birth at over four years of age, and fathering males were between four and five years of age.VNS Photo Vĩnh Quyền\n\nAccording to zoologists, their diet comprises 88 per\xa0cent\xa0leaves, 10 per cent\xa0fruits and seeds, 1.5 per\xa0cent\xa0flowers, and less than 1 per cent\xa0bark/pith.\nStaple plants of red-shanked doucs at Sơn Trà\xa0include parashorea, crepe-myrtle, morning glory, garcinia, ficus, and ancistrocladus.\nSuch a menu barely provides enough nutrition, which is why they must eat throughout the day.\nPortrait of a Red-shanked Douc. VNS Photo Vĩnh Quyền\nAt institutes in Việt Nam and around the world, many scientific works and papers are dedicated to researching red-shanked doucs at Sơn Trà.\nIn addition to the IUCN and the Douc Langur Foundation (USA), there is the NGO GreenViet based in Đà Nẵng. Since 2012, GreenViet has led a movement to protect this rare primate species. — VNS'",4

VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Chinh\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam must continue to improve on its Law on Enterprises,\xa0experts and researchers said at a law conference in Hà Nội yesterday.\nThe business code, since its formation in 1999 and two major reforms in 2005 and 2014, still has numerous shortcomings and limitations, according to the experts.\nCompliance costs – expenses incurred to keep up with industry\xa0regulations – remained high. Notably, decreases in compliance, if any, were often results of Government directives or reform programmes when what the country desperately needs is a framework to reduce such costs systematically, said Dr Nguyễn Đình Cung, former head of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and member of the Economic Council under the Prime Minister.\nMinistries and agencies tend to over-regulate the business sector, especially firms specialised in legal services, finance and banking. Technical barriers often proved to be significant hurdles to starting operations in such fields. Level of policy risk and legal complication remained high. Businesses often found themselves without reliable means to protect their legitimate interests, said CIEM’s former head.\nMinistries were slow to push for legal reforms thanks to both red tape and a lack of incentives.\n“One cannot expect changes to come from within the ministries. If what we are hoping for are swift legal reforms we must find the strength to push for them in the private sector,” said Cung.\nOn the other hand, according to Cung, the law has been getting more lax when it comes to State-owned-enterprises (SoEs). Regulatory oversights and poor law-enforcement have resulted in many SoEs being unable to establish an efficient management framework or fail to adhere to good management practices.\nPhạm Đức Trung, head researcher of CIEM’s business reform and development, said the country has been struggling with the implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 39 principles for corporate governance as a standard for business management.\nFor example, the State has yet to define its strategy and function in many SoEs even after the formation of the Committee for Management of State Capital at Enterprises – a central body responsible for the management of a massive amount of assets owned by the State in SoEs.\nA lack of autonomy has resulted in SoEs being unable to adopt modern management standards because SoEs cannot make important decisions without approval from\xa0the State, Trung said.\nTrung called for greater autonomy be granted to SoEs along with accountability for their performance. The State must build a system of performance criteria for SoEs to follow and they must be made to publicise financial information and their management board selection.\xa0— VNS",2

Photo tripsavvy.com\nHCM CITY — HCM City has set a target of achieving a growth rate of 8.5 per cent for Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) next year, with total private investment accounting for 35 per cent of GRDP.\nNguyễn Thiện Nhân, secretary of the city’s Party Committee, said the city next year would aim to create 44,000 new businesses, creating 135,000 new jobs for its people.\nSpeaking at the end of a two-day meeting last week in the city, Nhân said the city’s labour productivity was nearly three times that of the whole country, and that its State budget revenue exceeded 3.3 per cent of the target for the year.\nProgress was also being made in a creative urban area in the city’s Eastern part (District 2 and 9) and a project to build a smart city.\nThe implementation of National Assembly Resolution 54, which gives more autonomy to the city to speed up development, had seen positive results as well.\nThe city also targeted becoming the largest start-up centre in the country, Nhân said.\n“In an aim to attract more investment for much-needed infrastructure, HCM City is trying to become a digital- and knowledge-based economy with a highly skilled workforce,” he added.\nThe city will also continue to support enterprises with high competitiveness, focusing on green growth and the well-being of its people, according to Nhân.\nDespite achievements, he said the city was facing unsustainable development, decreasing competitiveness in some sectors, and slow administrative reforms.\nTo achieve the targets, the municipal government would improve competitiveness to ensure growth, and work to create a transparent business environment to draw more investment.\nState-owned enterprises would be restructured to enhance their efficiency, while export markets would be diversified to avoid dependence on a single market.\nThe city would also continue investing in urban infrastructure and climate-change adaptation, as well as flood-prevention and traffic congestion programme.\nKey industrial sectors that use advanced technology and have high added value, with an ability to join global value chains, would be the focus of development.\nIn addition, domestic supporting industries would be given assistance in an aim to reduce imports of spare parts and manufacturing equipment.\nThis year the city’s economic growth is expected to be 8.32 per cent, slightly higher than last year’s 8.3 per cent, according to Nhân.\nThe city’s economic scale accounts for nearly 24 per cent of the national economic scale, the highest figure ever.\nThis year, the city’s budget revenue is expected to surpass the target, an increase of 9 per cent over last year.

The ownership limit could create fear among foreign investors.”\nLegal concerns\nLegal experts also said the limit could violate commitments to the\xa0World Trade Organisation (WTO) and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).\nThe retroactive provisions in Article 42 were contrary to Article 74 of the Investment Law, and contrary to commitments to protect investment in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, which may lead to risks that the Vietnamese Government could be sued by foreign investors.\nĐặng Thanh Sơn, associate lawyer at\xa0Baker McKenzie Law Firm, cited the case of China being sued by the WTO when applying similar restrictions in the field of electronic payments.\nYee Chung Seck, a representative of the Singapore Business Association, said that\xa0though the restriction\xa0on fintech in Indonesia was not that big, it was enough to divert\xa0foreign investment flows from the industry.\nSeck said Việt Nam should avoid this scenario,\xa0especially after\xa0the Government had\xa0committed to promoting\xa0Industry\xa04.0 and encouraging the development of a digital economy.\nVirginia Foote, a representative of the\xa0American Chamber of Commerce\xa0in Việt Nam (AmCham\xa0Vietnam)\xa0and co-chair of the Việt Nam Business Forum (VBF), suggested the drafting board should\xa0reconsider the issue due to the influence it would have on investor confidence in the country.\nOn behalf of the drafting board, Deputy Director of the SBV Payment Department\xa0Lê Anh Dũng said: “The limit is a reasonable ratio in line with international commitments, ensuring the interests of all parties, and serving the sovereignty and rights of Việt Nam in the payment industry.""\nHowever, he\xa0also said the SBV appreciated\xa0all the comments,\xa0adding that the board would\xa0take them into consideration.\xa0— VNS'",2

The political motivation integrated into the trade war is unpredictable. This continues to be a risk not only for the global economy but also for Viet Nam's economy in the near future, BSC said.\nViệt Nam is likely to stay in the FTSE Russell watch-list. Earlier, in March, FTSE Russell kept Việt Nam in the watch-list to upgrade to Secondary emerging market but downgraded some criteria compared to the previous review in September 2018.\nETFs FTSE and VNM will also restructure their portfolios of stocks in the third quarter. Portfolio restructuring activities, though, will also create fluctuations, especially when the trading time and maturity term of future contracts coincide, BSC said.\nThe market will welcome the third quarter business results in the second half of September, but this is not yet a breakthrough when negative information from the global market is still ahead, the company forecast.\nIn September, BSC proposed two scenarios for the benchmark VN-Index. In the positive case, the VN-Index will remain above 965 points in the correction span, with the central price zone of 980 points. Price movements welcomed the third quarter business results, improved liquidity in some sectors and stocks with good growth prospects.\nIn the negative case, the VN-Index may drop below 950 points if there is adverse information from the world and foreign investors net sell.\nAccording to Bảo Việt Securities Company, next week, the VN-Index is forecast to experience some corrections and recover toward market close.\nThe VN-Index will receive support from the 970-point zone, where the market would possibly recover. However, the index could also drop to a deeper support zone 955-960 points if 970-point zone is violated.

In the third quarter, Việt Nam’s GDP growth recorded a nine-year high. The US Federal Reserves’ decision to cut interest rates and the constant reduction of interest rates among the central banks around the world also spells good news for the global stock markets and the Vietnamese stock market, according to Chung.\nAccording to Bảo Việt Securities Co (BVSC), the VN-Index is expected to enter an uptrend toward resistance zone of 1,035-1,045 points very soon.\n“In a shorter term, the index will possibly head toward the resistance zone of 1,019-1,024 points next week,” BVSC said.\n“However, the index may encounter a throwback to 1,000-1,006 point range before continuing its uptrend.”\nCash flow is forecast to improve while foreign investors’ net buy is expected to increase after FED’s interest rate cut. Large-cap and bank stocks will possibly dominate the market. Cash flow is expected to rotate among stock sectors to support the market’s uptrend.\nIf the 1,000-1.004 resistance zone is penetrated, the market may experience some short volatility, which is a good opportunity for investors to buy new or cover previously sold positions, according to BVSC.\nNguyễn Trung Du, Director of the Business Development Section at VNDirect Securities Co said the flourishing of VN-Index on Friday dispelled market gloom and cautious sentiment that had lasted for the whole of the previous month.\nMembers of the “Vin” family, Vingroup (VIC), Vinhomes (VHM) and Vincom Retail (VRE), reported impressive gains and pushed up the indices.\nVHM soared 11 per cent last week and contributed more than nine points to the rise of VN-Index.\nDu said improved liquidity and a vibrant trading would bring cash flow back to the market and open up many short-term trading opportunities while the positive context of the international stock market will support the Vietnamese market in the next trading week.\nAccording to Nguyễn Hồng Khanh, head of market analysis at Việt Nam International Securities Joint Stock Company (VIS), the market is in the recovery period and this is the best time to purchase stocks.\n“There will be some correction sessions, but the overall market trend from now until the end of the first quarter of next year is growing,” Khanh said.\n“Banking and retail will be more attractive than other sectors,” he said.\nOn the Hà Nội Stock Exchange, the HNX-Index rose 0.53 per cent to end Friday at 105.75 points.\nThe northern index gained a total of 0.99 per cent last week. — VNS'",2

1766,'Việt Nam expects the switch in education workforce',"'HÀ NỘI — Vietnamese teachers currently spend too much time on administrative tasks instead of focusing on teaching which restrains the country’s education sector from unleashing its potential.\nAn innovative approach which puts students at the forefront with teachers and other professionals supporting them will ease the burden on school staff and better cater for children.\nThe warning was voiced by experts as details of the report “Transforming the Education Workforce: Learning Teams for a Learning Generation” was released in Hà Nội on Wednesday.\nIssued by the Education Commission, a global initiative working towards Sustainable Development Goal 4 – ensuring inclusive and quality education and promoting lifelong learning for all, provides innovative visions for concreting, diversifying and reshaping an education workforce with an aim to offer inclusive and high-quality education for all students.\nAccording to the report, quality of teachers is key to improving standards but many countries, including Việt Nam, are facing limited access to resources to improve their capacities and apply technology.\nAmy Bellinger, leader of the Education Workforce Initiative – the Education Commission’s body in charge of the report, suggested three interactive visions which would help to tackle urgent challenges and ultilise opportunities for positive changes, especially in developing and low-income countries.\nThe first vision involves the enhancement of existing systems which aims to professionalise education workforce through processes of recruitment, capacity development and management.\nThe improvement of initial teacher training standards was also stressed as the core solution to raise learning results.\nThe second vision touches upon the development of learning teams which consist of professionals including qualified teachers, trainee teachers and welfare professionals of all levels – classrooms, schools, districts, nations and beyond – aiming to boost students’ inclusion.\n“This means the diverse needs of children can be met and teachers can focus on teaching and have greater support. It takes a team to educate a child,” explained Bellinger.\n“Using a learning team approach is about investing in social capital as well as a human capital in the education workforce,” she added.\nThe third vision, on a larger scale, emphasises the need of transforming an education system into a learning system.\nA learning system, the report suggests, gathers networks of educators and professionals, interdisciplinary partnerships and data sharing system.\n“Most education systems were designed during the Industrial Revolution to bring education to the masses,” said Ju-Ho Lee, the initiative commissioner.\n“Now, more than 150 years later, we need an education workforce and system that can respond to the rapid changes in today’s world – demographic shifts, environmental changes, scientific advances and technology innovation.”\nAlthough Việt Nam outperformed many high-income countries in the Programme for International Students Assessment, the country’s thriving economy is asking for different types of skills and innovations, the Education Commission Director Liesbet Steer suggested.\nViệt Nam’s application\nThe National Assembly has approved the 2019 Education Law which formalise the expenditure of 20 per cent of the State budget for education and training activities.\nAccording to Tạ Ngọc Trí, deputy director of Deparment of Primary Education, any primary and secondary school teachers will be required to hold at least one university bachelor degree. The rising standard is expected to ensure the switch from the education based on a general curriculum to the education individualised for each students.\nThe general educational curriculum unveiled in December 2018 places a focus on STEM education through the learning-by-doing approach.\nMinistry of Education and Training in collaboration with the US-based Arizona State University is now working on the “high tech, high touch learning” which experiments and analyses how adaptive and active learning can free up teachers’ time and help them focus on developing students’ ability of discussing, project building, problem solving and other soft skills.\nNguyễn Quý Thanh, director of University of Education under Việt Nam National University – Hà Nội, said the approach had been applied for trainee teachers and piloted in teaching mathematics and literature for tenth graders.\n“Normally, there are from 50 – 60 students in a classroom, making it possible for a teacher to monitor them all. We are developing an AI-integrated system which helps teachers assess students to offer them constructive consultations and advice based on their needs,” he said. “Without technology application, it is impossible to provide personalised education.”\nIn order to push forward the country’s education quality, it was also essential to develop capacity, leadership, commitment and growth mindset among teachers-to-be, Thanh said. He also cited the cheating scandal in the 2018 National Examination in three mountainous northern provinces of Hà Giang, Sơn La and Hoà Bình which involved many educators and officials as “the bitter experience showing that if we do not pay right attention to promote education workforce it can bring out negative results”. — VNS'",1

A partnership was created in 2016 that made Family responsible for administering community-based HIV testing for high-risk groups, including men having sex with men (MSM), finding cases of infection and persuading them to have antiretroviral (ARV) treatment with the support of Thái Nguyên CDC and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nSince then, the group of 20 members has provided free HIV screening tests for 700 people and accompanied 200 HIV-infected people on their ARV treatment journeys.\nMost of them are students and workers, aged from 18 to 25.\n“It is not simple to convince MSM to take HIV tests as they have to face enormous social stigma and always tend to hide their own identity,” Hoàng said.\n“Over the past four years, we have approached a thousand MSM. In conversations, we avoid mentioning sexual orientations and HIV, instead, we introduce our services of providing free condoms and lubricants. The process has to be repeated over and over again to build trust until they are comfortable enough to expose themselves and are ready to take tests,” he added.\nSo far, this year, the group has uncovered 37 cases of new HIV infections. All of them were sent to Thái Nguyên CDC for treatment.\n“We face huge challenges dealing with clients’ emotions while waiting for their test results,” said Hoàng. “Administering a test is easy, you only need to follow certain steps but no one has ever told us how to psychologically support people while they are waiting for the results.”\nOne of Family’s earliest clients committed suicide. The tragic incident has haunted Hoàng for years.\n“It used to take a week for test results to come back. It was hell for our clients. Sucidal thoughts came up at night when they were all alone. We had to follow them, and talk to them about self-harming,” he said.\n“Now, test results are ready within a day, and we tell them being HIV-positive is not a death sentence as long as they follow ARV treatment. That is really a relief.”\nThere is a bookshelf filled with dozens of Japanese\xa0manga\xa0comics in Hoàng’s tiny bedsit, which also serves as a meeting place and test centre.\n“Clients can read a couple pages of the comics while waiting for their test results. It stops them from thinking too much, even for 20 minutes,” he said.\n\n\nFamily’s bookshelf is filled with comics and brochures for clients to read while waiting for their results. —\xa0VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nPaying back\nLê Thanh Hậu used to be a drug user before witnessing his family break into pieces.\nReturning from a local drug rehab centre in 2016, he started revamping his life by becoming a volunteer at Thái Nguyên Province Outpatient Clinic, supporting ARV patients and searching for new cases of HIV infections.\n“It was strange how health workers at Thái Nguyên CDC treated me dearly like a family member,” Hậu said. “Their kindness motivated me to do something good in order to pay back for the sinful past I left behind.”\nAlong with four friends, Hậu wanders into countless alleys in Thái Nguyên City and nearby localities in search of drug users to convince them to take HIV tests.\n“There used to be some infamous spots where hundreds of needles used to hang out of banana trees,” Hậu said.\n“The situation has changed a lot now. Drug users are getting younger. They prefer amphetamine-type stimulants like ecstasy which make them lose control and become more vulnerable to HIV due to unsafe sex,” he added.\nSome of Hậu’s friends, who were unable to quit the habit, show him where addicts gather.\n“People say I will fall back into my old ways if I keep on visiting drug dens.

3473,'Pork supply to meet market demand by Tết festival',"'Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phùng Đức Tiến\nThe price of pork is expected to increase in the last months of 2019 and before Tết (Lunar New Year) in 2020 because African swine fever has caused the supply of pork to drop.\nDeputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Phùng Đức Tiến talks to local media about this issue.\nHow is the domestic pork price forecast to increase?\nIn the domestic market, there are forecasts that pig prices will increase to high levels. However, over the past month, the price was still around VNĐ48,000-50,000 per kilo of live hog. This shows that supply still meets demand.\nThere is no reason to forecast a lack of meat for the Tết festival in 2020. About 93 per cent of pigs were unaffected by African swine fever.\nThe price of pork in the Chinese market is rising – up to VNĐ100,000 per kilo of live hog in some localities – due to a shortage of pork. The crisis of supply means some provinces and cities have opened frozen pork storage, such as Jinan City, Hainan Province, Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, enhancing pork supply for the local market.\nHowever, China has recently reduced its imports of pork through border gates, and at the same time, it has increased the traceability and food safety of imported foods under commercial contracts.\nThose issues in neighbouring markets do not affect the pork price in the Vietnamese market.\nWhat will the ministry do to ensure enough pork\xa0and reduce the pressure on pork prices towards CPI?\nFacing African swine fever, the Government and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have directed the restructuring of the livestock sector.\nAs a result, the sector had a growth of about 3 per cent in cattle production in the first eight months of this year.\nPoultry production gained a growth rate of about 10 per cent. It is expected to increase from 11-13 per cent from now to the end of the year, with 409 million units of poultry and 11.6 billion eggs. Those products will partly offset the shortage of pork.\nMeanwhile, production of aquaculture in the first eight months rose by 5.7 per cent and is expected to reach a growth rate of 8 per cent for this year, ensuring both export and production growth targets.\nWhat will the ministry do to re-breed pigs in localities after African swine fever, especially regarding bio-safety breeding solutions?\nThe ministry\xa0has asked localities to implement synchronous measures on controlling African swine fever for stability in production and restructuring the livestock industry to diversify products.\nPig breeding maintains a large proportion in the meat structure because of the high demand for the daily meals of Vietnamese people. Therefore, if there is no solution for re-production, the risk of pork shortage is very high, especially towards year end and next year.\nIn fact, there are many companies applying bio-safety breeding measures for their production of pig, poultry and cattle, such as the pig breeding of Quế Lâm Group, Amavet Group and the Southern Breeding Sub-Institute.\nIn the process of re-development of pig herds, the ministry has guided the transportation of pig varieties and has also provided support for pig breeding facilities to ensure bio-safety in those facilities. Therefore, pig breeding facilities have basically maintained their production despite African swine fever. This ensures enough quality pig varieties to meet production needs.\nWith the strong development of the bio-safety pig breeding measure in provinces and cities nationwide and the development of breeding cattle, poultry and fishery products, the domestic market is expected to have enough meat for the upcoming Tết holiday.\nAccording to the Livestock Department, in 2016, there were 2,147 bio-safety pig farms, accounting for 18.3 per cent of total pig farms nationwide. This figure rose by 15.6 per cent in 2017 to nearly 2,500 farms, accounting for 24.4 per cent of the total pig farms. VNS'",2

They were at different stages of development, such as obtaining permission for project site investigation, permission for investment and formulation of investment construction projects.\nAs of the end of 2017, it was estimated that PV panel production plants in Việt Nam have a total design capacity of about 6,000MW with annual production of about 300-400MW for export.\nEnvironmental, economic and social impacts\nAccording to Đặng Hương Giang, an expert from Việt Nam Energy Institute, grid-connected solar power projects require large flat land areas.\nThese land areas include unused land, shifting forest land, agricultural land, water surface land, people land and public structure land turned into industrial land for projects.\nThese lands would be restored to their initial state at the end of projects.\nUnused land, wild land, production forest land, inundated land, inefficient one-crop land and inefficient production forest land could be used for solar power projects.\nAccording to results of an investigation in 2017, the number of households to be removed from solar power project areas during the preparation of the supplemented plan and construction time was small.\nIn the future, the construction of solar power plants will have little impact on the resettlement and replacement of households. Households will be compensated by project owners in accordance with regulations, said Giang.\nDeveloping the solar power plants would help reduce exploitation and use of fossil fuels, use of natural resources and coal from foreign countries.\n“Because solar power projects will be developed on wild land and inefficiently used land, the impacts on the ecological system and biodiversity are insignificant and could be prevented and mitigated if the solar power projects are developed in potential areas as defined in plan,” she said.\nBesides, solar power plants use solar energy for electricity generation, not creating dusts or toxic gases, especially GHG emission which causes climate change on the earth.\nHowever, no renewable energy project could totally avoid environmental impacts, even solar PV power technology.\n“Latent environmental impacts depend on the scale and type of projects and are usually related to specific locations (impacts on land, landscapes)”, Giang said.\n“Most adverse impacts are related to the plant construction stage and plant dismantlement stage. But these adverse impacts are small and can be reduced by mitigations measures”, she added.\nSo, it could say solar power can be considered a clean and safe energy source.\n“Financial closing for projects is difficult with present market conditions but once the market has developed and the prices drop the solar PV potential will increase dramatically,” said Sonia Lioret, Head of GIZ’s project.\nThe workshop was organised within framework of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (4E) Project, which is jointly implemented by Việt Nam’s Electricity and Renewable Energy Agency (EREA), the Ministry of Industry and Trade and Germany’s International Co-operation Agency (GIZ). — VNS'",4

He was particularly miffed at the decision to sell Matt Holland (Google him) and pick a teenage\xa0Lampard ahead of another midfielder, Scott Canham (Google him too).\nIn typical Redknapp fashion, no-nonsense Harry jumped to the defence of a rather embarrassed looking Lampard sat a few places to his right, who incidentally is also his nephew.\n“He (Lampard) is good enough and he definitely will be good enough,” Redknapp said.\n“He will go right to the very top. There aint (sic) no doubt about that in my opinion because he has got everything that’s needed to become a top class midfield player.\n“His attitude is first class, he’s got strength, he can play, he can pass it and he can score goals.”\nHarry wasn’t wrong.\nThe following season Lampard played 42 times for West Ham, scoring on ten occasions. A few years later, he moved to Chelsea and went on to make 429 appearances finding the net no fewer than 147 times in 13 seasons.\nHe has won the Premier League three times, the FA Cup four times, has two league cup medals and also won both the Champions and Europa Leagues.\nThis week, in one of the worst kept soccer secrets of the summer, Lampard was named manager of Chelsea.\nAs a player he was quite simply breathtaking. He was one of the greatest box-to-box midfielders of his generation. Hard-working, bags of energy, could read the game like a book and was an acute dead ball specialist.\nThe word legend is bandied about far too much in football but I’ve no hesitation using it to describe\xa0Lampard.\nAfter hanging up his boots, he had a half-decent spell as manager of Derby County, narrowly missing out on promotion to the Premier League, and now he has been made manager of one of the most difficult clubs there to manage.\nIf you don’t believe me, ask Maurizio Sarri, or Antonio Conte, or Gus Hiddink, or Rafa Benitez, or Jose Mourinho. In fact, you can ask Jose twice.\nLampard will be welcomed with open arms by the plastic flag–waving Chelsea faithful who will rightfully give him their full support.\nOnly time will tell if he will be a success but I do fear for Frank. He was an amazing player but as a manager, he has hardly proved himself at the top level.\nSome may rightly point to the likes of Pep Guardiola and Zinedine Zidane who were both superb players with Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively, legends even, and then went on to become amazing managers.\nFor Frank to succeed, he needs support, and not just from the supporters.\nHe needs Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to not only have faith, but to have patience too. The Russian billionaire does have a habit of expecting immediate success for his investment and right now, that won’t happen at Chelsea.\nWinning the Europa League last season wasn’t enough for Roman to keep the manager, and after Conte won the Premier League, he too was shown the door.\nChelsea needs work. It doesn’t need a complete rebuild but after losing Eden Hazard to Real Madrid last month, they do need to make some mechanical adjustments to both the line-up and style of play.\nLampard needs to take what is already there and fine tune it into the well-oiled machine they are capable of becoming.\nAnd if Frank is struggling with the mechanics, he can always call his former West Ham teammate Scott Canham, who was last seen working at a car repair company in Southend. — VNS'",3

Viet Nam Corporation.\nThe company instructed the farmers in the entire farming process, from building ponds and installing equipment to oxygenating the ponds, breeding density and feeding method.\nThe farmers bred white-legged shrimp on a total of 150ha of ponds and had a yield of 50 – 55 tonnes per hectare per crop. The model offered an income of VNĐ2 billion (US$86,200) per hectare per crop, 10 times the income from the industrial farming model.\nAccording to Phan Văn Hận, who now breeds white-legged shrimp on an area of 3,200sq.m under the model in Cầu Ngang District’s Mỹ Long Nam Commune, his farm has a density of 178 shrimp per square metre.\nThe model requires farmers to have a large breeding area and make a large initial investment in infrastructure of VNĐ3 billion ($130,000) per hectare.\nThe model requires ponds for breeding shrimp and treating wastewater, anti-sunlight nets to cover the ponds and plastic sheets to cover their beds and equipment for pumping oxygen and feeding the shrimp.\nTrịnh Thị Loan, an agricultural expert in Mỹ Long Nam, has bred white-legged shrimp on 1.5ha under the model for two years and earned a large income.\nThe model is sustainable since the ponds are covered with plastic sheets to prevent the spread of disease pathogens from soil, according to Loan.\nThe covering also helps farmers proactively control the quality of water used for raising the shrimp.\nThis year she expects to harvest around 100 tonnes of shrimp in two crops and earn VNĐ5 billion ($216,000).\nPhạm Minh Truyền, director of the province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the model had been expanded to nearly 400ha this year.\nIt would be a basis for the province to develop its shrimp industry and increase exports to high-demand markets like the US and EU, he said.\nThe province has identified shrimp, rice, vegetables, tra fish, and coconuts as its key agricultural produce.\nPotential\nBeing a coastal province, Trà Vinh has large potential for aquaculture with 95,000ha suitable for aquaculture, especially brackish-water and saltwater shrimp farming.\nThe province has 24,000ha of brackish water and saltwater ponds to farm shrimp, including 7,000ha under intensive and semi-intensive farming, and produces 35,000 tonnes annually.\nBut the average income from shrimp farming is only VNĐ100 – 150 million ($4,300 – 6,500) per hectare per year since most farms areas are small and do not use advanced techniques, according to the department.\nUnder a plan to restructure aquaculture in 2017 - 25, the province seeks to expand its shrimp farming area to 27,000ha and annual output to 87,000 tonnes next year.\nIt also plans to expand shrimp output by 5.3 per cent a year in 2021- 25.\nTo meet the targets, the province will expand its shrimp farming area and adopt advanced techniques to produce high-quality shrimp while also safeguarding the environment.\nĐồng Văn Lâm, chairman of the province People’s Committee, said both domestic consumption of and export demand for shrimp were high and steady, and so farmers would not need to worry about selling their produce.\nThe People’s Committee had instructed all relevant agencies to assist shrimp farmers in terms of infrastructure and farming processes, he said.\nThe Department of Agriculture and Rural Development should zone efficient shrimp farming areas and strictly monitor them to adequately support farmers, he said.\nThe province will prioritise implementation of 25 projects at a cost of VNĐ3 trillion ($130 million), including in infrastructure like irrigation, power and transport for breeding brackish and saltwater shrimp, according to the People’s Committee.\nIt will offer incentives to investors to produce and process shrimp. – VNS'",1

In addition, domestic steel brands have been counterfeited.\nNguyễn Văn Sưa, a steel industry expert, said that many lawsuits against the domestic steel industry in recent years stemmed from the fact that foreign products were transferred to Việt Nam for processing and were then labelled as originating from Việt Nam.\nThis example of trade fraud greatly affected Vietnamese goods when they were exported to other markets.\nAs they evade tax, many steel products imported into Việt Nam were cheap compared to domestic products. Therefore, co-ordination between related ministries and branches would be necessary, he said.\nSharing the view, Dr. Phạm Sỹ Thanh from the Việt Nam Institute for Economic and Policy Research, said that it would be a disaster if foreign goods ""borrowed"" Vietnamese origin, then were exported to other markets.\nThis would have a long-term negative impact on the whole industry, he said.\nHow to combat fraud?\nIn order to effectively handle violations in the origin of goods, Minister of Industry and Trade Trần Tuấn Anh directed the Trade Remedies Authority of Việt Nam to establish a standing team to increase state management on trade remedies and origin fraud and finalise action plans, co-ordinating with concerned ministries and branches in implementing them.\nThe Minister also asked C/O (certificate of origin) issuers and customs authorities to tighten the issuance of C/O, as well as strengthen inspections on enterprises with sudden export volume increases.\nThis was a necessary move to improve the control of goods origin and combat fraud, the minister said.\nNguyễn Văn Sưa said that authorities needed to have policies to protect the domestic market and restrict the import of domestically produced products. In particular, they need to promote the use of trade defence tools and prevent shoddy goods.\nHowever, the core issue lay with the enterprises, which are under pressure from trade remedies, so the initiative in domestic raw material supply plays an important role, according to Sưa.\nNghiêm Xuân Đa, Chairman of the Vietnam Steel Association, said that enterprises must work together and provide information to the association to avoid surging export growth to new markets such as Canada and Mexico when the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) comes into effect. This would reduce losses when countries initiate investigations and apply trade remedies on Việt Nam\'s exported steel products.\nIn addition, the authorities needed to strengthen protection of domestic production with technical and trade barriers, he advised.\nHe advised preventing the transfer of foreign investment into the country with inappropriate technologies which consumed a lot of energy and caused environmental pollution. — VNS'",2

Everything that he had done, the documents he had\xa0signed as the leader of the ministry will be called into question,” she said, suggesting that documents he signed would not be automatically rendered null and void, unless the court deemed otherwise.\nNga said the title deprivation must be clarified to stress that the measure is meant to take away the benefits that come with the title, while other rights such as social insurance or health insurance would remain intact.\nThe judicial chair also agreed with the draft’s proposed statute of limitation of 60 months but noted that in cases of “especially serious violations”, there would not be a limit to issue disciplinary measures.\n“When the official is 70-80 years old already, is it appropriate or practical summoning him up to carry out disciplinary action for something he did\xa0wrong 20 years ago?,” NA Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân asked.\nShe also voiced her support for keeping demotion as an important and highly potent disciplinary action.\nIn the session, the lawmakers also discussed measures to attract and retain talent in the public sector, including better benefit schemes and sector-specific support policies, as well as the merits of one draft law’s provisions that seek\xa0to eliminate undefined length contracts with public employees, in order to push them to improve their capacity and better fulfil their duties. — VNS'",0

Việt Nam News talks to ambassadors and international experts about what Việt Nam can do to put an end to the crime.\nCan you tell us about US-Việt Nam efforts to combat\xa0wildlife trafficking?\nDaniel Kritenbrink, US Ambassador to Việt Nam: USAID is carrying out a programme called Saving Species designed to build Việt Nam’s capacity to combat wildlife trafficking, working with law enforcement to improve the legal and regulatory environment and also to help build the capacity of Việt Nam’s civil society sector working on the issue.\nWe have recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Public Security and other departments.\nAs part of the MoU, we are going to work together to promote law enforcement co-operation. Early next year, the US Fish and Wildlife Service is going to appoint an attaché at the embassy, specifically to work on the wildlife trafficking issue with our Vietnamese partners.\nThese two primary programmes are designed to advance three main objectives.\nWe want to help strengthen enforcement of Việt Nam's laws and regulations to combat wildlife trafficking, reduce demands for illegally traded wildlife and increase international co-operation.\nMany organisations carrying out wildlife trafficking are involved\xa0in transnational crimes.\xa0This is a key point that I should emphasise.\nWe do think that working on the issue has an impact beyond just conservation, certainly it has security and economic impacts as well. As you know, there is a direct link between wildlife trafficking and corruption.\nThe thing we are encouraged by Việt Nam is that the country’s new penal code has very impressive and strict provisions to punish wildlife trafficking. Many recent busts and seizures have been\xa0quite impressive.\nI think the situation is both urgent and dire. Việt Nam has perhaps the number one\xa0market in the world now for illegal ivory, rhino horn and pangolin scales. Demand is\xa0much too high in our view. As well as\xa0periodic seizures that we have seen, we also hope to work with our Vietnamese friends to carry out investigations and prosecute\xa0major crime\xa0networks and their kingpins.\nMany rhino horns and wildlife products seized in Việt Nam have come from\xa0South Africa. As a source country, what has South Africa done to fight the crime?\nMpetjane Kgaogelo Lekgoro, South Africa Ambassador to Việt Nam: South Africa is home to most of the precious species as well as the largest population of rhinos.\nThe rhino is important to South Africa both in terms of\xa0economic activities in savannas and our ecosystem.\nTherefore, we pledge to join hands with different countries to save rhinos.\nThe geographic space where these animals reside\xa0is across borders of other South African countries including Mozambique and Zimbabwe.\nIn terms of local level attempts, we have raised awareness campaigns for people living around the national parks to support the movement.\nAt cabinet level, we have a charter in place that involves different state departments.\nIt is a very challenging\xa0task to combat wildlife trafficking. We do it together with Interpol, we have agreements with different transit and destination countries to build awareness campaigns with them. In Việt Nam, we have campaigns in education.\nAs people think that wildlife products are medicines or status symbols, we believe educating children to know the facts about that will help in the long run in fighting wildlife trafficking.\nMoreover, we have a DNA testing technique. When one product of a country is discovered in other parts of the world, we can trace the origin of that species to see whether it is from South Africa. It helps us to locate the scene\xa0of the crime.\nFor instance, when Việt Nam detected a case this year, our testing force came to conduct a test\xa0to establish\xa0the exact origin of the animals in South Africa.\nWhat do you think about Việt Nam’s efforts to\xa0combat\xa0wildlife trafficking? What are your recommendations for Việt Nam’s Government and civil society to enhance wildlife protection and conservation?\nSteph Lysaght, Deputy Head of Mission\xa0at British Embassy Hà Nội: There is a UN report this year which says not only iconic species are in danger but millions of species in the world are in danger. This is a threat that mankind has never known before, called the sixth mass extinction.\nIt is not just animals in minor that we need to care about, it is a whole range of animals under threat. We need to change our mindset about the preservation of biodiversity.\nThis is not just the illegal trade as a problem. There are other interactive issues that we have to deal with\xa0such as climate change, and approaches to animal habitats and\xa0land use.\nTransnational criminals take wildlife from Africa through Việt Nam to other countries. But please don’t fall into the trap of thinking that Việt Nam is only a\xa0transit\xa0country.\nViệt Nam is also a destination country and we need to raise awareness about that. Việt Nam has already lost many iconic species.\nWe should focus on the role that Việt Nam can play positively in reducing the crime and help people to understand how they can protect biodiversity, and we need law enforcement to stop criminal groups.\nSome of the changes that I have seen in Việt Nam are that we have passionate and skilled\xa0people across the Government who are trying to do the right things, and I am really inspired by NGOs in Việt Nam.\nPeople are now better informed about what the problems are. However, we need to understand that we have not yet won this battle.\nWe are seeing more animals successfully smuggled through Việt Nam. What we have done is not enough and we need to commit to each other that we can do more to win this struggle.\nThe UK prime minister announced in New York a new fund which he called biodiversity funding, and that is going to be around US$1.3 billion. The aim of that is to significantly increase what the UK is doing around the world to strengthen law enforcement to protect endangered species and reduce the loss of their habitats.\nIt is still a debate to come up with a timetable for it but Việt Nam is very much in the minds of people in the UK and\xa0we value your efforts to\xa0solve a\xa0global problem.\nWhat do you think is the biggest challenge Việt Nam has faced in pushing back wildlife trafficking?\nDavid Lawson, Chief of Party of the USAID Savings Species Project – Việt Nam: I think the biggest challenge is awareness.\nWhen a wild animal or plant is taken away from its natural habitat illegally, it is no longer a wildlife issue, it is a criminal\xa0issue. And we need different sets of skills to address the crime.\nAwareness about the scale of the problem is probably the most important issue that we have to face today.\nPeople need to appreciate the scale of problem that affects us as humans.\nIf we do not\xa0protect the environment, we will eventually suffer for doing nothing. — VNS",4

Photo courtesy of sggp.org.vn\nViet Nam News\nHCM CITY – The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is seeking approval from the Government to build a Vũng Tàu – Gò Công sea dyke in an effort to combat waterlogging in HCM City.\nIn recent years, the city has spent a great deal of money to prevent waterlogging, which occurs when the soil is saturated with water.\nHowever, rapid urban development, together with poor management and inefficient urban planning, has reduced the city’s water storage space and limited water transport capacity of the city’s canal system.\nThe impact of climate change and rising sea levels have also increased flooding and salt intrusion in the Đồng Tháp Mười area and HCM City, according to experts.\nHeavy rains along the Đồng Nai – Sài Gòn River, together with high tides, have placed pressure on the city’s drainage system, worsening waterlogging.\nThe city is a flood-prone spot as it is located downstream of the Đồng Nai River system, and has low-lying terrain, according to Dr Trần Bá Hoằng at the Southern Institute of Water Resources Research.\nThe proposed Vũng Tàu – Gò Công sea dyke would be extended from Tiền Giang Province’s Gò Công Commune to a point 5km from Bà Rịa - Vũng Tàu Province’s Vũng Tàu City, where it would connect with another dyke 13km long extending to Cần Giờ Biosphere Reserve in HCM City.\nThe main dyke would be 28km long and 25m wide, with an average water depth of 6.5m. The dyke scale would be 600m to 2000m wide.\nIn addition to the main dyke, the project includes construction of multiple drainage ditches, a Lòng Tàu sluice, and dams along Đồng Tranh and Soài Rạp rivers.\nThe project is based on a regional irrigation master plan, the technological capacity of Việt Nam, and similar project experiences from the Netherlands, South Korea and Japan.\nTotal investment of the Vũng Tàu – Gò Công sea dyke project would be about VNĐ74 trillion (US$3.6 billion).\nTo be implemented in three phases, it would also contribute to socio-economic development in the region, experts said.\nHCM City’s Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh Street is usually flooded after rain. Rapid urban development, together with poor management and inefficient urban planning, has reduced the city’s water storage space and limited the water transport capacity of the city’s canal system. — VNA/VNS Photo Xuân Dự\nMultiple benefits\nIn addition to preventing floods and saline intrusion in HCM City, the project would bring other benefits.\nProfessor Nguyễn Quang Kim, president of Water Resources University, said that even if the sea level increases by 75cm by 2100, the Vũng Tàu – Gò Công sea dyke would still prevent floods across the downstream of the Đồng Nai –Sài Gòn River and canal system.\nThe project would help conserve the Cần Giờ mangrove forest ecosystem, since it would leave an open space at the Gành Rái Gulf, allowing a natural exchange of fresh and salt water in Cần Giờ.\nCompared to other projects, this proposal would be less harmful to the environment.\nMeanwhile, Dr Nguyễn Bá Ân from the Development Strategy Institute under the Ministry of Planning and Investment said HCM City and neighboring areas would see less damage if the sea dyke was completed.\nAs it does not require land clearance, the dyke is expected to be completed within two to three years and the ditches within three to four years.\nIn general, construction progress would not affect the Cần Giờ forest and traffic to Cái Mép – Thị Vải deep-water port, while in the next 70 years, it would not affect water traffic to HCM City.\nFor locals who now grow clams at the river gate and outside Cần Giờ forest, authorities will help them find jobs in travel or service industries.\nThe Vũng Tàu – Gò Công sea dyke project is also expected to lead to the formation of new urban areas along the river and sea coasts. – VNS'",4

4215,'Arsenal really are desperate for a donkey',"WINNER: Arsenal are desperate for a leader in the mould of Tony Adams. AFP/VNA Photo\nIf you were to Google the phrase “no-nonsense footballer” the picture that should appear on your screen would be that of Tony Adams, the former Arsenal captain who made 504 appearances for the north London club between 1983 and 2002.\nHe wasn’t particularly classy, and silky was not a word you could use when talking about the central defender’s playing style. But one thing is for sure, he got the job done.\nI remember watching Tony play circa late 80s, early 90s, and every touch of the ball he made was accompanied by thousands of Liverpool fans chanting ‘eeyore,’ the noise made by a donkey.\nThat was his nickname, donkey.\nHe didn’t mess about, took no prisoners and week after week threw his body on the line for the good of Arsenal.\nYes, the football he played may have been akin to that of a donkey, but boy he really was the best donkey around.\nHis England record is not to be sniffed at either, representing his country 66 times over 13 years.\nHe won what was then the First Division title twice, won the Premiership twice and picked up three FA Cup winning medals.\nAdams was a leader. A captain in the true sense of the word. He would, and often did, sweat blood and tears for the shirt he wore.\nYou won’t find an Arsenal fan on the planet who doesn’t love Tony Adams and I’ve no doubt there are many teenagers called Anthony, or even Adam, named in honour of the centre half.\nArsenal today have a different sort of captain. Granit Xhaka is chalk compared to Adam’s cheese. They are polar opposites and on Sunday after a disappointing 2-2 home draw with Crystal Palace, Xhaka was substituted to a chorus of boos after yet another poor performance.\nWhat he did as he left the field has been well documented, and doesn’t need me to repeat words he directed at the home supporters.\nIt’s safe to say it wasn’t very pleasant.\nTony's unique form of training with Granada in Spain.\nThere is a school of thought that says supporters shouldn’t boo their own players and when the chips are down, must get behind their team.\nYet the reaction of Xhaka was nothing short of abhorrent. He is the captain of Arsenal and his behaviour was diabolical.\nCan you see Tony Adams doing that? No, not at all.\nAnd that for me is the root of Arsenal’s problem. Not only do they lack leadership, but really, since Adams hung up his boots many years ago, they still haven’t found a captain in the same mould.\nWilliam Gallas held the armband, he gave up. Cesc Fabregas took it, he went on strike. Robin Van Persie had a go, he then went public saying he wanted to leave, before leaving for Manchester United, then Loren Koscielny took it, before also going on strike.\nSo the million-dollar question being asked at the Emirates Stadium right now is \xad- what next for Xhaka?\nRumour has it he never even bothered sticking around until the end of the game and left before the full time whistle, not at all the actions of a leader. Not at all the actions of Tony Adams.\nTaking a look at the Arsenal squad right about now\xa0I’m struggling to see a leader among them. In fact, the only one I believe can do the job is\xa0Kieran Tierney, which is ridiculous considering he has only played four times for the Gooners.\nBut that’s how bad things are.\nTierney played more than 100 times for Celtic before his big money move south and there’s no doubt the Hoops faithful don’t suffer fools.\nI say give him the armband. He has already captained Scotland at international level and worn the armband for Celtic.\nHe is not Tony Adams, simply because there will never be another Tony Adams.\nBut right now, he is the best candidate for the job. As for Xhaka, if he never wears the Arsenal shirt again, it will be too soon. VNS",3

In addition, the rice exports to other countries also saw strong reductions, such as Indonesia (down 96 per cent), Bangladesh (down 75 per cent) and Algeria (down 55 per cent).\nHowever, the Philippines market has emerged as a bright spot in Việt Nam\'s rice export activities to help the national total rice exports rise in the first eight months.\nIn the January-August period, Việt Nam exported nearly 1.5 million tonnes of rice to the Philippines, an increase of more than 200 per cent year on year, accounting for 37 per cent of Việt Nam\'s rice exports.\nThis year, the export value of fragrant rice, specialty rice, and organic rice has increased in number, increasing the value of export rice.\nHowever, the application of advanced technology in rice production, processing and preservation is still very limited for the domestic rice production chain. This has created a significant impact on the quality and price of Vietnamese export rice compared to similar products of major rice exporting countries such as Thailand and India, according to MARD.\n""In recent years, many businesses have invested in high-quality products from design and appearance to good quality of rice as well as maintain high quality of rice during storage and trading. However, the number of producers doing that is not many compared to the large rice export volume,"" Sơn said.\nTherefore, the application of advanced technology in preservation and processing is very important in Viet Nam\'s rice value chain to increase to meet the strict requirements of major rice export markets, he said.\nĐỗ Hà Nam, Vice Chairman of Việt Nam Food Association, Chairman of Board of Directors and General Director of Intimex Group said to have sustainable development in Việt Nam\'s rice production industry, it was necessary to choose high-value products like Jasmine rice. On the other hand, local rice producers needed to renew technical production and equipment to not lose the market. They also must manage food safety and hygiene, chemical products and post-harvest preservation to overcome the increasing technical barriers of developed countries.\nAt the seminar, many businesses introduced global advanced technologies in rice production and processing as well as practical experience in applying technology to rice production and processing stages. - VNS'",2

One of the best opportunities to further our mission towards reform lies at Hospital Management Asia, with several stellar case studies from across the region,"" said Vietnamese health minister Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến.\n""Healthcare is accelerating exponentially in Asia and I am excited to be part of the movement to bring hospitals, investors and solution providers together to help our hospitals provide better service and the best patient outcomes possible,"" said Tiến.\nMinister Tiến said that in recent years, the health ministry has implemented a health reform programme with a goal towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), in which health service quality has played an important role in ensuring safety for patients and people. To protect the health of 96 million people, Việt Nam always follows the ""patient-centred"" motto –\xa0providing safe, quality services and satisfying patients.\n”To improve the quality of medical services, we have developed hospital quality, surgical and test quality criteria. We also launched the Satellite Hospital Programme to transfer medical technologies to lower-level hospitals to improve their professional quality, reduce over-capacity and overcrowding at higher levels,” stressed Tiến.\nShe added that the health sector also implemented various measures to improve patient satisfaction such as establishing hotlines, increasing health insurance coverage, training health worker and applying IT in hospital and patient management.\nDuring the two-day event, participants will focus discussions on topics such as the latest technologies for healthcare, cost reduction and patient safety to increase efficiency and improve patient outcomes. The conference will also discuss Healthcare 4.0, investments in hospitals and healthcare across Asia, and winning the war for healthcare talent, among others.\nThis year, the conference will feature five main streams, including a new one for C-level leaders, which will discuss financial sustainability through investments, the impact of public policy for hospital services and how to address the challenges in the implementation of value-based care. Other streams include Safety, Quality & Accreditation; Patient Care & Engagement; Talent Management; and Healthcare 4.0.\nRunning alongside the conference is the Asian Hospital Management Awards that recognise and honour hospitals in Asia Pacific that implement best practices. All projects submitted by Vietnamese hospitals will also be eligible for the \'Most Improved Local Hospital\' category – a special award for entries by Vietnamese hospitals.\nAccording to the health ministry, after 5 years implementation, the programme has built and formed 23 nuclear hospitals and 138 satellite hospitals nationwide. Ten specialties were invested and prioritised for development, including oncology, surgical trauma, cardiology, obstetrics, paediatrics, endocrinology, neurology, clinical haematology, emergency resuscitation and poison control.\nInitial results showed that it has gradually reduced the overload of higher-level hospitals, especially in HCM City and Hà Nội, contributing to improving the service delivery capacity of lower-level hospitals, strengthening people\'s confidence in the grassroots health system, reducing referral rates, and allowing people to receive technical services and safe quality right at their localities.\nAt the event, a Memorandum of Understanding on healthcare and treatment collaboration was signed between three Vietnamese private hospitals, including Hùng Vương General Hospital, Quang Khởi General Hospital and Central Otolaryngology Hospital, and three Malaysian private hospitals, including Mahkota Medical Center, Subang Jaya Medical Center and Sunway Medical Center.\nThis collaboration will allow patients after receiving initial consultation and diagnosis by doctors at the three Vietnamese hospitals to seek second professional advice from three Malaysian health units, if required. Three Vietnamese hospitals will continue to monitor and treat these patients after returning from Malaysia.\n“The co-operation of Malaysian health with three Vietnamese hospitals is an important milestone, emphasising the trust of our partners and foreign stakeholders in the quality healthcare service\xa0of Malaysia,” said Sherene Azli, CEO of Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC).\nIn 2018, Malaysia Healthcare served more than 1.2\xa0million visitors coming to the country for healthcare purposes, an increase of more than 14 per cent compared to 2017. — VNS'",1
971,'Việt Nam – US relation develops quickly in the past 25 years',"'Lê Đình Tĩnh\nViet Nam News\nLê Đình Tĩnh, deputy director of the Institute for Foreign Policy and Strategic Studies, talks to Thu Vân about Việt Nam’s current relations with the US and the experiences it can share with the DPRK.\nWhat were the milestone events during the normalisation process between Việt Nam and the US? What were the most challenging issues?\nThe normalisation process was long and complicated even though joint efforts were made not long after the war.\nViệt Nam first asked for reparations for war damages – a demand the United Stated refused to meet - but later agreed on normalization of ties with lesser conditions and flexible terms. That decision was probably made in 1978. In the 1980s, due to broad geostrategic calculations, the United States no longer gave the same priority to normalisation as it did in the latter half of the 1970s though its top concerns with Việt Nam remained a “full accounting” for the POW/MIAs and the Cambodian issue. An anti-Việt Nam sentiment, which was still strong in the United States, was also an obstacle. The thinking “shelving the past, looking to the future” gained more ground in the two countries in the early 1990s which paved the way for the lifting of the embargo in 1994 and establishment of diplomatic relations in 1995.\nHow has the relationship developed since then, and how has it helped Việt Nam’s development?\nThe bilateral relationship has developed quickly since the normalisation of ties.\nTrade increased more than 100 times in 2018 compared to 1995. In 2013, the two countries agreed on a comprehensive partnership with nine key areas of co-operation, including politics, economics, defense and security, science and technology, education, war legacies and humanitarian co-operation. In 2015, General Secretary of the Party Nguyễn Phú Trọng made a historic visit to the United States while every United States President since 1995 has visited Việt Nam.\nViệt Nam now has the highest number of students in the United States in ASEAN. All of these successes would have been impossible without the normalisation of ties.\nDPRK Chairman Kim Jong Un is in Hà Nội for a second summit with the US and also for a state visit to Việt Nam. How can Việt Nam share its experience in the normalisation process with the US with the DPRK?\nThe Vietnamese experiences both in economic development and normalisation with the United States have been studied by several countries. Chairman Kim Jong Un of the DPRK has expressed interest in the Vietnamese success story. Deputy Prime Minister cum Foreign Minister Phạm Bình Minh says that Việt Nam is willing to share those experiences if it is asked to by the DRPK. From a research perspective, the fact that both the United States and the DPRK chose Việt Nam as the venue for the second summit continues to show Việt Nam’s relevancy in this regard.\nWhat does it mean for Việt Nam to host such an important event?\nViệt Nam has deep experience in war and peace, and is a peace-loving country. This summit is testimony to Việt Nam’s proactive foreign policy, which promotes the country as a responsible member of the international community. Perhaps no other country would demonstrate the same level of enthusiasm to host the summit as Việt Nam. A message of peace and dialogue is consistently conveyed by Vietnamese leaders and diplomats and the summit will help to carry that message further.\nThe country’s image and profile will be raised when it comes to tourism, trade, investment and peace and security. Viet Nam will gain more confidence from the international community by resolving issues beyond its borders. Last year, Việt Nam sent a field hospital to Sudan as part of its commitment to maintaining peace with the United States.\nViệt Nam will also send another message to international friends supporting the peaceful settlement of regional and international conflicts via dialogue and negotiations.\nCan you share your expectations about the summit?\nThis summit will touch on more substantive topics compared to the first one in Singapore. The more details it has the more complicated it should be. So the two sides have to manage their expectations. Negotiations of this nature can take a long time. The Iran nuclear deal took more than 10 years. Even trade negotiations can some times span more than a decade. But taken together, the summit itself is already a success by helping sustain dialogue between the two countries. For peace-lovers in both countries and around the world, everyone should hope for the best and wish the summit a great success.—VNS'",0

Of these, 780 have met standards as of the end of July.\nThe department has organised training for officials in charge of food safety management and fruit stores in these districts. It has also worked with food preservation equipment providers - Sanaky\xa0and Alaska – that agreed to sell their products to fruit shop owners in the city for 10-15 per cent lower than market price.\nNguyễn Mạnh Hà, vice chairman of Long Biên District People’s Committee, said positive changes have been\xa0made over the past year in his district.\n“Ninety per cent of fruit stores have shelves and all businesses selling ready-cooked food have cabinets to store food,” he said, adding that all stores have signed a food safety commitment.\nTrần Thị Hiền, a fruit seller in Long Biên District’s Ngọc Lâm Market, said since the market’s management board promoted a programme on ""civilised trade"", she has realised her duty is to follow the regulations.\n“I’ve committed myself to fight trade fraud. The price of each kind of fruit\xa0must be publicised.\n""I promise to treat customers friendly and with the most hospitality,” she told Việt Nam News.\nWhile efforts to improve the food service have had success, experts said\xa0challenges remain.\nThe quantity of fruits supplied from Hà Nội is only 30 per cent while 70 per cent is imported from other provinces and cities. Thus, it was difficult for many wholesalers to provide bills of sale to prove where the food comes from.\nMany\xa0consumers don’t pay attention to product origin and buy fruit\xa0in places convenient\xa0for them, allowing the existence of fruit street vendors.\nSome market\xa0management boards failed to fulfil their duties so substandard food still existed in some places.\nSolutions\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the initiative, Lan said\xa0the DoIT would work with relevant units to deal with street vendors.\nThe department has been drafting a project to supply safe fruits to local consumers, she said.\nLê Hồng Thăng, director of Hà Nội Department of Industry and Trade, said the project would soon be expanded to all fruit shops in the capital city including those at wholesale markets.

Therefore, besides creating livelihoods, capacity building projects for ethnic women also needed to focus on community power and community-based initiatives.\nSùng Thị Lan, chairwoman of the Mường Hoa Co-operative in Sapa Town, Lào Cai Province, said at first she and other fellow members were reluctant to launch a business, facing barriers set by their families and society.\nIn 2017, the Centre for Social Initiatives Promotion (CSIP) helped them to overcome their initial difficulties, identify their strengths and develop business plans.\nThe co-operative now produces fashion items using Black Mông ethnic brocade, and offers homestay services.\nThe businesses have helped to ensure livelihoods and reduce poverty.\nAccording to the latest data, ethnic minority groups account for 14.6 per cent of Việt Nam’s population and 63 per cent of the country’s poor households. 21 per cent of ethnic people aged from 15 years old are illiterate while only 6 per cent of them have ever received training. — VNS",1

After light rain, the road was quite muddy.\nClutching the throttle, she skillfully guided her motorbike through the quagmire.\nIt is quite rare for\xa0a 27-year-old H’mông ethnic minority woman like Xinh to operate a vehicle on her own as tradition dictates that they rely on their husbands\xa0after marriage.\nFreedom of mobility was the first thing Xinh enjoyed after purchasing a motorbike, using money from the local village savings and loan association (VSLA).\nIt takes\xa0Xinh half an hour to ride from her tiny house on the legendary Pha Đin Pass down to a nearby valley, where 18 other members of the VSLA group gather for a\xa0fortnightly meeting.\nThe group, which was established in September\xa02018 under the umbrella “Reach to Excel” project implemented by NGO Care International in Việt Nam, Điện Biên Province Women’s Union and the Điện Biên Centre for Community Development, offers a savings incentive for\xa0members to\xa0pool their money by buying shares and then loaning to each other.\nIn single a session, one member can purchase up to five shares for\xa0VNĐ20,000 (US$0.86) each. The limitation has been\xa0set to avoid speculation, while maintaining the group’s sustainability.\n“Please give me five,” said Xinh confidently, as her family had just harvested their rice crop.\nReceiving the VNĐ100,000 ($4.31), Giàng Thị Mai, one of the group's treasurer, used a small stamp carved from an eraser to ink Xinh’s savings book.\nMai is one of three treasurers who\xa0each hold\xa0a separate\xa0key to the group’s safe – a simple way to ensure transparency.\nAt the beginning of a meeting, they open the safe and count the money together.\nBesides buying shares, each member contributes VNĐ2,000 ($0.086) to a mutual assistance fund which is\xa0used to support sick\xa0members who need\xa0hospital treatment.\n“We are\xa0all healthy so far, so we may spend the fund on\xa0a\xa0year-end party,” said Mai, cheerfully.\nGiàng Thị Mai stamps a member’s savings book, marking\xa0the number of share the book's owner\xa0has bought. —\xa0VNS Photo Khoa Thư\nSaving tool\nIn the mountainous commune of Tỏa\xa0Tình, 98 per cent of the population belong to the\xa0H’mông ethnic minority group,\xa0who live scattered\xa0among the\xa0rocky mountains relying on\xa0agriculture for their\xa0livelihoods.\nThe harsh conditions have pushed them below\xa0the poverty line, with average income per capita per year of\xa0just VNĐ8 million ($345).\nCompared\xa0to other ethnic minority groups living at lower altitudes, H’mông people have less\xa0demand for money.\nHowever, the\xa0impacts of climate change has hit\xa0productivity of traditional upland rice and maize plantations, forcing them to excessively cut spending and save even more.\nThe VSLA was formed to address their needs, while at the same time, creating\xa0a space for local women to share their common concerns over children, health and other family affairs.\n“Since we live far from each other, it is fun when we get the chance\xa0to gather and talk,” said\xa0Giàng Thị Mai.\n“We can also borrow money to pay for our children’s school fees, farming utensils and healthcare,” she added.\nSince the group’s establishment, eight members have been given loans of VNĐ500,000-10 million ($21.55-431).\nDespite the small amounts, the fund\xa0has\xa0empowered them to overcome difficult situations.\nSùng Thị Ly borrowed VNĐ2.5 million ($108) to pay for her children’s stationery.\n“The middle school\xa0tuition fees are\xa0just VNĐ9,000 ($0.39) per month, but we simply cannot afford notebooks, pens and other essentials,” she said.\nLy paid it off after several months.\n“The procedure is simple and transparent.

Yes!

It is a flexible mechanism in which women can practise their rights,” he said.\n“Empowering individual female members is the ultimate goal of VSLA. Once they know and perform their own rights, they will be able to access\xa0business opportunities, secure their livelihoods and build happy families,” he added.\nSocial concerns\nEvery night, some 120 coaches depart from Tuần Giáo District to transport local people down south on the hunt for work.\nAfter the upland rice harvest season, there is nothing much to do in the\xa0northern highlands.

They can choose to follow their husbands to big cities as they look for work rather than\xa0staying at home waiting,” My added.\nSharing the opinion, Hiếu said it was difficult to hold back a person when they want a\xa0better income.\n“Migration is good for the economy but\xa0I wonder whether anyone has raised the\xa0question about its impacts on social affairs and cultural identity,” he said.\n“I have not seen any reports about\xa0divorce rates among couples who had\xa0to separate due to difficult economic conditions. Migration has to be viewed as\xa0a bigger picture rather than focusing solely on income,” Hiếu added.\nCare International has put an\xa0expansion plan for the\xa0VSLA on the table to discuss with the Việt Nam Women’s Union.\nIf approved, the model will be implemented in other provinces from January 2020 along with training courses for trainers and developing documentation procedures.\n“Localities will then be able to allocate resources to duplicate the model, which acts as an efficient micro-finance solution, helping people improve their lives\xa0in their hometowns,” Hiếu said. —\xa0VNS",1

Especially for large businesses, when there is no free flow of data,"" he said.\nCastro, meanwhile, offered\xa0a few ways to help governments to manage\xa0the risks of digitalisation without hindering innovation.\nFirstly, he said it was necessary to stipulate that organisations must be responsible for managing the data they collect, wherever they store, process, or analyse data.\nSecondly, although every country has different privacy laws, there is a need to have a mechanism to ensure the ability to access cross-border data in order to respond to security threats or hackers.\nThis would ensure that when a security incident occurred, law enforcement agencies could\xa0access each other\'s data, and jointly investigate or respond to an\xa0incident properly.\nThirdly, countries needed to be responsible for blocking the flow of illegal information such as movies, music that infringes copyright, child pornography and\xa0hate speech.\nFinally, governments must have a role in encrypting data and dealing with vulnerabilities in the system.\nCastro writes and speaks on a variety of issues related to information technology and internet policy, including privacy, security, intellectual property, Internet governance, e-government, and accessibility for people with disabilities. In 2013, Castro was named on\xa0FedScoop’s list\xa0of the “top 25 most influential people under 40 in government and tech.”\xa0In 2015, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker appointed Castro to the Commerce Data Advisory Council.—VNS'",2

About 7,450 of them have been stuck there for more than\xa090 days, meaning\xa0State agencies are permitted to take any measure to deal with them at their discretion, including auctioning the quality scraps and disposing of subpar quality scraps that pose an environmental threat.\nUnder the maritime administration’s instructions, imported scrap containers can be unloaded only if their owners have certificates that prove they are qualified to import scraps, including environmental permits and the allocation of import quota.\nAfter China banned imports of 24 types of scraps last year – since then, the ban\xa0has expanded to cover 32 types of solid waste – the amount diverted to Việt Nam and other ASEAN countries has significantly increased, raising fear of becoming the world's dumping ground.\nLocal firms have been\xa0importing\xa0scraps from many different countries as materials for production or recycling, but many\xa0are forging import permits to illegally bring waste into the country.\nLast year, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc called for urgent measures to improve the management of imports of waste as production material.\nThe PM directed the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment not to issue new scrap import certifications or extend the validation of existing certificates.\nThe ministry only considers granting a permit when the direct importer can prove demand for and ability to use the scraps in goods production.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Finance was tasked with directing customs agencies to hasten clearance for scrap containers of firms or individuals with valid certifications.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade is in charge of strengthening the inspection and monitoring of the trade and usage of scrap imports. — VNS",1

Liverpool were without Mohamed Salah through injury and the Egyptian's pace and trickery was badly missed.\nThe visitors were able to welcome back goalkeeper Alisson Becker for the first time in two months after a calf injury, but the Brazilian was rarely tested as United were happy to sit back and counter-attack.\nSolskjaer changed his formation to a 3-5-2 in an attempt to limit Liverpool's flying full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson and it was largely effective as the hosts restricted the league leaders to precious few chances.\nLiverpool's best opening before the break came when Sadio Mane finally found some space to counter-attack, but from his cut-back Roberto Firmino fired too close to David de Gea.\nUnited had not scored in their two previous matches prior to the international break, but finally produced a moment of quality going forward to take the lead, even if fortune was also on their side for the goal to stand.\nVictor Lindelof looked to have upended Divock Origi on halfway, but no foul was given by Martin Atkinson and as United broke forward, Daniel James's cross perfectly picked out Rashford to prod past Alisson.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was furious on the touchline even before a VAR review failed to overturn the decision.\nThe visitors' frustration only grew moments later when Mane outmuscled Lindelof to turn in what he thought was an equaliser, only for VAR to this time rule the goal out for a handball by the Senegalese.\nKlopp sprinted down the touchline at the half-time whistle, but was unable to change the pattern of the game after the interval as Liverpool continued to dominate possession without creating many chances.\nIndeed United could have doubled their advantage when Rashford and Fred fired shots just wide of Alisson's goal on the counter-attack.\nLallana had played just 10 minutes in the Premier League this season prior to coming off the bench 20 minutes from time.\nBut he was in the right place at the right time to make a telling contribution in the title race as he tapped home at the back post from Andy Robertson's cross.\nUnited were than camped inside their own box for five minutes of stoppage time.\nAlex Oxlaide-Chamberlain was inches away from a winner as his driven shot flew just wide and United had another VAR review go their way deep into added time when Fred was adjudged to have played the ball with his shoulder rather than an arm inside the area. \xa0AFP",3

5328,'Regional cooperation needed to protect precious marine environment',"'Rubbish, mostly plastic, strewn across a beach on Hòn Sơn island in the southern province of Kiên Giang. — VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Vũ Thành Đạt\nKHÁNH HÒA — Regional co-operation will be essential in preserving the marine environment and ensuring sustainable fisheries management and food security in the ASEAN region, speakers said yesterday\xa0at an international workshop held in the central province of Khánh Hòa.\nVũ Hồ, director-general of the ASEAN Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said\xa0that marine debris, including micro-plastics, was a global threat to marine organisms, ecosystems, human health and socio-economic development.\n“Five of the top 10 global polluting countries are ASEAN members,” he said. “Marine debris crisis requires urgent collective action and co-operation for achieving an effective and sustainable solution.”\nCurrent studies suggest that 8\xa0million tonnes of plastic end up in our oceans every year, the equivalent of one garbage truck full of plastic dumped into the ocean each minute, Hồ said.\n“Việt Nam recognises the critical importance of our ocean and the resources for the future of our people. We have established 15 marine economic zones to develop fishery logistics, seaports, sea-based tourism and maritime scientific research,”\xa0he said.\nA State management system on seas and islands has been created from the central to local level, while policies, laws and legal documents in the field have been devised.\nHồ and more than 90 representatives from the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) are taking part in a three-day workshop discussing marine debris, sustainable fisheries and food security in Southeast Asia.\nRecently, the 12th Party Central Committee issued a resolution on a marine economic development strategy by 2030, with the aim of intensifying the sustainable development of the marine economy.\nThe Vietnamese Government has also developed a National Action Plan on Management of Ocean Plastic Waste.\nThe ASEAN region, with a vision by 2025, is committed to preventing and significantly reducing marine pollution, including marine debris, according to Hồ.\n“I hope the workshop will serve as a platform for ARF participating members to share experiences, best practices, and strengthen collaboration on tackling marine debris issue together,” he said.\nCaryn McClelland, deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in Hà Nội, noted\xa0that oceans were the world’s largest shared resource.\n“A healthy, productive and resilient ocean contributes to economic growth, creates prosperity, and ensures food security for people around the globe.”\nExperts estimate that 80 per cent of marine debris is mismanaged waste that enters the ocean from land-based sources. A good portion of the rest is waste pollution from ships and abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear, she said.\n“Ocean plastics pollution threatens our beaches, our food supply, and the ocean’s biodiversity. It demands a broad and comprehensive set of solutions,”\xa0she said. “We need stakeholders to develop and implement plastics management strategies to prevent and reduce marine plastic waste.”\nThe US is cooperating with NGOs, industry, academic experts and partner countries to strengthen co-operation on global, regional and local solutions to reduce plastic waste in oceans, she said.\nThe challenge is particularly acute in the Indo-Pacific region, which encompasses more than half of the Earth’s surface and more than half of the world’s population.\nTwo-thirds of global trade also happens here, and the strategic importance of the region’s economy is growing day by day, she said.\n“The largest sources of plastic waste are all in the Indo-Pacific, but we also see opportunities to improve technical capacity and address financing gaps for critical waste-management infrastructure,” she added.\n“Reducing ocean plastic waste requires a holistic approach that decreases demand for single-use plastics; incentivises recycling; strengthens local waste collection; and invests in long-term waste management solutions,” she said.\n“We need collaboration between local and national governments; grassroots organisations, civil society, and schools; businesses up and down the recycling value chain; and development organisations, researchers, and international NGOs,” she added.\nUsana Berananda, Deputy Director General of the ASEAN Department\xa0of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said marine debris was one of the key environmental issues at the global level and within the ASEAN region.\n“Marine debris is a critical concern for ASEAN as approximately 70 per cent of ASEAN population lives in coastal areas. Most importantly, several of us are among the world’s largest contributors to marine plastic pollution.”\n“In Thailand, we lose hundreds of marine species, including sea turtles, dolphins and whales each year.

source codes for Microsoft products, such as the popular Windows operating system and Office suites; technical data about Microsoft’s products and cloud services; and access to Microsoft's engineers to address specific topics.\nWhat are\xa0the Ministry of Public Security’s plans for\xa0the future?\nCurrently, the Vietnamese Government is aggressively directing the implementation of e-government\xa0towards a\xa0digital government and\xa0digital economy, which has achieved positive results.\nIn the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) and information technology increasingly being applied by\xa0ministries, departments, State agencies and localities, this\xa0creates a momentum for the strong development of the economy and society.\nGSP cooperation between Microsoft and the department include dissemination to the community, implementing application and enhancing State management of\xa0network security.\nThis\xa0helps raise awareness and promotes the\xa0application of\xa0new technology, replacing old software and removing non-copyrighted software.\nIn addition, through this cooperation, we will also strengthen the fight against all kinds of crimes including software piracy in Việt Nam.

It brought together leaders of parliaments, heads of delegations from 160 member parliaments, over 1,600 parliamentarians and representatives from international organisations.\nNgân said peace, security, and sustainable development are the goals that require all nations to make more joint efforts to build foundations, in which education is used as an approach and also a prerequisite.\nIn the current global context, education helps promote dialogue, enhance mutual understanding, fight against xenophobia, and prevent extremism, she said, adding education needs to target everyone in society on the basis of equality and justice.\nShe stressed the important role of parliamentarians in fine-tuning the legal system, distributing budget, supervising the Government’s implementation of action plans in education, as well as their role as a bridge for improving knowledge and awareness of people about the important role of education for peace, security and sustainable development.\nThe Vietnamese leader welcomed every effort of the IPU in pushing its member parliaments to give priority to education via its resolutions adopted in 1993, 2001 and 2017, saying this IPU’s theme shows the long-term and humane vision, looking toward a sustainable future for multilateral cooperation among nations.\nShe said Việt Nam always gives priority to sustainable development, highlights education as its prime national policy to help raise intellectual standards, and generate high-quality human resources to meet requirements of Industry 4.0.\nThe National Assembly of Việt Nam adopted and revised many legal documents, such as the Constitution, the Law on Tertiary Education, and the Law on Vocational Training, and increased supervision with the aim of raising the quality of education in Việt Nam, the top legislator said.\nShe suggested that the international community continue to strengthen the peaceful and stable environment for sustainable development and focus on providing comprehensive education for everyone with the aim of preventing the seeds of conflicts and promoting international legal framework for education cooperation, boosting vocational training to improve the quality of labourers for economic development.\nAlong with promoting the role of parliaments and parliamentarians, providing a complete legal framework, building a state of the rule of law, and supervising the execution and approval of budgets for education reform programmes, the countries should work to ensure all people access education.\nShe underlined the need to continue supervising the implementation of national action plans to implement sustainable development goals, asking the IPU to press ahead with reforms to raise the efficiency and role of its member parliaments in carrying out adopted resolutions.\nThe leader stressed the importance of increasing dialogue, international cooperation and partnership between countries, and regional and international organisations, providing maximum support for countries that meet limitations in carrying out comprehensive and inclusive education programmes. — VNS'",0

It is a very common charcoal fuel in domestic use in Việt Nam, though prevalence in modern cities has decreased sharply over the decades.\nA recent survey by the Hà Nội Department of Natural Resources and Environment shows that there are currently about 55,000 stoves running on charcoal briquettes daily in the city.\nThose stoves are expected to burn some 528.2 tonnes of coal and emit about 1,870 tonnes of carbon dioxide to the air a day, said Hà Nội environmental protection division head Mai Trọng Thái.\nThe Hà Nội People’s Committee has set a deadline of December 31 this year for all districts to fully inform residents in their areas on the city’s plan to ban the use of honeycomb briquettes for both domestic and commercial purposes.\nDistrict authorities will then carry out measures to help residents switch to other kinds of stoves which are “safe and friendly to the environment and the community’s health” during the buffer year of 2020.\nThe city’s Department of Industry and Commerce and Department of Finance should quickly develop policies and incentives for businesses and manufacturers which produce alternative stoves to the honeycomb briquettes.\nThey should also work on measures to support charcoal briquette manufacturers to convert their businesses. A report on this should be submitted to the People’s Committee for a final say by June 30, 2020.\nThe ban will go into effect from January 1, 2021 and all violations will face fines regulated in the Governmental decree on administrative penalties for environmental protection. — VNS'",4

Its after-tax profit was down 73 per cent to VNĐ152 billion ($6.6 million).\nA report from Viet Capital Securities Company said DPM’s profit target in 2019 would likely decrease by 17.3 per cent.\nBình Điền Fertiliser Company (BFC) reported a similar situation with turnover and profit declining by 8.8 and 72.7 per cent.\nThe Southern Fertiliser Group made a loss of VNĐ8.9 billion with the third quarter alone accounting for VNĐ4.3 billion.\nA company spokesperson said sales fell sharply in the third quarter.\nWhy is this happening to fertiliser companies?\nThe DPM management said the bad weather was one of the main reasons the company found it difficult to sell products in the third quarter.\nA BFC spokesperson concurred with this, adding that the agricultural sector also faced a deep drop in prices meaning many localities had to reduce their production targets.\nImports of foreign fertilisers remain at a very high level, which also causes difficulties for the domestic industry.\nAccording to the General Customs Department, in the first five months of this year Việt Nam imported more than 1.7 million tonnes of fertilisers for US$488 million.\nA DPM spokesperson said besides the market difficulties they also had to cope with a sharp increase in fuel prices.\nBut analysts said the biggest problem for fertiliser producers was the value added tax (VAT) policy, which significantly eroded their profits.\nFertilisers are not subject to VAT, and this means producers are not entitled to VAT refunds on inputs including machinery and equipment and other fixed assets, which increases cost by 5-8 per cent.\nMany fertiliser companies have repeatedly petitioned lawmakers to amend Law No.71/2014/QH13 that waives VAT on fertilisers to help them in their current plight.\nThey explained that this waiver badly hit\xa0companies, especially those that had invested in modern technology.\nPVFCCo, for instance, should have got VAT returns of VNĐ1 trillion between 2015 and 2017.\nAnalysts said lawmakers should add fertilisers to the list of products that are subject to VAT. —VNS'",2

The figure was 6.98 per cent in the first nine months, said\xa0Phạm Thế Anh,\xa0VEPR's chief economist.\nIn the first nine months of 2019, the service sector grew by 6.85 per cent,\xa0agriculture, forestry and fishery increased\xa0by 2.02 per cent, while industry and construction climbed by 9.56 per cent. The Industrial Production Index (IPI) rose\xa0by 9.6 per cent, the\xa0consumption index\xa0of the\xa0manufacturing\xa0and\xa0processing sector increased by 9.5 per cent, he said.\nRegarding enterprises, in Q3, there were 35,316 newly registered enterprises with total registered capital of VNĐ430.6 trillion (US$18.4 billion), up 37 per cent year-on-year. The number of enterprises suspending operations continued to decrease to 12,505.\nCPI in Q3 increased by 2.23 per cent year-on-year, the figure for nine months was 2.5 per cent, but there is a high risk of rising inflation with increases in food prices due to epidemics, as well as increasing education fees and energy prices, Thành said.\nThe VNĐ/USD exchange rate at commercial banks fluctuated while the central exchange rate increased slightly. The exchange rate at commercial banks fluctuated around VNĐ23,275 per USD.\nTotal State budget revenue in the first six months was estimated at VNĐ1.1 trillion, equalling 77.5 per cent of the yearly estimate and up 10.1 per cent over the same period in 2018.\nIn six months, total budget expenditure was estimated at VNĐ1 trillion, equalling 63.1 per cent of the yearly estimate, up 3.8 per cent year-on-year.\nAccording to Thế Anh, Việt Nam’s GDP growth in the third quarter stood in contrast to the global trend.\nDuring Q3, the growth rates slowed down in many economies.\nThe US economy decelerated so the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its interest rate twice in Q3. European economies enervated, thus the ECB also had to reduce\xa0interest rates. Meanwhile, Japanese government\xa0has been attracting foreign workers to compensate their labour shortages.\nThere are increasing concerns about China’s economy due to\xa0its slower\xa0economic growth and the reducing power of the yuan. Besides, China’s PMI was under 50 while growth-enhancing packages were no longer effective.\nIn addition, oil prices fluctuated unpredictably owing to trade tension between US-China, Japan-Korea and a recent attack on the world’s largest oil refinery in Saudi Arabia.\nThe economic growth in ASEAN countries decelerated. Thailand offers preferential packages to attract companies that want to move production out of China.\nMost central banks of these countries cut interest rates to spur growth, Thế Anh\xa0said. — VNS",2

The biggest threat is not (risks of) lagging economy but reluctance for actions for fear of responsibilities,” Phúc said.\nViệt Nam’s key driving force for growth and development was no longer natural resources, he said, but the population of nearly 100 million Vietnamese people.\n“Our political system is committed to take care of every single one so that none are left behind.”\n‘Dangerous matter’\nVietnamese-made social networks hope to have 90 million users by the end of 2020, the communications minister said on Friday.\nMinister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng told the NA that the ambitious number – given that the country’s population was 96.2 million in 2019 – could be reached with “public support in preferring Vietnamese products”.\nHùng took the hot seat on Friday as the NA continued into its third day of cabinet hearings with deputies bombarding the minister with questions over issues including fake news, spam phone calls and the development of e-Government.\nResponding to questions from HCM City deputy Tô Thị Bích Châu and Đồng Tháp deputy Nguyễn Thị Mai Hoa over the development of the Vietnamese digital ecosystem including social networks, Hùng said he set up a task force to support made-in-Việt Nam social networks as soon as he took office last year. His goal was to attract as many users as those of foreign platforms in Việt Nam – most notably, Facebook.\n“After one year, Vietnamese social networks have gained growth of 30 per cent with some 65 million users,” the minister said.\nThree new domestic social networks, namely Lotus, Gapo and Hahalolo, were introduced within months in 2019, joining in the race to attract users against other Vietnamese networks Zalo and Mocha as well as foreign players like Facebook and Google.\nThose international platforms generated more or less 90 million users in Việt Nam a month, Hùng said.\nThe US social network Facebook had the biggest share of the pie with between 60 and 65 million active users monthly, according to the company.\n“Now what we think, say, buy and even who we love, all can be found on social networks. It means that Vietnamese’ brains are staying in one place and it’s not in Việt Nam,” Hùng said.\n“What will they (foreign networks) do with it? It’s a very dangerous matter, a matter of national security.”\nThe minister, however, said the Government did not aim to replace foreign social networks with domestic ones.\n“Việt Nam has integrated and opened for investment. But to do business anyone in Việt Nam must abide by Vietnamese law and make Việt Nam more prosperous. Foreign social networks can exist alongside domestic ones if they follow Vietnamese law,” Hùng told the NA.\n‘Fake news battle’\nThe Government’s push to switch netizens to domestic social networks is part of its efforts to tackle the fake news epidemic.\nMinister Hùng cited an example saying that a task force of the communications detected and tried to remove 207 fake social media accounts and websites that spread disinformation over the last two months.\nOf those impersonation cases, 46 were ""involved with names of Party and Government leaders"", he added.\nHùng said other countries had already made laws to address misinformation, for example Singapore where fake news spreaders are subject to fines of millions of dollars and jail terms.\n“The Prime Minister has asked the Ministry of Public Security to co-ordinate with the Ministry of Information and Communications to soon issue legal regulations to battle fake news,” Hùng said.\nHe added that the communications ministry was working to find ways to identify users of social networks, and would require foreign social networks provide their users’ information upon request as regulated in the recently-adopted cybersecurity law.\nThe long-term solution to battle misinformation, however, should be education to raise awareness of citizens to learn how to distinguish between real and fake news, the minister said. — VNS\nBOX\nNever let such a tragedy happen again\nHÀ NỘI — Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc on Friday called for never letting the tragedy in which 39 Vietnamese people died inside a lorry in the UK repeat itself.\n“Our deepest sympathies go to Vietnamese citizens who were lost in the tragedy that occurred recently in the UK. We send our condolences to their families and relatives,” Phúc said in his opening remark before his hearing in the National Assembly on the country’s socio-economic development.\n“We shall never let that tragedy happen again,” the PM said.\nThe Ministry of Public Security on Thursday night confirmed all 39 victims who were found dead in a lorry in Essex, the UK on October 23 were Vietnamese nationals.\nThe news came following week-long co-operation between Vietnamese and UK police to identify the victims. — VNS'",0
3865,'Local hotel industry faces challenge in technology: Savills Vietnam',"'The domestic hotel industry will face many challenges during development, especially in the application of technology. Photo tbck.vn\nHÀ NỘI – The domestic hotel industry will face many challenges during development, especially in the application of technology, according to an expert from Savills Vietnam – a foreign property service provider in Việt Nam.\nIn most countries, three- and four-star hotels are usually popular with domestic tourists, and Việt Nam is the same, said Troy Griffiths, Deputy Managing Director Savills Vietnam.\n“In this golden age of domestic tourism for Việt Nam, we can see that these are generally performing well,” he said in a statement.\nInfrastructure in Việt Nam is developing at a rapid pace with a multitude of second-tier cities now touting international capacity. This, in turn, pulls forward competitiveness and capacity, so for the short to medium term, Savills Vietnam believes hospitality and particularly the low mid star level is well-positioned to take advantage of the boom in tourism.\xa0Local budget level is exposed the greatest to competition as capital levels are lower and therefore more easily accessed, according to the director.\nHowever, hospitality was already under pressure from running out-dated business models and has had to adapt and change much more than many other asset classes.\nIn the era of Proptech and Industry 4.0, booking platforms, word of mouth and social media all work to both disrupt and benefit hotels. Whilst Airbnb has totally disrupted and removed market share, at the same time Booking, Agoda and other platforms allow greater reach.\nSome of the Vietnamese start-ups are now operating in this space and have received very good support, including Luxstay, Mytour, Vntrip, Ivivu and Vietnambooking.\nInternational operators, like RedDoorz and OYO, have sturdy practice templates that standardise quality. Since the hotels and place owners act as the franchisee, they’re bound to operate in line with the pre-determined standards, he said. They have tapped into younger market segments through providing an affordable, instantly accessible service.\n""Operating margins are very shallow at the budget levels and so efficient operations are critical, however, the ability to increase revenue through greater occupancy and market share is also very important.\xa0 International operators and booking sites offer this advantage and together the global brands offer loyal customers,"" Griffiths said.\nViệt Nam’s tourism is booming, establishing itself as one of Southeast Asia’s top destinations.\xa0 More than 15 million foreigners visit each year, compared to only 4 million a decade ago, alongside roughly 80 million domestic traveller-trips, which have similarly quadrupled over the same period. Average growth of 13.5 per cent per annum is forecast for 2019-23 with total arrivals to reach 29.1 million by 2023, according to Savills Vietnam.\nIn 2018, travel and tourism GDP was approximately US$27 billion, accounting for 8 per cent of Viet Nam’s GDP. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), the total contribution of travel and tourism to GDP for the next ten years is forecast to increase to 9.8 per cent, ranking Viet Nam 10th out of 185 countries.\nViệt Nam is in a very good situation and will lead the Asia-Pacific region in\xa0compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) at 14 per cent per annum to 2023, according to the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA)\nMeanwhile, according to “The Technology Application to Tourism in the period of 2018-20 oriented to 2025”, developing technology will be a focus to improve Việt Nam Tourism in the coming years. Mobile apps will improve tourism information and experiences, particularly as virtual tour guides and translation services.\nAccording to Travelport Digital – a mobile engagement platform for travel brands, 35 per cent of users downloaded a travel app to their smartphones to search for flights/accommodation, 27 per cent of them downloaded to book flights/accommodation, and 19 per cent keep them updated with travel notifications. - VNS'",2

Photo Liverpool FC.\nPaul Kennedy\nAjax defender Matthijs de Ligt is signing for Barcelona. And Liverpool, PSG and probably Manchester United too. Oh, and also Juventus.\nLiverpool’s young full back Trent Alexander-Arnold is heading to Barcelona and taking his Anfield teammate Andy Robertson with him.\nSadio Mane meanwhile is moving to Real Madrid and Arsenal will be signing Getafe centre-half Djene Dakonam in the summer who is also going to be playing for Everton next season.\nGareth Bale is desperate for a reunion at his old club Tottenham Hotspur and at the same time desperately wants to play for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United.\nYes, you’ve guessed it, it’s that time of year again, its silly season.\nFor those of your unaware with this particular period in the Gregorian calendar, silly season begins around the end of May and runs until somewhere around mid-August.\nCoincidentally, that is also the time of year when there is no competitive club football taking place and sports journalists find themselves with nothing better to do than make up stories about transfers.\nIt’s not all the hacks' fault though, agents too have a massive role to play during silly season.\nTelltale words to look out for include ‘could’ ‘may’ and ‘possibly’. These are the writers get out of jail cards for when their transfer tips disappear down the plug hole.\nThey’ll take a punt and if it comes true then you’ll never hear the end of it.\nI could marry Halle Berry next year and I may find myself going on a date with Charlize Theron. There’s also a possibility, albeit a slim one at best, that I might bump into Angelina Jolie while walking along Hàng Bông Street in downtown Hà Nội, fall head over heels in love and live happily ever after with my new ready-made family.\nBut what makes silly season even sillier in the modern era, if that was even possible, is the huge amount of football websites plastered all over the internet that take transfer tittle tattle to a whole new level.\nSome of stories I’ve seen in recent weeks are nothing short of ridiculous.\nOne claimed that because Memphis Depay of Lyon was seen wearing a red suit and travelling onboard a red private jet, then he must be joining Liverpool.\nAnother claimed Egyptian striker Mohammed Salah will be leaving the Champions of Europe to ply his trade at, er, Old Trafford with Manchester United, who last season finished sixth in the Premier League.\nI get that agents have a job to do and first and foremost they are there to represent the best interests of their players, but a hefty chunk of stories you will read during the season of silliness are simply planted by agents in the hope of bumping up transfer fees and increasing already over-bloated pay packets.\nIn days gone by it was a mate in the pub who knew a bloke who’s sister’s best friend from school used to work with the brother of a woman who is employed as a secretary at a football club. And she said Manchester City will be signing Ronaldo.\nNowadays it’s all about social media sites like Twitter that are awash with rubbish, rumours and downright ridiculousness.\nTake it from me, the only time you will know for sure a club has signed a player is when you open a newspaper or log on to a reputable sports website and see him donning the football strip of his new team.\nSaid player will then conduct an interview with the club’s official TV channel and say: “I have always been a (insert name of club here) supporter ever since I was a young boy and I can’t wait to get started with my new teammates.”\nThen, and only then, will you know 100 per cent beyond any shadow of doubt that your team has signed a new player.\nUntil that happens believe nothing and trust no one, because chances are the story you have just read claiming that Lionel Messi is unhappy in Barcelona and has set his sights on playing for Wolverhampton Wanderers because he has heard there’s some amazing Argentinian steak houses in the Black Country\xa0is probably not true. — VNS",3

This is crazy,"" said Munoz, who becomes just the second Colombian to win on the tour, joining Camilo Villegas.\n""The putts weren\'t going in but I just stayed confident. It was awesome.""\nThe 26-year-old Munoz fired a closing round of two-under-par 70 for an 18-under 270 total to tie Im, who closed with a 66 on Sunday at The Country Club of Jackson in Mississippi.\nIm\'s South Korean compatriot An Byeong-hun finished in third, one shot back of the leaders, after a 69 in the fourth round.\nMunoz\'s three prior professional wins have all come in Colombia -- including the 2016 Colombia Championship on the developmental Korn Ferry Tour.\nHe was coming off a tie for seventh at The Greenbrier last week. Munoz, who started the fourth round with a one-shot lead, becomes the seventh first-time tour winner of this event in the past eight years.\nThe last time Munoz had a 54-hole lead he finished tied for third at The Greenbrier in 2017.\nOn the playoff hole, both players landed in the rough, on either side of the fairway off the tee.\nHitting out of the left-side rough, Im flew his second shot over the flag stick and into the grandstand.\nThat opened the door for Munoz, who had found the right rough off the tee. But Munoz left his 166-yard second shot well short of the green.\nMunoz then made a nice chip to four feet and claimed the victory after Immissed badly from six feet on his first putt.\nMunoz had birdies in regulation on three, 11 and 18 and a bogey on 15. He forced the playoff by making a slow roller from 15 feet over an uphill slope.\n""We decided on a line and tried to make it as simple as we could,"" he said of the clutch putt.\nMunoz is the second South American in as many weeks to win after Chile\'s Joaquin Niemann captured his first title by six shots at The Greenbrier.\n""Jaco\'s win gave me the belief I needed, the little extra belief I\'m good enough,"" said Munoz.\nMunoz, from Bogota, was in the final group with his former teammate at the University of North Texas, Carlos Ortiz, but the Mexican needed an eagle on\xa0 18 to get into the playoff and settled for a par.\nOrtiz shot a final-round 71 to finish in a tie for fourth with American Kevin Streelman at 272, two shots back of Munoz and Im.\nIm\'s burgeoning career gathered more steam as he charged to the finish with three straight birdies on 14, 15 and 16 to get to 18 under overall.\nLike Munoz, the 21-year-old Im was gunning for his first tour title after winning the 2019 rookie of the year award.

2939,'Garment export target of\xa0$40 billion a long shot',"Production of garment products at Duc Giang Garment Co, Ltd, Long Bien, Hanoi. Viet Nam wants to hit $40 billion in textile export turnover in 2019. VNA/VNS Photo Trần Việt\nHÀ NỘI - The domestic textile and garment industry was still striving to reach its export revenue target of US$40 billion this year despite facing many difficulties, said Vũ Đức Giang, chairman of the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS).\nTo achieve this target, the industry needs export value growth of at least 11-12 per cent for the rest of the year, he said.\nAccording to the association, growth reached only 9.1 per cent in the third quarter, much lower than the same period in 2018. However, it was higher than other textile producers including China, India and Bangladesh.\nThe association is hoping textile enterprises will be able to deliver big orders to push export value up in December.\nThe most important thing is for textile and garment enterprises to search for markets and alternative partners. Currently, the businesses can take advantage of the Vietnam-EU Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) to promote export expansion to some markets in the EU as well as Canada and Australia.\nCanada holds a lot of potential for Việt Nam with import value of textiles and garments reaching more than $13 billion each year, while Việt Nam's textile and apparel exports to this market reach only about $550 million per year.\nViệt Nam does not have a free trade agreement (FTA) with Canada so the CPTPP opens the door for Việt Nam's textile and apparel products. Businesses need to seize this opportunity and seek partners in Canada.\nThân Đức Việt, general director of Garment 10 Corporation, said to achieve export success, enterprises needed to be aware of requirements on price, quality, quantity and production time. Moreover, they must also ensure production stability.\nAt the same time, enterprises also needed to cooperate with each other through affiliate programmes and support from the association to meet the rules of origin stated in FTAs.\nEnterprises, especially small businesses, should build a production chain to meet the demand of large contracts in terms of quantity, quality and time of delivery, as well as to create a name for themselves.\nIn recent years, the textile and garment industry had developed strongly and exports had grown year by year, according to the association. However, it still faced many challenges in production and business, such as low labour productivity, lack of high quality human resources and mainly processing products rather than manufacturing them.\nIn addition, challenges from export markets had also put pressure on them, including increasing protectionism, higher quality demands, and environment and technical tests.\nAccording to VITAS, local apparel producers were facing falling export orders. Since mid 2019, some businesses had been able to sign export contracts for small quantities each month. Meanwhile, in the same period last year, many large enterprises had export orders stacked up till the end of the year.\nCao Hữu Hiếu, CEO of Việt Nam Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex), said most textile and garment businesses did not have enough orders to keep them operating until the end of the year.\nLarge businesses such as Garment 10 Corporation, Đức Giang Garment Joint Stock Company, Hòa Thọ Textile Garment Joint Stock Corporation, Hà Nội Textile and Garment Joint Stock Corporation (Hanosimex) had export contract to maintain production until November, but only Việt Tiến Garment Joint Stock Company was going to be busy until the year-end.\nHiếu said given the current situation, the industry would find it difficult to reach the export target of $40 billion this year. - VNS",2

2772,'Việt Nam finance ministry responds to Moody’s latest rating action',"The headquarters of the Vietnamese Finance Ministry. Photo MoF\nHÀ NỘI The Vietnamese Ministry of Finance (MoF) on Wednesday said Moody's Investors Service’s decision to confirm Việt Nam’s rating at Ba3 but change the outlook to negative was not appropriate, given it is grounded on an isolated incident and does not adequately recognise the Vietnamese Government’s instituted policies and procedures to ensure smooth and timely debt repayment on government guaranteed borrowings.\nOn Wednesday, Moody's released the latest rating action on Việt Nam, confirming the Vietnamese Government’s Ba3 local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings, and changed the outlook to negative, concluding the review for downgrade that was initiated on October 9, 2019.\nEarlier, on October 9, Moody's announced to place the Ba3 local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings of the Vietnamese Government under review within three months for downgrade, saying the decision was driven by institutional deficiencies that have come to light. In particular, Moody's became aware of delayed payments on an obligation by the Government.\nUnder the new rating action, Moody’s said the confirmation of the rating reflects its assessment that enhanced attention by the administration on forthcoming payments of all the government's debt obligations, direct and indirect, reduces the risk of renewed payment delays.\nThe Ba3 rating is underpinned by strong growth potential and economic diversification, supporting the economy's capacity to absorb shocks, including a prolonged slowdown in global trade. The rating also reflects Moody's expectation that the government's direct debt burden will decline gradually, from moderately high levels, and debt affordability will improve.\nMoreover, while the rapid build-up of a large and diversified manufacturing sector denotes policy effectiveness, Moody's assesses the country's institutions and governance to be relatively weak, including administrative deficiencies revealed in the delayed debt payments. And although the financial health of Vietnamese banks has improved over recent years, the banking system remains the chief driver of overall event risks for the sovereign.\nThe negative outlook reflects some ongoing risk of payment delays on some of the government's indirect debt obligations, in the absence of more tangible and significant measures to improve the coordination and transparency around debt management within the administration.\nAccording to the MoF, Moody’s acknowledged in its press release that with a coordinated focus on ensuring that the payments are planned for and processed promptly, the risk of renewed delays has significantly receded. Nevertheless, the MoF believes Moody’s signal to keep monitoring Việt Nam’s credit profile with a negative outlook is incommensurate with the strong and timely directives of the Government, as well as the set of drastic measures which the Government of Việt Nam, the MoF and competent authorities have implemented to improve administrative coordination and to immediately address the payment delays on the Government’s contingent liabilities, ensuring no loss for creditors.\n“On this occasion, the MoF affirms that the Government of Việt Nam always honours all debt obligations in a reliable and timely manner as per commitments pledged with development partners and international financial institutions. This principle has been unambiguously demonstrated as the Government of Việt Nam has proactively performed the guarantor’s obligation in debt servicing even in the absence of an official demand from the creditors,” MoF said in a statement.\nAccording to the MoF, to prevent potential future payment delays on contingent liability of the Government, which may cause unnecessary misconception in the investor community about the Government’s debt repayment capacity and adversely affect the country’s reputation and national image, the Prime Minister has directed the MoF and competent authorities to allocate sufficient resources to ensure timely payments on both direct and indirect debt obligations.\n“In the coming years, the Government of Việt Nam shall continue to pursue enabling policies to ensure macro-economic stability, improve the country’s competitiveness, accelerate institutional reforms and utilise resources to ensure debt repayment capacity and debt sustainability,” MoF noted.\nThe MoF and competent agencies are willing to provide information to underline the Government’s firm commitment to fulfilling debt obligations in a transparent manner, the MoF said, expecting that Moody’s, other rating agencies as well as international organisations shall have adequate information and concrete evidence to form a more accurate assessment of Việt Nam’s strong credit profile\nAt the latest rating of Moody’s, Việt Nam's long-term foreign currency (FC) bond ceiling at Ba1, its long-term FC deposit ceiling at B1 and its local currency bond and deposit ceilings at Baa3 were unchanged. The short-term FC bond and deposit ceilings also remained unchanged at Not Prime. VNS",2
4769,'Instant karma’s gonna get you',"SAD FACE: Luis Suarez (right) can’t hide his tears. Photo AFP\nby Paul Kennedy\nI’m going to start off with a bombshell. Get something off my chest I’ve been wanting to say for some time.\nDeep breath. Here we go…\nI like Luis Suarez. There, I’ve said it.\nGranted his best days are very nearly behind him, and as football players go he is about as trustworthy as a bored and restless serpent in the Garden of Eden, but there’s something about little Luis that I just kind of like.\nOn the pitch he’s an animal. And a bitey one at that. But when he plays for your team, as Luis did at Liverpool from 2011 to 2014, he becomes your very own pantomime villain.\nLuis Alberto Suárez Díaz, to give him his full name, has not had the best of summers. In fact as a footballer, it’s probably been his worst.\nAnd the Uruguayan's downfall can all be traced back to one moment.\nIt\xa0was in Barcelona, on the night the Catalans thrashed Liverpool by three goals to nil, towards the end of the game. His teammate Lionel Messi had just scored their third goal, a superb free-kick, and Luis did what Luis does best.\nAfter the final whistle he jogged past Liverpool’s Andy Robertson, who he had kicked earlier on in the match and forced him off the pitch, and laughed in his face. Robbo didn't react, and the match came to an end.\nLuis and the rest of his Barca pals\xa0would have been on cloud nine after that win and no doubt would have already been planning their trip to the Champions League final.\nThat is when things began to start heading south for Suarez.\nThe second leg at Anfield, well we all know what happened there, then Barcelona went on to lose the Copa del Rey final against Valencia.\nNext came the Copa America and saw Luis up to his old tricks. He was caught on camera claiming for a penalty against Chile when one of their players clearly handled the ball in the box. Slight problem, the player was the goalkeeper.\nIn the same match he tried to get another Chilean player booked for a blatant trip, and boy it was blatant alright, but again there was a problem.\nThe player didn’t trip one of Uruguay’s midfielders, no, it was a pitch invader. Undeterred, Luis was still caught on camera gesturing to the referee to show him a card.\nThen on Sunday, Uruguay played Peru in the quarter-finals, a match that couldn’t be decided in normal time, nor extra time.\nPenalty shoot-out and guess what? Correct, Suarez was the only player to miss and as a result, Uruguay are out of the Copa America.\nA truly summer horribilis for Luis.\nBut (ducks out of the way from incoming abuse) I still really, really like him.\nHe’s an amazing talent and reminds me of an adolescent and very angry rabid dog that you can just, only just, keep under control thanks to a very tight leash.\nChances are his Barca days won’t last much longer and that’s not because of his antics but because of his age.\nWhat’s he got left? A season at the Nou Camp? Two maybe? And then this street fighting footballer from the north western Uruguayan city of Salto will be off to pastures new.\nIf you believe what you read on the internet, and there are a million reasons why you shouldn’t, there’s a good chance the 32-year-old will next ply his trade in the United States with the new Miami team run by David Beckham, tipped to sign him.\nWill he change his ways? I truly hope not. Will he mellow out in old age? Not a chance. Will he be the same rapscallion loved by his own supporters and hated by\xa0everyone else? You can guarantee it. VNS",3

AFP Photo\nLONDON — Serge Gnabry scored four second-half goals as Bayern Munich embarrassed Tottenham 7-2 in the Champions League on Tuesday -- the biggest-ever margin of defeat suffered by an English team at home in any European competition.\nThe Bundesliga champions fell behind to an early Son Heung-min goal but then clicked into gear, producing a ruthless display of finishing in the north\xa0London rain as Spurs fell apart.\nHarry Kane briefly gave the home side hope with a penalty to reduce the deficit to 4-2 but that was merely the prelude to another masterclass in\xa0finishing from the five-time European champions.\n""It was a great evening for Bayern Munich and for German football,"" said\xa0Bayern boss Niko Kovac. ""Playing this way here in England is really unique.""\n""I have compassion for my colleague (Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino),"" he added, praising the ""amazing"" Gnabry and Manuel Neuer for his display in the\xa0Bayern goal.\nSpurs, who reached the Champions League final in June, where they lost to Liverpool, also had a sluggish start to the competition last year, winning a\xa0single point from their first three games.\nBut Pochettino faces a huge task now to lift the team after this humbling at their new ground following an unconvincing start to the season.\nThe Spurs boss urged his side to stay together despite the traumatic\xa0defeat, saying the timing of Bayern\'s second goal just before half-time was a\xa0hard blow.\n""The most important thing is to stay calm, no rushed analysis, no rushed judgement, no rushed assessment,"" he said, praising the clinical finishing of\xa0Bayern, who had 11 shots on target.\n""You need to show your quality like a man first,"" he added.

Lewandowski also scored a second.\nIt was the first time Spurs had conceded seven goals in a home match in any major competition.\nThe result leaves Bayern in pole position in Group B with two wins from two matches while Spurs have just one point after seeing a 2-0 lead wiped out in\xa0their opening game against Olympiakos.\nBut despite their poor start they are just two points behind second-placed Red Star Belgrade, who beat Olympiakos 3-1 on Tuesday.\nBayern extended their advantage eight minutes after the break as Gnabry broke at pace down the left and burst into the box before drilling into the\xa0bottom corner.\nSpurs\' misery was compounded as Gnabry struck again two minutes later, capitalising after Harry Winks lost possession.\nPochettino\'s men were handed a lifeline as the referee pointed to the\xa0penalty spot for a foul on Danny Rose, with Kane reducing the deficit to 4-2 on the hour mark.\nBut Gnabry sealed his hat-trick for Bayern in the 83rd minute after racing beyond the Spurs defence and slotting past Lloris from 15 yards.\nThere was still time for Lewandowski to side-foot home a sixth for the\xa0German giants and Gnabry was able to add his fourth, and a seventh for Bayern,\xa0in the 88th minute. —AFP'",3

It uses artificial intelligence to help users improve their English pronunciation.\nELSA Speak has raised over $15 million and has around four million users in more than 100 countries and territories around the world and was listed as one of 13 promising tech startups in Southeast Asia by the South China Morning Post.\nLate last month Vietnamese education start-up Everest Education raised $4 million in a Series B round led by Hong Kong private-equity fund Hendale Capital, according to media reports.\nThe round also saw the participation of venture capital fund Viet Capital and Singapore’s Nullabor.\nEarly last month Singapore- and India-based education fund manager Kaizen Private Equity (Kaizen PE) decided to invest $10 million in YOLA, a Vietnamese ELT service provider backed by local PE firm Mekong Capital.\nAll these start-ups have some common features: their projects have high applicability, they are developing e-learning or EdTech, and their initiators are all Vietnamese.\nGoTit! was founded by Dr Trần Việt Hùng and Elsa Speak by Văn Đinh Hồng Vũ and Ngô Thùy Ngọc Tú.\nWhat accounts for this sudden interest among foreign investors in Vietnamese edtech start-ups?\nViệt Nam and some other countries like India, the Philippines and Mexico, which face major population pressure, have had to opt for e-learning to keep up with the education levels in developed countries.\nViệt Nam’s e-learning market is valued at $2 billion by experts and has enormous potential, thus attracting young people who are strong in digital technology.\nTen years ago some companies pioneered e-learning and achieved reasonable success, including Violet.vn, Hocmai.vn and Topical, who have millions of followers.\nThe quick success of the edtech companies also means Vietnamese people are able to easily use sophisticated education technology, again underlining the huge potential of the market.\nThe country’s e-learning market size is calculated based on the fact that every year Vietnamese are estimated to spend $3-4 billion to send their children abroad to study.\nBesides, the sheer numbers are attractive: it is a country with more than 22 million students.\nThe Vietnamese online training market has in fact been attracting much attention from foreign investors for years.\nAt the end of 2016 the country had 309 investment projects in the fields of tech-based education and training with total registered capital of over $767 million.\nMarket expects banks to follow SBV, cut interest rates\nOn September 16 the State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV) began to cut several key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to pump prime the economy.\nThe cuts, the first by the SBV since October 2017, brings down the refinancing and rediscount rates to 6 per cent and 4 per cent.\nThe annual overnight electronic inter-bank rate and rate on loans to offset capital shortage in clearance between the central bank and domestic banks have been cut to 7 per cent.\nThe interest rate on bids for valuable papers through open market operations is reduced from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent.\nAccording to the SBV, it previously used monetary policy measures to stabilise interest rates in the context of rising international rates, which contributed to macroeconomic stability and ensured reasonable growth.\nBut it has now opted for the new cuts since the global economy has become more volatile and less favourable, and many central banks, including those of the US and Europe, have cut key interest rates.\nExperts had been asking persistently why Việt Nam effected no change though many economies around the world had already loosened monetary policy, including cutting rates.\nDr Cấn Văn Lực, member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Consultation Council, said the central bank’s decision to lower key interest rates was apt amid the current global economic instability.\nBesides, Việt Nam’s inflation rate was fairly benign at 2.57 per cent, which gave the SBV some leeway to cut the rates.\nVeteran economist Nguyễn Trí Hiếu said Việt Nam was suffering from the impacts of the US-China trade war especially since they were also Việt Nam’s two biggest trade partners. So it had to act, he said.\nHow do the rate cuts affect the market?\nAccording to BIDV Securities Company, the market took the cuts in a positive manner as the first sign of policy loosening.\nThey would help weaken the đồng somewhat against the Chinese yuan, helping sustain Việt Nam’s exports as well as competitiveness, it said.\nACBs Securities Joint Stock Company said the cuts were a move to stabilise the economy and support growth against the background of a slowdown in some sectors seen in August.\nLowering interest rates is a powerful form of economic stimulus and the lower interest rates are expected to push up personal consumption and encourage enterprises to expand production.\nExperts said prospective borrowers now expect a wave of interest rate cuts by banks.\nSome bankers said with the lower cost of capital now lenders are likely to slash both deposit and loan interest rates soon.\nThey expected the central bank’s rate cuts would also help banks facing liquidity problems.\nBut some analysts expressed reservations saying it was too early to predict the outcome of the rate cuts because the central bank’s key interest rates had for years had only a modest effect on the economy.\nBesides, a cut of 0.25 percentage points was too little to affect the economy considering the current interest rates, they said, implying they would like to see further cuts in the near future.

The company’s brand Lumitel became profitable after just one month of operation and reached one million users – 10 per cent of Burundi’s total population – after four months.\nIn Mozambique, Viettel’s Movitel brand has been\xa0called “An African Miracle” after\xa0winning\xa0six international awards for offering low-cost telecoms and internet services for local people.\nWhen cyclone Idai hit Mozambique in March 2019 and devastated the country, Movitel was the first telecoms business that attempted to repair and restore\xa0connectivity.\nOur principle is building technology for\xa0untapped areas. This\xa0principle has helped Viettel cover every corner and user of our\xa010 foreign markets.\nIn each foreign country, Viettel has opted to localise its name to fit the local market which has demonstrated the pride of local people.\nDespite being the most valuable\xa0telco in Việt Nam, we know there is still a big gap between Viettel and leading global companies but\xa0we are striving narrow that each day.\nAs a tech firm, we know that it's a “change or die” market so we try to adapt each day. This month, we started operating the first-ever 5G service in the country and the first infrastructure for the\xa0Internet of Things (IoT) in HCM City. We also start testing our drones for\xa0fire rescue activities\xa0in the central forests of Việt Nam. Viettel is working on more projects in AI\xa0and machine learning to serve local people. We want the best connectivity to serve the development of future technology in\xa0Việt Nam.\nWhat we have been doing is also the\xa0way we brand ourselves. Internal relations is also one of our\xa0branding strategies. There is no one better equipped\xa0to speak volumes about our\xa0products than the employees. We don’t consider our 50,000 employees as simply\xa0workers. They are stakeholders who directly benefit and make benefits for\xa0the group. In such a tech society, when 50,000 of them mention, share and like us and our products on their social networks, it is far better than many kinds of advertisement. That's why\xa0we have built a workplace that allows\xa0our employees to be themselves, get\xa0more connected and contribute to the group.\nCEO of Mibrand Lại Tiến Mạnh. — VNS Photo\nCEO of Mibrand Lại Tiến Mạnh praises what Viettel has done with\xa0branding and\xa0thinks there should be more cases like the telco.\nAfter five years of being ranked by Brand Finance, many enterprises in Việt Nam are on the right track of\xa0building their brands to\xa0international standards. However, there are still many who don’t.\nServing a large\xa0market of 100 million people, most enterprises in Việt Nam don’t pay enough attention to improving their brands internationally. But things are so uncertain now when people live in a flat world with increased connectivity. If a business does nothing to boost its\xa0image and its\xa0brands, customers will forget.\nTo bring local brands to the world, there should be more work from higher levels, not only from\xa0businesses. The State, ministries and industries should pay more attention and spend more on promoting\xa0local brands with more frequent international trade fairs and\xa0farm trips. Enterprises themselves should concentrate more on connecting with the public. Nothing is as easy as promoting a\xa0brand than enhancing\xa0internal relations. If employees don’t clearly know about a\xa0brand, how they are they meant to promote it among others?\xa0— VNS",2

Mobile payments witnessed a year-on-year surge of 169.5 per cent in the number of transactions.\nSpeaking at a conference organised by the Việt Nam Bank Association and International Data Group Việt Nam in HCM City on Thursday, Neil Van Heerden, head of commercial - international at Thai financial technology company True Money, said non-cash payments were rising sharply in Việt Nam due to the young population, rapidly growing economy and expanding middle class besides the rise of e-commerce and technological services companies.\nNguyễn Hưng, general director of TPBank, said technology was also changing customers' habits and how they experience banks since they have more options and banks should be more customer-focused in their procedures and services.\nLê Thanh Tâm, chairman of International Data Group Việt Nam and ASEAN, said cash payments still accounted for 79 per cent in Việt Nam and paying through banks was still not common.\nThe financial technology (fintech) infrastructure is still restricted to big cities and digital fintech and its users are rare, according to Tâm.\nAn executive from MOCA Technology and Service JSC said the Vietnamese habit of using cash was a core problem to the non-cash economy, but if technology was ready to satisfy their requirements, people would be willing to use non-cash payment in their day-to-day transactions, he said.\nSo fintech companies needed to expand the non-cash payment eco-system so that this method could become more popular and be used for important transactions, he said.\nOnce users realise non-cash payment is more simple and convenient than cash, they would be less hesitant to use it, he assured. - VNS",2

Sets are small bulblets which are harvested before they mature. The onions can be grown from seeds, transplants or sets.\nVĩnh Châu farmers grow three crops a year on around 6,500ha, with the early and main ones accounting for 5,000ha, according to the bureau.\nThe main crop, planted in the dry season, has an average yield of 1.5-2 tonnes per 1,000sq.m. However, farmers who grow the main crop often face a fall in prices because of excessive supply.\nThe town’s red onions are delicious and both sold domestically and exported. VNS",1
1651,'Hà Nội health sector improves service to better serve patients',"Nguyễn Đức Chung (second, left) Chairman of the People's Committee of Hà Nội talks to Professor Joel Leroy at an event in Hà Nội.— VNA/VNS Photo Lâm Khánh\nHÀ NỘI — Hà Nội's health sector has improved its service in recent years, aiming to decrease the amount of money Vietnamese spend on treatment overseas, a figure that currently amounts to about U$2 billion annually.\nSince 2016, the health sector has worked to attract foreign doctors and experts to come to Hà Nội and transfer advanced medical technologies to local doctors and medical staff.\nFor example, the Hà Nội-based Saint Paul Hospital has worked with 263 foreign medical experts from France, the US, Australia, Switzerland, Japan and South Korea for academic exchange and technology transfer.\nNotably, the hospital received support from Professor Joel Leroy a top French endoscopy expert, Professor Bretagnol Frederic and other experts to establish the Hi-tech and Digestive Centre, specialised in endoscopic surgery and digestive treatment in 2016.\nIt was the first digestive centre of the city with advanced medical equipment and new technologies for digestive treatment.\nNguyễn Đình Hưng, director of the hospital, said the hospital had implemented a range of advanced medical techniques, such as minimally invasive colon and rectal surgery; laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of ileosigmoid fistulas; transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and natural laparoscopic surgery leaving no scars.\nBesides, Leroy also trained doctors at Đức Giang Hospital in Long Biên District to perform advanced medical techniques.\nHưng said Leroy not only trained doctors at the hospitals but also performed difficult surgeries.\nLeroy's first operation in Đức Giang Hospital was performed on a 76-year-old man, of Long Biên. The patient was taken to the hospital with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating and vomiting. After being examined, the patient was diagnosed with a bowel obstruction due to colon cancer.\nUnder the instruction of Leroy, the tumour was successfully removed in just over an hour. The surgery was recorded and presented to the hospital’s meeting room so other doctors could watch it.\nIn the operation room, Leroy guided doctors on how to conduct open laparoscopy and explained how to perform minimally invasive colon and rectal surgery.\nLater, in recognition of Leroy's contribution to the city’s health sector and Việt Nam, late President Trần Đại Quang awarded him the Friendship Medal of the Socialist Republic of Việt Nam in 2017.\nLeroy is currently helping train doctors specialised in gastrointestinal laparoscopy for the city’s health sector as well as doctors for the hi-tech and digestive centre.\nAnother example of international co-operation is 108 Military Central Hospital. Doctors from the hospital worked with their colleagues in France’s Foch Hospital to conduct Viet Nam's first lung transplant from a brain-dead donor in March 2018.\nThe leading partner of the hospital is now Japan, a country with some of the most developed medicine in the world. The hospital has sent doctors and technicians to training courses in Japan to improve the quality of examination and treatment.\nAssociate Professor Nguyễn Anh Tuấn, deputy head of the hospital’s Gastrointestinal Surgery Department, said after the training courses, doctors and technicians of the hospital had learned advanced techniques.\nTuấn said doctors from the hospital now could conduct techniques for treating gastric and esophageal cancer just as doctors in Japan can.\nChallenges remain\nData from the hi-tech and digestive centre show thanks to the improvement in service quality, the centre has received 20 -30 per cent more patients each year since 2016.\nNguyễn Ngọc Đan, a doctor from the centre, said there were patients diagnosed in Singapore’s hospitals but they returned to the centre for treatment because of the reasonable price and to be treated by reputable doctors, he said.\nStatistics of local hospitals revealed most foreign patients chose to be treated in well-known hospitals, including Saint Paul, 108 Military Central and Bạch Mai because of good service quality and the skills of doctors.\nDespite initial results, challenges still remain, said director of the city’s health sector Nguyễn Khắc Hiền.\nHiền said international co-operation had only been carried out by some hospitals and focused on certain aspects, while many other hospitals and aspects had not enjoyed international co-operation.\nHe said a lack of staff with fluent foreign language skills was the major challenge. It caused limits in finding partners, negotiating and implementing international co-operation.\nHe said the city’s health sector would focus on improving foreign language skills for medical staff, he said.\nAdditionally, the sector hopes to seek international co-operation in building a general strategy to develop the city’s health sector to improve service quality. It also plans to construct new medical centres with advanced equipment equal to centres of developed countries and establish hi-tech medical centre, according to Hiền.— VNS",1

We see more and more Vietnamese looking to invest overseas.”\nKingston Lai, CEO of Denzell Vietnam, said a few years ago many Vietnamese invested overseas for a number of different reasons such as children’s education or residency.\nBut now the trend had changed, and the top reason was to diversify their portfolio, he said.\nConcurring, Pantazis Therianos, CEO of Euroterra Capital, a multinational property investment and development company headquartered in Europe, said Vietnamese were now looking for good global investment, looking to diversify their portfolio and find the best return for their investment abroad.\n“I also saw that in the past they used to buy property in different ways from friends, from platforms but now most of them are looking for the best agencies to buy from them.”\nAccording to speakers at the seminar, Việt Nam is one of the most attractive overseas markets for international businesses thanks to its high economic growth, rising income and increasing demand for making overseas property investment.\nFour international property developers, Euroterra Capital, Pafilia, Australian developer Lendlease, and Thai real-estate developer Sansiri, introduced their products as well as residence permits such as Greece Golden Visa, Cyprus Citizenship Programme and Thai Retirement Visa at the seminar.\nThey also advised investors in choosing where to invest.\nTherianos said investors should consider places they understand, and since tourism is what Việt Nam is famous for, Vietnamese should invest in properties related to tourist such as on an island, in the city centre or near the sea.\nWinters said investors should look at “locations that can generate over 70 per cent of sales to foreign investors and locations that give a good return regardless of the reason for investing.”\nPoomipak Julmanichoti\xa0, executive vice president of Sansiri, said: “There are two locations that I would like to recommend for investment - Bangkok and Phuket.\n“Obviously these two cities are among the most visited by foreign tourists and you can retire there easily.”\nAccording to Eric Chan, residential director, Lendlease Malaysia, Malaysia has a low and friendly tax structure.\nMalaysia is very culturally adaptable for most Vietnamese and also a very easy place to retire in, he said.\nBut investing overseas is not an easy task for investors since they are not familiar with the market, legal processes, developers, and language, according to delegates.\nWinters said the two key elements that investors should think about when they want to invest abroad were “making sure that you are investing in a reputable company in that country and making sure you have a good performance agency here in your home country.”\nLai said Denzell would be a bridge connecting Vietnamese investors with globally reputed real estate development.\nThe company checks developers and projects to make sure they are reliable before it introduces their projects to the market, and invites clients to visit those countries, whether Greece, Cyprus, Thailand, or Malaysia, to enable them to see the property for themselves and meet and work with partners (lawyers), and offers comprehensive after-sales service such as leasing and property management, according to Lai.\nDenzell next plans to organise an event to introduce TRX, an integrated 70-acre development that will be Kuala Lumpur's new financial district, on November 3 in HCM City. — VNS",2

2729,'Problems remain in turning public non-business units to joint-stock firms',"'A building at the Transport Hospital, which became a joint-stock business in October 2015. — Photo tinnhanhchungkhoan.vn\nHÀ NỘI — To improve the quality of public products and services, the Government in June 2015 issued a decision to transform public non-business organisations into joint-stock businesses.\nThis helped the State attract more private investors to involve in producing\xa0public products and services, improve the governance and quality of the units, and increase labour productivity and income.\nAfter four and a half\xa0years, the number of successfully-transformed units has remained modest and there are many challenges that need to be resolved.\nAlmost 340 public non-business units and organisations have been enlisted for the transformation since June 2015. Of the total, 31 units have completed the process and 38 units have gained approval for their transition plans.\nOne of the units is the Transport Hospital, which became a joint-stock business in October 2015.\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, the transformation plan has lagged behind schedule set for 2015-20 period as the number of successfully-transformed units accounts for only 14.5 per cent.\nSome have not implemented the plan properly while others have delayed the transformation. In some provinces and districts, the post-transition business plans have remained inappropriate.\nIn addition, transformed units have not been managed correctly and the quality of products and services dropped with some no longer available.\nTo improve the transformation process, the Ministry of Finance is working on a new decree. According to Đặng Quyết Tiến, deputy director of the Department of Enterprise Finance, the new decree is expected to resolve the issues public non-business units have encountered with their transformation.\nUnder the draft, a unit or an organisation that wants to be transformed can be state and government agencies, units under ministerial management, local authority departments and offices, schools, hospitals, sub-units of State-owned enterprises and State-owned limited liability companies.\nNguyễn Thị Lê Thu\xa0of the National Institute for Finance at the Ministry of Finance\xa0said to lure investors to targeted public non-business units, they should be productive and their products are widely accepted and purchased.\nMoreover, the products should be necessities and they should be accessible to a large part of the population.\nA regulation is needed for those units to address their financial issues, property rights for assets and land areas, the State control and management, and policies towards employees in the post-transition stage.\nTo assure the quality of products and services provided in the post-transition stage, the State needs to issue standards to supervise the production process and deal with violations.\nThe State has to control prices of some services such as university fees, waste collection and management, and public transport to make sure they are broadly affordable.\nThe transformation process needs to go into stages through which public non-business units are encouraged to fully take control of their own finance and governance.\nThe State may either sell its ownership entirely or issue shares to potential investors to increase the charter capital of the unit.\nVũ Hoàng Quyên, World Bank senior economist, said the transformation must be assessed carefully and the Government needs to choose the right sectors that are suitable for the transition.\n“The State takes a big role in the management of fundamental public services like healthcare and education. The list of units to-be-transformed must be developed upon the assessment of the State responsibility in the post-transition units,” she said.\nOther important factors include information disclosure and transparency, handling differences between the ceiling prices of public services set by the Government and the prices provided by the privatised\xa0units, she added.\nQuyên suggested the units are turned into State-funded companies so they must\xa0get used to operating as a business, then they are totally privatised. In addition, the State must take control of financial management in those businesses and its role must be legalised. — VNS'",2

2751,'State agency or company should\xa0manage apartment buildings\xa0in Hà Nội: expert',"'Apartment buildings in Hà Nội. The capital city is considering\xa0compiling\xa0its own regulations on managing apartment buildings. Photo thanglong.chinhphu.vn\nHÀ NỘI – An enterprise or the State agency should be responsible for the management of apartment buildings and the building’s maintenance fund with the participation of representatives including residents, investors and local management agencies, said Đồng Minh Sơn from Hà Nội Construction Association.\nHe said the capital city has been collecting opinions to issue its own regulations on apartment management, including management over maintenance funds.\nThe city needs to consider its characteristics as the capital to have more specific regulations on ownership and use of common areas in apartment buildings, especially those located near political, security and defence institutions, and more effective solutions in managing the maintenance fund, according to Sơn.\nArchitect Đào Ngọc Nghiêm, Vice Chairman of Hà Nội Urban Planning and Development Association, said the management of condominiums must come from planning and projects. Therefore, the boundary around the apartment building should be defined in the master plan to avoid disputes between investors and residents because the apartment is not only the building itself but also the surrounding space.\nMeanwhile, Lê Thị Bích Thuận from the Vietnam Federation of Civil Engineering Association, said in the process of making apartment management regulations, Hà Nội should pay attention to suburban areas, in which the state management apparatus has works including agricultural land and village management. After the urbanisation process, the apparatus would have to manage on a larger scale, so it would be hard to meet professional qualifications, creating more difficulties in management of many fields, including apartment buildings.\nDeputy Director of Hanoi Department of Construction Nguyễn Chí Dũng said before the 2005 Housing Law came into effect, the management of apartment buildings was given to the investor and the maintenance fund came from the rent of the building’s first floor for business activities. This model has many problems due to the monopoly of the investor.\nAfter the Housing Law came into effect, the Ministry of Construction issued regulations on managing the operation of condominiums, including the management board model and maintenance fund from two per cent of the contract of apartment buyers.\n""However, at present, there are many disputes such as the establishment of the management board, defining common and separate areas, and the maintenance fund itself,"" he said.\nFor instance, after the management board is established, the investor must hand over related documents, but this process is often very slow. For common and private areas, the legal regulations are very clear, but home buyers often do not read the contract carefully, so when living there, they have complained about those issues.\nBefore having a management board, the investor manages the operation of the building and the maintenance fund. After a board is established, the investor must hand over the fund to the board, but the board does not accept the investor’s spending from the maintenance fund, leading to lawsuits, Sơn said.\nHa Noi has 833 commercial apartment buildings with over 230,000 apartments in use, of which more than 80 apartment buildings have witnessed disputes. The city’s Department of Construction has solved those disputes in 79 of them.\nNearly 600 out of the 833 apartment buildings have established management boards, investors of 300 apartment buildings have transferred the 2-per-cent maintenance fund to the management boards.\nIn addition, the city currently has 174 resettlement apartment buildings in operation, of which 82 buildings have management boards and the investors of 50 of 82 apartment buildings have handed over the maintenance funds for the boards. - VNS'",2

Construction work\xa0has\xa0been blamed as one of the contributors to the city's declining air quality. VNA/VNS Photo Thành Đạt\nHÀ NỘI The Việt Nam Environment Administration under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has advised members of the public, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with respiratory diseases, to limit outdoor activities due to rising pollution.\nPeople should wear air masks and glasses when they go outside, the ministry said.\nThe ministry officially issued its recommendations two weeks after fine dust levels in Hà Nội and HCM City started reaching highly unhealthy levels.\nIt warned that levels of PM2.5, a single particle with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres, could continue to remain high, especially at midnight and in the early morning. The phenomenon occurs due to dry sunny weather during the day and low surface air temperatures at night.\nAccording to an air quality report for September released on Tuesday by the Việt Nam Environment Administration, PM2.5 levels in Hà Nội over the past few days had reached their highest levels for five years.\nThe air quality index from September 12 to 29 showed PM2.5 levels exceeded the permitted limit according to statistics collected from 13 environmental monitoring stations in the capital.\nDuring that period, Hà Nội enjoyed only five days when the air quality was good. On the other days, the air quality index reached more than 100, which is classed as unhealthy.\nLow rainfall was one of the reasons for the surge in fine dust last month, the report said.\nHeat reverse and people burning straw in fields on the city’s outskirts were also to blame for increasing levels of PM2.5, according to the report.\nAir quality in Hà Nội is continuing to worsen. The Air Quality Index on AirVisual, an international air quality monitoring facility that generates data from public, ground-based and real-time monitoring stations, reached the purple level (very unhealthy) at 7-8am on Tuesday morning and the brown level (hazardous) at 9am. At this level, air quality is deemed toxic and poses a serious risk to the heart and lungs. Everyone should avoid outdoor exertion.\nAssociate Professor Vũ Văn Giáp, deputy director of the Respiratory Centre at the Hà Nội-based Bạch Mai Hospital, said: “Fine dust with super small diameters cannot be felt. When we breathe it in it goes into our blood and organs, causing inflammation and diseases to different organs.”\nIf the air quality worsened, people with heart or respiratory diseases would experience difficulty breathing and cough more, he said.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, air pollution is a silent killer. About 30 per cent of deaths caused by lung cancer and 43 per cent of deaths caused by respiratory diseases in the world are related to air pollution. If there are no measures taken to protect the air, humans will be the first to suffer the consequences.\nNguyễn Minh Tiến, deputy director of HCM City’s Paediatrics Hospital, advised people to use air filter masks which are able to filter 95 to 99 per cent of fine dust.\nNormal masks filter only 30 to 40 per cent of dust. People should keep their houses and bodies clean and eat fruit and vegetables to increase resistance levels. VNS",4

Meanwhile, interest rates for long-term savings are much higher, ranging between 7 and 8.5 per cent per year depending on the bank.\nTo stabilise the monetary market and ensure the secure operations of the banking system, SBV has asked credit institutions to shun unhealthy competition and follow regulations on lending and interest rates and the use of non-cash means of payment for loan disbursement.\nBanks are required to strictly oversee capital use purposes and the disbursement of credit guaranteed by such collateral as savings books. The central bank will take strict action against credit institutions caught breaking the rule, according to the notice.\nBanking expert Nguyễn Trí Hiếu told Việt Nam News that the tightening was necessary as loans to customers using savings books as collateral without plans to use the capital could cause risks to the safety of the banking system.\n“This form of lending is called ‘phantom loan’ and many developed countries in the world forbid such loans as it could distort total assets of banks,” Hiếu explained.\nIn Việt Nam, at the end of the year, some banks which wanted to increase their total assets use this technique. — VNS'",2

Conditional business investment means the businesses must meet the requirements of national security, social order and safety, morality or community health when investing and doing business in Việt Nam.\nThese 12 business sectors, from the list of 243 conditional business sectors, are now seen as suitable with Việt Nam’s development. These conditions need to be cut to create an open and favourable environment for businesses.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM), there are 243\xa0conditional business sectors under the Law on Investment, however many of them restrict enterprises and hinder the development of the business environment.\nIn addition, the law drafting agency also proposed to amend 19 sectors and supplement six conditional business sectors to suit State management requirements and practices. Of which, debt collection services will be removed from the list of conditional businesses but added to the list of sectors banned from business investment.\nThe reduction in conditions is part of the Government’s goal to improve the business environment in Việt Nam, in which Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has assigned ministries and relevant sectors to promote reforms for enterprises.\nPhúc has also assigned the Government Office to collaborate with relevant ministries to draft a plan on removing regulations related to business activities in the 2020-25 period, which must be submitted and issued by January 2020. — VNS'",2

2285,'Health ministry wants to promote cashless payments in the health sector',"'Delegates launch the portal on supporting medical electronic transactions in Hà Nội on Friday. — VNS Photo Thanh Hải\nHÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Health has set out a plan to promote e-payments, or cashless payments, in the health sector, especially for health check-ups and treatment services at medical facilities nationwide.\nSpeaking at an online conference on Friday in Hà Nội, health minister Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến said the implementation of non-cash payments will be an important task of the health sector.\nTiến said that non-cash payments have many benefits, including improved safety, speed and accuracy. It also allows people to access and make payments not only within the country but even globally.\n“To date, cashless payments have been applied at about 30 medical facilities nationwide, gaining remarkable results. At several hospitals, non-cash payments made up 35 per cent of total payment transactions for health check-ups and treatment, reducing congestion, queuing time and improving patient satisfaction,” said Tiến.\nHowever, Tiến said, there are still many difficulties in expanding cashless payments in the health sector, such as low rate of hospitals using cashless payment systems or shortcomings in connecting with banking software or between organisations providing intermediary services and information systems of hospitals.\n“Vietnamese people are still used to paying for medical services with cash,” said the health minister.\n“Recently, the health sector has accelerated the application of IT and ensured infrastructure in improving management activities, quality of medical services and satisfaction of patients in fields of public administration, health check-up and treatment; medical and pharmaceutical training. This will be the foundation for implementing electronic payments for services,” said Tiến.\nAt the event, the health ministry requested units in the sector to develop action plans, resources and conditions to implement suitable non-cash payment solutions.\nThe ministry asked hospitals and health facilities to actively deploy various forms of electronic payments for hospital fees and tuition, such as via credit card, smartphone, electronic wallets and electronic payment gateways.\n“For people who have no bank card or account, health facilities must work with banks to implement a convenient non-cash payment solution,” said Tiến.\nAt the same time, the health sector will also promote communication and strengthen people’s awareness on the significance and important utilities of non-cash payment, encouraging people to use cashless methods in paying hospital fees and tuition.\nThe State bank of Việt Nam Deputy Governor Nguyễn Kim Anh said that the SBV will continue to work with the health sector in improving people’s experience and satisfaction in paying treatment fees, reducing queues, contributing to improving the quality of check-up and treatment services.\nSBV also suggested commercial banks research and apply incentive policies and affordable service fees for payment of hospital fees and implement incentives, promotion and discount programmes to change habits and behaviours of customers in paying hospital fees from cash to e-payments.\n“SBV will instruct commercial banks to work closely with medical facilities in providing safe, fast, accurate service products and payment methods with affordable fees,” added Anh.\nA report of the State Bank of Việt Nam showed that around 50 per cent of Vietnamese people still do not have bank accounts or e-payment cards. Fees for cashless payments are still high and there is a lack of payment methods for medical services at hospitals in mountainous and remote areas, hindering the development of non-cash payments in the health sector.\nViệt Nam currently has more than 70 banks providing Mobile Banking and 31 e-wallets of intermediary payment service providers that can participate in providing cashless payment solutions. Nearly 14,000 health facilities use bank accounts nationwide.— VNS'",1

It is both a humanitarian task and a task to ensure the sustainable and prosperous development of the country,” Cử said.\nIncidents like the recent mercury pollution and water safety issue in Ha Noi showed the increasing risk of chemical pollution, he said.\n“Threats to environmental security have been increasing in terms of scale and seriousness in the past year,” he said.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam emphasised the importance of establishing the NACCET.\n“There still remains a huge amount of dioxin-contaminated land in Việt Nam, millions of toxic chemicals in the soil, millions of people who suffered from dioxin contamination after the war. That’s a problem we need to deal with,” Đam said.\nHe also said that like many in other countries, environmental protection had been neglected for a while.\n“The need to address pollution and chemicals detoxification is urgent,” he said, adding that the establishment of the NACCET is timely.\nHe asked the centre leaders to focus on human resources and technology investment, while also calling on international organisations to support Việt Nam on the issue.\nSpeaking at the event, Caryn McClelland, deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in Hà Nội, said the US was committed to supporting the development of Việt Nam.\n“Last year, the USAID committed a funding of US$183 million for the initial five years of the dioxin remediation project at Biên Hoà Airport. This is the largest remaining hotspot of dioxin contamination in Việt Nam,” she said.\nWhile it would take Việt Nam and the US 10 years and up to $390 million to clean the Biên Hoà site, McClelland said US commitment was only increasing.\n“There have been zero UXO accidents in the last 20 months in the areas where we concentrate our efforts in Quảng Trị Province,” she said.\nOver the next five years, USAID has committed more than $65 million to work with the Ministry of Defence, Office 701 and the NACCET to implement the next phase of US’s support for persons with disabilities, according to the official.\nThe NACCET will also carry out research and technology transfer to help overcome post war consequences of toxic chemicals, handling pollution of toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, and toxic chemical incidents treatment.\nIt will be responsible for running programmes and working plans on overcoming post war consequences of toxic chemicals, as well as treating toxic chemicals, hazardous substances and overcoming incidents of toxic chemicals.\nThe Prime Minister assigned the Ministry of National Defence to be responsible for NACCET's activities.--VNS",1

Last year, Việt Nam welcomed 15.5 million foreign visitors while Laos attracted about 4.2 million international arrivals, much lower compared to the 38 million foreigners visiting Thailand annually.\nBoth Việt Nam and Laos have significant potential for further growth. One of their big challenges is the lack of quality accommodation facilities in tourist destinations.\n“We value IFC’s extensive experience and expertise drawn from its global portfolio of tourism projects,” said Đoàn Quốc Huy, CEO at BIM Land.\n“As part of this project, BIM Land will add a significant number of international quality hotel rooms or serviced apartments – more than 1,500 – in Vientiane, Hạ Long Bay and Phú Quốc Island. Moreover, the project in Phú Quốc Island is expected to set new environmental and social standards in the property sector, attracting a new category of domestic and international tourists.”\nIFC will provide a loan of up to $50 million from its own account and a trust loan up to $37.5 million to BIM Land and its subsidiaries from the multi-investor Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Programme (MCPP) managed by IFC. At least $10 million of this financing package will be offered to developing tourism in Lao PDR.\nThe project is expected to create about 1,400 jobs – 60 per cent for women. Apart from local hiring and a relatively higher wage, the project will source around 90 per cent of its goods and services locally. IFC will also share best practices to help the company enhance its performance.\nIn addition, in pursuit of a green and sustainable tourism business, BIM Land has committed to applying IFC’s Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies Green Building Certification System (EDGE) in its new hotels to be developed under this project with the aim of reducing energy, water\xa0and material consumption by at least 20 per cent compared with similar buildings.\n“The tourism industry is a major contributor to employment, foreign exchange earnings, and tax revenues for developing countries,” said Kyle Kelhofer, IFC Country Manager for Việt Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR.\n“In alignment with the Government’s efforts, IFC’s loan to BIM Land will help create higher skilled job opportunities for the local workforce in Lao PDR and Việt Nam, thereby strengthening supply chains, driving inclusive growth and enabling private sector participation.” — VNS'",2

Of all the countries, NESCAFÉ Plan is seen as reaping the greatest success in Việt Nam.\nSo far, the project has distributed 36 million high-yield and diseases-resistant coffee saplings to farmers and helped rejuvenate over 36,000ha of aged coffee areas in the Central Highlands.\nIt has also provided training to over 230,000 coffee famers in best practices to improve bean quality and ensure sustainable farming and helped over 21,000 farmers achieve 4C international certification and increase their incomes by 30 per cent.\nThe project also helps protect the environment by reducing water use by 40 per cent and fertiliser and pesticide use by over 20 per cent.\nWill Mackereth, supply chain director at Nestlé Vietnam, said one of the things NESCAFÉ Plan does is help farmers reduce the cost of inputs. This might be in the form of water management or agrochemical, pesticide and herbicide use.\n“We are working with farmers to ensure they have a business mindset so that they are looking to optimise costs and the quality of the products. And we help them downstream by working on innovation, branding and product terms to ensure we can get the best value for the coffee throughout the supply chain.\n“We are proud of what NESCAFÉ Plan has done to help the farmers achieve sustainable livelihoods by reducing the cost of inputs by intercropping with other crops like pepper, avocado and durian. This means that they can be more resilient so that if the coffee prices are low as they are toda,y they still have a good income from other product streams, but also that the cost of coffee production in Việt Nam is extremely efficient and extremely competitive.\n“So we help keep that as viable as possible for farmers and downstream we try and get the best possible return we can for the coffee to ensure the sustainability of coffee here in Việt Nam in the long term.\n“We see a lot of improvements in farmer livelihoods and coffee quality.”\nNguyễn Đức Huề, a farmer in Ia Hrung Commune, Ia Grai District, Gia Lai Province, who participated in NESCAFÉ Plan in 2014, said his coffee productivity has increased sharply to five tonnes per hectare on average thanks to better farming practices.\nHe started intercropping his 4ha coffee plantation with avocado in 2016 and now harvests the fruits.\nTự said:\xa0“The NESCAFÉ Plan project has contributed positively in supporting farmers even in the time of market uncertainty.”\nThe productivity of coffee farms participating in the project is 4.5-5 tonnes per hectare, much higher than the country’s average of 2.6 tonnes, he said.\n“The project contributes greatly to the coffee sector’s target of replacing 130,000 hectare of ageing coffee out of a total coffee area of 650,000 hectare.”\nNestlé has also organised activities to create opportunities for farmers from various locations to meet and exchange experiences and improve their knowledge of sustainable agricultural practices.\nIt recently organised the NESCAFÉ Plan Farmer Contest as part of the 2019 Việt Nam Coffee Day celebrated in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai from December 7 to 11.\nThe competition attracted the participation of 90 outstanding coffee farmers from Đắk Lắk, Đắk Nông, Gia Lai\xa0and Lâm Đồng.\nMackereth said:\xa0“2020 will mark the 10th\xa0anniversary of NESCAFÉ Plan Vietnam and we expect many more such activities.”\nNestlé is the biggest buyer of coffee in Việt Nam, buying US$700 million worth a year. — VNS'",2

Therefore, the forum offered an opportunity for delegates to look into urgent issues regarding labour, social welfare and human resources development, along with challenges Việt Nam may face in the future.\nVũ Minh Tiến, head of the Institute for Workers and Trade Unions under the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour, touched upon opportunities and challenges to labour and social welfare as Việt Nam was striving to reach an upper-middle-income status.\n“Today’s world of work is going through accelerated and disruptive changes, affecting the livelihoods of millions of working women and men, employers and workers alike,” said ILO Việt Nam Director\xa0Chang-Hee Lee. He named the key change factors as\xa0technological innovation represented by the Industrial Revolution 4.0, increasingly interconnected global trade, an aging population and climate change.\n“How to build a better future of work in this transformative era, by grasping the opportunities it offers and preparing to face the arising challenges, is a critical question of our time,” he said.\nIn that context, the ILO’s historic Centenary Declaration adopted in June 2019 called for a human-centred future of work and emphasised that the\xa0future was not something to be imposed on us, but a choice to be made by governments, workers and employers.\nViệt Nam has been a success story with sustained high growth over the past decade despite a turbulent global environment, as a result of the country’s strategic choice for economic development through deeper global integration, combined with domestic reforms.\n“To realise its ambition of becoming an upper middle income country by 2030, Việt Nam needs to make social upgrades\xa0in tandem with economic upgrades,” said the head of ILO Việt Nam. “Fortunately, the country is taking bold and right steps by upskilling its workforce, by extending coverage of social protection, and by modernising its industrial relations institutions.”\nDelegates shared the view that Việt Nam was benefiting from its young population, with a total of 56 million workers.\nPointing\xa0out the low rate of trained labourers (23 per cent) and bottlenecks in vocational training, they suggested the Government revamp relevant policies in order to encourage businesses to take a more active role\xa0in this regard and promoting\xa0vocational training centres. — VNS'",1

Photo dautucophieu.net\nHÀ NỘI — Profit growth of Vietnamese banks in 2019 is forecast to be lower than last year, but experts say this should not be cause for concern.\nAnalysts from the Viet Dragon Securities Company (VDSC) say despite the dip compared to 2018, results are still positive.\nIn a banking industry report released recently, analysts attributed the slowdown to reduction in income from interest of loans and net profit margin (NIM) ratio.\nAccording to the report, the NIM ratio will decline due to the pressure for banks to raise medium and long-term capital to meet a State Bank of Việt Nam’s strict regulations.\nThose regulations have seen a reduction in the ratio of short-term capital used for medium- and long-term loans from 45 per cent to 40 per cent from early 2019 and raising the capital adequacy ratio to prepare for applying international banking standards Basel II from early 2020.\nThe NIM reduction was also forecast as the proportion of retail outstanding loans at banks is high and competition in retail lending increasing.\nAnother factor is that banks’ provision expenses for risky loans continue to be high, especially in banks, such as BIDV, Vietinbank, VPBank, TPBank and HDBank, whose non-performing loans are still kept at the Việt Nam Assets Management Company (VAMC).\nAccording to VDSC, banks’ profitability will be also affected adversely as banks’ irregular non-interest income, including from the signing of life insurance contracts and divestments, will be no longer abundant as previously.\nThe VDSC analysts also forecast local banks will face risks in 2019.\nConsumer finance is a business segment that shows saturation in demand that makes loan growth difficult. It will increase the competition and difficulties in the business segment if there are new entrants to take part in the market and the competent authorities tighten management regulations on the segment.\nAs the proportion of retail outstanding loans continues to increase, in which the housing loans are still dominant, banks would face more risks if the real estate industry falls into a downward cycle, according to the report. — VNS'",2

The plan is\xa0to hold another prequalification in October and results are expected to be released by 2020,” he added.\nĐặng Đại, deputy head of the Việt Nam Association of Financial Investors, said that domestic investors have\xa0the appropriate\xa0capacity and the construction techniques to carry out\xa0the project.\n“Domestic investors only need to pay attention to the capital for\xa0eight eastern sections in which the State commits to ensure 30 per cent of the total investment capital. Therefore, investors are responsible for 20 per cent, so the rest can be mobilised from loans. Domestic investors definitely can fund the 20 per cent. For technical issues, many of them have carried out\xa0expressway, bridge and tunnel projects, which have shown\xa0their capability,” Đại said.\nTransport expert Nguyễn Xuân Thuỷ said that domestic investors should be given priority for the key national projects like the North-South Expressway to ensure quality and reduce costs.\n“Only a few\xa0international investors joined the bidding because\xa0they may have not\xa0met the criteria or they were concerned about\xa0issues related to\xa0procedures, capital, interest, and other matters. Also, the project might not be attractive enough for them,” said Thuỷ.\nSince domestic investors would likely\xa0face\xa0financial challenges, he recommended that\xa0they cooperate with others.\n“Large Vietnamese corporations\xa0such as Vingroup, Sun Group and\xa0T&T can work\xa0with road construction companies to\xa0have sufficient\xa0financial resources\xa0and\xa0at the same time meet standards related to\xa0experience,"" Thuỷ said.\nThe eastern section of the expressway will be\xa0654km long and have total investment of VNĐ118.7 trillion (US$5.1 billion), including VNĐ55 trillion ($2.36 billion) allocated from the State budget.\nIt will run through 13 provinces and cities from the northern province of Nam Định to the southern province of Vĩnh Long.\nThe highway is divided into 11 sub-projects, including eight under\xa0PPP investment. —\xa0VNS'",1

All local people must also be able to enjoy the fruits of tourism development for what they have contributed.\nReferring to Lào Cai\'s Sa Pa as the ""town in the mist,” PM Phúc remarked that aside from world-renowned tourist attractions in coastal localities, with the huge potentials of northern mountainous provinces such as Lào Cai, Việt Nam could make a name for itself in mountain tourism globally.\nIn addition, the PM urged the province to sustainably develop local traditional industries, like the making of steel billets, cement, kaolin, and yellow phosphorus, saying the Government does not welcome investors in mining with a short-term vision, outdated technology and small-scale production that may hamper environmental sustainability while contributing little to economic growth and improving local incomes.\nHe also underlined the need to intensify prevention of illegal mineral exports and revoke inefficient mining projects.\nThe leader moved on to talk about Lào Cai’s promising agriculture, highlighting seven crops set to grow on large-scale specialised farms, including high-quality rice, specialty rice, medicinal herbs, vegetables, high-quality tea, tropical fruits, temperate fruits and flowers.\nIf advanced techniques and technologies are applied, average agricultural revenue can reach VNĐ120-150 million (US$5,160-6,450) per hectare and possibly up to VNĐ300 million per hectare or more in the next few years, he said.\nPhúc suggested Lào Cai develop agriculture on three pillars – organic and clean farming, use of high technology in production and processing, and linkages in value chains.\nHe asked the province to improve accessibility of land and information for businesses and enhance quality of business support services while investing more in vocational education and human resources quality, taking advantage of its central location on the Kunming (China)-Lào Cai-Hà Nội-Hải Phòng-Quảng Ninh economic corridor.\nThe Vietnamese Government leader also sent a message to investors, saying all investors to Lào Cai in particular and the Northwest region in general are appreciated as, in spite of this land’s great potential, local people struggle to make ends meet and infrastructure is poor in many areas.\n“Each penny from the investor, each livelihood or job created is valuable. Business aside, what matters is the thought towards the society, the country and the people,” he said.\nHe wanted the investors to honour their commitments and make a worthy contribution to the local economy, not only helping create employment but also improve incomes, productivity and social welfare for local people.\nThe event, themed ‘Lào Cai – A Destination of Success’, brought together over 500 delegates, many of whom were representatives from major groups and enterprises at home and overseas.\nLater at the conference, Lào Cai signed cooperation agreements with 11 partners, worth over VNĐ124 trillion ($5.3 billion) and presented decisions approving investment for eight projects worth VNĐ22 trillion (US$1 billion).\nThese projects are expected to commence between 2019 and early 2020.\nDuring 2004-18, Lào Cai attracted 618 domestic projects worth VNĐ93 trillion, while licencing 29 foreign-funded projects worth $574.7 million.\nStriving for top 15\nLater on Saturday,\xa0the Government leader had a meeting with the Lào Cai Government, where he asked that Lào Cai would soon\xa0to be named among top 15 developed localities in Việt Nam.\nAt the meeting, Đặng Xuân Phong, Chairman of the Lao Cai People’s Committee, informed the PM on the province’s recent socio-economic development.\nIn the first six months of 2019, its Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) grew 10.02 per cent. The province welcomed nearly 3 million tourists, generating an annual revenue increase of over 20 per cent for the local tourism sector. Lào Cai\xa0fulfilled 60 per cent of its budget collection target.\nParticipating officials proposed the PM and Government direct the local building of special mechanisms to support investment in infrastructure.\nThey recommended the Government continue selecting the Lào Cai\xa0border gate economic zone to be among key zones of its kind for 2021-25,\xa0build a bridge crossing the Red River in Bát Xát District’s Bản Vược\xa0Commune to connect Việt Nam with\xa0China, and invest in the construction of the Lào Cai-Hà Nội-Hải Phòng railway.\nAgreeing with a number of such proposals, including the building of the bridge, PM Phúc said he asked relevant ministries and agencies\xa0to assist Lào\xa0Cai in carrying out these projects in line with regulations.\nDuring his trip to the northern border province, PM Phúc also paid a visit to Trần Thị Don, wife of war hero Phạm Ngọc Tuy and the family of war invalid Bùi Xuân Xanh, on the occasion of the 72th anniversary of War Invalids and Martyrs Day (July 27). — VNS'",0

But in our country, not many people have the same conditions and facilities"".\n“So, that\'s how I came up with an idea to collect discarded materials to create models that could demonstrate theories in physics. The models inspire students to explore and study this subject,"" he said.\nThiệu has used homemade pulleys and cardboard to make a pendulum clock; a lawn mower to power a bicycle; cardboard and ice cream sticks for a machine that demonstrates leverage theory by shooting marbles; and a mirror to explain animation theory through refraction.\n""I used to be a student, so I understand that theories in textbooks are too academic and don\'t interest students, so that\'s why I wanted to make models with discarded materials so that any student could make them. This will help them become more interested in the subject.”\n“If more expensive materials are used, it may be unfair for some students who are passionate about the subject but don\'t have enough money. ""\nNgô Văn Thiệu, a physics teacher, uses his model of a pendulum clock made from homemade pulleys and cardboard to explain the theory of pendulum motion to his students. – VNS Photo Xuân Đăng\nThiệu collects materials from the school playground, flea markets and other sources where he finds discarded items.\n“I collect lollipop and ice cream sticks, and bottle caps at school playgrounds, or ask for used electrical motors and electrical wires at auto repair shops,” he said.\nThanks to the models, he can easily teach students theories about optical, mechanical and electrical effects.\nHis other aim is to show students that the knowledge they learn at school can be applied to a number of fields.\nHis student, Phạm Ngọc Thạch, said the models he made had helped him understand lessons on pendulum and oscillation theories.\nAnother student, Trần Anh Minh, said: ""Because our teacher uses the models in class, I find that the lessons from the textbooks are easier to grasp, and they help me see the practical aspect more clearly.""\nThiệu said: “The press says that I am an environmentalist, but I don\'t think I’m that great. I just want my students to be successful in the future. That is why I made these models.""\nAs the head teacher of physics at the high school, he has worked with other teachers to organise many creativity contests for students.\n“There is no greater happiness for a teacher than to watch students passionately discuss a solution and have passion about learning. It also motivates me to keep trying, and to do more for them,"" Thiệu said.\n“I also receive a lot of support from my family and other teachers at the school, which motivates me to continue the work,"" he added.\nIn March next year, Thiệu will reach retirement age.

Permeable fabric or fine nets were installed outside the barrier to hold the soil.\nThe barriers also cushion the banks from ripples and waves caused by travelling boats.\nCajuput and other plants that grow in water were then planted inside the barriers so that their roots bind the soil against erosion.\nThey cost VNĐ350 million (US$15,000).\nTheir cost per metre was only VNĐ400,000 ($17) compared to VNĐ60 million ($2,580) for concrete embankments, according to the sub-department.\nBesides, the trees planted in them generate an income of VNĐ700,000 – 900,000 ($30 - 38) per metre in three or four years’ time.\nThe province then built another 25 kilometres of similar embankments last year and 143 kilometres so far this year.\nIn Búng Tàu Town in Phụng Hiệp, some 100 households along the Búng Tàu and Ngang canals have built these embankments near their houses.\nCao Văn Bồi, who built a 30-metre embankment in front of his house in Búng Tàu’s Tân Phú A2 Hamlet, said many large boats traverse the canal, and without something to block them, the waves caused by the boats hit the canal banks and cause erosion.\n“The embankment helps stabilise the bank.”\nBesides cajuput, Bồi has also planted spotted mangroves in the embankment. He grows water hyacinth in the canal to absorb the energy of the waves until his plants grow large enough.\nTrần Thanh Oai, chairman of the Búng Tàu Town People’s Committee, said locals have built 2,000 metres of embankment under the guidance of officials.\nThe cost is borne by the locals themselves in some places.\nThe town plans to build more embankments and also instruct residents in building them, Oai said.\nTrần Thanh Toàn, head of the sub-department, said the embankments are a sustainable solution since they offer reliable protection and are cheap and environment-friendly.\nTheir use should be widely and regularly propagated to educate officials at all levels and the public, he said.\nThe province has a dense network of rivers and canals extending nearly 3,500 kilometres.\nIt has suffered from nearly 250 cases of erosion in the last five years, losing 25,000sq.m of land.\nTrương Cảnh Tuyên, deputy chairman of the People’s Committee, said the province has also built concrete embankments, but their high cost is an inhibiting factor, he said.\nThe earthen embankment is an appropriate solution and the province would expand its use, he added. \xa0VNS'",1

VNA/VNS Photo Xuân Khu\nAN GIANG Lieutenant Colonel Vũ Trọng Tuệ still remembers one of his first investigations into drug trafficking as a member of the Southern Border Guard Soldiers’ Department of Drug and Crime Prevention.\nIt was almost 10 years ago when the Southern Border Guard Soldiers team learned some\xa0traffickers planned to transport drugs in a seven-seat car and decided to chase after the criminals, after two prior failed attempts to apprehend the group.\nIn April 2010, in\xa0Ninh Thuận Province the traffickers realised they were being followed and suddenly changed direction towards Phan Rang City.\nNo matter how crowded National Highway No 1 was, the traffickers drove very fast, sometimes at\xa0100km per hour and shot at the soldiers, Lieutenant Colonel Tuệ recalled.\nThe criminals drove for 30km and abandoned the car when encountering a road without an exit in Bảo An Ward, Phan Rang.\nIt was not until 1pm the next day that the soldiers found\xa0where the traffickers were hiding, arrested them and seized 20 bricks of heroin. Two police officers and one sniffer dog were injured in the firefight with the criminals.\nFor Lieutenant Colonel Tuệ and his colleagues, the case coded 909C was a difficult one as the team had failed to catch the traffickers on\xa0their first two attempts.\nNo matter how difficult it was, the team did not give up;\xa0they never do.\nColonel\xa0Nguyễn Trường Thọ, investigation assistant of the team, said case 909C taught soldiers lessons on selecting the right time to attempt to strike, preparation and working with other units.\nHot spots of drug trafficking\nDrug trafficking around Việt Nam's borders has become more complicated as the country has become a transit hub for traffickers.\nAccording to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 80 per cent of drugs brought into Việt Nam are bound for another country.\nBorder guard soldiers in the south have to be vigilant at all\xa0times to protect the border\xa0from local and foreign drug traffickers.\nThe number of drug trafficking cases at the end of 2018 and in the first months of 2019 in southern localities has reportedly risen, especially after northern and central localities stepped up a crackdown on drug traffickers.\nMore and more drug traffickers have fled to the south and Cambodia to produce synthetic drugs, set up drug trafficking rings\xa0and transport\xa0drugs from Cambodia to Việt Nam\xa0for local consumption or to ship elsewhere.\nForty provinces and cities in the south share more than 1,100km border with Cambodia and have nearly 50 international borders.\nThat makes the fight against drug trafficking tough for southern border guard soldiers.\nAccording to the Southern Border Guard Soldiers’ Department of Drug and Crime Prevention, in the first six months of this year, border guard soldiers nationwide tackled 482 drug-related cases involving 746 criminals and seized more than 2.1 kg of drugs. The number of cases increased by 142 per cent compared to the same period last year.\nOn the Việt Nam-Cambodia border, 60 people were arrested in 32 cases, with more than 129kg of drugs of different types seized.\nMajor General Nguyễn Hoài Phương, deputy commander of the Southern Border Guard Soldiers, said drug trafficking was predicted to get more complicated with more hot spots in the south.\nCities, big trade centres\xa0and transport links between Cambodia and Vietnamese southern provinces facilitate large numbers of people and goods crossing the border.\nThis had become a big challenge for border authorities, he said.\nThe Southern Border Guard Soldiers’ Department of Drug and Crime Prevention is a leading agency in the fight against drug trafficking in the south.\nColonel Nguyễn Trọng Việt, deputy head of the department, said drug traffickers were dangerous and had experience of fleeing authorities,\xa0and some were even\xa0armed.\n“The investigation is complicated and requires soldiers to spend time and effort. With professional skills, the border guard soldiers must be careful and follow laws because drug trafficking cases across borders involve foreign factors,” he said.\nAfter identifying suspects, the soldiers report to the department and start an investigation if approved. The soldiers work with agencies to probe how drugs are transported, set up plans and select the right time to catch the traffickers.\nOver the past 10 years, the team has tackled about 200 cases, arresting more than 400 criminals\xa0and seizing drugs and other exhibits including petrol, natural resources, guns and explosives.\nOn May 24, 2018, the team worked with HCM City’s police to arrest 10 drug traffickers and seized 39 bricks of heroin, 26kg of meth and more than 100,000 synthetic drug tablets.\nIn March this year, the team worked with police and customs to arrest 11 traffickers transporting 300kg of meth and expanded investigation to seize 276kg of meth to be transported to a third country.\nThe fight against drug traffickers is never easy and many soldiers have shed blood in the battle. Since the team was established in 2009, six soldiers have died on duty and\xa0hundreds of others have been injured.\nAccording to Lieutenant Colonel Nghiêm Nam Phong, deputy head of the department’s investigation group No1, the soldiers need to be not only determined and brave but also creative. The most\xa0dangerous time is when the investigators secretly follow the traffickers and wait for an opportunity to arrest them.\n“They need to be not only skilful at their professional skills but also brave enough to overcome challenges and not succumb to temptations such as bribes from\xa0the criminals.” VNS\nSoldiers arrest a trafficker and drugs in May 2019.

In addition, the mechanism which controls the incomes of people holding powers at different levels as well as the publicity and transparency of assets should be improved.\nThe ministry also suggested that Government issue regulations on the coordination between judiciary bodies, including the one between law enforcement, the Natural Resources and Environment Division and land registration offices to resolve difficulties for those who want to purchase and sell property in accordance with judgment execution.\nAt the meeting, Dũng asked MONRE to continue reviewing shortcomings in the ministry’s operation and set forth solutions for better coordination with relevant agencies and localities to improve the effectiveness in acquiring assets in land-related cases.\nInternational cooperation\nInternational judicial cooperation in criminal asset recovery was the main topic\xa0discussed at a workshop held the same day by the PCC’ Commission for Internal Affairs.\nParticipants at the workshop pointed out that the reclamation of property originated from criminal acts in Việt Nam encountered many difficulties as the amount of money recovered was still low and a lot of cases dragged for a long time but didn’t bring about any results.\nAccording to Lê Tiến, head of the Department of International Coopration and Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matter under the Supreme People’s Procuracy, it was necessary for Việt Nam to consider the building\xa0a law on legal assistance specifically in criminal matters that is separate from the 2007 Law on Legal Assistance in order to improve the efficiency of the work.\nThis was supposed to clearly define the authorisation, procedures involved in asking foreign agencies to verify, block off, retrieve and transfer property gained from criminal acts orginated in Việt Nam to Vietnamese Government. A mechanism on information sharing and coordination with relevant agencies in foreign countries should also be determined.\n“In the long-term, the building of a law on retrieving property gained from criminal activities is a must,” Tiến said.\nNguyễn Tuấn Khanh, deputy head of Strategy and Inspectorate Science Institute under the Government Inspectorate, suggested that in addition to signing or supplementing agreement on mutual or multilateral legal assistance on acquiring corruption assets, it was necessary to accomplish criminal law and criminal procedure.\nNguyễn Thái Học, deputy head of PCC’s Commission for Internal Affairs, touched upon loose coordination between relevant agencies and stressed the need to respect and understand international law and standards in the work. — VNS'",0

4844,'Why 13 really is unlucky for American women',"'The USA women’s team celebrate their fifth goal, or maybe it was their eighth. Or twelfth. — AFP Photo\nBy Paul Kennedy\nSukanya Chor Charoenying may be only 31 years old but she is already a world record holder. And it will take some doing for her to lose her prize.\nSadly for Sukanya it is a world record she neither wanted nor will ever boast about. It’s unlikely you’ll find her dining out on such a global achievement and the quicker someone beats her achievement and takes away said world record, the sooner\xa0she will breathe a huge sigh of relief.\nSukanya Chor Charoenying is the goalkeeper for the Thailand national women’s football team and she holds the record for conceding the most ever goals in a single game during a World Cup tournament.\nIt was 13 in all\xa0last week at the hands of a ruthless and rampant USA team that showed little mercy and, in some quarters, have been criticised for not knowing when to stop.\nBut I’m not really seeing a problem here. Sure, Sukanya may be feeling a little down but I’m sure there’s a bevy of advertising agencies hovering in Thailand waiting to sign her up.\nAs for the USA team, favourites to lift the prize, well they just did what they are paid to do, and that is where the problem lies.\nIf you are a professional footballer, scoring in the World Cup finals is what dreams are made of. Each American player who bagged a goal\xa0–\xa0for the record seven did with Alex Morgan grabbing five of them\xa0–\xa0fulfilled their childhood dreams.\nBut what the emphatic win has also done is raise the ugly issue of gender inequality. The women’s team has won the World Cup three times, compared to the men who haven’t, and probably never will, win the competition.\nTheir best ever finish was third, in 1930.\nYet despite the fact that the men’s team is nothing short of bang average, below average in fact, they are paid a huge amount more than their successful female counterparts.\nIn March this year, every member of the U.S. women\'s team filed a lawsuit against the\xa0soccer federation for gender discrimination.\nIt stipulates that currently, if\xa0each team played and won 20 exhibition games in a year, “female WNT players would earn a maximum of $99,000 or $4,950 per game, while similarly situated male MNT players would earn an average of $263,320 or $13,166 per game.""\nBreak that down and effectively the women earn just 38 per cent\xa0of what the men do. And it seems it is not just America where the women earn considerably less than the men playing football at the international level.\nThis year’s Women\'s World Cup in France sees a total prize pot of around US$30 million for all 24 teams with the winners, probably the US, walking away with a total of $4 million.\nThat may be double what was on offer in the last tournament but it pales into insignificance compared to the men. In 2018 the total prize fund for the World Cup was, wait for it, $400 million.\nSo you can understand the women being a little miffed to say the least. They are the current defending champions of the biggest prize in women’s world football and the men didn’t even qualify for the last World Cup.\nThis problem is nothing new.\nIn 1996, American soccer authorities promised bonuses to the women’s team but only if it won the gold medal in that year’s Olympics, but not a silver or bronze.\nThe head of the US soccer federation said at the time: “We cannot reward mediocrity.”\nMeanwhile the men’s team in that particular Olympics were given a bonus for each match they won. For the record they won one;\xa0the women’s team secured gold.\nIf the men played the women I’d like to see who would win. Sure, physically speaking the men’s team is far superior and should overcome the ladies but in their own categories\xa0it is the women who are much better.\nSukanya Chor Charoenying is probably not feeling her best right now, but if the powers that be in world football do finally take their fingers out of their backsides and pay female athletes what they deserve them maybe, just maybe Sukanya might feel that little bit better. — VNS'",3
5742,'Clean-up success at lead recycling village',"'Paving stones are doubled up to contain the deadly soil. – Photo courtesy of Centre for Environment and Community Development\nViet Nam News\nKhánh Dương\nHƯNG YÊN — After a hard day’s work,\xa0labourers in the lead recycling industrial area of Chỉ Đạo Commune in northern Hưng Yên Province are required to leave their contaminated clothes at work, bathe and then change into clean clothes in a changing room before going home. The hygiene helps eliminate lead contamination that may affect other people.\nThe separate\xa0industrial zone was created by moving all lead recycling households out of\xa0Đông Mai Village by the end of 2015.\nLead was recycled in the residential area of Đông Mai Village for more than 40 years. Residents were surrounded by piles of batteries that were broken up and smelted down for their lead content.\nChemicals were directly discharged into the environment, absorbed into the soil and water sources and diffused into the air.\nA series of health check-ups by scientists showed the lead had serious impacts on human health. A comprehensive study of exposures was conducted by the Health Ministry’s National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health and the University of Washington School of Public Health in 2011.\nAll of the 109 village children tested had lead levels in the blood exceeding 10 µg/dL, a level of concern recorded by the US\xa0Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThirty three out of \xa0the children had blood levels exceeding 45\xa0µg/dL,\xa0which meant that their posisoning had reached a medium or high level.\nThe shocking statistics prompted scientists to take action to save human - and environmental - \xa0health. And they made changes. The changing room for workers was one of their contributions.\nThe intervention was jointly implemented by US and Vietnamese researchers from Pure Earth and Việt Nam’s\xa0Centre for Environment and Community Development between July 2013 and February 2015. Working on a budget\xa0of US$118,750, the project outcomes and follow-up results, released recently, show its sustainability.\nUnder the project, contaminated yards at local homes have been covered with compacted clean soil, alluvial soil, clean sand, paver stones or concrete to isolate the contamination from leaking out and affecting humans and animals.\nThis type of soil mitigation was applied at 49 households highly contaminated with lead. Capping with a clean layer soil of more than 10cm is an internationally accepted approach to dealing with such contamination and has been used in the United States and Australia, according to the research report.\nIn addition to the homes made safe by the project, 47 other home-owners spent their own money following the project’s protocol.\nDương Thị Tơ, director of Centre for Environment and Community Development said: “If all contaminated soils were moved to another place, the process would be enormously costly. We use a simple and\xa0optimal\xa0solution, which is low-cost.”\nAccording to researchers, at the close of the project in 2015, average surface soil-lead concentrations in all 96 targeted yards were confirmed to be below the clean-up threshold value of 100mg/kg.\nThis compares with average soil concentrations of 3,940 mg/kg before the intervention. In 2016, the research team measured 20 randomly selected points in the village and was unable to identify lead in surface soils above the instrument detection limit of 5mg/kg.\nLocal authorities paved village roads using local budget and mobilising funds from enterprises.\nTrịnh Văn Hiến, a resident of Đông Mai Village told Việt Nam News: “Now I feel the air fresher than it was 10 years ago. Main roads, alleys and every local yard look cleaner.”\nPercentage of lead-contaminated children at medium and high level (more than 45 µg/dL) in Đông Mai Village through the years - before and after intervention. – VNS Infographic Khánh Dương\nPositive improvement\nMore importantly, the intervention has resulted in positive reduction in the lead blood levels of local people.\nBlood lead levels in 196 children below six years old fell by an average of 67 per cent from a median of 40.35 µg/dL in late 2013 to 13.3 µg/dL in the middle of 2015.\nLỗ Văn Tùng, vice head of Department for School Hygiene and Health at the National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health, one of the researchers, said that the effort to help locals release the lead in their blood did not end there.\nThe institute, in collaboration with Pectin Technology Company, gave free medicine called Pectin complex to 333 children and 107 labourers in July and August 2016.\xa0“Positive results were seen after two months of taking the medicine,” he said.\nA total of 118 children taking the medicine had their lead levels fall from 20.9\xa0µg/dL to 16.5 µg/dL. And 44 labourers had their lead levels decrease from 43.17µg/dL to 31.55 µg/dL.\xa0Nearly 60 per cent of children and nearly half the labourers who took the medicine said that their health had improved.\nResearchers said that the success of the project was also due to people becoming aware, keeping dust out of their homes and keeping their homes clean.\nBret Ericson, a Pure Earth researcher, said low-cost, rapid and well-coordinated\xa0interventions could be readily applied elsewhere to significantly reduce lead poisoning.\n“I presented the findings recently to the Department of Environment in Bangladesh. We are working with many countries, such as India, trying to replicate the experience from Việt Nam. In Zambia, we applied these lessons recently to protect the health of thousands of people,” Bret said.\nChecking lead level in the soil. — Photo courtesy of Centre for Environment and Community Development\nMore needs to be done\nTùng said that although the environment and health of local residents had been improved, there were still potential health risks from the untreated lead slag dump stored in the village. Technical solutions must be studied to remove this waste.\nWorkers in the industrial area still face the risk of being poisoned with lead and can take lead back home if they do not clean their clothes and shoes carefully.\nThey must strictly follow hygiene regulations at work, use protective equipment, such as specialised masks, boots, follow personal hygiene and change clothes before leaving work. They are absolutely not allowed to smoke, cook or eat at work because these activities create conditions for lead to be distributed, Tùng\xa0said.\n“We also need to assess the long-term impacts of the intervention by testing blood level of vulnerable groups such as residents, workers and children below six years old.”\nDr Dương Khánh Vân, Tùng’s college at the National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health is pushing for the separate lead recycling area to be strictly controlled so that its emissions are not released into the air and waste from the area does not spread. —\xa0VNS'",4

However, this\xa0group has gone quiet in the latter half of this year despite several tides\xa0on the stock market.\nShares in\xa0big companies such as Saigon Securities Inc (SSI), Hồ\xa0Chí\xa0Minh Securities Corp (HCM), VNDirect Securities Co (VND), Vietinbank Securities Co (CTS) and Sài Gòn-Hà Nội Securities Co (SHS) have lost 20-50 per cent of their value this year.\nSSI, Việt Nam’s biggest brokerage company, plunged 26.5 per cent this year, sliding from nearly VNĐ27,000 (US$1.16) to around VNĐ20,000 this week.\nHCM has also lost more than 50 per cent, closing Tuesday at VNĐ22,800.\nThe securities business is heavily affected by market movements. In an uptrend period, companies can earn big profits from margin lending, brokerage services or self-investment activities. By contrast, they can also incur losses during a\xa0bearish market.\nDespite falling from the 1,000-point landmark in November, Việt Nam’s benchmark VN-Index has increased nearly 8 per cent so far this year. However, cash inflow has been slow and\xa0affected brokerage and margin lending at\xa0securities companies,\xa0dragging on\xa0their business results.\nHSC reported net profit of just VNĐ305 billion ($13 million) in the first nine months of this year, just half recorded\xa0in the same period of last year.\nEnding September, SSI’s post-tax profit had\xa0decreased 44 per cent on-year to VNĐ644 billion. SSI is also seeking shareholders’ approval to adjust its profit and revenue targets down this year to VNĐ1.1 trillion and VNĐ2.95 trillion, respectively, equivalent to decreases of 35.3 per cent and 21.9 per cent.\nProfits of others such as VNDirect, Sài Gòn-Hà Nội and Vietcombank Securities also declined.\nBesides, Vietnamese securities firms must compete with foreign-invested companies, especially those from\xa0 South Korea. There are six Korean-invested securities companies operating in Việt Nam:\xa0including KIS, Mirae Asset, Pinetree (previously known as HFT), KB Securities Vietnam, Shinhan Vietnam and NH Securities VN.\nWith strong financial backing, Korean investors have quickly increased their charter capital and become a formidable competitor for\xa0domestic firms.\nMirae Asset Securities in September approved a\xa0plan to\xa0raise\xa0its charter capital from VNĐ4.3 trillion to VNĐ5.5 trillion ($237 million), which will make it the second biggest securities company in Việt Nam (after SSI which is also planning to increase charter capital to more than VNĐ6 trillion through dividend payments).\nKIS Securities also has a charter capital of nearly VNĐ2 trillion.\nAfter being acquired by Hanwha Investment & Securities Co Ltd, Pinetree Securities also hiked its capital by six times, from VNĐ100 billion to VNĐ600 billion.\nPumped by big money, margin lending at\xa0these companies has\xa0developed strongly. The outstanding value of margin loans at\xa0Mirae Asset Securities has increased to VNĐ6.6 trillion, for the first time surpassing leading domestic securities firms – SSI with VNĐ5.31 trillion and HSC with VNĐ4.67 trillion.\nMargin loans of other Korean companies also increased such as KIS (VNĐ2.64 trillion), KB Securities Vietnam (VNĐ1.8 trillion), not much inferior to large domestic firms such as VNDirect (VNĐ2.95 trillion), Vietcombank Securities (VNĐ2.9 trillion) and MB Securities (VNĐ2.4 trillion).\nThe third-quarter top 10 biggest brokerage firms on the Hồ Chí Minh and Hà Nội stock exchanges also saw the presence of Mirae Asset and KIS.\nSome companies are competing with zero fee policies offered by\xa0Pinetree with free lifetime transactions or Vietnam Cyberspace Securities Technology. Vietnamese companies – AIS Securities and VPBank Securities – have also introduced zero fee transactions for new investors for a certain period of time.\nIn South Korea, deposit interest\xa0rates are currently low at about 1-2\xa0per cent, so margin lending is an effective investment.

Ethereum is the leader of a new era of smarter and more complex blockchain technology and its open-source nature enables developers to create and publish decentralized apps for value transfer, social media, email, e-voting and other applications with great transparency. Buterin attended the University of Waterloo but dropped out in 2014, and went on to establish Ethereum Foundation, which launched a development project with over 30,000 bitcoins raised from its initial coin offering (ICO).\nThe economic war between the US\xa0and China is getting worse. The tit-for-tat began with a tariff and non-tariff barrier building, expanding into attacks and counterattacks even on individual companies. Now the two economic powers are almost at all-out war in economic fronts. The point is that the G2 war not only negatively impacts the two countries themselves but also threaten the whole global economy. For example, South Korea, which is heavily dependent on international trade, can be a victim of the war.\nThe trade spat will be discussed by two renowned scholars who represent their respective country: Niall Ferguson, senior fellow of Harvard University, and Justin Yifu Lin, professor of National School at Peking University. They will diagnose the nature of the G2 war and outline how it will develop. They are also expected to propose a solution to end the standoff.\nThe World Knowledge Forum this year will also provide a platform for a rich and stimulating political debate and this time will involve a close aide to President Donald Trump and a front-runner in the opposition camp regarding the US presidential election next year. David Urban, Chair of American Battle Monuments Commission, who helped spearhead Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state, and Bob Woodward, WP Associate Editor and author of his new book “Fear: Trump in the White House” will face off in this session.\nDavid Urban who joined the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1982 is Trump’s inner circle along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Mark Esper. Urban who is confident about Trump’s second-term win is expected to lay out the vision and policy direction of the Trump administration for the second term in office. Bob Woodward, an outspoken critic of President Trump, published the non-fiction book last year to reveal in unprecedented detail the harrowing life inside Donald Trump’s White House and how he makes decisions on major policies.\nOne of this year’s key differentiating factors for the World Knowledge Forum lies in shedding light on the K-Pop industry. Lee Soo-man, founder and executive producer of SM Entertainment Group, who is a global cultural figure and one of the who’s who behind K-Pop superstars, will be on the podium at the Jangchung Arena on September 25 to take a look at the past achievements and future opportunities in 2020 and beyond. He will also explain in detail the overseas market strategy for SM Entertainment’s new “Avengers” boy group SuperM. SuperM is a seven-member group consisting of SHINee’s Taemin, EXO members Baekhyun and Kai, and NCT members Taeyong, Mark, Ten, and Lucas. — VNS'",1

Photo baodautu.vn\nHÀ NỘI – Việt Nam needs to renew its real estate market to attract more foreign investors and increase the quality of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector, according to experts.\nDirector of Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) Vietnam, Đặng Văn Quang said regulatory reforms will help improve transparency, making Việt Nam\'s real estate market more attractive to foreign investors.\nThis is because finding available land areas for investment will be a challenge for developers and investors next year, he said.\nAuthorities need to continue reforms of administrative procedures to support foreign investors pouring capital to Việt Nam, according to experts.\nWith the Government\'s efforts in proposing, issuing and implementing policies to encourage investment as well as improving the legal framework, investment in Việt Nam\'s real estate market is expected to grow in all segments, especially in FDI capital.\n""The growth is expected to happen in all segments and the industry will be the hottest sector this year, driven by the movement of foreign enterprises to Việt Nam and the positive impact from large trade agreements, like the CPTPP and EVFTA,"" Quang was quoted by the Nhà báo & Công Luận (Journalist and Public Opinion) newspaper as saying.\nAccording to Lê Hoàng Châu, chairman of the HCM City Real Estate Association FDI is really important. As production moves to Việt Nam, capital flows also shift into industrial, offices and housing property. Therefore, enterprises should be encouraged to build cooperative relationships with foreign partners.\nJLL Vietnam’s representative also said foreign investors had continued to show strong interest in Việt Nam\'s real estate market. However, the long approval process for projects might now affect new developments this year and beyond.\nEconomist Nguyễn Trí Hiếu said some local businesses had restructured sharply to list on the stock market and cooperated with many foreign investment funds to take part in project implementation. This showed domestic real estate firms needed foreign capital.\nHowever, Hiếu said that it was still necessary to screen foreign investors because some enterprises that did not have enough capital often asked to reduce the project scale and extend the schedule to keep licences and land use rights.\n""State management agencies need to re-evaluate projects that are slow or withdraw projects to find investors who have sufficient capital and ability, avoiding wasted land and money,"" Hiếu said.\nAccording to Quang Việt Nam is still one of the most popular destinations in Southeast Asia for foreign investors. This is due to the Government\'s investment incentives, political stability and economic growth. Việt Nam has also been proactively improving transparency in the real estate market.\nThe experts said foreign investment had helped the domestic real estate industry witness positive changes, including diversified designs. It had also helped the market be more transparent and increase competitiveness, quality, utilities, services, technology and operational management.\nHowever, merger and acquisition (M&A) deals in the real estate sector have faced difficulties, including a decision to stop the approval of new projects in HCM City to review licensing, according to Quang. This means investment opportunities are lost.\nIn addition, the State Bank of Việt Nam’s tightened capital policies for the real estate market have also affected the M&A deals for domestic investors.\nProperty research and consultancy companies said foreign investors from Japan, Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore have poured the most capital into high-end and luxury apartments.\nAccording to the M&A Vietnam Market Report 2018-19, Japanese investors have been tending to shift their attention from the finance and consumer goods sector to real estate in 2018-19.\nAmong them, the deal between Sumitomo Corporation and BRG Group of Vietnam was granted an investment certificate for the Smart City Project in Đông Anh District, Hà Nội, with total registered capital of US$4.14 billion.\nIn the first eight months of this year, foreign investors poured most into the manufacturing and processing sector totalling $15.7 billion, or 70 per cent of the nation’s total FDI. This was followed by real estate with $2.32 billion or 10 per cent, and the wholesale and retail industry with $1.2 billion or 5.2 per cent, according to the Foreign Investment Agency. - VNS'",2

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI Việt Nam’s fiscal deficit, including principal repayments, would come in at 6.6 per cent of GDP in 2019 and 2020, up from 5.9 per cent in 2018, Fitch Solutions Macro Research forecast.\nIt was revised from 5.7 per cent and 5.8 per cent projected previously.\nAccording to Fitch analysts, this follows a 7.4 per cent deﬁcit based on its estimates (including principal repayments, otherwise 3.2 per cent without according to oﬃcial ﬁgures)\xa0in\xa0the\xa0ﬁrst\xa0half\xa0of\xa02019.\n“We\xa0 expect\xa0 falling\xa0 Vietnamese\xa0 government\xa0 bond\xa0 yields in\xa0 line\xa0 with\xa0 the\xa0 decline\xa0 in\xa0 global\xa0 bond yields to ease growth in interest\xa0 payments\xa0 on\xa0 new\xa0 issuances\xa0 going\xa0 forward.\xa0 However,\xa0 we\xa0 expect\xa0 this\xa0 to\xa0 be\xa0 more\xa0 than\xa0 offset\xa0 by\xa0 increased\xa0 government borrowing to fund key public infrastructure projects to ease the congestion in major cities and\xa0 ports\xa0 exacerbated\xa0 by\xa0 the\xa0 inﬂux\xa0 of\xa0 companies\xa0 relocating\xa0 their operations to Việt Nam as a result of the ongoing US-China trade war,” the analysts said.\nGlobal yields have fallen as a result of a rush to safety amid growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty globally, as well as expectations of further monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve and major global central banks.\nThis\xa0has\xa0supported\xa0a\xa0decline\xa0in\xa0Vietnamese\xa0credit\xa0default\xa0spreads\xa0and\xa0also yields offered on new Vietnamese government bond issuances. Given that risks to the global economy appear to be ﬁrmly weighted to the downside, government bond yields are likely to head even lower over the coming quarters.\n""As such, the continued fall in yields would help to slow the growth in interest payments over the coming years as the government increasingly refinances at a lower cost. That said, while we believe that interest rates are likely to head lower over the long term, we highlight the risk of occasional spikes in interest rates during periods of risk-off sentiment, given Việt Nam’s classification as an emerging market,"" Fitch said.\nHowever, Fitch believes that the positive impact of this on ﬁscal accounts will be outweighed by an increase in government borrowing to expedite key infrastructure projects, which would put upside pressure on interest payments.\nBesides, according to Fitch, evidence has so far shown that Việt Nam is the main beneficiary of the relocation of manufacturing operations out of China.\n“We expect the rush by companies to relocate manufacturing operations from China to Việt Nam to avoid the US’ tariffs on Chinese exports to continue worsening congestion in major cities such as HCM City and Hà Nội, as well as at Việt Nam’s sea ports,” the analysts said, explaining this is because the sheer scale of infrastructure China has built over the years to handle the nation’s manufacturing capacity will be impossible to replicate at short notice. As such, the lack of transport infrastructure in Việt Nam will increasingly become a bottleneck in the supply chain which would drag on the country’s growth potential.\nWhile the authorities have long recognised this problem and laid out plans to enhance Việt Nam’s transport and logistical infrastructure network, progress on the projects have been slow, with the build-up of traﬃc volumes outpacing the construction of new road infrastructure.\nAccording to Fitch, an important point to note is that delays to land acquisition for these projects would also increase project costs for the government as the inﬂux of businesses to the country would increase competition for land, particularly in and around the major cities, putting upside pressure on land prices.

5089,'ASEAN to take immediate steps to combat drought in SE Asia',"'Speakers at the Building Resilience Drought Southeast Asia dialogue held\xa0yesterday in Cần Thơ. VNS Photo Bồ Xuân Hiệp\nBồ Xuân Hiệp\nCẦN THƠ — ASEAN-member countries have vowed to take immediate action to resolve problems caused by worsening drought in Southeast Asia, especially in Việt Nam’s Mekong Delta region, which is especially susceptible to global warming.\nSpeaking at a meeting on Tuesday in Cần Thơ, Intani Nur Kusuma, senior officer at the Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance Division of the ASEAN Secretariat, said that a declaration on drought would be adopted by leaders at the ASEAN Summit to be held in Việt Nam in November next year.\nASEAN has worked closely with relevant sectors to help the ASEAN Committee on Disaster Management draft the declaration, she said, adding that drought-related activities need to be integrated into the future action plan of ASEAN.\nTo mitigate the impact, drought risk assessment and early-warning services should be improved through the sharing of data from space-based technologies.\nRisk-financing instruments as well as improvement of people’s awareness of the effects of drought are also needed.\nTiziana Bonapace, director of the Information and Communications Technology and Disaster Risk Reduction Division of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESACP), told\xa0Việt Nam News: “Climate change has already happened. Now is the time to adapt instead of fighting it.”\n“Southeast Asia is faced with intensification and a changing geography of drought, and of disaster risk in general, as climate change converges with social, environmental and economic stresses.\n“Regional co-operation, especially among nations benefiting from the Mekong River, is needed to support national efforts to manage drought through data, technology, innovations, policy and financing options,” Bonapace said.\n“The best solution is no single solution but a multi-approach solution,” she added. “Negotiations and dialogue are also needed among all the countries involved based on science and technology and evidence.”\n“Our new analysis shows disasters in the region are having more impact than previously thought. Much of the increase is due to the quantification of agricultural drought losses, which was not reported before,” she noted.\nNguyễn Trường Sơn, deputy head of the Việt Nam Disaster Management Authority, said the Mekong Delta and Central Highlands regions were facing abnormal weather that could be attributed to climate change.\nThe Mekong River levels in June and July significantly fell compared to previous years, raising concern of exacerbated drought and saline intrusion for the entire Mekong Delta in the 2019-20 dry season.\nIn the Central Highlands, rainfall in the dry season has dropped considerably compared to previous years, while temperatures have been 0.5-1 degrees Celsius higher than average, sparking serious droughts that have threatened vast tracts of natural forests as well as crops.\nEconomic losses\nNo Southeast Asian country can afford to ignore drought when trying to mitigate the economic impact of natural disasters, according to experts.\nBonapace said the significance of economic losses due to agricultural drought was consistent across all countries for which data is available.\n“The agricultural losses are highest in Indonesia. In Việt Nam, we estimate it to be around US$6.5 billion or 3 per cent of GDP,” she said.\nDisasters continue to erode economic gains. Ultimately this means that disasters will limit the ability of economic growth to eradicate poverty.\n“According to our study, the economic models show that without disasters, Việt Nam is expected to completely eradicate extreme poverty by 2030,” Bonapace said.\nAccording to the Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2019, annual economic losses in Asia Pacific more than quadruple when slow-onset disasters, most notably drought, are added to the region’s disaster risk landscape.\nThe average annual loss for the region is $675 billion, of which $405 billion, or 60 per cent, is drought-related agricultural losses.\nIn Southeast Asia, the average annual loss is higher than the Asia-Pacific regional average, reaching $86.5 billion or 3 per cent of the regional GDP.\nThe average annual loss is highest in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Việt Nam, and the Philippines.\nAccording to the 2019 Report Ready for the Dry Years report, though starting slowly, drought can have a devastating cumulative impact, striking hardest at the poor and heightening inequality and degrading land, all of which increases the prospects of conflict.\nAccording to the report, there will be many more dry years ahead, and the area affected by drought is likely to shift and expand.\nThe report was jointly produced by ESCAP and ASEAN as part of their disaster-risk reduction efforts.\nDying river\nExperts have recently expressed concern about a number of dams impeding the Mekong Delta’s flow, drying up many parts of the once fast-flowing river and leaving the region facing serious drought.\nLê Công Thành, deputy minister of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, said an increasing number of dam constructions in the Mekong River were “posing a great burden on the 4,700-kilometre Mekong River basin, especially on the Mekong Delta”.\nAs a result, millions of people who depend on the river for their livelihoods in Việt Nam, China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand will be seriously affected.\nThe Mekong River Commission, a regional intergovernmental agency that manages the river’s water resources, said that all the “dams in the upstream Mekong River countries contribute to worsening drought in the region”.\nThe river’s water levels last month recorded their lowest level in 60 years. Other estimates suggest that water levels have dropped to their lowest level in a century, the commission said.\nLower freshwater river levels mean that saltwater levels in the delta could rise, threatening rice-growing and agriculture in general, while agriculture irrigated by the river could suffer if nutrient-rich sediment is blocked from flowing downriver by dams.\nThe Mekong River, which originates in China and snakes through five Southeast Asian countries, is emerging as a new security flashpoint, experts have warned.\nThe river begins in the Tibetan Plateau, stretches through much of mainland Southeast Asia, and ends in the Mekong Delta.\nThe one-day Building Resilience Drought Southeast Asia dialogue was co-organised by the Việt Nam Disaster Management Authority, ESCAP, and the ASEAN Secretariat. — VNS\nIntani Nur Kusuma, senior officer at\xa0the Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance Division, speaks at the Building Resilience Drought Southeast Asia dialogue\xa0held yesterday in Cần Thơ.

3807,'Interest rates to be stable till year end',"The central bank is expected to remain on hold over the coming months to observe the impact of its rate cut on the economy before making further adjustments to its monetary policy. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — Interest rates in the domestic market are expected to remain stable until the end of the year, buoyed by good liquidity and proper credit growth, said Phạm Thanh Hà, director of the State Bank of Việt Nam\xa0(SBV)’s Monetary Policy Department.\nAccording to Hà, the pressure on domestic interest rates has eased as central banks in many countries are no longer pursuing tight monetary policies.\nAn SBV decision to cut several key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points from the middle of this month would help credit institutions access more affordable capital from the SBV, in turn enabling the institutions to improve liquidity and keep interest rates stable, Hà said, adding it would help support economic growth.\nThe SBV would continue to monitor local macroeconomic trends and the monetary market to flexibly employ monetary policy instruments, in order to control inflation, stabilise the macro-economy and support economic growth, Hà said, affirming the central bank would maintain a 14 per cent credit growth target for this year.\nThe SBV announced the 0.25 percentage point rate cut from September 16, which would take its refinancing and discount rates to 6 per cent and 4 per cent, from 6.25 per cent and 4.25 per cent previously.\nAccording to Hà, the move is aimed to support liquidity for credit institutions and boost the country’s economic growth.\nHowever, experts said the adjustment was quite low compared to the current loan rates, which poses no major impacts to the deposit and lending rates.\nThe Bảo Việt Securities Company said the SBV’s move is deemed to have orientational and psychological effects, instead of major impacts on the financial market.\nAnalysts from Fitch Solutions expect the central bank to retain a hold over the coming months to observe the impact of its rate cut on the economy before making further adjustments to its monetary policy.\nThis is predicated on Fitch’s view for rate cuts to have a limited effect in boosting growth at this juncture due to an infrastructure deﬁcit in major Vietnamese cities. Moreover, inﬂationary pressures mainly from rising food prices, on the back of the spread of the African swine fever across Việt Nam and also across Asia, would likely also see the SBV favour keeping its interest rates on hold.\n“We expect the rate cut to have a limited impact on raising growth, although we now note that the SBV’s rate cut will pose a slight risk to our 2019 real GDP growth forecast of 6.5 per cent, which we will be looking to review upon the release of the growth print in the third quarter of 2019. Going forward, we forecast growth to strengthen to 6 .8 per cent in 2020,” Fitch analysts told Việt Nam News, explaining that this is because while there have been strong signs of companies shifting their manufacturing operations to Việt Nam amid the ongoing US-China trade war, the rush to relocate has resulted in an infrastructure deﬁcit in the country.\nAccording to Fitch, it is also revising its forecasts for Việt Nam’s inflation to average 2.7 per cent in 2019\xa0and 3.7 per cent in 2020, from 2.9 per cent and 3.3 per cent previously.\n“We expect food and housing construction material inﬂation to increasingly put upside pressure on the headline ﬁgure, although this is likely to be partially offset by weak transport inflation from lower oil prices,” the analysts said.\nIt is expected food inﬂation to pick up over the coming months, as the spread of African swine fever, which has now affected all provinces in Việt Nam and increasing locations around the region, has put pressure on food prices.\nA likely pickup in construction work over the coming months in an attempt to alleviate the infrastructure deﬁcit should also put pressure on construction material costs.\nIn addition, weak global demand due to slowing global growth will likely see oil prices remain subdued over the coming quarters, barring any major supply shocks, and this should see transport inﬂation correspondingly also remain subdued, partially offsetting the inﬂation in food and construction materials. Brent oil prices are forecast to average US$64 per barrel in 2019 and $62 in 2020, below the year-to-date average of $64.9 and a notch below 2018's average of $71.7. — VNS",2

Three- to five-star hotels offered 101,400 rooms. Over 21,000 tour guides have been licensed, and tourism provides an income to some 2.5 million people.\nThe rapid expansion of the high-end hotel segment but without the availability of management experience in the country means international hotel management companies are the only option, and most hotel and resort investors prefer to have leading names.\nNguyễn Việt Thung, vice chairman of TMS Group, said that tie-ups with foreign hotel management brands offer a lot of benefits like prestige, global brands and management skills.\nForeign hotel managers and operators are in turn partial to Việt Nam and like to work in the country because of its culture, beautiful landscapes and comfortable geographic location.\nBut in fact, it is not easy to invite those professional hotel managers to participate in management of hotel projects.\nThat is a good thing since, professionally, famous brands have stringent requirements of tourism properties in terms of location, construction quality, services, and legal and environmental factors, as Empire Group chairman Nguyễn Đức Thành pointed out.\nThey fiercely protect their prestige, he said.\nSome analysts pointed to the fact that foreign hotel management companies often refuse to accept offers from Vietnamese hotels claiming the market is not attractive, owners are inexperienced and hotel designs are unsuitable for their brands’ requirements.\nIs it a good time to buy gold?\nOn November 10, the buying and selling prices of SJC gold were VNĐ41.26 million and VNĐ41.56 million per tael of 37.5 grammes.\nAt Doji, they were VNĐ41.35 and 41.55 million.\nMarket observers said prices dropped by almost VNĐ600,000 on November 7 and have remained there though the fall was not as sharp as in the global market.\nThe corresponding global fall was $60 per ounce, or 3 per cent, to $1,440, the biggest single-day drop in the last two years.\nThe sharp decrease in prices could see individual investors buy gold in the hope to making a quick profit since prices always goes up at the end of the year.\nWhat do experts think?\nThey attributed the price fall to positive information about the China-US trade war.\nOn November 7, the two countries agreed to remove the additional tariffs imposed recently in phases once their leaders sign an interim deal towards ending the costly trade war.\nBritish broadsheet The Guardian said the prospect of an agreement sent stock markets soaring to all-time highs and prompted the International Monetary Fund to say a deal easing trade tensions between the US and China could persuade its officials to revise upward forecasts for global growth next year.\nBut some experts said that it is not easy to make short-term profits on gold now because the trade war is unpredictable and would not cease immediately.\nDr Phan Dũng Khánh of Bizlight Business School said gold prices would possibly fall further to $1,400 by the year end, which would push down Vietnamese prices to VNĐ39-40 million.\nShort-term gold traders should be cautious, he warned. — VNS",2

If the US’s gas prices are competitive, then Việt Nam will import LNG from the US.”\nMarie Damour, the US consul general in HCM City, said Việt Nam's Power Development Plan (PDP-8) presented an opportunity for energy companies to invest in the country.\nDue to Việt Nam's rapid industrialisation and urbanisation, the Government expected electricity consumption to grow by 10-12 per cent annually through 2020, she said.\nTo meet this increasing energy consumption, the country had begun the movement towards LNG, a natural solution to address the country's quickly rising energy demands, she said.\n“Within this sector are American companies that are well known as world leaders for advanced technologies, quality, and experience.\n“As Việt Nam moves closer to utilising LNG as part of its energy portfolio, US companies can help support an energy landscape that is investment rich and energy secure, something in the interest of both Việt Nam and the US.”\nJoe Knierien, executive director of Globalinx Group, the event’s organiser, said US companies were greatly interested in selling and distributing LNG to Việt Nam because they saw great demand in the market.\n“So we would like to have closer collaboration with Vietnamese companies to assist in the development of the energy sector and energy security.\n“We are very interested in investment in developing energy projects here in Việt Nam.”\nHe said his company brought its partners Fluor, Braemar and Emerson, all top LNG companies to Việt Nam to evaluate the opportunities available.\nSỹ said: “Currently the gas market and gas prices in Việt Nam are controlled and regulated by the Government through various decisions depending on the wellhead gas price.\n“By 2025 the Government is trying to open part of the gas market, and after 2025 Việt Nam will try to fully open its gas market.”\nFluor, Braemar and Emerson executives introduced their companies and the solutions and services they provide. — VNS",2

5111,Don't silence the Mekong river,"The Mekong River has too many dams. — Photo\xa0Mekong River Commission\nThu Vân\nLast month, the Mekong River Commission announced the commencement of Prior Consultation for Luang Prabang, the fifth lower Mekong mainstream dam to undergo the process.\nEarlier the same month, Xayaburi Hydropower Project on the Mekong River in northern Laos began operations, funded by Thai companies and banks.\nDozens of hydropower dams have been built on the Mekong and on tributary rivers in Lao territory, many of them funded by foreign countries, with\xa0China providing large loans for dam construction.\nWhile these projects are good for the pockets of firms, they could also mean\xa0bitter consequences for people living downstream – and that includes 20 million Vietnamese people.\nThe fertile Mekong Delta is home to those 20 million people and is the food basket of Việt Nam, producing more than 90 per cent of the country’s rice exports, and providing 75 per cent of its fish.\nBut with upstream countries rushing\xa0to build more hydropower dams, people living downstream have suffered: dams caused the destruction of Mekong migratory fisheries, trapping of sediment, preventing it from travelling downstream, threatening the food and\xa0livelihoods\xa0of populations residing within the river basin.\nAlready battling climate change impacts, which is making the river’s flow\xa0and levels more unpredictable, the Mekong Delta is facing a crisis.\nAccording to a report by the Mekong River Commission, an organisation governed by ministers from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Việt Nam, before the first dam in 1990, the Mekong was releasing 160 million tonnes of sediment on average per year. Now it is only 80 million tonnes per year.\nThe reduced sediments and nutrient flows would adversely decrease agriculture production in the Mekong floodplains as the delta's coastal areas become vulnerable to sea level rises and saline intrusion. The fish catch of Vietnamese coastal fisheries, which strongly depend\xa0on suspended sediment\xa0and associated nutrients deposited by the Mekong, will also be affected.\nLê Anh Tuấn, deputy director of the Research Institute for Climate Change at Cần Thơ University, said dams also contribute to the sinking of deltas.\nWithout sufficient sediment to replenish the land, erosion from the sea on the delta may increase, resulting in serious landslides.\nA total 11 large-scale dams and more than a hundred tributary dams are planned by 2040\xa0to meet power demand.\nThis would cause a further 50 per cent reduction of sediment load.\n“And then the disappearance of Mekong Delta is only a matter of time,” he said.\nThat is not to mention dangerous ventures for countries downstream if they lack adequate planning and readiness for disasters.\nThe collapse of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy dam after heavy rains last year that killed more than 30 in Laos and left thousands of Lao and Cambodian people homeless shows the need for preventing similar tragedies in the future.\nMake a choice\nIn the Luang Prabang project, Vietnamese firm VP Power, is slated to hold a 38 per cent share.\nWith the consultation for the Luang Prabang hydropower dam process ongoing, Việt Nam needs to give it serious thought.\nWhile hydropower projects can promote economic development,\xa0the potential hit to food security and agricultural productivity from decreased sediment flow\xa0will trigger higher poverty levels and climate vulnerability.\nThat, in return, would ultimately depress economic growth in all Mekong countries downstream.\nThe Save the Mekong coalition, a coalition of non-government organisations, community-based groups and concerned citizens within the Mekong region, recently expressed their concern over the Luang Prabang project.\n“We, therefore, call for the Luang Prabang and other planned mainstream dams to be cancelled. Rather than embarking on another flawed Prior Consultation process, we urge lower Mekong governments and the MRC to address outstanding concerns regarding impacts of mainstream dams and to undertake a comprehensive options assessment to study alternatives,” they said in a press release earlier last month.\n“If built, Luang Prabang dam, combined with Pak Beng, Xayaburi and Pak Lay dams, would complete the transformation of the Mekong River along the entire stretch of northern Laos into a series of stepped lakes, resulting in major and irreversible damage to the health and productivity of the river. This means that the wide range of economic and social benefits that the river provides to society will be lost, and the river will become a water channel for electricity generation, primarily benefiting hydropower companies.”\nViet Nam\xa0has already urged Laos to rethink its plans for more dams.\n“Viet Nam wants all upstream Mekong River nations to adopt proper policies in exploiting the river, especially in hydropower dam construction, in order to ensure rights for downstream nations, like Viet Nam,” Vietnamese Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Trần Hồng Hà\xa0said at a 2017 conference.\nMore recently, Việt Nam called for greater attention to exploring renewable energy sources as replacements for hydropower in the Mekong Basin.\nAs a shareholder of the project, Việt Nam will hold three discussion sessions and come up with a final technical report by March 2020.\nIt’s time the country acts in accordance with its previous statement.\nThe Viet Nam National Mekong Committee said in a meeting on Monday that the country would aggressively request Laos investors adjust the design of the dam to minimise negative impacts on downstream areas and to build supervision mechanisms before going on with the dam's construction.\nBut maybe Việt Nam could do more.\nIt’s not only about economic benefits, it’s not only about co-operation. It’s about food security and about life. Switching to less risky renewable energy\xa0is an option. Solar, wind, and biomass power have the potential to replace these dams, and as a country with a lot\xa0to lose from upstream dams, Viet Nam could convince its neighbours to diversify their energy options.\nOnly by doing so, we will not be among those who silence the Mekong river. — VNS",4

He also underlined the need to adhere to international law; bring into play community responsibilities, and promote existing bilateral and multilateral co-operation mechanisms.\n\nAccording to the Vietnamese minister, for regional countries, big or small, to co-operate substantively and sincerely in solving security challenges in the region, trust is vitally important.\n\nThe building and consolidation of trust require time and patience, and trust must be strengthened regularly on the basis of concrete principles and actions, Lịch said, adding that the trust building process needs consistency between words and actions, transparency in policy making and implementation, and the harmonisation of each country’s interests with those of other countries and the region.\n\nAll actions must be in line with principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter, international law and regional commitments, he noted.\n\nThe minister said recent tensions in the East Sea show that once international law is not respected, security and stability are jeopardised.\n\nPeace in the East Sea not only benefits the parties directly concerned but also the region and the world. The settlement of the East Sea issue in a peaceful manner, in a\xa0 partnership spirit and for community responsibility, is the foundation to turn it into a water body of peace, co-operation and development, he added.\n\nLịch also reiterated Việt Nam’s consistent policy of solving the East Sea issue by peaceful means on the basis of international law, and that parties must respect one another’s legitimate and legal interests stipulated in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and avoid actions that may complicate the situation or elevate tensions.\n\nViệt Nam has been working with other ASEAN members and China to build a substantive and effective Code of Conduct (COC) in the East Sea, he noted.\n\nAt the meeting, participants discussed traditional and non-traditional security challenges like terrorism, the reverse effect of technological development, and cybersecurity.\n\nThey also had in-depth discussions on maritime challenges, including those relevant to the East Sea, and affirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the waters to regional and global security.\n\nMany ministers stressed the need to respect international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS, and expressed the hope to soon finalise an effective and substantive COC. — VNS",0

Vân said making decisions on how to fund public investment projects was one of the NA’s key responsibilities.\nDeputy Tôn Ngọc Hạnh from Bình Phước Province said that with the NA’s heavy workload, it would be unrealistic to expect the legislative body to approve and adjust specific funding for as many as 9,000 projects in five years.\nOther lawmakers disagreed, saying the NA’s approval process would not take too much time if the Government makes careful preparations before submitting investment plans.\nUnfocused investment\nDeputy Lê Thanh Vân said the implementation of the mid-term public investment plan had faced difficulties, including a failure to follow public investment law regulations because the Government’s advisory team had not completed all of the tasks assigned by the NA.\nDeputy Nguyễn Thị Quyết Tâm from HCM City proposed the Government attempt to determine whether slow disbursement of public investment funds for key national projects was due to structural problems with the Law on Public Investment or poor implementation of its regulations.\nSpeaking with Vietnam News Agency reporters on the sidelines of the meeting on Tuesday, deputy Nguyễn Đức Kiên from Sóc Trăng Province said the cost overrun of Bến Thành-Suối Tiên metro project in HCM City and the slow disbursement of funds to hospitals in Hà Nội and HCM City showed that the problems lie in unfocused and ineffective implementation of the law rather than any flaw with the law itself.\nAccording to deputy Hoàng Văn Cường from Hà Nội, the Law on Public Investment must prioritise urgent and realistic projects to address transportation problems, support people in mountainous areas and help stabilise lives.\nHe proposed the Government issue a set of quality standards for State budget–invested projects after the revised law is passed. Localities which meet the criteria would be selected to receive public investment.\nThe criteria would help avoid wasteful spending, select suitable projects and assess their efficacy after they are complete, he said.

Phúc also mentioned the case of Ba Vàng Pagoda in Quảng Ninh Province, where tens of thousands of worshippers paid up to thousands of dollars each to have their “bad karma” removed.\n“Is this alarming? What are the responsibilities of the education ministry and localities when it comes to school violence?” Phúc said.\n“Ministries and authorities need to address this issue so it does not lead to public outcry. Stronger solutions are needed,” he said.\nThe PM said while economic development was of great importance, it was also necessary for authorities to focus more on social problems.— VNS'",0

This was an important political event for the country, and the NA leader noted it was highly valued by voters and the public in general.\nMeanwhile, the NA ratified the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and related documents, making Việt Nam the seventh country to do so. The deal shows the political determination of the Party and State to actively integrate into the region and the world, she said.\nThe sixth session, which took place during October and November last year, was the mid-term meeting of the NA. At the session, the deputies cast votes of confidence on 48 officials holding positions elected or approved by the NA.\nNA Chairwoman Ngân underlined that this was an extremely important supervision action, demonstrating confidence in the officials subjected to the vote and providing a fair assessment of their efforts and performances.\nLast year was also a successful one for external parliamentary activities. The NA showed its active engagement in inter-parliamentary forums in the region and the world, contributing to the achievements in the country’s foreign relations.\nIn 2018, Việt Nam assumed the position as Vice Chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).

The strategy, which has a vision until 2050, \xa0identifies three key tasks – reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting clean and renewable energy, and practising environmentally-friendly production and consumption.\nThe meeting heard that five ministries and 30 cities and provinces in the country had formulated action plans on green growth and were implementing them.\xa0— VNS'",4

Districts will have to identify the number of vehicles to be converted in the area before implementing the plan.\nFrom 2022 to 2025, private garbage collectors\xa0in suburban districts should change all their vehicles to meet the city’s standard.\nThe city's\xa0People's Committee has assigned the Department of Finance and Department of Planning and Investment to provide authorised capital from\xa0the Environmental Protection Fund to ensure that there is enough\xa0money to change the vehicles.\nThe department of Natural Resources and Environment will continue to work with SAMCO on\xa0solutions to upgrade garbage collection vehicles.\nIn addition, the city department will continue to shift\xa0the formal operational mode of\xa0private waste collectors\xa0to cooperative units.\nNguyễn Toàn Thắng, director of the department, said that\xa0more than 1,000 to\xa02,500 private collectors had not changed to official cooperative units.\nAfter completing the plan to merge private units with\xa0cooperatives, waste collection fees would be collected\xa0by districts, not by individuals.\xa0This\xa0aimed to\xa0protect private collectors’ incomes and ensure that bidding for rubbish collection and transportation services would be done properly.\nIn addition, the city’s Department of Transport had directed district\xa0authorities to review domestic waste-gathering sites\xa0to arrange collection times and\xa0to avoid collection during peak\xa0traffic\xa0hours.\nThe department was also considering providing\xa0warning signs and reflective clothing to\xa0sanitation workers and vehicles to ensure safety, he said.\nThe city currently has two main garbage collection systems, including the city’s Urban Environment Co\xa0Ltd\xa0and private garbage collectors.\nThe city generates more than 9,000 domestic solid waste\xa0per day, and\xa0the volume has risen\xa0by 5-6 per cent per annum in recent years.\nMore than 60 per cent of rubbish is\xa0collected by private garbage collectors\xa0who mostly work in narrow alleys.

2961,"'Pork trading floor to eliminate intermediaries, benefit farmers, consumers'","Nguyễn Nguyên Phương. — Photo sggp.org.vn\nNguyễn Nguyên Phương, head of the HCM City’s Department of Industry and Trade’s trading management division, speaks to Sài Gòn Giải Phóng (Liberated Sài Gòn ) newspaper about the necessity of a pork trading floor\xa0in the city.\nWhy is the Department of Industry and Trade setting up the pork trading floor now?\nPork ranked second in terms of demand among food items in the city. The city consumes more than 10,000 pigs a day.\nHowever, there are still many difficulties in this sector such as poor management and the traditional nature of the pork trading market with small farms and manual slaughter.\nPork must go through many intermediaries to reach customers, causing high prices.\nBased on projects such as for tracing pork origin and building a safe food supply chain in the Southern Key Economic Region, we found that \xa0production and processing of agricultural products and foods have great potential for growth.\nSo the Department of Industry and Trade sought permission from the People's Committee to trial a pork trading floor before replicating it for other agricultural products and foodstuffs.\nIn my opinion, its establishment can help the city to meet many objectives at the same time such as restructuring agricultural production, adoption of technology including biotechnology\xa0and market stability.\nCan you describe the organisational structure and operating mechanism of the trading floor?\nIt can operate in the form of a joint stock company like most agricultural trading floors in countries with a similar agriculture sector as Việt Nam’s.\nThe State will only support the setting up and development of the floor initially and issue appropriate regulations.\nIt will monitor and supervise instead of directly investing or managing.\nBuyers and sellers will directly trade while quality inspection of pork after slaughter will be assigned to an independent quarantine unit.\nWith the support of foreign experts, especially from the British and Dutch consulates in the city, the department proposes to study more trading models for pigs and other agricultural products to choose suitable solutions for the city’s model.\nWhat are the likely benefits of this model compared to the current system?\nAccording to the evaluation of research teams, this model will bring great benefit to society as well as all the participants.\nFarmers can deal directly with buyers and decide the selling price without intermediaries. Therefore, farmers can build their brands and know the needs and market demand to have a consistent and steady production and business plan.\nCustomers will be able to buy clean and safe food at [farm] prices without intermediary costs.\nWhat were the difficulties faced by the department in researching and developing this model?\nThe department had difficulty in persuading small farms and manual slaughterhouses to participate.\nHowever, this problem has been solved thanks to the project for tracing pork origin.\nThanks to the direction of the People's Committee and support and co-ordination by related departments, cities in the Southern Key Economic Region and the two wholesale markets of Hóc Môn and Bình Điền, the preparatory steps have gone smoothly.\nCan you tell us about the schedule for the project?\nWe expect that by the end of 2020 specific models will be proposed as well as complete preparatory steps for pilot operation in early 2021. —VNS",2

Some of them even threatened the lives of relatives if the person refused to pay what they owed.\n“Their activities are troublesome for the people and the society but it is difficult for the police to handle the cases,” Ngọc said.\n“Debt collection is regulated and seen as a conditional business activity but the fact is we lack clear, tight standards for the action, making it easier for moneylenders turn into ‘black creditors’.\n“If the amended Law of Investment regulates debt collection as one of the forbidden items, it will help authorities prevent loan shark lending and all relevant activities will be handled,” he said.\nDeputy Trương Trọng Nghĩa from HCM City said it was useless for both lenders and borrowers to bring the case to the court because no rules allow an unlicensed entity to make loans to other people.\nThe Government needed an arbitration system to help resolve the situation, Nghĩa added.\nSocial enterprises\nMeanwhile in the afternoon session, deputy Nguyễn Thị Thu Hà from Bắc Giang, raised the issue of social enterprises, suggesting legal frameworks should be improved and the Government should offer more incentives.\nShe said there are only 80 social enterprises out of 2,000 that have impacted social development, adding this was a very small amount.\nSocial enterprises had proven necessary for the socio-economic development in the world as they created jobs and improve the living conditions for people in harsh conditions, Hà said.\nOne social enterprise employed 42 workers and offered indirect jobs for others, she said.\nIn 80 existing social enterprises, 27 per cent of them employ handicapped people and the same number employ long-term jobless people. Meanwhile, 78 per cent of all social enterprises have low profits but their social responsibility is too heavy. Leaders of social enterprises age from 25 to 44 years old and nearly half of them are female.\nSocial enterprises still faced problems when trying to adapt and benefit from the policies, Hà said.\nShe suggested the Government add at least one item in the amended Law on Enterprises about the definition, obligations, rights and registration of a social enterprise and incentives they may obtain. – VNS'",2

VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — A Japanese organisation on Tuesday announced\xa0 it was ready to pay all costs to clean\xa0the heavily polluted Tô Lịch River and West Lake in Hà Nội following a remark by an environment official saying the firm's sewage treatment technology had failed.\nThe Japan Environment and Business Organisation (JEBO), which was behind a pilot project to clean up the river and lake this summer, said it was prepared to pay in full for the treatment technologies and would rent them to Hà Nội authorities once they were proved to be successful.\nHà Nội would then take charge of the management and operation of the cleansing system, JEBO said.\nJEBO, in co-ordination with the Japan Việt Nam Environment Company (JVE), kicked off a pilot project in May to clean a short section of the Tô Lịch River and part of\xa0West Lake using Japanese nano-bioreactor technology.\nThe project was run for three months before being wrapped up with a stunt when a project member immersed himself in the filtered water from the\xa0river to prove the success of the project in August.\nHowever, Lê Văn Dục, director of the Hà Nội Department of Construction which oversees the capital’s sewage system, said JVE had been invited to carry out the pilot project in the capital city but “it failed”.\nThe comment sparked a protest from JEBO which claimed on Sunday that what the construction director said was “baseless”, and “opposite to the conclusion by the city People’s Committee”.\nThe Tô Lịch River has been a symbol of environmental pollution in the capital for decades despite several efforts to save it since the 1990s.\nThe blame has been placed on the 150,000 cubic metres of raw sewage released daily into the 14km-long river, according to statistics by the municipal Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\nApart from the Japanese\xa0project using nano-bioreactor technology to remove contaminants, Hà Nội authorities were also working on two other solutions to clean\xa0the river.\nOne was to build a system to collect the sewage which would then be transferred to the Yên Xá wastewater treatment plant. Construction of the system, however, has lagged behind schedule and won't be ready\xa0until 2021.\nThe other solution was to treat the water chemically using Redoxy-3C,\xa0a strong oxidizer which can degrade almost all inorganic and organic impurities in water.\xa0It\xa0has already been used in 87 lakes in Hà Nội since 2016.\nThe Redoxy-3C treatment, however, was being inspected following complaints over a\xa0lack of\xa0transparency in Hà Nội's\xa0purchase\xa0of the chemical. The city\xa0Inspectorate was due to release the inspection report on July 15 but so far nothing has been published.\nThe city inspector chief Nguyễn An Huy told the reporters on Wednesday morning that the inspectors were still in the middle of the work and would announce the conclusion as soon as it was available.

Humans who relied on hunting and gathering began to settle and use various techniques to farm.\nThe third was the Scientific Revolution. With the emergence of modern science, major countries entered the overseas market more freely.\nThe fourth expansion was known as\xa0the Industrial Revolution, which featured the\xa0development of steam engines, expanding\xa0productivity rapidly.\nFinally, Knowledge Revolution 5.0 features the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as artificial intelligence, 5G and\xa0smart sensing, which\xa0is poised to dramatically change human life.\nChang stressed many challenges lie ahead as the world is witnessing a trade war between the US and China,\xa0political crises such as Brexit and the Hong Kong protests,\xa0as well as the adverse impacts of climate change.\nHe said that it’s time for countries to act toward globalisation goals and reconciliation of free trade and innovation.\n“We cannot succeed alone,” Chang stressed.\nHe called for an increase in knowledge-sharing as knowledge is a decisive factor\xa0in information-based decision making.\nEsko Aho, former Prime Minister of Finland and co-chair of the event, said since the 2000s, the challenges have increased, not decreased. Major technological invention and innovation drive economic and social developments but there are more technological interruptions without fundamental changes in economic, political and social policies as well.\nTherefore, social and economic models should be revised\xa0to get full benefit of\xa0technological advances, Aho said.\nWang Jia Rui, vice chairman of the Chinese People′s Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of China Soong Ching Ling Foundation, said the world is going through a transformation unseen in a century.\nThe most striking feature of the changes is uncertainty, he said, adding that governments seem unable to catch up with changes caused by new technological evolution and industrial revolution.\nTo cope with the changes, countries need to understand the laws of history, identify the general trend of the world and share knowledge, he said.\nHe emphasised that countries need to focus on long-term goals by working together in an open and inclusive manner, finding common factors and common interest of each other in order to build mutual trust and co-exist.\nThe World Knowledge Forum, one of Asia’s largest annual business forums, takes place from yesterday to Friday with the participation of 250 leaders from political, economic, business and technology sectors and 3,500 attendees. — VNS'",1

In addition, they want their projects preserved if policies are changed.”\nThere should be a programme to make sure demands of foreign investors are met, Mại added.\nBanking specialist and economist Cấn Văn Lực said foreign investors were often worried about how business licences are granted in Việt Nam and whether their cash could be transferred to a third-party territory.\nThose issues were urgent as the Government wanted to make Việt Nam a financial hub and HCM City a financial centre of the region, he said.\nThe policy system was not transparent and consistent and it would become an issue if the Government wanted to make the business environment more open, he said.\nAccording to Đậu Anh Tuấn, director of the legal department at the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), the Prime Minister has recently asked VCCI to review the regulatory system.\nHe said the regulations often overlapped and there were problems with ongoing projects in local areas, especially real estate, as investors had to meet different requirements and qualifications set by both local and central authorities.\nThe issue will lead to consequences as investors and businesses have to fulfil similar administrative works, costing them time, money and efforts and interrupting business operation.\nThe Government, ministries and agencies need to revise all laws and regulations comprehensively.

VNS Photo Gia Lộc\nHCM CITY— The unfolding revolution in internet and information and communication technologies offers an array of innovative and dynamic opportunities to unleash the potential of women and girls, a senior development official has said.\nAmbassador Nguyễn Nguyệt Nga, vice chairwoman of the Vietnam National Committee for Pacific Economic Co-operation and senior advisor to the National Committee on ASEAN 2020, told a two-day workshop in HCM City on Thursday, that digitisation promises to narrow a deeply entrenched and historical gap and also has the potential to provide women with opportunities for a better future.\n“New technology has become an increasingly important tool for education, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, health services, information, and civic participation.\n“In developing countries in particular, new technologies provide women with opportunity to overcome many dominant cultural, traditional and mobility barriers, greater access to information communication technologies for business development, innovative digital solutions to support women-led enterprises.\n“There are also emerging issues of work-life balance 4.0, parenting 4.0. That is why, despite remarkable achievements over the past years, progress has been slow and persisting patterns of inequality are stalling further progress on gender equality.”\nIt is crucial to develop a holistic approach to gender equality which is based on and driven by sustainable development and inclusive digitisation, ensuring no woman is left behind, she said.\nThat would focus, among other things, on the inclusive and responsible use of digital and new technologies to provide affordable, reliable and safe internet and mobile services for women and support the delivery of healthcare, education and education services to women and girls while preventing gender discrimination by biased data sets, she said.\nConcrete steps and actions to increase women and girls’ access to life-long skills development and digital literacy through developing modern online and flexible educational and retraining programmes should be taken, she said.\nGender-responsive environments, especially e-government mechanisms, should be built to empower women to innovate and strengthen their participation in decision making, she added.\nProf Dr Amara Pongsapich, chair of the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR) 2019, said women are especially at risk of being exploited, and the gender equality gap could widen if women are not equipped with the required skills and knowledge.\nThe AICHR workshop on promoting gender equality and empowerment of women through information communication technologies towards achieving the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development brings together relevant stakeholders in the region and beyond to exchange views on these issues.\nThrough this, the AICHR seeks to address this important issue from the complex perspectives of regional and international human rights frameworks and use the latest ICTs to advance gender equality and empowerment of women.\nDr Nguyễn Thái Yên Hương, Việt Nam’s AICHR representative, said: “Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.”\nProviding women and girls with equal access to education, healthcare, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making would fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large, she added.

The textile\xa0and garment industry is expected to gain $40 billion in export turnover this year despite difficulties in some\xa0markets.\xa0— VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Lành\nHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam’s textile and garment industry was likely to reach its target of US$40 billion in export turnover this year despite facing difficulties in some markets.\nThe statement was made by Cao Hữu Hiếu, managing director of the Việt Nam National Garment and Textile Group (Vinatex) after the industry reported export earnings of\xa0$29.3 billion in the first nine months of the\xa0year.\nHiếu said the result was due to the industry's efforts to overcome\xa0difficult global economic conditions. To achieve this\xa0figure, solutions had\xa0been implemented synchronously to remove difficulties, especially input\xa0prices which had dropped sharply due to the impacts of the trade war.\n“After a quiet period, the fibre sector\xa0has started to prosper. Customers are showing more\xa0interest\xa0in it while the price has also recovered. We hope the market\xa0will correct\xa0itself over the next year and return to the highs seen in 2016-17,” Hiếu said.\nWith new-generation free trade agreements (FTAs) such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (\nCPTPP) and the EU-Việt Nam free trade agreement (EVFTA)\xa0which took effect this year, Vietnamese businesses will need to make efforts to take advantage of the preferences they offer.\nTechnology application is seen as a key factor to helping Việt Nam’s textile and garment industry to promote its business and expand its markets.\nAccording to Hiếu, many Vinatex firms had\xa0invested in automatic cutting and spreading machines to replace workers, and in 3D design. Meanwhile, yarn and dyeing were\xa0also under pressure from the\xa0fast development of technology.\nHe said in the\xa0fashion industry, creativity\xa0was very important, so there are stages that machinery cannot replace humans. “A Vinatex survey of about 150 enterprises showed\xa0that employment opportunities within\xa0the industry over\xa0the next 10 years would still be high.”\n“The domestic market is expected to earn\xa0$9 billion\xa0this year, so it's a massive sector. Besides, top global\xa0brands have already\xa0invested here, and\xa0Japan's\xa0Uniqlo will be arriving in 2020,” Hiếu said.\nUnder such pressure, he said the industry needed to\xa0find its own path for Vietnamese fashion to reach the domestic market\n“Vinatex is focusing\xa0on Vietnamese designs with\xa0materials suitable for Vietnamese people and the industry, ensuring quality and reasonable prices and increasing competitiveness,” he added.\nMany businesses have set up e-commerce systems deals or invested in their own\xa0online sales\xa0services to increase domestic market share.\nViệt Tiến Company has invested in a fashion design centre, while Đức Giang Corporation has focused on building and developing its own brands such as Paul Downer, HeraDG and Forever Young.\nOther enterprises such as Nhà Bè and May 10 are also offering\xa0fashionable products in\xa0various styles and categories to meet diverse consumption needs, ensuring quality and design\xa0to\xa0follow\xa0international trends.\nAccording to economic experts, Việt Nam’s accession to a series of FTAs had\xa0increased the openness of\xa0the domestic market by 200 per cent. Along with efforts to improve domestic market share, authorities needed to\xa0create\xa0favourable conditions for enterprises to restructure, especially when it came to raising\xa0capital, expanding production, and improving\xa0technology and management to compete with foreign brands. — VNS",2

The total rice export volume and value in the first ten months of this year reached 5.56 million tonnes and US$2.43 billion.\xa0— VNA/VNS Photo Đình Huệ\nHÀ NỘI — Vietnamese rice producers and exporters needed to focus on quality and supplying products that were in demand, rather than simply looking at quantity, according to the Agricultural Products Processing and Development Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Development (MARD).\nThe total rice export volume and value in the first ten months of this year reached 5.56 million tonnes and US$2.43 billion, respectively.\nThe figures represented a rise of 6.1 per cent in volume and a drop of 9.1 per cent in value compared to the same period in 2018.\nViệt Nam’s five per cent broken rice is now fetching\xa0$350 per tonne, the highest level in the past two months, but still lower than that of India ($365-370 per tonne) and Thailand ($395-400 per tonne).\nIn the first seven\xa0months of this year, Vietnamese rice exports\xa0to China decreased by 67 per cent to 400,000 tonnes, whereas in the past\xa0China often imported up to two million tonnes of rice from Việt Nam annually.\nThe decline had\xa0knocked China off top spot as the country's main export market, accounting for just over 8 per cent of Việt Nam's total export value, Minister of Agriculture and Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường said at a seminar on Thursday.\nMeanwhile, Cambodia, another rice exporter in the region, has\xa0increased\xa0exports to China.\nAccording to the Cambodia Rice Federation, Cambodia's rice exports to China rose sharply in the first nine months of this year, reaching nearly 158,000 tonnes, up 44 per cent from the same period last year. In 2019, the country plans to export 300,000 tonnes of rice to China and raise the figure to 400,000 tonnes in 2020.\nCambodia prioritises the production of organic rice to\xa0offer clean materials that\xa0meet market demands and ensure the sustainable growth of rice exports.\nIn terms of rice export volume, Việt Nam exports on\xa0average five to seven million tonnes of rice annually, making it one of the world’s top three largest rice exporters. In 2018, Việt Nam exported more than six million tonnes of rice while Cambodia sold only more than 626,200 tonnes.\nHowever, in terms of quality and brand, Cambodian is gradually becoming a formidable opponent in the region.\nAt the 10th TRT World Rice Conference 2018 held on October 2018 in Hà Nội, Cambodian premium fragrant rice, Malys Angkor, won the World's Best Rice award.\nCambodia is also\xa0among the top five organic rice exporters to the EU market, behind only the US, Pakistan, India and Thailand.\nRegarding export markets, Vietnamese rice is now exported to 150 countries and territories in the world, but mostly in the low price segment.\nCambodia now exports rice to a few dozen countries, mainly picky markets.\nAccording to Minister\xa0Cường, in the long-term strategy, the agriculture sector should look at reducing the total area of rice plantations to a level that ensured food security and partial exports.\nCường said the domestic market needed to ensure supplies and the quality of rice and packaging. Regarding export markets, Việt Nam should promote and expand markets, for example, in Africa and the Middle East, as well as regional markets such as Indonesia and the Philippines.\nAt The Rice Trader (TRT) World Rice Conference 2019 in Manila, the Philippines,\xa0Việt Nam’s organic rice from Sóc Trăng ST24 was crowned the best in the world\xa0on Tuesday.

The world biosphere reserve is vulnerable to mass tourism with overloaded boats and logistics demands. — VNS Photo Công Thành\nIn April, Đà Nẵng released a plan to develop eight aquatic tourism services – including a direct boat route from the Hàn River to the Chàm Islands – by 2021.\nHowever, the islands are already overloaded, with a fleet of 152 boats including 145 speed boats travelling between Cửa Đại Port in Hội An and the Islands (a distance of 20km).\n“The Chàm Islands are not only a tourism attraction, but also a world biosphere reserve,” Thúy said.\xa0“They need a balance between tourism development and nature conservation.”\n“Đà Nẵng and Hội An have had discussions about the plan to operate more boats to the Chàm Islands,” Thúy said. “However, the islands hold biodiversity conservation and sustainable development as their top priorities rather than mass tourism.”\nOverloaded\nThe islands, which were recognised as a World Biosphere Reserve on over 33,000ha by UNESCO in 2009, hosted 21,000 tourists on the public holidays from April 27 to May 1 – an average of 4,200 visitors, far exceeding the daily limit.\nIn the first three months of this year, they hosted 54,000 visitors, a 69 per cent increase over the same period last year. The increase has stretched the food and fresh water supply – already a worry for the islands’ 2,400 residents – and put a strain on waste treatment services.\nVice Chairman of the People’s Committee of Tân Hiệp Commune in the centre of the islands, Mai Quốc Bảo, said the 80,000cu.m reservoir on the islands could only supply enough fresh water for residents, and the rising number of tourists meant there was not enough water for locals during the high season.\nTourism has also had severe ecological impacts. At a conference on conservation of the islands, Thúy said 66 per cent of the area’s sea grass was destroyed from 2009 to 2018, leaving just 17ha intact.\nThe damage was caused by the rapid increase of speed boats and fishing vessels over the past decade.\n“The excessive number of speed boats has caused mass damage over a large area of sea grass off the islands and also destroyed safe shelter for marine species and fish,” Thúy said.\n“Despite increasing the entrance fee from VNĐ30,000 to 70,000 in 2015 and imposing the daily limit, the Chàm Islands are barrelling towards an environmental tragedy in the next three or four years,” Vice Chairman Bảo said.\nVice Chairman of the Hội An People’s Committee Nguyễn Văn Sơn said that, in the spirit of maintaining conservation as the top priority, the islands would reject the development of large-scale hotel and resort projects.\nTrần Lê Trà, an expert from German development agency GIZ, said the\xa0Chàm\xa0Islands\xa0offered tourism services at prices that were far too low.\n“The islands have been seen as an ideal site with unique nature and status of a world biosphere reserve,” he said. “It is a challenge to balance conservation with tourism revenue.”\n“The\xa0Chàm\xa0Islands\xa0need more investment in nature conservation with safe and hospitable tourism services,” Trà said. “The islands should only offer tourism products and services that do not damage marine and forest biodiversity.”\nAccording to a report from the MPA, the biosphere reserve has 1,500ha of tropical forests and 6,700ha of sea featuring a wide range of marine fauna and flora.\nBùi Thị Thu Hiền from the International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) said the islands only have\xa0strict protection requirements for a core zone of 1 per cent of their total area. Hiền said the protection area should cover at least 30 per cent.\nLê Xuân Ái, an expert from the Chàm Islands MPA, said beaches on the islands have been reserved for turtle conservation since the island started a hatching programme on Bấc Beach in 2017.\nÁi said human activities such as fishing and construction have seriously damaged the area’s seaweed and coral reefs, which shelter abundant aquatic species, and that allowing in more boats would only make the problems worse.\nDisagreement\nIn an interview with local media, Deputy Director\xa0of Đà Nẵng’s tourism department said the Chàm Islands could not prevent boats from travelling from Đà Nẵng.\nHe said officials from the two localities will meet to discuss sustainable ways to implement the new route from Đà Nẵng to the islands. — VNS'",4

The mill would require the construction of an 85ha lake in the commune, of which 50ha are to be built where a century-old nipa palm forest now stands. Construction on the plant will likely not begin for two to three years, as ministries and departments conduct assessments on the planned facility.\nLocal residents say they rely on the forest for survial.

We could earn VNĐ300,000 (US$13.3) each day from fishing in the area,” Minh said.\n“The forest creates a ‘green’ landscape and shelter for aquatic fish, shrimp and oyster.

The 100-year-old forest area is also a safe shelter for 26 migrant bird and waterfowl species. Almost 90 per cent of aquatic animals and fishes in the coastal area are grown in the ecological system of nipa palm forest before moving to the sea,” Minh said.\nThe controversy over the wood-pulp plant comes as the region struggles to balance conservation with economic development. According to latest report from the provincial agriculture and rural development, the province has 197ha of coastal mangrove forest, nearly 60 per cent decrease from 2002.\nIn 2015, the province grew 45.7ha coastal mangrove forest in three communes of Bình Phước, Bình Đông and Bình Dương in the district under the Climate Change Resilience and coastal mangrove swamp project.\nBut regrowth projects can’t keep pace with the destruction of forests.

Investing in the form of public-private partnership will create better products and services,"" he said.\nNguyễn Đức Trung, deputy minister of Planning and Investment, said the draft law contains 12 chapters and 117 items based on existing regulations on investment and investment contracts in the form of PPP. It is expected to amend some regulations related to project scale and competence to decide on investment policy.\nIn accordance with current regulations, State\'s investment in PPP projects must be in line with procedures of the law on public investment.\nThis led to a lack of flexibility in capital arrangement because it would be adjusted with finance plans.\nHe said it was necessary to set forth a new rule on the arrangement of investment from the State in PPP projects.\nThe Ministry of Planning and Investment has proposed two options on allocation of State funds to PPP projects.\nFirst was to set up a development fund to allocate State money and grant guarantees for PPP projects. The second option suggested reserving separate funds for PPP projects in mid-term public investment plans.\nNA deputies said given the constraint budget, attracting private investment is essential to reduce pressure on the State budget.\nVũ Hồng Thanh, head of NA Economic Committee, emphasised the necessity of the law on PPP and the draft law would be submitted to the NA Standing Committee for consideration.\nAccording to the Government\'s report on the implementation of PPP projects, as of January 2019, the country has mobilised about VNĐ1.6 quadrillion (US$69.1 billion) from private investment to address urgent needs for infrastructure development. — VNS'",0

Of those, four of the patients died.\nThis year, 20 cases have been reported. This number is equal to those reported over the last ten years.\nCường said Whitmore’s disease was a dangerous acute infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei.\nThe bacteria exist in contaminated water and soil. Transmission to humans and animals is through skin contact with the contaminated source or the inhalation of particles containing the bacteria.\nAs many as 16 cases of Whitmore’s disease were reported in July and August at the hospital. Of those, 12 patients were in critical conditions.\nCường said the rainy season provided good conditions for the development of the virus. The disease has a high mortality rate of approximately 40 per cent if the patient is misdiagnosed and does not receive proper treatment.\nAccording to the doctor this is a serious infection that causes damage to many organs. Patients suffering from diabetes or chronic lung, heart, or kidney-related diseases are vulnerable to the virus. These patients may suffer multiple organ failure and death if infected.\nCường said the doctors had prescribed high-dose antibiotics for these patients and received consultations from specialists, but some patients had severe liver damage and respiratory failure that could not be cured.\nThe Bạch Mai Hospital’s Department of Infectious Diseases received a patient suffering from a severe abscess on her nose.\nShe was misdiagnosed as having sepsis caused by a staph infection at a local hospital.\nThe doctors had to completely change the treatment regimen, otherwise the patient could have died. The patient would be given a combination of antibiotics for at least three months under strict monitoring to avoid relapse, he said.\nCường said the disease had a wide range of symptoms that could be misdiagnosed for other diseases. Many patients were diagnosed with sepsis caused by staph infections. Tuberculosis and pneumonia were also blamed as the cause of the symptoms.\nCurrently, there is no vaccine for the disease.\nCường said it was necessary to improve the training of microbiologists at grassroots-level hospitals, so that patients can be treated properly.

It has also lured 378 foreign-financed projects worth more than $5 billion.\nThese impressive results are attributable to the province’s endless efforts to improve its investment climate and to facilitate investors to solve challenges to\xa0implement\xa0their projects in a timely manner.\nIn the past, the province has always ranked high on the Provincial Competitive Index (PCI) which has been conducted every year since 2005 by the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The province received high rankings in terms of legal institutions, proactivity of provincial leadership and time costs and regulatory compliance as well as transparency and access to information.\nHowever, the province’s investment attraction is yet to match its potential\xa0and expectations of local authorities who have considered inflows of domestic and foreign investment as important factors that will help the locality archieve its long-term goal.\nFollowing to the goal, the province strives to become one of the country’s key industrial\xa0and service centres and a city directly under the Central Government by 2020. The province also targets to be a reliable destination for large businesses but also a place to live and work of talent and rich people.\nIn order to reach this\xa0ambition, Vĩnh Phúc needs quality investment projects that will bring great socio-economic efficiency. These projects will come into the industrial sector such as including automobiles, motorbike, electronics, telecommunication, food processing beside to those to be invested in the agriculture sector like hi-tech farming, clean fruits and vegetables, high-tech cattle and poultry breeding and agricultural processing.\nThe locality also needs projects to be invested in the service sector such as health-care, education-training, tourism as well as ones in infrastructure development including infrastructure constructions of industrial parks and complexes and the launches of industrial waste and water-treatment plants.\nAccording to the provincial leaders, enterprises are important drivers of the province’s development.\xa0Creating a favourable investment and trading environment for them is the duty of the whole provincial administrative system and people.\nVĩnh Phúc is determined to improve the investment climate in all three areas of legal environment, infrastructure, and services, they said.\nThe locality will continue to improve the quality of the local administration through\xa0administrative reform, enhancing the provincial competitiveness index, developing a smooth, transparent and attractive investment environment, and creating optimal conditions for all economic sectors to operate in.\nThe province will also offer investors many investment incentives focusing on land access and clearance, personnel training, investment procedures and several investment costs.\nThe locality will also support investors in developing technical infrastructure inside and outside industrial parks and clusters and large-scale urban and service areas. It has planned to develop a total of 50 industrial parks and clusters, covering a total area of more than 5,890ha.\nMeanwhile, the local administration will better deal with the difficulties and obstacles facing businesses to help them boost production.

2090,'Vietnamese doctors provide free health checks to Lao patients',"'HÀ NỘI — Heading north from HCM City, a van carrying the Vietnamese doctors arrived at the border gate with Cambodia.\nBut that was far from their final destination.\nA Vietnamese doctor examines a Lao patient. — VNA/VNS Photo Đinh Hằng\nThe doctors then continued their trip across Cambodia to the south of Laos, a 1000-km journey taking them to the border district of Tha Teng.\nTheir patients knew they were coming, and were eagerly awaiting their arrival.\nA makeshift hospital was quickly set up in the middle of a factory owned by a Vietnamese company. Tables were lined up for registration, general diagnosis, ultrasound and other medical treatments that may be common to many, but rare to this particular group of patients.\nHundreds of Lao residents started flooding into the makeshift hospital.\nAided by health staff at the Tha Teng Medical Centre, the doctors got down to business.\nThe trip was the third in three for doctors of HCM City Young Doctors Association to Laos. Their destination this year was Tha Teng District in the Sekong Province which was adjacent to the central part of Viet Nam.\nTha Teng was a typical border community where farming was the main way of life for most of the residents.\nThe modern world seemed a million miles away, so too was healthcare.\nDoctor Lê Hồng Tuấn, head of District 2 Hospital’s Department of Cardiology, has been on all three volunteering trips. He recognised the similarity in the disease pattern between the Lao patients in remote areas and the Vietnamese back in the 80s.\n“Poor nutrition and hard labour tend to leave them with bone and muscle pain, eye pain, dermatological diseases or intestinal and respiratory problems,” he said.\nMethao Vifon, 70, lived some 25km away from the district centre where the makeshift hospital was set up. She woke up earlier at 5 am on the health check day and went with her son.\n“I was very happy when heard Vietnamese doctors were coming over,” she said.\n“They are very good doctors, their medicine work better than the herbs on the mountain.”\nAnother elderly patient, 76-year-old veteran Kham Biem, was thankful that he was examined by Vietnamese doctors. His only regret was that his wife could not come to the hospital.\n“The local authorities said that only one person in each family can come so my wife let me go,” he said.\n“I hope Vietnamese doctors come here several times so that Lao people can have more free health checks.”\nThe doctors were doing their very best to help the poor patients, but there were things beyond their capability.\nA man drove his 77-year-old father on an agrimotor from their house which was 15km away. He was so weak he struggled to climb out of the vehicle.\nDoctor Trần Quang Châu went to examine the old man, said revealed he suffered from diabetes and tuberculosis, which were worsened by poor nutrition that gradually eroded his health.\n“We could not do anything for him but only suggesting his family take him to a hospital,” Châu said. “It seems unfeasible though considering the family’s economic status.”\nDoctor Diêu Hà Nam said many patients had very serious illnesses but could not find adequate healthcare services.\nHe said: “They were in so much pain but our time here was limited while the medicine and the medical equipment were not sufficient to cure their diseases. Looking at their eyes beaming with hope, I just couldn’t stop that sour feeling overwhelming my heart.”\nKhuonmixay company director Nguyễn Văn Việt, one of the biggest sponsors for the charity trips, said that the lives of Lao people along the borderline were extremely difficult.\n“They have very little chance to gain access to healthcare services. There are those to whom healthcare is not a priority as they can’t even have three meals a day let alone coming to the hospital,” Việt said.\nLao people were particularly fond of Vietnamese doctors whom they believed were very skillful, he added. It was also the reason why Việt decided to provide financial support to bring the doctors to Laos over the last three years.\n“It is my company’s social responsibility to help Lao people approach the best possible medical services,” he said. — VNS'",1

To date, Việt Nam has about 500 enterprises involved in the chain, from production, harvest, processing, to trading, import and export of agricultural products.\nHe said the State had issued many policies to support agricultural enterprises, especially to enhance connections in agricultural production.\n“Việt Nam has a system of businesses, co-operatives and many agricultural scientists, along with the State\'s support. That’s enough for us to promote the participation in global export chains,” Tuấn said.\n“Co-operation among businesses is extremely important, and needs to diversify towards safe, traceable and higher value-added agricultural production,"" Tuấn said.\nStatistics from MARD shows that Việt Nam had 1,478 production chains by the end of September, an increase of 660 units compared to the same period last year.\nThe country has more than 25,500 households co-operating with businesses in production meeting VietGAP standards. About 619,000 others are involved in production.\nViệt Nam’s agricultural products are currently exported to 185 countries and territories, ranking second in Southeast Asia and 15th globally. The country has also signed 16 new-generation free trade agreements, thereby creating more opportunities for agricultural exports.\nIn the first nine months of this year, the country’s agricultural exports reached US$30.2 billion, up 2.7 per cent year-on-year.\nGeneral Director of South Korea’s Dreamfarm Company, Park Hyang Jin, said the weakest point in Vietnamese agricultural enterprises is production and processing technology. In addition, State support has not been effective while the linkage among enterprises to improve the value of agricultural products is poor.\nPark said Vietnamese businesses needed to further invest in technology from production to processing, packaging and consumption, ensuring the entire process is properly controlled.\nAccording to Phạm Hoàng Vân Anh, an expert at the World Bank in Việt Nam, global demand for food will increase by 70-100 per cent by 2050 due to population growth and changes in eating and drinking habits.\n“To catch up with these changes, Vietnamese businesses need to participate deeply in the global value chain, building an infrastructure of quality to raise competitiveness. This infrastructure is a key factor for the development of the agriculture and food industry,” Vân Anh said.\nAccessing credit\nPhạm Thị Thanh Tùng, head of the central bank’s Department of Credit for Agriculture, said that the re-organisation of production in the value chain and application of science and technology is a key driver for the country’s development of sustainable agriculture.\nHowever, she said production under the associated models revealed limitations due to weak co-operation and linkages. The number of safe agricultural chains is also low.\n“Many associated contracts are not close, causing violations to people and businesses. This makes it difficult for credit institutions to control the cash flow when lending,” Tùng said.\nIn addition, she said the agricultural sector is always at risk of natural disasters and epidemics. Many agricultural enterprises lack transparency and security assets, making it difficult to access credit.\nIn order to increase credit for agricultural development and encourage businesses to invest in agricultural value chains, Tùng said that it was necessary to improve the appraisal efficiency and assess customers’ trustworthiness, as well as enhancing the possibility of lending without collateral and removing difficulties for agricultural enterprises.\nAt the forum, participants discussed and put forward solutions to increase the development of the agricultural sector, including training for businesses, planning production areas, trade promotion and market expansion.\nThey agreed that IT policies would need to be renovated, helping businesses access capital and land, in addition to strengthening the application of standards to enhance the quality of products, ensuring food safety, branding and supporting people to implement VietGap, GlobalGap and Organic standards. — VNS'",2

2944,'Central bank tightens lending for property sector',"'The central bank said limiting loans to the real estate sector is aimed at ensuring its sustainable development and the safety of the banking sector. — Photo vneconomy.vn\nOn November 15 the State Bank of Việt Nam replaced its previous circular on operational safety ratios for the banking sector with Circular No 22.\nTo take effect on January 1 it focuses on two changes that will tighten banks’ lending to the property sector.\nThey are a reduction of the ratio of short-term funds that can be used for medium and long-term loans from the current 40 per cent to 30 per cent by September 2022 in four phases, and the increase in the risk ratios of mortgages from the current 50 per cent to up to 150 per cent and loans for commercial real estate to 200 per cent.\nAnalysts said the central bank’s moves are aimed at cutting off credit to high-risk sectors, especially property.\nThe central bank said limiting loans to the real estate sector is aimed at ensuring its sustainable development and the safety of the banking sector.\nMarket observers said the tightening could rock the property market.\nThe tripling of the credit risk ratio for loans to buy homes\xa0worth VNĐ1.5 billion (US$126,000) and more to 150 per cent would push up lending interest rates, which would hit\xa0market liquidity, they said.\nThe market has already undergone many difficulties since the beginning of the year.\nIn the period many banks have hiked interest rates on medium- and long-term loans to buy properties to 10 per cent.\nBut with the real estate market not witnessing any unusual developments, experts said it is not necessary to tighten credit policy at this time.\nSo what is the central bank’s rationale?\nBank loans to the property sector in the first half of this year accounted for 7-8 per cent of overall credit. But according to the National Financial Supervision Committee (NFSC), this would rise to 40 per cent if it includes loans for buying homes.\nThis rate is too high since the property sector is always considered high-risk.\nIn light of the new circular, many experts said, while the credit tightening could have some impact on property developers and the market, it would help banks better control money flows, reducing risks and ensuring economic stability.\nBanking expert Dr Cấn Văn Lực said not only developers but also homebuyers who need to borrow money need long-term loans, and so the central bank’s decision to reduce the ratio of short-term funds used for long- and medium-term loans would help lenders minimise risks possibly arising from stretching themselves too thin.\nSBV Governor Lê Minh Hưng has ordered a strengthening of inspection of credit activities, particularly of lending to developers and homebuyers, to ensure safety and proper used in line with regulations.\nExperts believe that the new credit policies would encourage banks to shift lending to individual homebuyers to hedge risks while at the same time not losing interest income.\nFor many banks, mortgages are key credit products.\nLenders have to carefully assess property projects before providing loans to homebuyers and take the initiative to work with developers to better manage risks, they said.\nForeign businesses eye VN furniture market\nThai furnishing retailer Index Living Mall has entered into a strategic tie-up with VI Furniture Joint Stock Company, and they have opened a 1,000sq.m store on Hồ Chí Minh City’s Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai Street.\nVI Furniture, backed by the Vietnam Investment Fund, and the Thai company, are all set to open a second store in the city’s District 2.\nIndex Living Mall came to do business in the Vietnamese market eight years ago, but had to quit.\nWith its return this time, Thailand’s most favourite brand -- with more than 30 years of experience -- hopes to bring to the Vietnamese market quality products at reasonable prices.\nThe $4.5 -5 billion a year Vietnamese furniture market has also been attracting many other foreign furniture brands.\nThe market is in fact flooded by foreign furniture products including famous brands like the US’s Ashley, Denmark’s JYSK and South Korea’s Kimsfullhouse.\nViệt Nam is generally considered one of the region’s most attractive markets for foreign investors with its steadily increasing GDP and FDI boom.\nAccording to the 2018 Furniture & Home Décor report released by the EU-Vietnam Business Network (EVBN), as the country’s economy continues to grow, the home décor and furniture industry can expect to grow along with it.\nRising household incomes lead to improving living standards as local consumers become more able and willing to spend on high-quality goods.\nSo a preference for western-style products is expected to put pressure on local manufacturers to come up with innovative designs to compete.\nExperts said consumers in the past were only looking for functional items but are now looking for products to match their personal style and way of life while also offering better quality.\nAnother reason is\xa0a growing trend among the younger generations to move out of their parents’ home, and the youngsters place greater emphasis on new and stylish furniture at affordable prices, the report said.\nThe westernisation of the younger generation is the key driver of success for foreign furniture companies, according to the EVBN.\nKý Quí Trung, CEO of AKA Furniture Group, a leading furniture retailer, said demand for high-class furniture is increasing sharply, especially in Hà Nội and HCM City.\nLast year the country spent $500 million\xa0importing foreign furniture, and the trend is expected to continue in the coming years.\nPlywood imports suspended on re-export fraud\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade has decided to suspend the import of plywood products for re-export to the US from December 27 this year to prevent possible origin frauds and unauthorised transshipments.\nIt has issued Circular 22, which will take effect on December 17, to strengthen efforts to prevent the circumvention of trade remedies and origin fraud.\nOne of its measures is to gain greater control over plywood exports to the US since failure to do so could prompt the world’s largest economy to take drastic measures against Vietnamese plywood products.\nAccording to scoutAsia Research, a corporate data and news service provider backed by the Financial Times and Nikkei Inc., the US-Việt Nam bilateral trade gap is also caused by goods originating in China and other countries and rerouted through Việt Nam to take advantage of the country’s friendlier tariff treatment.\nThe true scope of this origin fraud is unknown, but surging imports from China and exports from Việt Nam of key products such as wood, furniture and computer and parts have rung alarm bells, forcing the Vietnamese Government to act.

Evidence is that all auto businesses have confirmed the origin and type of imported cars, strictly complying with the provisions of Decree 116. Meanwhile, the number of imported vehicles has increased.\nAccording to a report by the MoIT, after the import duty was reduced to zero from 2018 under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), domestic manufacturers initially affirmed their role and position in the automobile market. Especially, Decree 116 has played an important role in protecting the production and assembly of cars in the country.\nThe report shows that after the decree was issued, some ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and other WTO members such as the US, Japan and EU raised concerns about Decree 116, saying it may create additional procedures and hinder businesses in exporting cars to Việt Nam as well as violating national treatment principles.\n“The import of cars has slowed down due to Decree 116 but has increased sharply again,” stated the report.\nThe MoIT said that the current output between domestically-produced vehicles and imported vehicles had changed significantly. In 2017, the number of domestically-produced vehicles was 2.5 times higher than imported ones. The figure was 3.72 times in 2018. In the first six months of this year, it decreased to 1.74 times.\nHowever, the ministry said that the domestic sector would not maintain its advantage in the market if it did not attempt to improve quality and lower production costs to increase competitiveness, especially against vehicles imported from ASEAN, which enjoy preferential import tariffs.\nThe ministry said it needed to issue solutions supporting and promoting the domestic automobile industry to compete with imported cars, especially those from ASEAN.\nNguyễn Minh Đồng, an expert in the automobile industry, told plo.vn that imported cars were increasingly narrowing the sales gap with domestically-assembled cars because the auto businesses had met requirements of Decree 116, increasing supply.\n“In addition, imported models are hitting the low-cost segment that used to be the playground for locally-assembled cars,” Đồng said.\nTo increase the competitiveness for domestic automobiles, Đồng said it was necessary to adjust tax and fee policies to help domestic automobile manufacturers and assemblers reduce costs.\n“But the most important thing is that domestic automakers must strive to improve quality and lower production costs to enhance competitiveness. The price of domestically-manufactured and -assembled cars is still high, making it difficult to promote the industry,” he added.\nTo solve the problem, the MoIT proposed the Government not apply special consumption tax for automobiles which are locally-produced, as part of efforts to reduce the price of cars.\nThe ministry also expected the Government to adjust import tax on the principle that the import tax rate on components, spare parts and raw materials must be lower than the import tax rate on completely built-up cars, or at floor level according to international commitments in each period.\nIn addition, the tax rate will be reduced to zero per cent for items on cars with nine seats or fewer, such as engines and gearboxes, which are valid until 2025. — VNS'",2

Those who have played for the Spaniard describe him as cold, calculated and methodical.\nI’M OFF: Rafa Benitez will leave Newcastle United at the end of June. AFP\xa0Photo\nThis week former Liverpool striker Fernando Torres retired from football and recalled a story about his old boss.\nHe said after scoring a hat-trick for Liverpool he was given the match ball to keep and asked his teammates and manager to sign it.\nRafa wrote: “Today you lost the ball eight times.”\nThis was Rafa’s perverse way to motivate a player, and on the whole, his methods have worked.\nHe is an incredibly successful manager. At Valencia he won La Liga twice and the UEFA Cup before moving to Liverpool where he won the FA Cup, the Community Shield, Champions League and the Super Cup.\nHe moved to Italy and won a few cups with Inter Milan then came back to England to be caretaker manager of Chelsea and won the Europa League then returned to Italy and won the Coppa Italia with Napoli.\nHis resume is enough to give him a job at just about any football club in the world which was why it was a surprise for me that in 2016 he took charge at Newcastle United who were at the time fighting relegation.\nHe lost that particular battle, but the following season led the Magpies back up to the Premier League.\nI have friends in the northeast of England who have nothing but praise for Rafa. Newcastle is a city where football is more important than religion and as a result, their supporters are loyal to the core.\nThere’s a way of thinking in that particular part of the world that no matter what, you should support your club at all costs.\nAnd while that may well be correct, there is a slight problem. The football club is rotten because of one thing, the\xa0owner.\nMike Ashley has toyed with the emotions of those in black and white for way too long. Last month there was a strong suggestion he was close to selling the club to a Middle Eastern royal family which was music to the ears of the fans.\nSadly when Ashley says it’s Thursday, you really need to check your diary because the man spews more hot air than you’ll find in the skies above Hà Nội on a hot and sticky summer day.\nBenitez this week has quit. Called it a day and walked away, so in my limited mind that means there is no buy-out on the cards and Rafa is jumping headfirst overboard from the sinking ship that is Newcastle United Football Club.\nIn two weeks’ time not only will the Newcastle players return for pre-season training with no manager, but also no coaching team, as they have all left as well.\nIt’s a shambles, and while Ashley remains in charge, a shambles it will always be.\nIf scientists in the next two weeks can come up with a way to make a combined clone of Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp it would still not work at Newcastle.\nThe club is infected. Ashley is a cancer that is ripping the soul out of each and every supporter at St James Park, sorry, I mean the Sports Direct Stadium.\nWhile he is in charge, there is no cure.\nBut what will become of Rafa? Odds of him taking charge at Chelsea have been slashed dramatically much to the anger of their loyal band of plastic supporters, and there’s always China.\nDalian Yifang - who are backed by a man reportedly worth billions of dollars - are understood to have offered Benitez a mouth-watering contract to take charge.\nI really don’t think Rafa is short of a bob or two and his motivation, as far as I can see, has never really been about money.\nRafa likes a challenge, that’s why I guess Newcastle was his last destination.

The average trading volume in the first 11 months of this year reached VNĐ9 trillion (US$387.26 million) per session, increasing 24 times compared to 2009.\n""Việt Nam’s G-bond market has grown at an average rate of 27 per cent per year over the past decade, the highest growth rate in emerging economies in East Asia,"" Hiền said.\nIn addition, the G-bond market has also become an important medium and long-term capital mobilisation channel for the State budget. The focus on issuing long-term G-bonds has enabled the Government to increase borrowing in the domestic market and reduce foreign loans.\nFrom\xa02009-19, the G-bond issuance channel mobilized VNĐ1.96 quadrillion for the State budget, an average of about VNĐ175 trillion per year.\nAlwaleed Alatabani, the Lead Financial Sector Specialist at the World Bank in Việt Nam, said that in recent years, the G-bond market had\xa0achieved remarkable results. The WB highly appreciated\xa0the close co-operation of Vietnamese State agencies in the development of the G-bond market in Việt Nam.\nHe recommended that, as the market was growing, it was necessary to expand the network of investors holding G-bonds in order to gradually reduce the dependence on investors from the banking sector.\nThere was a need for a broader and more diverse legal framework to encourage non-banking investors, including those from insurance, investment funds and foreign investors, to participate in the G-bond market, Alatabani said. — VNS'",2

To win 5-0 was exactly what we needed.""\nSon was restored to the starting line-up after being left on the bench for Spurs\' latest disappointing display a 1-1 home draw against bottom-of-the-table Watford.\nThe South Korean had been rested just days after returning from a tense World Cup qualifier in North Korea.\nSon has been a shining light among a dramatic dip in form from many of his teammates this season and got his reward on a night Mauricio Pochettino will hope proves to be a turning point.\nKane has also continued to score goals and is now up to 15 for club and country this season.\nThe England captain opened the floodgates when he met Lamela\'s in-swinging corner on nine minutes.\nSpurs also took an early lead against Bayern in a bright opening half hour before a second half collapse against the German giants.\nBut there was never any danger of a repeat against far more limited opponents, especially after Son deservedly doubled the hosts\' lead.\nLamela was again the creator with a teasing cross for Son to meet sweetly on the half-volley.\nPochettino admitted on the eve of the game that speculation over his future was normal, despite the success he has achieved in turning Tottenham from Europa League regulars to Champions League contenders over the past five years.\nHowever, the Argentine was serenaded by a home support soothed by the sight of Spurs returning to form, for 90 minutes at least.\nA much tougher task awaits on Sunday when Spurs travel to Liverpool in a repeat of last season\'s Champions League final with revenge on their minds.\nBut another adventure into the knockout stages of the Champions League at least now looks probable for Pochettino\'s men, as they moved a point ahead of Red Star into second place in Group B behind Bayern.\nAfter a brief spell of resistence from the visitors, Son made sure the three points were safe before the break by finishing off a swift counter-attack from Tanguy Ndombele\'s pass.\nSpurs should have had far more than two more after the break. Lamela could have had a 15-minute hat-trick as he missed two glorious chances either side of a thumping left-foot finish from Serge Aurier\'s pass.\nSon was then withdrawn to keep him fresh for the trip to Anfield, but the chances continued to flow and Kane rounded off the scoring when his side-foot finish nestled in the far corner. —\xa0AFP'",3

National public service portal debuts\nOn December 9, the national public service portal was officially launched and put into use, marking an important milestone in the implementation of an e-Government that centres on people and businesses.\nBy going to a single website (http://dichvucong.gov.vn) and using a single account, people and businesses can easily access all public service portals at ministerial and provincial levels to handle public services online, follow procedure settlement processes, assess settlements, and send feedback regardless of time or place.\n4.

5106,'Recycling harms environment in Vĩnh Phúc',"'Scrap is piled up along local roads in Tề Lỗ Village, Vĩnh Phúc Province. — VNA/VNS Photo Nguyễn Trọng Lịch\nVĨNH PHÚC The rapid development of waste recycling in recent years has seriously affected the lives of people in Vĩnh Phúc Province.\nA small area in Tề Lỗ, a village in Yên Lạc District, gathers tens of thousands of old cars, excavators, bulldozers, and cranes which are waiting to be dismantled and classified for reuse,\xa0vietnamplus.vn\xa0reported.\nGood spare parts will be reused by selling them to car repair shops.\nAfter a few weeks or months of dismantling, the paint, rubber gaskets, tires, plastics and machinery lubricants from the vehicles is discharged into the environment.\nAll of this non-recyclable waste is burned or thrown away to the local environment by residents, polluting vacant areas, canals, ponds and lakes.\nThe waste also contributes to water, air and land pollution.\nT, a car dismantling worker in Tề Lỗ Commune, said tonnes of wastes from all kinds of machines and motors were discharged into the environment every day.\nThese products were only partially collected and most were carried to fields and canals along villages and hamlets to destroy by burning, he said.\nThe burning has caused air pollution and an unpleasant odour from rubber and plastic.\nMany people are upset about the burning of waste but do not speak out because they do not want to harm their relationships with relatives and neighbours.\nIn addition to dismantling cars and motor vehicles, Yên Lạc district also hosts villages that purchase scrap and recycle plastic, causing environment pollution.\nFor a long time, collecting and recycling plastic scrap in Đông Mẫu Village, Yên Đồng Commune has been the main source of income and job creation.\nHowever, environmental pollution is a concern for residents.\nĐông Mẫu is always busy with people coming and going to trade and transport scrap as well as the big noise from plastic grinding machines, day and night.\nMost of the plastic scrap in this village is purchased from scrap dealers to manufacture products from recycled plastic.\nThe recycled products are mostly exported to China and some provinces such as Bắc Ninh and Hưng Yên.\nThere are 400 households with 2,000 people in Đông Mẫu Village, of which more than 200 households work in trading, manufacturing and recycling plastic scrap.\nThe development of plastic recycling has greatly affected the environment.\nSewer systems are overloaded because of the daily waste water from plastic recycling, while ponds, lakes and canals are full of black wastewater.\nScrap is piled up everywhere and roads have become yards to gather scrap.\nA lack of management and planning from local authorities for the rapid development of such villages has caused illegal public land encroachment by businesses.\nAccording to Yên Lạc District People\'s Committee, by August, there were 253 cases of land encroachment with a total area of more than 32,400sq.m, 649 cases of misuse of public land and other land-use violations.\nThe main reason leading to the situation is a lack of respect and compliance for the law by some people, organisations and enterprises, according to Nguyễn Kim Sơn, chairman of the People\'s Committee of Tề Lỗ Commune.\nMeanwhile some localities have not strictly dealt with violations early, causing difficulties in recovering land.\nMany households and businesses have built workshops or solid constructions on encroached land, typically in localities with such villages.\nTề Lỗ Commune alone has 95 cases of people violating the Land Law with an area of tens of thousands of square metres, the committee said.\n""There are 540 households trading excavators and bulldozers, of which more than 300 families have been approved (in plan) to settle in an industrial zone,"" said Sơn.\n""The remaining households also need to expand production and are struggling to find a place to gather goods.""\nTo minimise environmental pollution from waste, in 2018, the commune put into use two concentrated landfills with a total area of 4,400sq.m to replace Đồng Soi landfill which was closed for a road project.\nHowever, it hasn\'t solved the pollution problem.\nNguyễn Công Võ, chief of Vĩnh Phúc Department of Natural Resources and Environment Department, said the province planned to build two more waste treatment plants and work with localities to set up waste management plans.\nThe province also requested the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment promulgate guidelines and management procedures in classifying, storing, gathering, transportation, reuse, recycling and treatment of waste, as well as recovery of energy from solid waste.\nThe province also needs guidance in improving and rehabilitating the environment of solid waste burial sites as well as technical requirements and management processes related to environmental protection for waste treatment facilities.\nThe province also plans to establish 16 industrial complex and concentrated villages with total area of 344ha to gradually relocate production facilities out of residential areas and issue mechanisms to support businesses in building and installing wastewater treatment systems.

Everyone knows how a pond or a lake’s water can be cleared up significantly if treated with alum,” Tứ said.\nHe also noted how it would be more complicated as the Tô Lịch is no longer a true\xa0river, given that the freshwater supply that goes into the lake is dwarfed by other sources, namely wastewater and rainwater.\nTứ remarked that if the issue of wastewater discharges\xa0into the river is not dealt with, any solution would just be temporary.\nIn the short-term, Hanoians might no longer have to turn up their nose at the rancid smell, especially\xa0during the hot summer, but testing is needed before declaring\xa0the project successful, he added.\nPhạm Văn Cường, former director of Hà Nội’s water discharge project management unit, said the city is building the 4,800ha Yên Xá wastewater treatment factory with daily capacity of 270,000cu.m.\nOnce operational, the facility would collect and handle all wastewater discharged from households alongside the Tô Lịch River, which means the river would no longer have to bear the polluted water, Cường said.\nCity\xa0authorities are also considering pumping water from West Lake to flush out the pollution from the Tô Lịch River.\nPreviously, Lê Công Thành, deputy minister of environment and natural resources, said the Japanese\xa0technology being piloted at Tô Lịch River is merely a test\xa0and the results remain to be seen.\n“The ministry has assigned relevant units to constantly monitor the water’s quality and assess the efficiency as well as the practicality of the technology,” Thành said.\nAccording to the environment ministry, the pilot project will go on for two months with expenses borne by the Japanese side. — VNS\nThe stretch of Tô Lịch River near Hoàng Quốc Việt Street was choosen as the\xa0site for the cleanup operation project by Japan. — VNA/VNS Photo Huy Hùng",4

These drilling rigs have operated safely and sustainably, bringing in high efficiency for Vietsovpetro.\nThe successful manufacture of the drilling rigs Tam Đảo 03 and 05 has helped position Việt Nam as one of\xa0 the very few countries in the world that successfully made modern and international standard drilling rigs.\nThis is the first mechanical product manufactured in Việt Nam applying high technology with a localisation rate of 35 per cent.\nIt also affirmed the trademark of the petroleum sector’s mechanical manufacturing services when its products can replace imported deep water drilling platforms.\nThe petroleum engineering industry has also developed to be able to meet demands for oil rig manufacture and installation of foreign petroleum companies.\nIn 2014, the PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation (PTSC) announced the load-out and delivery of the Heera Redevelopment (HRD) Process Platform in southern Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province’s Vũng Tàu City after 17 months of manufacturing. The platform was highly appreciated by its investor, India's state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), partners, contractors and supervisors.\nThis is the first and biggest HRD Process Platform manufactured by a Vietnamese company for a foreign client via international bidding.\nThese achievements proved that petroleum engineering companies have gradually approached, implemented and mastered the technology of manufacturing and building petroleum projects which require high accuracy, skills, quality and safety standards.\nThe success construction of the Biển Đông 01 project, for example, can be considered a miracle of Việt Nam’s petroleum sector, which proves the potential of the petroleum engineering industry. It is considered the most complicated project of the petroleum sector in all aspects: progress, technology and scale.\nThe project was developed by the group to exploit two gas and condensate fields – Hải Thạch and Mộc Tinh with duration expected to be 25 years and a capacity of 8.5 million cubic metres of natural gas per day.\nAll the process, from designing, equipment and material purchasing and manufacturing, was implemented within 30 months. This is a record that not so many contractors in the world could do, according to the PVN. The project proved skills and knowledge of Vietnamese experts, engineers and workers in the petroleum industry.\nIn the new context, the PVN will strive to continue successfully manufacturing more modern petroleum mechanical projects with support from the State and Government and concerted efforts of its staff in spite of challenges ahead.\nAt a recent conference on measures to boost the development of the mechanical industry of Việt Nam, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc said that the Government would build a market for mechanical businesses to develop, including creating conditions for businesses to supply their products at domestic market and seek opportunities to expand export markets for petroleum mechanical products of Việt Nam. — VNS",2
