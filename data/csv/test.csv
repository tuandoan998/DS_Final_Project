Thus only more than 20 per cent of local women of childbearing age had knowledge of\xa0the disease.The province also lacks equipment and medicine\xa0to treat cervical cancer.Lê Thị Thu Cúc, deputy chairwoman of the Long An Federation of Trade Union, said many women refused to have the examination, thus education to raise women’s awareness on the disease prevention was very important.Võ Thị Định, deputy director of the provincial Diseases Control Centre, said cervical cancer could be treated completely with early discovery.The province has\xa0set up a draft project on cervical cancer screening for 2019-25, aiming that by 2025, as many as 60 per cent of local women between the age of 30 and 54 will receive free-of-charge screenings.All medical workers are hoped to be equipped with knowledge about the disease, and the province aims to acquire enough equipment for the work. — VNS'",1

1176,'National Assembly focuses on extinguishing huge fires',"HÀ NỘI — The National Assembly spent the whole day yesterday discussing the implementation of policies and laws on fire prevention and fighting from 2014-2018.During that time, failure to raise the alarm promptly was the main reason for huge fires that caused devastating losses.At the sitting, Chairman of the NA’s Committee of National Defence and Security Võ Trọng Việt presented a report regarding supervision of the issue.Việt stressed that huge fires were an emerging issue that needed to be focused on.Between July 2014 and July 2018, only giant blazes were reported, accounting for 0.96 per cent of the total number of cases, but causing devastating consequences.In those incidents, 35 people were killed and 72 others were injured. They caused estimated damage of more than VNĐ4.9 trillion (US$211 million), accounting for 76.2 per cent of the total.Việt said most big huge fires were caused by slow reactions of people and authorised agencies. Fires were detected but the alarm was raised late, allowing them to spread which made tackling them all the more challenging.Notably, up to 80 per cent of blazes were reported to the fire service at least ten minutes after they broke out. Sometimes it took 30 minutes before agencies were informed.Việt cited the fire at Tuấn Thông Trading and Commerce Co,Ltd in HCM City, which produced plastic items, as an example. Firefighters were only informed about the two blazes 42 and 48 minutes after they broke out.Thousands of square metres of factories were burnt down due to the delay, causing billions of\xa0đồng\xa0in losses.Việt said the total number of fires during the period reviewed was high - more than 13,140, killing 346 people and leaving 823 injured.Fires mostly broke out in urban areas and densely populated areas, accounting for 60 per cent. Of that, 42 per cent were reportedly house fires.Despite the complicated nature of fires, the implementation of firefighting policies had been neglected and impractical, he said.Many fire drills did not look at the reality of residential areas in HCM City and Hà Nội located down deep alleys with high population densities, which caused difficulties for firefighters.Urban water supplies in Hà Nội, Hải Phòng and Khánh Hoà Province did not meet the requirements, while natural water sources from ponds, lakes, rivers and canals used for firefighting had been exhausted due to the rapidly increasing rate of construction.The report also revealed the network of firefighting and rescue teams failed to meet the requirements.There was only one firefighting and rescue team for areas covering hundreds of kilometres.On average, each officer was in charge of managing 150 establishments in six districts, and between five to 10 residential areas while the stipulated number was no more than 100 establishments.The number of vehicles equipped for firefighting was substandard as nearly 30 per cent of trucks had been in use for more than 20 years, and 23.5 per cent were in poor condition.In addition, special firefighting vehicles for blazes involving gasoline and chemicals at large-scale industrial zones or underground projects were still lacking.Deputy Đoàn Thị Thanh Mai from Hưng Yên Province said the firefighting organisation in urban areas needed due attention.Mai said deep alleys and traffic congestion had blocked fire trucks from accessing many blazes. The city was facing a shortage of 7,000 hydrants, 300 reservoirs and 400 natural sources.Thus, it was urgent to revise and build a qualified infrastructure system for the work.Mai suggested that construction projects should only be put into use after fire prevention measures had been checked and accepted, and they should be periodically checked. Fire drills would also be held to improve people's ability to respond to fires, especially in high-rise apartment buildings.Deputy Leo Thị Lịch from Bắc Giang Province raised concern over the restricted design of firefighting vehicles.Ladders on fire trucks could reach the 20th floor, while encroachment on residential areas, commercial centres and big markets were common, blocking the ways for trucks to reach blazes.Lịch said local police and officers should be trained to react quickly to fires. Local authorities needed to strengthen inspections of private businesses, especially karaoke bars, to ensure the implementation of regulations on fire prevention and fighting.Those found violating the regulations must be closed down, she said.Deputy Cao Thị Xuân from Thanh Hoá Province reminded the NA of a recent forest fire which was caused by human carelessness.Seven hectares of forest in Hương Sơn District was razed when a farmer tried to burn wild grass. The farmer was sentenced to two years in jail.Another farmer in Nghi Sơn District was put behind bars for setting light to a protection forest while trying to burn leaves in his garden.Xuân said education was needed to protect the forests.To improve effectiveness, the NA supervision delegation asked the Government to continue building policies on firefighting and rescue.Local authorities, in co-operation with the Ministry of Public Security, needed to build criteria on fire prevention and fighting and a plan to stop construction works that failed to meet the fire regulations.This would require the ministry to classify high-risk areas and prepare measures to react promptly in the case of fire. — VNS",1

A great run by Văn Toàn into the host’s box gave him a shooting opportunity.But after twisting and turning his effort was tame\xa0and easily cleared to safety.After the break Thailand made one change, with Sumanya Purisai coming on for Sarach Yooyen.There were few chances to begin with but the match did spring into life on 64 minutes as both teams clashed in the middle of the pitch.Some needless pushing and shoving led to yellow cards being shown to Nguyễn Văn Toàn and Theerathon Bunmathon with the Vietnamese striker substituted a minute later.After 70 minutes the ball eventually found the back of the net from a Thai free-kick – only for the goal to be disallowed.On 81 minutes, Quang Hải, who was largely anonymous by his high standards, found himself on the edge of the box but the star man dragged his shot wide.The late drama was to come though, as the recently un-retired from international duty\xa0Anh Đức stepped up to send the travelling supporters wild.

The more I train, the better I get. It's made\xa0me more confident to\xa0try harder,” said Huyền, who is the\xa0mother of a 10-month girl.“I am confident but I still need to work hard because I will face many naturalised runners at\xa0the SEA Games. I should run without any pressure and\xa0just stay focused.“I had\xa0to overcome challenges after giving birth before getting back to training. I hope to reach my peak\xa0at the Games to make all this work worthwhile,” she said.According to head coach Vũ Ngọc Lợi, Huyền had\xa0quickly regained\xa0her form.Huyền will compete in the 400m hurdles and 4x400m relay, although she wants a chance to defend her title in the 400m. She is also a\xa0substitute in the 4x200m relay.“She is doing great. She has a problem with her nerves\xa0during competition.

I just want to do well in all four,” she said.“Athletes always compete under pressure but my teammates and I will not let this pressure affect us. We will compete with an open\xa0mind which will help to push us ahead.”Lan has competed at\xa0three Games but has never\xa0won an\xa0individual gold.“It is really unlucky. First it was an injury I sustained just days ahead of the tournament, then my rivals were just to fast for me, even though I tried my best.”This time Lan is at\xa0her peak and will face the comeback of her teammate Huyền, who may threaten her golden hopes.However she considers it an encouragement.“It is no problem for\xa0me. Her return provides\xa0strong motivation\xa0for me. It pushes me to work harder and both of us could lift our results.

2382,'Seminar discusses ways to add value to farm produce',"'HCM CITY — Improving production technologies, designs and packaging are among the important factors that could add value to Vietnamese farm produce, businesses have said.Nguyễn Thị Các Thủy of Tây Cát Co., Ltd said to improve traditional products, producers needed to adopt technology, do research to enhance product quality and improve product designs.If businesses were constantly innovating, regardless of their scale they could enhance the value of their agricultural products, she told a seminar in HCM City on Monday.Lê Thị Thanh Lâm, deputy general director of Saigon Food JSC, said her company sold products such as fresh porridge, processed seafood, frozen seafood, and vegetables, and besides improving product quality and offering competitive prices, it had also changed the packaging of its fresh porridge products many times since launch.These had helped the company increase market share and win consumers’ trust, she added.According to experts, the agricultural sector needs to develop modern value chains, enhance linkages between various stakeholders and strictly conform to good agricultural practices, food safety standards and product traceability to ensure development.Võ Phương Thủy, deputy director of Đồng Tháp Province Department of Industry and Trade, said in the past the department used to help farmers find outlets for their produce, but now it would connect them with distributors and large businesses for the two sides to work out their requirements.It also often provides farmers and businesses with market information to enable them to meet consumers’ demands.Seo Fumio, deputy general director of AEON Vietnam’s purchase division, said AEON’s first priority was to ensure customer safety followed by\xa0convenience.Agricultural products and specialities, especially fresh vegetables and fruits, need to have certificates such as VietGap, Global Gap and Organic to be able to enter AEON supermarket shelves.There are many aspects that farmers in the Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta need to improve, according to Fumio.Firstly, they, and Vietnamese farmers in general, mostly focus on output but should shift it to improving product quality.Farmers sell their products through many layers of middlemen, and as a result consumers do not know the origin of products.Delegates agreed that besides ensuring consistent quality and obtaining production certificates, enterprises would need to also ensure product traceability.They should research market trends to come up with the right products, they said.Organised by the Business Association of Vietnamese High Quality Products and the Business Studies and Assistance Centre, the seminar was a pre-event of the 2019 Mekong Connect Forum to be held in Cần Thơ next month. — VNS'",2

Roads near EPZs and IPs were often overloaded, leading to higher production costs for their tenants and reducing their competitiveness, Trần Trọng Tiến, a representative of enterprises in Tân Thuận\xa0Export Processing Zone said.Other problems included flooding, lack of schools, accommodation and medical facilities for workers and their families, Tiến said.The limited availability of skilled IT and management personnel was also an issue.To address these problems, administrative procedures related to investment, labour and construction in the\xa0EPZs and IPs\xa0needed to be simplified to attract foreign investment.The quality of life and working environment for workers needed to be improved.Đào Xuân Đức, deputy head of the HCM City\xa0Export Processing Zones and Industrial Parks Authority (Hepza), said the city would make all EPZs and IPs green, clean and hi-tech by 2025 and build new hi-tech zones for supporting industries.The city targeted having 23 EPZs and IPs with an area of around 6,000ha\xa0by 2020.Priority would be given to current investors in hi-tech, Industry 4.0 technologies and parts supply industries with high value-addition.Losing sheenThe city is losing its advantages over neighbouring provinces, and one of the main reasons is its high land rental rates.The average rental in its EPZs and IPs is US$120 per meter square.

4860,"'To-your-health: Vaccination, what is it all about?'","'by Dr Mathieu Nalpas*How was vaccination\xa0discovered?The concept of vaccination and immunisation is very ancient. Evidence of early inoculation to protect people from some disease was found in China. However, the rate of success and protection was not very good. The first modern vaccine was developed in England in the late 18th Century and was used against an infectious disease called smallpox or variola.Another version of this infection was affecting cows; its name was cowpox or vaccine. The words vaccine and vaccination come from the vaccine disease. The word vaccine comes from the Latin word vacca, which means cow.In the 18th century, farmers who were milking the cows could get infected with the cowpox virus. They suffered skin lesions and pustules on their hands and arms, but nothing very severe.During smallpox epidemics, the milkmaids would not become infected with smallpox even when in contact with people suffering from the disease.In 1796, in England, the scientist Edward Jenner injected material from a cowpox virus into an 8 year old boy with the idea that this would provide the protection needed to save people from deadly outbreaks of the related smallpox virus. It was a success. The eight-year-old was inoculated against the disease and it became the first ever vaccine. Vaccination was born.What is the immune system?The immune system protects us against threats and aggression from outside, such as virus and bacteria.The main cells of our immune system are white blood cells. There are millions of them circulating in our body like a little army watching for something unusual to penetrate the body.If a microbe invades us, the white blood cells react and multiply into an army of millions of clones who will attack and destroy the invaders. The signs of this immune response working are the coughing, sneezing, inflammation, and fever we experience which work to trap and rid the body of threatening things like bacteria.Our second line of defence is called adaptive immunity. Special white blood cells create a memory of what the germs look like and how best to fight them. If the same pathogen invades us again in the future, our immune system will have the memory of previous infection and will react much more quickly and effectively. The weapons of adaptive immunity are antibodies.How do vaccines work?Doctors use vaccines to trigger a response from the immune system without exposing humans to the full infectious disease.Vaccines work in two ways.First, vaccines help to create a standing army of antibodies circulating in our body, ready to trigger fast and effective immune response to an infectious pathogen.The second mechanism is just as important. It is called herd immunity. It works on a community level. Widespread vaccination reduces the ability of a virus to circulate. With fewer infected people walking around, fewer infected people are passing the disease around, therefore epidemics become very unlikely.This is very important because some vaccines might be contraindicating for some people, in case of severe allergic reaction for example or immune deficiency.This herd immunity is essential for preventing outbreaks and protecting vulnerable individuals.What about side effects of vaccination?Side effects of vaccines are usually very moderate and not severe. Around the point of injection we can have mild pain, redness and swelling. A low grade fever can occur for a short period of time – nothing to worry about.Serious reactions to vaccines are very rare, the main one being an allergic reaction that can lead to anaphylactic shock. This kind of allergic reaction can happen with any kind of medicine and even with food. This is not something specific to vaccines and we should not be afraid of allergies with vaccines. Even if such a reaction starts to occur, it is usually treatable with good care – doctors know how to deal with allergies and they have medicines for it.Where do mistrust and fear about vaccinations come from?The first reason is amnesia. As far as infectious diseases are concerned, we are living in a much healthier world compared to only 100 years ago. Progress in medicine and hygiene has reduced the burden of countless diseases. Antibiotics and vaccinations are the main actors in this progress.As a consequence, people forgot about many diseases, they forgot how severe and deadly they could be.The second reason is misinformation, controversy and misinterpretation. Nowadays, fake and inaccurate information is more likely to be widely spread and, then, will strongly influence and badly damage trusts about vaccinations.There is a large scientific consensus to say that vaccinations and vaccines are safe and effective. They contributed to eradicate one deadly infectious disease from the planet (smallpox), it dramatically reduced the burden of many other infections and therefore saved millions and millions of lives and it continues to do so every single day. Fear and suspicion about vaccination are irrational and are not based on scientific evidence. — Family Medical Practice*Dr Mathieu Nalpas is a general practitioner graduated from Lille Medical University in \xa0France.

1379,'Recent deaths raise alarm over unlicenced plastic surgery clinics',"HCM CITY Two women died last week in HCM City after undergoing plastic surgery.The city’s Department of Health has called the deaths serious medical incidents, raising concerns over the quality and oversight of plastic surgery clinics in the city.On October 14, a 59-year-old Vietnamese-American woman died after getting a facelift at Kangnam Plastic Surgery Hospital in District 3.On October 18, a 33-year-old woman died after a\xa0breast\xa0enhancement surgery.The city's Department of Health has established a professional council to probe into the cases.The problem isn't confined to HCM City though. In Hà Nội, recently, a 28-year-old woman fainted and suffered convulsions after having abdominal liposuction at a plastic surgery clinic on Kim Ngưu Street and had to be rushed to a nearby hospital.According to the law, facilities offering surgeries to alter the body like nose jobs, breast enhancements, botox injections and liposuction must be granted licences and can be conducted at hospitals only.Plastic surgery hospitals must meet strict requirements of local departments of health as complications can still occur even in\xa0 licensed facilities as the ones mentioned above.Authorities conduct unscheduled inspections to test doctors’ capacity because surgeons must take\xa0classes to learn new knowledge every two years.According to Nguyễn Việt Cường, chief inspectorate of Hà Nội Department of Health, plastic surgery facilities must have a head doctor with at least 54 months of experience. Technical workers need training and licences from their local department of health.Plastic surgery facilities must also meet requirements in terms of infrastructure, he said.Đặng Thị Xuân Hương, vice chairwoman of Việt Nam Beauty Association, said as demand for plastic surgery had grown, beauty clinics had mushroomed. These clinics got licences for surgeries which do not alter the body but advertised nose jobs, breast enhancements and other surgeries.“These centres do not have doctors but only technical workers who are trained for a few months before doing real things. The customers are women who are lured by advertisements and willing to undergo plastic surgeries that may lead to risky complications,” she said.This fact may result from the loose management of authorities. Plastic surgery clinics do not care about consequences and conduct surgeries for profits. Meanwhile, customers can not check whether the centres are licensed, according to Hương.Professor Lê Gia Vinh, vice chairman and general secretary of Việt Nam Medical Association, said many women want to be more beautiful quickly and cheap, so they choose unlicensed or low-quality facilities, leading to serious complications.“Those who are willing to conduct plastic surgeries should choose facilities with modern equipment and skilful surgeons and not go to nail and eyebrow salons to avoid unexpected consequences,” Professor Vinh said.

2204,'Foreign insurers eye promising Vietnamese market',"'HÀ NỘI — Growing demand for health care and disease prevention in Việt Nam offers great opportunities for life insurers, especially foreign firms, to develop.Better income has led to more attention on health among many Vietnamese. The World Bank predicts that by 2026, 26 per cent of Vietnamese will be middle class, double the number today. The average growth rate of the insurance market in Viet Nam in\xa02012-2017 was 21.4 per cent, much higher than the Philippines (14.4 per cent) and China (14.4 per cent).Along with expansion strategies, life insurance firms have entered a fierce race to increase charter capital to improve their financial strength to attract customers. Among 18 life insurers in Việt Nam, Bảo Việt Life is the only domestic firm.This year, Manulife has increased its charter capital to nearly VNĐ9.7 trillion (US$418.6 million), Hanwha Life Vietnam increased its charter capital to VNĐ 5 trillion ($215.7 million) from VNĐ 1.89 trillion ($81.5 million), Generali Việt Nam injected additional capital, bringing the current charter capital to VNĐ4.85 trillion ($209.3 million).Compared\xa0to most of the mentioned foreign insurers, Bảo Việt Life\xa0has lower charter capital of VNĐ 4.15 trillion ($179 million).In the field of newly exploited contracts,\xa0considered one of the most important categories for life insurers, Manulife leads with revenue from new customers of VNĐ2.72 trillion ($17.3 million). Bảo Việt Life was second with\xa0revenue of VNĐ2.64 trillion ($113.9 million).Notably, the number of newly exploited contracts via bancassurance in 2019\xa0increased by 180 per cent year-on-year while the new premium revenue of this channel accounted for 17.8 per cent of the total newly exploited revenue of the entire market.Lots of potentialsDespite spectacular growth in the past few years, according to experts, Việt Nam\'s life insurance market remains relatively untapped.Experts are\xa0upbeat about the Vietnamese insurance industry’s health in the coming years, forecasting it would maintain an annual double digit growth rate. The insurance industry expects a growth rate of 20 per cent this year.The growth potential is great as the country has one of the world’s lowest life insurance penetration levels at less than 1 per cent of GDP. The average insurance premium in Việt Nam stands at $30, much lower than the global average of $595 and Southeast Asia’s average of $74.Data of the Việt Nam Insurance Association showed\xa08 per cent of Việt Nam’s population currently has life insurance. Though there is no updated data, the number of insurance contracts signed via bancassurance in the first half of last year grew by 89 per cent year-on-year, reaching nearly 857,000 contracts.""The potential for further development is enormous, especially as the middle class continues to expand rapidly and awareness of risks such as increased cancer,"" said the CEO of a foreign insurance firm in the market.Bloomberg reported on September 23, billionaire Richard Li\'s FWD Group\xa0Ltd. was nearing an agreement to pay about\xa0$400 million\xa0for the purchase\xa0of\xa0Vietcombank\'s Cardif Life Insurance.There are also domestic insurers which have launched life insurance products like Bao Minh or PVI however, a report of Rồng Việt Securities Company said: “The products of domestic companies are relatively similar.

2585,'Virtual telecom operators eye\xa0opportunities in Việt Nam',"By Mai HươngHÀ NỘI – Virtual telecom carriers have a great opportunity to gain a foothold in Việt Nam’s market thanks to the country’s open regulatory environment and young and tech-savvy population.Việt Nam is one of the youngest mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) markets in the world, with the first virtual operator launched in April this year.A virtual network operator does not own network infrastructure, instead it purchases telecommunication services from traditional mobile network operators (MNO) and resells network services after repackaging at lower prices.The pioneering Indochina Telecom Company (ITelecom) has entered into an agreement with Vinaphone, a mobile subsidiary of State-owned telecom VNPT, which allows it access to the company's network services and offer its own.The pre-fix of its mobile service is 087.According to the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC), a legal framework had been established for virtual telecommunication networks.Following ITelecom, the ministry has granted a licence to Mobicast Joint Stock Company. Mobicast is currently preparing to launch.Both companies have registered to provide basic, value-added telecommunications services which are similar to those of traditional carriers.“The MVNO model will help save investment costs for businesses and a avoid waste of social resources when unused traffic and infrastructure of MNOs can be exploited by carriers that do not have their own infrastructure,” Nguyễn Phong Nhã, deputy general director of the MIC’s Authority of Telecommunications, told\xa0Việt Nam News.In Việt Nam, the Law on Telecommunications 2009 and Decree 25 dated in April 2011 showed telecom companies how to establish MVNOs and provide telecom services through obtaining bulk access to networks wholesale rates and then setting retail prices independently.“In the near future, the launch of a 5G network with low latency, extremely high speed or equipment density per kilometre will open up many opportunities for businesses to provide mobile services without investing in network infrastructure,” Nhã said.Telecom industry website\xa0telecoms.com\xa0has put Việt Nam in the watch list for impressive growth drivers for MVNOs in the Asia-Pacific region, along with China, Australia, Singapore and Japan.Việt Nam has the advantages of a young, tech-savvy population with a high rate of smartphone penetration backed up by a fast, extensive 4G network. The country has plans to launch 5G, with Viettel and MobiFone having already provided a pilot 5G network in HCM City.5G, together with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), e-SIM and soft-SIM, bodes well for hopeful MVNOs.Foreign mobile carriers have reported to be eyeing the Vietnamese market. At the MVNOs World Congress in Amsterdam in May this year, Malaysia’s redONE said it had plans to expand to Thailand and Việt Nam this October.Việt Nam News\xa0could not reach redONE for confirmation.At the MVNOs Asia 2019 which was held in Việt Nam for the first time last week, some foreign companies expressed their interest in the MVNO sector in Việt Nam, wanting to seek partnerships to jointly develop this sector.MVNO is a fledgling marketEven in China it was only last year that it started completing the commercialisation of virtual telecom operators after a five-year pilot scheme, with licences issued for 15 virtual telecom operators including big names such as Alibaba, Xiaomi and JD. Virtual telecoms have attracted about 5 per cent of the total market of 1.2 billion mobile subscriptions.In Việt Nam, according to Nhã, the mobile telecommunications market had reached a saturated point with the dominant presence of veteran MNOs including Viettel and VNPT (through Vinaphone and MobiFone), so it will be very hard for MVNOs to compete with these giants.“As MVNOs don’t own infrastructure but have to lease it from MNOs, they will be under pressure in negotiating contracts with them. MVNOs need to select specific services that do not compete directly with traditional MNOs,” Nhã said.For example, ITelecom has focused its initial service offerings on industrial workers in nine provinces and cities with low cost packages. — VNS",2

1180,'Centre for toxic chemicals and environmental treatment established',"HÀ NỘI — A ceremony to announce the establishment of the National Action Centre for Toxic Chemicals and Environmental Treatment (NACCET) was held yesterday in Hà Nội.In July, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc signed the decision to establish the NACCET.The organisation will be responsible for running tasks to overcome the post war consequences of chemical toxins to environment and humans; handling pollution of toxic chemicals and hazardous substances, overcoming incidents of toxic chemicals and environment nationwide; and building and managing a database on overcoming post war consequences of toxic chemicals.Hà Văn Cử, General Director of the NACCET, said while the war had ended long ago, its consequences remained.“Tackling post-war toxic chemicals and carrying out activities to ensure security and safety of the environment is an urgent and long-term task. It is both a humanitarian task and a task to ensure the sustainable and prosperous development of the country,” Cử said.Incidents like the recent mercury pollution and water safety issue in Ha Noi showed the increasing risk of chemical pollution, he said.“Threats to environmental security have been increasing in terms of scale and seriousness in the past year,” he said.Speaking at the ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam emphasised the importance of establishing the NACCET.“There still remains a huge amount of dioxin-contaminated land in Việt Nam, millions of toxic chemicals in the soil, millions of people who suffered from dioxin contamination after the war. That’s a problem we need to deal with,” Đam said.He also said that like many in other countries, environmental protection had been neglected for a while.“The need to address pollution and chemicals detoxification is urgent,” he said, adding that the establishment of the NACCET is timely.He asked the centre leaders to focus on human resources and technology investment, while also calling on international organisations to support Việt Nam on the issue.Speaking at the event, Caryn McClelland, deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in Hà Nội, said the US was committed to supporting the development of Việt Nam.“Last year, the USAID committed a funding of US$183 million for the initial five years of the dioxin remediation project at Biên Hoà Airport. This is the largest remaining hotspot of dioxin contamination in Việt Nam,” she said.While it would take Việt Nam and the US 10 years and up to $390 million to clean the Biên Hoà site, McClelland said US commitment was only increasing.“There have been zero UXO accidents in the last 20 months in the areas where we concentrate our efforts in Quảng Trị Province,” she said.Over the next five years, USAID has committed more than $65 million to work with the Ministry of Defence, Office 701 and the NACCET to implement the next phase of US’s support for persons with disabilities, according to the official.The NACCET will also carry out research and technology transfer to help overcome post war consequences of toxic chemicals, handling pollution of toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, and toxic chemical incidents treatment.It will be responsible for running programmes and working plans on overcoming post war consequences of toxic chemicals, as well as treating toxic chemicals, hazardous substances and overcoming incidents of toxic chemicals.The Prime Minister assigned the Ministry of National Defence to be responsible for NACCET's activities.--VNS",1
666,'Lawmakers debate funding regulations for public works',"'The current Law on Public Investment, which took effect in 2014, says the NA is in charge of approving the total amount of public investment capital to be disbursed over a period of five years.The Government is responsible for submitting a list of key national projects to be funded with the State budget and setting the amount of investment capital to be given to each project, with the total not to exceed the limit set by the NA.The draft revised law on public investment discussed by the NA gathering proposes transferring the power to set funding for individual public projects from the Government to the NA, while still allowing the legislative body to set the total amount of funding for all projects in the five-year term.The Government would no longer be allowed to approve funding levels for each project.Deputy Lê Thanh Vân from Cà Mau Province supported the draft. Vân said making decisions on how to fund public investment projects was one of the NA’s key responsibilities.Deputy Tôn Ngọc Hạnh from Bình Phước Province said that with the NA’s heavy workload, it would be unrealistic to expect the legislative body to approve and adjust specific funding for as many as 9,000 projects in five years.Other lawmakers disagreed, saying the NA’s approval process would not take too much time if the Government makes careful preparations before submitting investment plans.Unfocused investmentDeputy Lê Thanh Vân said the implementation of the mid-term public investment plan had faced difficulties, including a failure to follow public investment law regulations because the Government’s advisory team had not completed all of the tasks assigned by the NA.Deputy Nguyễn Thị Quyết Tâm from HCM City proposed the Government attempt to determine whether slow disbursement of public investment funds for key national projects was due to structural problems with the Law on Public Investment or poor implementation of its regulations.Speaking with Vietnam News Agency reporters on the sidelines of the meeting on Tuesday, deputy Nguyễn Đức Kiên from Sóc Trăng Province said the cost overrun of Bến Thành-Suối Tiên metro project in HCM City and the slow disbursement of funds to hospitals in Hà Nội and HCM City showed that the problems lie in unfocused and ineffective implementation of the law rather than any flaw with the law itself.According to deputy Hoàng Văn Cường from Hà Nội, the Law on Public Investment must prioritise urgent and realistic projects to address transportation problems, support people in mountainous areas and help stabilise lives.He proposed the Government issue a set of quality standards for State budget–invested projects after the revised law is passed. Localities which meet the criteria would be selected to receive public investment.The criteria would help avoid wasteful spending, select suitable projects and assess their efficacy after they are complete, he said.

3700,'Heat inversion worsens\xa0air pollution in Hà Nội: report',"'HÀ NỘI — Many studies in Hà Nội have shown that heat inversion is one of the main causes for recent sharp rises in pollutants, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE).In a report released on Wednesday, the MoNRE said that in order to comprehensively assess air quality in a certain area, it is necessary to analyse and evaluate the monitoring data of many parameters continuously on different days throughout the year.The report was released after Hà Nội’s air quality has been reported at harmful levels over recent days.The monitoring results showed that the air pollution is mainly dust, especially PM2.5, a single particle that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres.Other parameters such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone are still within permissible limits, except for some spots near roads with elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide.The report said that during summer months in the rainy season, air quality is the best of the year. However, sometimes abnormal meteorological conditions led to increases in dust concentration.Last Monday, the PM2.5 dust concentration increased, thus air quality remained at a harmful level at air monitoring stations in the capital city.The PM2.5 dust concentration reached the highest level at night and dawn last Monday, possibly because of a lack of wind limiting the circulation of pollutants, according to the report.In order to explain the meteorological conditions that cause the dust concentration to increase suddenly, it is necessary to conduct further studies.Recent research by the Hà Nội University of Natural Resources and Environment said that heat inversion was an atmospheric phenomenon that occurred when the temperature of the upper atmosphere is greater than the temperature of the lower atmosphere.Heat inversion occurs at different times of the year, often with high frequency in the winter when the air is stable, the nights are long and cold air is flowing in.When heat inversion occurs, it stops the atmosphere disturbance process leaving pollutants trapped in the atmosphere.This process raises the concentration of pollutants and affects human health.In developing countries, many studies have shown that human health is affected by polluted air during the days of heat inversion. Heat inversion also causes acute respiratory diseases.The MoNRE believes that to improve polluted air in Hà Nội, it’s necessary to limit the number of personal vehicles in the city and encourage environmentally-friendly public transportation.Industrial enterprises should be moved to suburban areas and reduce waste from construction work.More inspections should also be conducted on vehicles. — VNS'",4

1002,"'HCM City has new\xa0plan to eliminate\xa0homelessness, begging on streets'","HCM CITY — Though HCM City has tried to take care of beggars and the homeless for years, many people continue to beg for money, saying they have had goods or cash stolen, or need to find their lost relatives, among other explanations.For example, a middle-aged woman regularly stands near a gas station on the corner of Nguyễn Văn Cừ and Nguyễn Trãi streets in District 5 to look for handouts, according to a report in Sài Gòn Giải Phóng (Liberated Sài Gòn) newspaper.When a driver stops at the gas station, the woman helps them open up the gas tank cover and waits for the bike owner to make the next move. After the driver pays for the gas, the woman then immediately asks for money. If she doesn't receive any, she argues that she deserves it because she helped open the tank cover.Since most bike owners want to avoid problems and not be told that they are selfish, they give the woman VNĐ5,000 or VNĐ10,000. Within a fairly short period, the woman is able to earn hundreds of thousands\xa0of đồng.A similar circumstance can be seen at a gas station on Lý Thường Kiệt Street in District 5 where a middle-aged man is “in charge”. In addition to opening and closing the gas tank lids in exchange for money, many other scams have been recognised.In particular, a woman holding a sick-looking child usually sits on the pavement of District 11’s Âu Cơ Street. Many people give her money but others volunteer to take the child to the hospital. But the woman refuses, explaining that she just wants money to take care of the child herself.Other beggars tell people they need money because they have missed their train home or their motorbike needs repair.The city's hotspots for begging include: the Nguyễn Thái Học – Trần Hưng Đạo Intersection in District 1; Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa – Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai Intersection and Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai – Cách Mạng Tháng 8 Intersection in District 3; Nguyễn Trãi – Nguyễn Văn Cừ Intersection and Nguyễn Trãi – Châu Văn Liêm Intersection in District 5; and Cộng Hoà – Út Tịch Intersection and Bảy Hiền Intersection in Tân Bình District; among others.Ineffective plansTo address the situation, the city's Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs has submitted a report to the city's People’s Committee on a draft plan dealing with the homeless situation through 2020. The department's goal is to end the situation by the end of 2020.However, experts are concerned that this new draft plan is similar to former ineffective plans.In 2010, the city's Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs aimed to eliminate begging by the end of 2010. Then a year later. The department submitted another plan that focused on getting rid of begging in several central districts by 2013 and citywide by 2015.At the end of 2014, the city began encouraging beggars and the homeless to visit or stay at social protection centres. A similar goal was set in early 2015, with the aim of solving the problem by the end of April, 2016. However, the problem persisted.According to the city's Department of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs, the homeless and beggars who stay at social protection centres receive general education and vocational training, with the aim of eliminating literacy and offering them access to primary school education.The flexible training period allows them to quickly return to their localities, find proper jobs, and have stable lives. The centres also work with businesses to find jobs for former beggars or the homeless.To provide the best conditions for them to reintegrate into the community, the Department of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs sends a notification to its counterparts in neighbouring provinces, asking them to offer support to beggars and the homeless.For those who continue to stay in HCM City, the People’s Committees of districts and wards are responsible for connecting the homeless or beggars with their families who are asked to promise that their relatives stop begging or living on the streets. Authorities consider each problem case by case, and then offer support to the former beggars and the homeless. VNS",1

The deal caused losses of more than VNĐ6.47 trillion ($278.21 million) to the State.Sơn also allegedly received $3 million from AVG chairman Vũ while Trà, Hải and Tuấn got $2.5 million, $500,000 and $200,000, respectively, to accelerate the transaction.The families of Trà, Hải and Tuấn have handed over more than VNĐ68 billion in total to the Investigation Police Authority under the Ministry of Public Security to make up for the losses they caused.Authorities\xa0have seized Sơn and Tuấn’s houses and land and frozen their bank accounts. — VNS'",0

4536,'Psychologists help couple and families as well as individuals',"'By Matthew Ryan*Most psychologists are trained to offer therapy to individuals suffering mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. There is a specialisation in psychotherapy which focuses on relational problems – this speciality is often referred to as couple and family therapy. A psychologist trained in this form of therapy rather than focusing on the individuals that make up the couple or family\xa0assesses and treats problematic patterns that have developed between them over time. Just as an individual moves through a series of stages so too do couples and families. As a couple or family moves from one stage to another they can encounter difficulties because the skills and roles required by the next stage are often quite different from those of the previous stage.For example when two people fall in love and decide to marry or move in together they move from a state of being on their own to sharing their lives. Some people who have been very competent looking after themselves can find themselves partially or completely out of their depth when they are required to live with and relate intimately to another human being. Some of the potential problems for a new couple include:Any of these difficulties can threaten to derail the couple’s relationship, causing misunderstandings, arguments, and disillusionment. Dysfunctional patterns of relating to each other develop and if not corrected become quite entrenched and very difficult to change. Without insight or help one or both partners can begin to sadly or even angrily conclude they have made a terrible mistake and begin to seriously consider separation and/or divorce.A couple and family therapist is skilled at assisting the couple to discover new learning, behaviours and skills that will enable them to escape the dysfunctional patterns that have bound and imprisoned them so that they may joyfully reconnect with each other.A very critical stage in the life of a couple occurs when the first child arrives. As in the move from being on one’s own to becoming a couple, they may be very competent and happy as a couple, but can find that the arrival of the first child causes significant challenges and difficulties. They must now assume new roles, that of mother and father. These are much different roles from that of lovers and partners. Some of the problems couples experience with the arrival of children include:Again a family therapist can be very helpful in assisting the couple to deal with the challenges and difficulties that children bring.All along the family life cycle new challenges present and possible difficulties between the couple as new stages are reached, such as:* Matthew Ryan is a senior psychologist who has been supporting and assisting people to work through their personal and relational problems, for more than 30\xa0years.As a couple and family psychologist, Matthew’s role is to help each person in the relationship see how they contribute to their dysfunctional ways of relating, and what changes are necessary to resolve their difficulties.Matthew is also experienced in working with teenage males and females as they face the challenges of stepping into young adulthood.\xa0In addition, Matthew is experienced in providing counseling to people from the LGBT community.For more advice on any medical topics, visit\xa0www.vietnammedicalpractice.com; www.care24h.com.vn or visit our clinics:Family Medical Practice Hanoi on 298 I Kim Mã Street, Ba Đình District or call (024) 3843 0748.

It also establishes criteria for evaluating a safe water supply work.At\xa0a recent conference hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Directorate of Water Resources and East Meets West Foundation in Hà Nội, a\xa0representative from the Directorate of Water Resources said since 2013, many provinces have actively enacted policies to call on the private economic sector in rural clean water supply works.While piped water supply systems have increased in rural areas, more than 30 per cent of community managed and public water works are out of service.According to a Directorate of Water Resources’ latest report, most of the rural water supply works in northern Thái Bình Province have been transferred to the enterprise for management.In northern Bắc Giang Province, 12 local enterprises have built and are managing water plants that supply clean water to about 124,000 people.In northern Hà Nam Province, from two in 2013, now there are 11 enterprises built and managing rural water supply works\xa0serving 150,000 people.In the Mekong Delta province of Tiền Giang, there are 15 enterprises invested for water supply system with 13 among total 29 provincial plants managed by local companies.However, the representative said: “The rural population is sparse while the acreage is large. Many areas are developing so constructing water supply works requires high cost but economic efficiency is low. Investors must consider before joining.“We lack of capital mobilising measures. Many provinces have had supportive policies but not enough financial resources to support the private sector.”The conference reviewed the Innovations for Private Sector Development Project (PSI), funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affair and Trade ( DFAT), that has carried out in three nations: Việt Nam, Laos and Cambodia.In Việt Nam, the AU$2 million-funded PSI started in 2016 has succeeded in providing new piped water works for more than 6,600 rural households.

She said the landslide victory for the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) demonstrated the absolute confidence of Cambodian voters and people in the CPP’s leadership.The Vietnamese lawmaker also extended her congratulations to the Cambodian NA on the successful hosting of the 27th Annual Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Siem Reap last January.Recent high-level visits between the two Parties, States and NAs marked a new stage in the development of the Việt Nam-Cambodia relationship, she said.Phóng suggested the two sides maintain their relations through all diplomatic channels including their parties, states and especially NAs, along with people-to-people diplomacy.She called for a joint effort to educate the young generations of Việt Nam and Cambodia about traditions and the history of relations between the two parties and states, and about strengthening the long-standing solidarity between the two countries.The two legislatures should intensify co-ordination in supervising the implementation of agreements reached by the two governments and promote the planting of border markers to build a peaceful border area. These moves would boost friendship and development for the common interests of both nations, helping to ensure peace and stability in the region, she said.Phóng proposed Cambodia create optimal conditions for Vietnamese businesses to operate in the country, and thanked senior Cambodian leaders for their attention to issues relating to Vietnamese-Cambodians. She expressed the hope that the community would receive more assistance to stabilise their lives.The Vietnamese leader also suggested the two sides continue to support each other at international forums, which would help enhance the prestige of the two countries and their legislative agencies.Phóng voiced her hope the Cambodian legislature and government would back Việt Nam’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2020-2021 tenure.Sudary highlighted the sustainable development of relations between the two countries and their legislatures.Congratulating Việt Nam on achievements under the CPV’s leadership, she said the country held an increasingly important role in the region and the world.The Cambodian leader lauded Việt Nam’s development and noted her belief that the country would soon complete its targets of national industrialisation and modernisation.Sudary said Cambodia was stepping up the deployment of strategies to raise living standards and help the country develop.Cambodia was working to increase public services, she said, stressing that the country placed importance on diplomatic and economic affairs and tourism promotion to accelerate its development. — VNS'",0

Henri Gatien Bertrand, who followed the French leader into exile on the far-flung South Atlantic island after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, auctioneers said.\nThe general later gave the shoes to a sculptor working on an equestrian statue of Bonaparte.The relics were expected to fetch between 50,000 and 80,000 euros, but bidding at the Drouot auction rooms was brisk.\n\nLike ImeldaLike Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, Napoleon had a large collection of footwear, which he bought from the Paris shoemakers Jacques in Montmartre.Although British propagandists often caricatured the Corsican as an authoritarian midget, at 1.69 metres he was actually above average height for his time.The boots were gifted by the son of sculptor Carlo Marochetti to the French politician Paul Le Roux, a minister under the Second Empire of Bonaparte’s nephew, Napoleon III.His family has kept them ever since, said auctioneers Binoche & Giquello.General Bertrand returned to France after the death of his beloved leader in 1821.Many French people still suspect Napoleon was poisoned by his British jailors.Some historians, however, are convinced he was slowly murdered with arsenic administered by Count Charles de Montholon, his closest friend on the island.They think he was blackmailed by French royalists into lacing the emperor’s wine with the poison after he was caught stealing money.\xa0— AFP'",5

The Ministry of Finance was assigned to work with ministries and authorities in formulating a Government Decree to implement Protocol 7, which this draft aims to achieve.Finance Minister Đinh Tiến Dũng said the draft decree would create a legal basis for the application of customs modernisation for goods in transit between ASEAN countries, including Việt Nam, and reduce customs paperwork for transit goods.Dũng said issuing the decree would enhance the competitiveness of enterprises engaged in good transit activities and bring into full play the advantages of the geographical position of the country in the transportation of transit goods.Nguyễn Đức Hải, chairman of NA’s Committee on Finance and Budget, said the draft decree regulated some contents that haven’t been amended in the country’s legal documents including guarantees for goods in transit and priority regimes in customs procedures.Notably, the draft decree contained no provisions contrary to current laws and resolutions.Most NASC deputies agreed on the necessity of the issuance of the draft decree to incorporate Protocol 7 into national law and in accordance with international treaties, and NA vice chairwoman Tòng Thị Phóng underlined the need to ensure smooth links between Vietnam Customs and other countries.The safety of the information system and interest of Vietnamese individuals, organisations should be guaranteed, she said.Other NA deputies proposed the Government enhance the capacity of the customs sector, particularly e-customs, ensuring smooth connectivity and strengthening inspection to prevent trade fraud.Tax reliefFinance Minister Đinh Tiến Dũng said the tax administration agency had made great efforts in recovering outstanding tax debts, increasing the amount of debt collection. However, tax debt is still prevalent.Total outstanding tax arrears reached around VNĐ81.6 trillion (US$3.5 billion) by the end of last year, up 4 per cent compared to 2017. Of which, VNĐ41.3 trillion was irrecoverable, accounting for just over half of total unpaid tax debts.Dũng attributed the situation to several reasons.There are 2,635 taxpayers who died, went missing or lost civil act capacity with tax debt of VNĐ460 billion.A total 24,113 enterprises were dissolved but did not follow dissolution procedures and owe tax of VNĐ2.07 trillion. In addition, 216 enterprises were insolvent and went bankrupt but failed to pay tax of VNĐ398 billion.Notably, there are about 731,696 taxpayers abandoning their business addresses or having their business registration certificates revoked who owed tax of nearly VNĐ23.9 trillion, he said.The Law on Tax Management stipulates that late payment interest is 0.03 per cent per day on the overdue payment.However, this regulation was ineffective when applied to the taxpayers mentioned above, he said, adding the total fines and interest of late payments reached VNĐ12 trillion by the end of last year.“Therefore, it is necessary to build a National Assembly resolution on handling tax arrears for taxpayers who fail to pay to the State budget,” Dũng said.Hải, chairman of NA’s Committee on Finance and Budget, said the committee agreed on the need for a resolution on handling tax debts that can’t be collected by freezing tax arrears or writing off late payment interest for taxpayers as proposed by the Government.He suggested the Government consider the settlement of tax debts for State-owned enterprises (SOEs) because SOEs were legal entities represented by the State and were in the process of equitisation.Thus, the freezing and relinquish of tax debts should be handled during equitisation, he said.The Government should review and report the settlement of tax debts for those related to land use or land rent. Accordingly, debts would be forzen or written off in specific cases, he said.Lưu, the NA’s vice chairman, said regulations in the decree should be strict enough to prevent tax evasion.""We should only erase the tax debt when a court has confirmed the business is bankrupt,"" he said.His opinion was shared by Nguyễn Thanh Hải, head of NA’s Ombudsman Committee, saying it was necessary to clarify individuals and organisation whose tax debts were erased and why. — VNS'",0

Hằng added that the embassy remained ready to take necessary protection measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the Vietnamese woman, who is now under treatment at a hospital with tight security.The spokesperson said the MoFA had held a working session with the RoK Embassy in Việt Nam to express Việt Nam’s concern over the case, adding that the RoK side noted regret for the incident and pledged to pay special attention to it.Hằng said the number of marriages between Vietnamese and Koreans had increased over recent years. Most couples have a stable life, but conflicts happen in some families for different reasons.She went on to say that to protect the rights and interests as well as happiness of Vietnamese-Korean families, Vietnamese officials at all levels had discussed these matters with the RoK side.The MoFA has taken many citizen protection measures, including asking competent agencies and social organisations of the RoK to teach Korean language and culture, provide vocational training and create jobs for Vietnamese citizens married to Koreans.It has established a co-operation mechanism with the RoK Migrant Women’s Emergency Support Centre to exchange information and swiftly address emergency cases relating to Vietnamese brides in the country, while closely coordinating with the RoK Ministries of Justice, Foreign Affairs, and Gender Equality and Family to deal with incidents involving Vietnamese citizens married to Koreans.The ministry has regularly brought the issue up during annual consular consultation meetings between Việt Nam and the RoK, and asked the RoK side to tighten coordination and take measures and policies to ensure stable and happy mixed-nationality families, according to the spokesperson.The case of violence made headlines in both countries over the weekend, after a video went viral of a 36-year-old Korean man punching and kicking his Vietnamese wife in the presence of their two-year-old son. The violence left the woman with a broken rib and other injuries that require four weeks of treatment.The man, a resident of Yeongam, South Jeolla province, about 390km south of Seoul, reportedly beat his wife for three hours on July 4 for not speaking Korean well before he was put under emergency detention. He has been arrested and detained for eight days for investigation. — VNS'",0

But after a few days, some families found out that their children were still in Việt Nam or had gone to another country,” Lâm said.Police in the central provinces of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh received 34 reports of missing persons between October 24 and November 1. Three families in Nghệ An, however, on Saturday announced that they managed to contact\xa0their thought-to-be-missing members who were abroad.During a meeting on Saturday night on the deaths of 39 alleged illegal migrants in Essex, Deputy Prime Minister Trương Hòa Bình asked relevant ministries and agencies to keep coordinating closely with the UK to identify the victims and make an official announcement to the public as soon as possible.It was reported at the meeting that a delegation of the Ministry of Public Security was headed to the UK on Friday night. A deputy foreign affairs minister also led another delegation to the country the next day to work with British agencies to identify the victims.In a statement late on Friday (UK\xa0time), Essex police said they believed the victims in the Essex lorry case were Vietnamese, adding that they have identified some of the victims and have contacted the Vietnamese Government and some families in the UK and Việt Nam.The confirmatory evidence needed to formally present cases to HM Senior Coroner for consideration has not yet been obtained, they said.""This evidence is being gathered across a number of jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, we cannot at this time announce the identity of any of the victims,” said the statement.Essex police will continue to co-operate closely with the Vietnamese Government\xa0and others to identify the victims and offer support to all those affected by this tragedy.Also, during Monday morning’s NA session, Nguyễn Hữu Cầu, chief of police in the central province of Nghệ An, said that eight people have been arrested in connection with the case.He sent his condolences to all the families who are suspected to have relatives found in the lorry, stressing that it is a “heart-breaking humanitarian tragedy.”Cầu also posited that while there are no official conclusions yet, the victims have likely gone through several countries before finding their way to the UK.They were likely not trafficked directly from Việt Nam, Cầu said, adding that the charge of those detained was likely assisting unlawful emigration, according to the Vietnamese Penal Code.— VNS'",1

Meanwhile, credit for high-risk sectors, mainly the real estate sector, has been tightly controlled.Real estate loans accounted for 19.14 per cent of the total outstanding loans, up 14.58 per cent against the figure seen in late 2018. The growth rate was higher than the 9.4 per cent average credit growth of the economy.According to the SBV, real estate credit surged over the past few months of 2019 due to the Government’s change in calculations. In the past, loans for real estate firms and consumer credit for house buyers were placed into separate categories. However, since last year, the two indicators have been merged into one for more accurate measurement of credit growth in the sector, leading to the surge in property credit figures.Of the total loans in the first nine months of this year, loans for real estate business activities represented 32.7 per cent of the sector’s outstanding loans, up 5.5 per cent.Consumer credit made up 20.7 per cent of the total outstanding loans in the economy, up 13.9 per cent, of which loans for activities associated with the real estate sector, including buying, renting, building or repairing houses, accounted for 59.4 per cent of the total outstanding consumer loans, soaring 19.5 per cent. — VNS'",2

1259,'Forum discusses new financial approach for disaster prevention and response',"HÀ NỘI — Disaster prevention and response activities in Việt Nam have focused on preventative support and building safe communities with the application of new approaches using science and technology.Participants heard that at the first National Forecast-based Financing (FbF) Dialogue Platform in Việt Nam, co-organised by the Việt Nam Red Cross Society (VNRC) and German Red Cross in Việt Nam, held on Monday in Hà Nội.Speaking at the event, VNRC President Nguyễn Thị Xuân Thu said that Việt Nam is one of the countries most frequently affected by natural disasters and global climate change. Every year, about 300 people die and go missing due to natural disasters, causing economic losses of around 1 to 1.5 per cent of the country’s GDP.“The FbF approach aims to optimise the application of technology, data and weather forecast information from the global network into actions and early response before disasters occur to protect lives, assets and livelihoods of vulnerable groups,” said President Thu.Thu added that FbF was an effective approach to improving the resilience of the community to natural disasters, while also promoting cooperation among scientists, national governments, research institutes and the private sector in improving the effectiveness of forecasting, preparedness and response to increasing natural disaster risks.Since 2017, VNRC has applied a new FbF approach by implementing a pilot project on early response to heat waves in Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng and developing an action plan on financial support based on forecasts and supporting 21 provinces and cities to develop a forecast map of the impact of natural disasters.“Expanding needs, competing priorities and scarce financial resources globally mean that new tools are needed to ensure smart, effective investments to help attenuate the impact of disasters before they occur,” said FAO Representative in Việt Nam Albert T. Lieberg at the event.Lieberg suggested that the Vietnam Disaster Management Authority and the Provincial Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control should form the fundamental driving force to move forward FbF implementation.Development partners, NGOS and international organisations should adopt the forecast-based financing approach in their strategies and programmes.“Households must be well aware of the necessary actions to take for mitigating the anticipated impact of disasters. Therefore, stronger coordination and collaboration between the Việt Nam Disaster Management Authority and the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting\xa0are key to providing actionable early warnings with reliable prediction of likely impacts and recommended early actions,” said Lieberg.The FAO representative also highlighted the role of social assistance as important to establishing effective targeting and delivery mechanisms for disaster preparedness and response, including forecast-based financing.“Mass organisations like the Red Cross, Women's Union, Farmers' Union and others, play a vital role in disaster preparedness and response. With networks at the community level, they are well-positioned to support the formulation of early actions, disseminate actionable early warning messages and identify vulnerable groups,” he said.This year, the forum aims to gather and establish a network of agencies, departments, experts, scientists and gain a common understanding of how FbF can contribute to the Government's efforts to improve community resilience to natural disasters. It also provides opportunities for participants to share and exchange experiences on FbF among domestic and international agencies and organisations and develop a roadmap towards the institutionalisation of the FbF approach in Việt Nam. — VNS",1

The international investment pavilion will assist start-ups with training\xa0conducted by foreign lecturers.Secondly, we will connect start-ups and investors at\xa0all Techfest 2019’s technology villages. The event will take place across the whole of\xa0Thursday. More than 100 start-ups and nearly 200 investors are expected to take part.Last but not least, we will work with international funds to help\xa0Vietnamese start-ups to build their eco-systems.How do you assess the potential\xa0of Vietnamese start-ups to\xa0attract\xa0foreign investment?In 2017 when I returned to Việt Nam from the UK, I started to realise that the quality of Vietnamese start-ups, demonstrated through their ideas and skills, is improving.Vietnamese start-ups now have more opportunities to approach domestic and foreign investors. Communication about the\xa0Vietnamese start-up eco-system has been given\xa0more attention. A lot of investors and investment funds from Asian countries like South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and also funds from the UK are interested in the Vietnamese start-up eco-system.Vietnamese start-ups have opportunities to compete at national start-up contests such as\xa0Techfest, helping to improve their skills. The methods used to set up their start-ups have also improved. When they interact more, it is much easier for them to attract investment.What are the weaknesses among\xa0Vietnamese start-ups?Let’s talk about business ideas. Many start-ups I know have\xa0limited themselves with ideas to address problems of an area or a city only. But they have not looked further to see if\xa0their ideas could also solve problems on a nationwide, regional or global scale.Vietnamese start-ups in general are not good at making business models and business plans. They just look focus on the short-term and\xa0do not have plans for the next\xa0three years, or five years. They also fail to conduct\xa0market research to see\xa0whether the market will accept\xa0their products, or how many people are likely to use them.What resources and skills do Vietnamese start-ups need to reach out for more overseas opportunities?Human resources are the most important factor that\xa0investors look at to decide whether they should pour money into a\xa0start-up\xa0or not.Start-ups have only five minutes to pitch their ideas to\xa0investors. In those five minutes, the most important thing is to show their capacity and\xa0knowledge, and pitch their ideas in an easy to understand way so that investors can see the potential\xa0of their products.Presentation and foreign language skills are very important.The Government has launched programmes to encourage start-ups and\xa0students at all levels to learn English. I think it is compulsory for start-ups to learn English and other foreign languages to leverage themselves to compete with start-ups from other countries. VNS'",1

In April 2012 scientists from the Việt Nam Archaeology Institute, French School of Extreme East (École Française d'Extrême-Orient), and Hà Tĩnh Provincial Museum conducted large-scale research on the structureThe researchers established the wall had been built from\xa0sedimentary stones which had bonded together over the years.The wall stands over 3m high and is 1.2-2m wide. Along the wall, there are holes every 3-4m which were designed in a wedge shape to protect the soldiers, similar to arrow slits found in western castles.Lê Bá Hạnh, former director of Hà Tĩnh Museum, said the holes may\xa0have also been used to observe the enemy\xa0and for drainage.According to various historical documents, the wall was part of the\xa0Chăm Pa Kingdom's Lâm Ấp Citadel.Work on the citadel started in the fourth century and it was renovated by the Chăm people to protect their border.In the\xa017th century, during fighting between the\xa0Trịnh and Nguyễn lords, Lord Trịnh Toàn ordered the wall to be shored up\xa0to protect his northern territory from attacks from the south.Documents say\xa0that between 1655 and 1672, fierce fighting took place at the site between the Trịnh\xa0and Nguyễn.According to Hạnh, the wall is a one of a kind in the country, and holds cultural\xa0and historical values.In 2014, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism recognised the structure as a\xa0National Archaeological\xa0Site.Many parts of the wall have fallen away and\xa0most of the area is overgrown with wild climbers and trees.“We hope the renovation project will help restore the\xa0glorious beauty of the wall so it can become a tourism destination,” said Toàn. — VNS",5

Landslides, land subsidence, illegal construction near waterways, and environmental pollution are hindering development, he said.The city has more than 100 rivers and canals, with water surface accounting\xa0for about 16 per cent of the city's total area.Embankments built in the city account for 15 per cent of the total rivers and canals.“Mobilising intellectual and socio-economic resources is very important so that\xa0scientific and comprehensive solutions can be developed\xa0to cope with risks and challenges, and promote the potential of these areas,” Nhã\xa0said.Đỗ Thanh Tùng, head of the National Institute of Architecture, said\xa0the city should begin\xa0studies on building landscapes on the water surface of rivers and canals.“Planning on rivers and canals should\xa0focus on serving all citizens’ demands and ensuring their basic function of water drainage,” he added.Associate Professor Sybil Derrible, from the University of Illinois in\xa0Chicago in the\xa0US, said the role of canals in many cities around the world has changed significantly and has\xa0helped\xa0solve problems that cities\xa0face.Canals can be\xa0used for multiple functions, from transporting people and goods and\xa0providing drinking water to\xa0handling\xa0storm water runoff.“With proper planning, canals can\xa0revitalise entire neighborhoods and can significantly help\xa0address contemporary issues,” he said.Canals present\xa0both social and engineering assets, and offer opportunities that should be leveraged to help build smarter, more sustainable\xa0and more resilient cities, he said. — VNS",1

If the soil is good quality, 18ha of protective forest could be planted at the shore side of the geotube dyke.However, many geotubes have been damaged for a number of reasons, including being hit by parts of trees affected by strong waves.The province is now improving inspections of the geotube dyke and repairing the tubes.The province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has asked the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to help it identify the cause of the problem and come up with a solution.The two-phase project cost more than VNĐ56 billion (US$2.39 million), including VNĐ46 billion from the central budget and the rest from the province’s budget.The second phase in 2018 -20 includes growing trees in the alluvial ground and building the rest of the facilities for the project.However, the amount of silted soil inside the embankment is still not sufficient for growing mangrove trees, so the second phase has been delayed. – VNS'",4

Most commune health stations have a physician, nurse, midwife and\xa0traditional practitioner, and operate based on the principle of family medicine,” she said.According to the 2017 UHC Monitoring Report compiled\xa0by the WHO and World Bank, the service coverage index of Việt Nam scores 73 out of 100, comparing favorably to the average for South-Eastern Asia of 59 and the global average of 64.The social health insurance programme now reached\xa090 per cent of population coverage and the government subsidised\xa0100 per cent of health insurance premiums for vulnerable people and 70 per cent for the near poor, Tiến said.Being aware of the important role of primary healthcare for achieving sustainable UHC, Việt Nam had implemented ten health reform policies to strengthen the performance of the healthcare system, including\xa0strengthening the capacity of grassroots healthcare to provide services for both\xa0sick and\xa0healthy people.Healthcare services have been expanded at grassroots levels to ensure the provision of comprehensive services of health promotion, disease prevention and\xa0early detection of diseases and treatment, focusing on non-communicable diseases.Reforms of financial mechanisms and\xa0infrastructure investment, including Private Public Partnerships, training for health workers at\xa0grassroots\xa0facilities, have been leading the way\xa0to ensure the implementation of UHC in Việt Nam.Tiến said the main\xa0difficulty the country was facing was a\xa0financial mechanism at grassroots levels. In addition, resources were still focused more on curative services and insufficient for promotive, preventive and primary healthcare services.The UN meeting aimed at accelerating progress towards universal health coverage, including access to essential health services, including skilled health workers, financial risk protection and access to safe, quality, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines for all. The meeting will result in a political declaration on universal health coverage, negotiated by member states and endorsed by heads of states. — VNS",1

Two lawyers Phạm Ngọc Trung and Lại Huy Tùng represented her in the court.Phấn, 72, also former chairwoman of Phú Mỹ Development Investment Joint Stock Company, was charged with appropriating over VNĐ1.38 trillion (US$57.8 million) from Trust Bank.Phấn’s five accomplices consist of Bùi Thị Kim Loan, accountant of Phú Mỹ Co Ltd; Lâm Kim Dũng, former director of Lam Giang Real Estate Co Ltd; Huỳnh Thị Xuân Dung, former director of Phúc Nguyễn Real Estate Investment Co Ltd; Lâm Hứa Quỳnh Trinh, former deputy head of Treasury Office of Trust Bank in HCM City; and Phạm Hồng Hảo, a member of staff at Trust Bank, were also charged with “abusing trust to appropriate property”.Many others, including Phạm Công Danh, Phan Thành Mai, Hoàng Văn Toàn and Trần Sơn Nam, were also summoned to court.A representative of VNCB attended as a civil plaintiff. The State Bank of Việt Nam's representative attended as a legal entity with related rights and obligations.According to the indictment of the Supreme People’s Procuracy, in 2007, Phấn had taken advantage of holding 84.92 per cent of Trust Bank’s charter capital and being the biggest shareholder of the bank in order to direct the bank’s board of directors and staff to invest VNĐ1.03 trillion ($44.8 million) in four real estate projects in which three companies of Phấn were investors. The three companies include Phú Mỹ Development Investment Joint Stock Company, Lam Giang Real Estate Co Ltd and Phú Mỹ Co Ltd.However, Phấn did not use the money to invest in the projects following the contracts. She used all the money for private purposes and then denied all responsibility to pay back the Trust Bank.Additionally, Phấn also ordered her staff to buy four properties in districts 1, 3 and 10 in HCM City and another in Nha Trang City, Khánh Hòa Province. She directed the Trust Bank’s board of directors to re-buy the properties at much higher prices. As a result, Phấn appropriated about VNĐ437 billion ($18.9 million) from Trust Bank.Previously, in the first phase of the case, the court sentenced Phấn to 30 years in prison for “deliberately violating State regulations on economic management, causing severe consequences” and “abusing trust to appropriate property” in May 2018. The Trust Bank was determined to suffer a loss of over VNĐ6.3 trillion ($272 million) in the first phase of the case.According to the schedule, the trial will continue until November 25. — VNS",1

3807,'Kiên Giang recovers protective forests',"KIÊN GIANG — The Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province of Kiên Giang has recovered its protective forests along coastal areas by enlisting the help of local residents to plant and protect mangrove trees.The province, which has one of largest forest areas in the delta, asked residents in the\xa0coastal districts of An Biên and An Minh several years ago to take care part of\xa0about 4,000ha of mangrove forests along\xa0a coastal line of 60km.Trần Phi Hải, director of the An Biên – An Minh Forest Management Board, said the mangrove forests included the main and buffer mangrove forest areas.As many as 867 local households and organisations take care of\xa02,985ha buffer mangrove forest area, mostly spotted mangrove, he said.The 1,012ha main mangrove forest area, mostly grey mangrove, includes 754ha of natural forest and 257.8ha of planted forest.The management board is responsible for the main mangrove forest area.The buffer mangrove forests have favourable conditions for breeding aquatic species like shrimp, fish, mud clams, blood cockles, eels and crabs.The management board in co-operation with the local households and organisations that protect mangrove forest buffer zones\xa0has protected the forests well.Local authorities have helped\xa0the households to breed aquatic species, including instructing them in techniques and providing financial\xa0support for breeding new aquatic species like ba khía (Sesarma mederi), a mangrove crab species.In An Biên District’s Nam Thái Commune, many forest-protection\xa0households have bred the mangrove crab since 2017 and earned high profits.However, many areas in\xa0buffer mangrove forests have\xa0eroded because of climate change, according to the management board.To protect mangrove forests, the management board has implemented three mangrove recovery projects\xa0along coastal areas since 2016.One project\xa0creates\xa0alluvial grounds for growing mangrove forests, which\xa0protects\xa0a sea dyke in An Biên’s Nam Thái Commune. Around\xa035ha of grey mangrove has been planted.Another project has\xa0recovered mangroves\xa0along coastal areas, starting from\xa02016 and ending in\xa02020. The project has planted new 170ha of grey mangrove in alluvial grounds and 88ha of spotted mangrove in buffer forest areas.The management board has helped\xa0forest-protecting households and organisations\xa0replace\xa0dead mangrove trees.Under\xa0current regulations, households and organisations have to ensure that 70 per cent of the allocated forestry land is used to\xa0grow\xa0forests and that\xa030 per cent of the allocated forestry land can be used to\xa0breed\xa0aquatic species.The projects have helped recover\xa0mangrove forests and curb erosion, according to the management board.However, the process of growing new mangrove forests has\xa0also faced problems\xa0such as strong waves and currents and erosion.Strong waves, for example, caused erosion to alluvial grounds and damage\xa0to mangrove trees.The illegal exploitation of aquatic species in newly planted mangrove forests has also\xa0caused\xa0the death of newly planted mangrove trees.The province’s People’s Committee last year developed a project to\xa0protect\xa0and develop\xa0protective forests along coastal areas in Hòn Đất and Kiên Lương districts and Hà Tiên Town in 2016-20.The project aims to protect 3,330ha of natural and planted mangrove forests and grow 203ha of new mangrove forests in alluvial grounds.In Hòn Đất, protective forests in many areas like Thổ Sơn Commune’s Hòn Quéo Hamlet, Bình Sơn Commune’s Vàm Rầy Hamlet and Bình Giang Commune’s Giồng Kè Hamlet have eroded because of climate change in recent years.The province has 71,000ha of forests, including 26,000ha of protective forests.Most of the\xa0protective forests are planted near the province's\xa0200km coast line and on its\xa0islands. —\xa0VNS",4

He cited the 142,000sq.km sea area in the southern region and the 44,000sq.km sea area from the central province of Bình Thuận to the southernmost province of Cà Mau.Statistics from 1,500 wind farms in the country (some are in the process of developing further) in the last decade show that the average wind speed of 7-12.5m per second at 100m above sea level generates the most wind power, which is highly effective for consumption and trade.Projects exploiting wind power in Việt Nam are developing well, especially two major wind farms in the southern Bạc Liêu Province and southernmost Cà Mau Province, which are expected to generate 1,000 MW of wind power by 2020 and 2025, respectively.The wind farms and wind power plants have been contributing to the provinces’ budgets by selling electricity to the Việt Nam Electricity.For example, the\xa0100 MW Bạc Liêu wind power plant in the southern province of Bạc Liêu\xa0has been contributing some VNĐ76 billion (US$3.3 million) per year to the local budget since 2010. It is expected to increase its capacity to 400 MW and contribute some VNĐ300 billion ($13.2 million) per year to the local budget soon.On January 16 last year, construction the 100MW Khai Long wind power plant began in the southernmost province of Cà Mau. It is expected to generate 300 MW of wind power and some VNĐ200 billion ($8.8 million) per year by 2018.With this high potential Việt Nam should establish a\xa0wind energy development strategy which includes developing wind power construction on the sea, said Dr Dư Văn Toán.“We will be able to further develop the economy and prevent landslides and land erosion if we know how to utilise wind power resources together with other sources of power such as solar power, wave power,\xa0ocean thermal energy conversion, as well as biomass energy, aquaculture and aquatic conservation,” he said.“On the other hand, offshore wind power constructions not only create new tourism attractions but also help strengthen the protection of national sovereignty on the sea,” he said. —\xa0VNS'",4

For example, various devices measuring vital signs today are directly connected to the hospital’s systems. Once measurements are taken, the data is incorporated directly in the patient’s medical records without the need for manual intervention.\nNew technologies have enabled the healthcare industry to carry out remote operations. For instance, earlier this year, a surgeon in China successfully carried out an operation remotely.\nDigitisation across the healthcare industry has helped service providers improve the quality of care and accelerate medical breakthroughs for better patient outcomes and mitigate the rising cost of healthcare.\nThe Vietnamese Government is also supporting the digitalisation of healthcare, launching projects to encourage and enable digital health solutions to be adopted around the country.\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, all healthcare establishments will complete digitisation of medical records by 2030.\nAccording to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade) Việt Nam, Việt Nam’s economic growth, health-conscious population and fast-developing 4G and 5G infrastructure provide the perfect environment for digital health solutions.\nThere is strong interest in telemedicine and advanced technologies and systems that can improve decision making, improve operational efficiency and enhance patient care and experience, it said.\nYeo Siang Tiong, general manager of Kaspersky Lab Southeast Asia, said most hospitals were in the first stage of digital transformation, digitising simple data such as patient records, personal information, past diagnosis, and medicine.\nBut the digitisation of the healthcare industry had led to a massive increase in the number of targeted attacks against the sector, he said.\n“The healthcare sector tracks a person’s medical history, personal information, sometimes they also track who their parents are, and genetic conditions that pass down from parents to child.\n“Some of this information is actually worth more than a bank card.”\nIn addition, ""the sector is less protected than sectors such as banking and finance,"" he said.\nIn the healthcare industry, cyber security should not be taken slightly because any issue could be a matter of “life and death,” he warned.\n“What would happen when you need to treat a patient in an emergency room, but the information is suddenly not available. It is a life and death situation. It is actually very dangerous.”\nAt a recent conference on cybersecurity in the healthcare sector, experts said the consequences of a breach could be quite detrimental since healthcare records are highly personal and sensitive in nature.\nIf patients’ records were stolen, their private data could be traded on the dark web to be exploited by cybercriminals for scams and frauds, and worse still it could cause tremendous trauma to the patients, they said.\nYeo said to protect the healthcare industry from cybercrimes, it was very important to “raise security awareness not just among IT workers but also users of the equipment, doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers.”\n""A lot of hospitals do not have chief security information officers,"" he said, suggesting that they should focus on developing human resources to ensure cyber security, he said.\nThe healthcare sector is a critical one, and therefore hospitals, public and private, should start drafting regulations to address the rising threats, according to Yeo. — VNS'",1
2913,"Kane, Son double up to reawaken Tottenham's Champions League challenge","'LONDON —\xa0Son Heung-min and Harry Kane combined to ease Tottenham\'s troubles by scoring twice each in a 5-0 win over Red Star Belgrade and put their Champions League campaign back on track on Tuesday.Last season\'s finalists were thrashed 7-2 at home by Bayern Munich in their previous European outing and have won just two of their last eight games in the Premier League.They moved back into pole position for a place in the last 16 by blowing away the Serbian champions.Kane\'s near post header opened the scoring before a Son double put the outcome beyond doubt before half-time.Erik Lamela smashed home a fourth and Kane rounded off the scoring 18 minutes from time on a night when Tottenham clicked back into gear.""We know we have had a tough run of results and that was the perfect way to respond,"" said Kane.""We were ruthless in front of goal and got the clean sheet as well.""The most important thing was the win. To win 5-0 was exactly what we needed.""Son was restored to the starting line-up after being left on the bench for Spurs\' latest disappointing display a 1-1 home draw against bottom-of-the-table Watford.The South Korean had been rested just days after returning from a tense World Cup qualifier in North Korea.Son has been a shining light among a dramatic dip in form from many of his teammates this season and got his reward on a night Mauricio Pochettino will hope proves to be a turning point.Kane has also continued to score goals and is now up to 15 for club and country this season.The England captain opened the floodgates when he met Lamela\'s in-swinging corner on nine minutes.Spurs also took an early lead against Bayern in a bright opening half hour before a second half collapse against the German giants.But there was never any danger of a repeat against far more limited opponents, especially after Son deservedly doubled the hosts\' lead.Lamela was again the creator with a teasing cross for Son to meet sweetly on the half-volley.Pochettino admitted on the eve of the game that speculation over his future was normal, despite the success he has achieved in turning Tottenham from Europa League regulars to Champions League contenders over the past five years.However, the Argentine was serenaded by a home support soothed by the sight of Spurs returning to form, for 90 minutes at least.A much tougher task awaits on Sunday when Spurs travel to Liverpool in a repeat of last season\'s Champions League final with revenge on their minds.But another adventure into the knockout stages of the Champions League at least now looks probable for Pochettino\'s men, as they moved a point ahead of Red Star into second place in Group B behind Bayern.After a brief spell of resistence from the visitors, Son made sure the three points were safe before the break by finishing off a swift counter-attack from Tanguy Ndombele\'s pass.Spurs should have had far more than two more after the break. Lamela could have had a 15-minute hat-trick as he missed two glorious chances either side of a thumping left-foot finish from Serge Aurier\'s pass.Son was then withdrawn to keep him fresh for the trip to Anfield, but the chances continued to flow and Kane rounded off the scoring when his side-foot finish nestled in the far corner. —\xa0AFP'",3

The number of days on which air quality was good also decreased.The department measures air quality at ten spots in the city and reports the results at 2pm every day.Between September 8 and September 14, Minh Khai,\xa0Phạm Văn Đồng and Hàng Đậu had the worst air quality.As of Monday morning, air quality measured by PAMAir, a pollutant/air modeling software\xa0based on sensors for measuring real-time air quality,\xa0continues to decline on Hàng Trống Street, Ô Chợ Dừa Street, areas around Times City Urban Area and Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology.On August 25 and 26, air quality of Hà Nội was reported to get worse with air quality index standing at unhealthy level due to high level of PM2.5.PM, or particulate matter, is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. PM2.5 is some 1/30th in thickness of a human hair. It can easily pass through the lungs and get absorbed into the bloodstream, causing adverse health effects. Normally-designed air masks are unable to help avoid PM’s harmful effects.Many studies in Hà Nội have shown that heat inversion is one of the main causes for recent sharp rises in pollutants, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. — VNS'",4

It also aims to make recommendations to boost the country’s development.Participants discussed four main topics, namely Việt Nam’s economic situation in 2019 and impacts of free trade agreements, major issues of Việt Nam’s economy in 2019, major socio-cultural issues of Việt Nam in 2019, and recommendations for Việt Nam’s socio-economic development in 2020.According to reports at the event, the global economy is in a period of “high uncertainty” as about 70 per cent of economies, mostly developing, are projected to experience economic slowdown in the wake of escalating trade tension between major nations.However, a positive outlook has remained for Việt Nam’s economy as the macroeconomy has been stable, inflation is under control and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the first half of the year expanded 2.64 per cent, the lowest over the past three years. The six-month Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 6.76 per cent, lower than a year ago but higher than the same period in 2011-17.The participants also highlighted major social issues, notably violence against children, child sexual abuse and school incidents that have sparked public outrage.Child sexual abuse and violence occurred in most cities and provinces nationwide, said Hoàng Thị Tây Ninh, Child Rights Governance (CRG) Programme Manager at Save The Children. Close to 3,000 cases were reported from 2017-18, involving 3,400 offenders and 3,200 victims, she noted, adding that child sexual abuse accounted for more than 50 per cent of the cases.She said it was critical to develop and reinforce the local child protection system and facilitate community-based child protection mechanisms. She also urged improving the capacity of social workers and volunteers and enhancing inter-sectoral coordination in this matter while authorities must strengthen education and communications to raise public awareness of child rights and child rights-related law and policies. — VNS'",1

4428,'New decree to protect genetic resources from foreign loss',"'HÀ NỘI — A newly effective bill, government Decree No.59/2017 on the management of access to genetic resources and the sharing of their benefits (issued on May 12, 2017), was expected to protect the country’s rich genetic resources.In 1992, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre ranked Việt Nam the 16th most biologically diverse country in the world, while the World Bank said “the entire country is included within Conservation International’s Indo-Burma hotspot, one of the earth’s richest and most threatened biological regions.”Nguyễn Đặng Thu Cúc, head of the Division of Genetic Resources and Biosafety Management, under the Việt Nam Environment Bureau, said machinery and human capacity in the country remain limited, therefore genetic samples are usually sent abroad for analysis, and “this is a notable source of loss of genetic resources.”She cited the recent case of an American university’s 2016 finding what they claimed to be an “anti-cancer” agent in Cúc Phương National Park during various trips held with Việt Nam’s institutions in the 1990s.“This is a lucky case, as they credited the source of the agent, whereas there are several other cases, where previously lax legal provisions allowed unscrupulous foreign parties to ‘steal’ genetic resources discovered in Việt Nam to claim as their own, and make profit from it, is that fair?,” Cúc said, during a workshop on Decree 59 yesterday in Hà Nội.The decree, years in the making, aims to remedy this situation by providing a “tighter protocol in granting access to national genetic resources to a foreign entity.”The creators of the decree admitted that this is Việt Nam’s first legal document that addresses in detail the country’s compliance to the 2010 Nagoya Protocol on the use of genetic resources, so there might be issues translating the document to reality.These issues can be addressed in later revisions “as soon as every two years, instead of the usual five-year-window” from experience gained in the implementation period, said Dr Phạm Anh Cường, Director of the Biodiversity Conservation Agency.Associate Proffessor Dr Lê Văn Hưng, from the Environment Department of the Hà Nội-based University of Natural Resources and Environment, said that the current term requiring that 30 per cent of monetary benefits gained from using genetic resources from a provider shall be paid back to the provider is too high.Hưng said the international standard of 0.5 – 3 per cent is appropriate, as long as a solid valuation mechanism is in place, since “in many cases, only much later after the genetic sample was collected, could it be utilised in a commercial product.”Other participants also voiced concerns over administrative paperwork, however, lawmakers responded that follow-up guiding documents would “iron out the wrinkles”, including an expedited mechanism for academic institutions working with international parties.A civil society representative said attention should also be focused on the community aspect, namely “folk wisdom.”The representative cited the example of traditional medicine made from local herbs by ethnic groups in the northern mountainous province of Hà Giang, saying if a pharmaceutical firm wants to commercialise such products, measures should be in place to help the community ""strike a fair deal with those companies.""Decree 59 defines the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment as the “national focal point” for the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol. Together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the two have the power to “grant, extend, or revoke access licences to genetic resources.”– VNS'",4

4768,'To-your-health: Time to Get Your Shots',"By Dr. Ekaterina (Kate) Naumova*Most people have had the flu, but not everyone knows that the word “influenza” refers to a very specific group of viruses that are a dangerous subset of the various common colds and flus we’re familiar with. In Việt Nam, you can get it at any time of the year.Influenza is a serious respiratory infection that can result in hospitalisation and even death. The most common complication of influenza is bacterial pneumonia, but it can also aggravate chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic rhinitis\xa0and diabetes. It’s a highly contagious viral infection transmitted by coughing, sneezing\xa0or contact with someone who is infected, and it can also be transmitted if you touch surfaces on which infected influenza droplets have landed.After being exposed, it usually takes an average of two days to develop symptoms, but it can range from one to four days. Typical influenza disease causes the onset of fever, headache, a runny or stuffy nose, eye pain\xa0and sensitivity to light. Kids may also suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.The fact that it spreads so easily is what makes it such an important health problem. People become contagious from the very beginning, one or two days before the onset of symptoms –\xa0even when they don’t yet know they have it. You can still pass on the virus to others for the next four or five days after the onset of symptoms.Once you’re infected, there’s no going back. The virus will collect in the upper respiratory tract, producing phlegm in the airway in response to the inflammation of the surrounding organs. Your immune system (provided it’s functioning normally) will start to detect the presence of the virus multiplying in your body, and get to work on developing an antibody to fight it. The symptoms you experience are a combination of the spread of the virus and your body’s countermeasures, which will cause inflammation, fever and discomfort. Once your body has produced these antibodies, you’ll be protected from reinfection – and if you ever do contact the same virus again, it will be swiftly and invisibly dealt with.So how is it that you can get the flu again and again? It’s because influenza gradually morphs into different forms as it spreads, making it resistant to antibodies that worked against it before. This means that every time the body catches a new strain of influenza, it must start from the beginning.How can people protect themselves from a shape-shifting disease that keeps turning out new forms to infect us again and again? Firstly, we can try our best not to put ourselves and others at risk in the first place. For a start, remember to cover your nose and mouth with your sleeve or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Wash your hands often with soap and water, or at least alcohol-based hand cleansers. Stay away from people who are sick as much as possible. If you already have influenza, stay at home from work or school for at least 24 hours after the fever has ended.The best way to prevent influenza is vaccination. Because the strains of viruses change every year, pharmaceutical companies conduct research to find out which strains will be typical for the coming season worldwide. According to their results, they produce a new vaccine to match the circulating strains. Every year, we receive new vaccines that are different from the older ones and more effective against the forms of influenza that are likely to be ascendant during the following twelve months.We usually receive our annual vaccines in October, which is the best time to get vaccinated. We use an inactivated vaccine (made from killed viruses) produced by Influvac that doesn’t cause the disease. Unlike some vaccines, Influvac does not contain egg, meaning those with egg allergies (including pregnant women) can take it safely. It will protect you only from the more common strains of the influenza virus, however—if you’re unlucky, you could still contract a less prevalent strain.People aged six months and older should get the influenza vaccine, unless they suffer from an immunodeficiency condition. Kids under six months old should not get vaccinated because they’re too small—usually at that age, however, the mother is breastfeeding, so she can pass on some immunity to the baby if she is vaccinated. It’s recommended that everyone in a family with a baby should get vaccinated while the baby is still too young to receive or develop its own antibodies. It’s also important to note that kids under eight years old who receive their first-ever flu vaccine should get two shots one month apart to fully trigger their immune response.The 2019-20 influenza vaccination contains the following:*Dr. Ekaterina (Kate) Naumova gravitated toward pediatrics early in her career, drawn by a love for children, moving on to pursue her interest in dietetics and enhancing people's health through nutritional changes.

The model offered an income of VNĐ2 billion (US$86,200) per hectare per crop, 10 times the income from the industrial farming model.According to Phan Văn Hận, who now breeds white-legged shrimp on an area of 3,200sq.m under the model in Cầu Ngang District’s Mỹ Long Nam Commune, his farm has a density of 178 shrimp per square metre.The model requires farmers to have a large breeding area and make a large initial investment in infrastructure of VNĐ3 billion ($130,000) per hectare.The model requires ponds for breeding shrimp and treating wastewater, anti-sunlight nets to cover the ponds and plastic sheets to cover their beds and equipment for pumping oxygen and feeding the shrimp.Trịnh Thị Loan, an agricultural expert in Mỹ Long Nam, has bred white-legged shrimp on 1.5ha under the model for two years and earned a large income.The model is sustainable since the ponds are covered with plastic sheets to prevent the spread of disease pathogens from soil, according to Loan.The covering also helps farmers proactively control the quality of water used for raising the shrimp.This year she expects to harvest around 100 tonnes of shrimp in two crops and earn VNĐ5 billion ($216,000).Phạm Minh Truyền, director of the province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said the model had been expanded to nearly 400ha this year.It would be a basis for the province to develop its shrimp industry and increase exports to high-demand markets like the US and EU, he said.The province has identified shrimp, rice, vegetables, tra fish, and coconuts as its key agricultural produce.PotentialBeing a coastal province, Trà Vinh has large potential for aquaculture with 95,000ha suitable for aquaculture, especially brackish-water and saltwater shrimp farming.The province has 24,000ha of brackish water and saltwater ponds to farm shrimp, including 7,000ha under intensive and semi-intensive farming, and produces 35,000 tonnes annually.But the average income from shrimp farming is only VNĐ100 – 150 million ($4,300 – 6,500) per hectare per year since most farms areas are small and do not use advanced techniques, according to the department.Under a plan to restructure aquaculture in 2017 - 25, the province seeks to expand its shrimp farming area to 27,000ha and annual output to 87,000 tonnes next year.It also plans to expand shrimp output by 5.3 per cent a year in 2021- 25.To meet the targets, the province will expand its shrimp farming area and adopt advanced techniques to produce high-quality shrimp while also safeguarding the environment.Đồng Văn Lâm, chairman of the province People’s Committee, said both domestic consumption of and export demand for shrimp were high and steady, and so farmers would not need to worry about selling their produce.The People’s Committee had instructed all relevant agencies to assist shrimp farmers in terms of infrastructure and farming processes, he said.The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development should zone efficient shrimp farming areas and strictly monitor them to adequately support farmers, he said.The province will prioritise implementation of 25 projects at a cost of VNĐ3 trillion ($130 million), including in infrastructure like irrigation, power and transport for breeding brackish and saltwater shrimp, according to the People’s Committee.It will offer incentives to investors to produce and process shrimp. – VNS'",1
4360,'Authority confirms serious deforestation in Điện Biên',"'ĐIỆN BIÊN\xa0—\xa0Authorities have confirmed a serious case of deforestation has occurred in this northern mountain province, resulting in the destruction of about 80 percent of the special forest areas in Pá Khoang Commune.The province’s Mường Phang Management Board for Forest, Historical vestiges and Environmental Landscape issued a complaint late last month that serious illegal logging was occurring in more than 6,500 square metres of special forest in the commune, online newspaper Vietnamplus reported. In response, the province’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development completed a report on \xa0September 5 and released it to the public on Friday.The board charged that about 80 per cent of the special forest areas in the commune had been destroyed. Almost all trees with a diameter of 15cm and many others with a diameter of about 20-30cm had been cut down and burnt.The destruction happened, according to the board, during July 15 and August 4 this year when a company named Trần Lệ Cherry Blossom sent staff and hired some locals to fell the forest without informing the local forest management board about their work.Director Trần\xa0Lệ admitted in a meeting with local authorities and the forest management board that he had directed his staff to clear more than 6,500 sq.m of the forest to plant cherry trees. He said they did so with the authorisation of the Điện Biên Province People’s Committee.The company director said a document issued by the committee on July 12 allowed the company to undertake the deforestation in order to plant cherry trees in preparation for an upcoming cherry blossom festival. The festival was intended to promote tourism development in the area.At the scene of the destroyed forest area, about 480 cherry trees have been planted.However, at some other working sessions with local authorities, the company director could not provide adequate documents proving his company’s actions to destroy the forest areas were done with authorities’ approval, especially the decision to convert special forest land into other purposes in accordance with the law.Investigation results showed that the company exploited the November 2017 policy of the People’s Committee of Điên\nBiên\nProvince\nto organise a cherry blossom event to destroy the area of special forest, Vietnamplus reported.Thus the action of deforestation by the company had seriously violated the regulations cited in Article 12 of the Law on Forest Protection and Development.\nThe company would be punished strictly according to the law, according to the forest management board.The case would be investigated further, the newspaper said.\xa0— VNS'",4

780,'NA Standing Committee looks to trim fat',"HÀ NỘI — Parliamentarians took a step towards streamlining the Government apparatus yesterday.Members of the National Assembly (NA) Standing Committee yesterday agreed with the Government’s proposal on amending and supplementing several articles of the Law on the Organisation of the Government and the Law on the Organisation of local administration, focusing on streamlining the Government apparatus, decentralising power and reviewing State administrative institutions.The committee discussed the draft law on amending a number of articles of the laws.According to Lê\xa0Vĩnh Tân, Minister of Home Affairs, the issuance of new laws is necessary. After three years of implementation, a number of provisions of the laws needed to be amended to be relevant with the Party’s plans and stay in touch with reality, he said.Regarding the organisation of the Government, the fact the Government was authorised to regulate the organisation of specialised agencies under provincial and district People's Committees has reduced the proactiveness of localities in running of specialised agencies in each locality, he said.Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc's abilities under current regulations were still limited in establishing organisations within the structure of ministries, ministerial-level agencies, as well as those of provincial People's Committee, to serve as grounds for testing new management models.Nguyễn Khắc Định, Chairman of the NA’s Legal Affairs Committee said many deputies approved amending article 23 of the Law on Organisation of the Government.Accordingly, the Government stipulated the number of specialised agencies under provincial and district People’s Committee, deciding the criteria on the establishment, the minimum number of staff and the maximum number of deputy heads of an organisation.The deputies said such a regulation would promote decentralisation and create flexibility for localities.In the session, lawmakers also discussed reducing the number of vice chairman of People’s Council at provincial and district level and increasing the number of vice chairman of People’s Committee at communal level.NA’s Legal Affairs Committee Chairman Định said the Law on the organisation of local administration issued in 2015 stipulated there are two vice chairmen at the provincial and district levels to enhance the efficiency of the People's Council's.The committee proposed that the Government assess the impact carefully if the number of vice chairmen of provincial and district People's Committees was reduced nationwide and how to arrange new work for them.Phan Thanh Bình, Chairman of the NA Committee for Culture, Education, Youth, and Children, said the most important issue was not reducing the number of staff but improving State management.According to Bình, if the new regulation comes in, the effectiveness of supervising power will be reduced, especially in provinces that are striving to reduce the number of departments.Speaking at the session, NA Chairman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân said the reduction in the number of vice chairmen in elected bodies and an increase in government bodies was unreasonable.“In fact, after 10 years of piloting of not having People's Council in some localities, they have been restored. Thus, it is necessary for the Government to assess the impact on the above-mentioned issues to be in accordance with the conclusions of the Politburo and the Central Government and meet the requirements of reality, ” she said. — VNS",0

2534,'Plastics industry confident of achieving export target of $3.2b',"'HCM CITY — With solid growth in shipments, the plastics industry will surely meet its full-year export target of US$3.2 billion, according to the Việt Nam Plastics Association.Speaking to Việt Nam News, Hồ Đức Lam, its chairman, said exports saw impressive growth last year to $3 billion while overall revenues jumped to $12 billion.“Exports in the first nine months of the year increased by 5 per cent and will continue to enjoy good growth in the rest months of the year.“The US-China trade war has offered opportunities to Vietnamese plastics firms to boost exports.”According to the association, exports go to more than 150 countries and territories, with the US and Japan being key markets.In the domestic market, some industries, even those such as aerospace which use high-grade materials, are shifting to plastic products, and as a result sales have grown rapidly, Lam said.Locally-made plastic\xa0products are confidently taking on imports from Thailand, Malaysia and China, he said.The industry has stepped up investment in technology and facilities and co-operation with foreign partners to make more products meeting local and export demand, he said.But it also faces challenges, he said.“Many countries have put up safeguard measures to protect their domestic plastics industry from imports. Some producers have shifted their production to Việt Nam, which requires the Government and business groups to ensure transparency in the manufacture of products in Việt Nam, and accurate certificates of origin.“Another challenge is that we are importing 60-70 per cent of raw materials.“The world commodities market has been volatile, affecting the industry. Besides, the Government plans to raise import tariffs on some raw materials, which will affect producers.”Foreign investors are enamoured of Việt Nam’s plastics industry due to its high growth rates, increasing exports and enormous potential, he said.“But huge investments by foreign investors also pose challenges to Vietnamese firms since they have to face fierce competition, requiring them to transform and invest in new technologies to improve productivity and cut costs.”According to the Việt Nam Plastics Industry Development Plan for the period until 2020 approved by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the industry is expected to achieve average annual growth of 17.5 per cent in 2011-20.The industry also targets to become a key sector by 2020 with a high and sustainable growth rate.It seeks to gradually build a complete supply chain encompassing all stages from raw material production to final processing, increasing the ratio of locally sourced raw materials to reduce reliance on imports.Phạm Thị Huệ Anh of the University of Economics - Technology for Industries said plastics firms need to further improve designs, models and quality, restructure, invest in advanced technologies, develop local sources of raw materials and cut costs to improve competitiveness.The Government needs to have policies to encourage investment in raw material production and develop supporting industries, she added.The plastics industry has nearly 4,000 enterprises, most of them small and medium-sized ones. — VNS'",2

For every\xa01,000 battery chickens sold, a breeder suffers a loss of VNĐ15-20 million ($646-862 million).According to the Việt Nam Poultry Association, oversupply is also caused by the way the General Statistics Office counts chicken breeding rotations.\xa0The office’s breeding rotation is only 1.5 flocks per year.However, the process to raise battery chickens often lasts between 42-60 days, so the rotation is\xa0up to 3-6 flocks per year.The association estimated that the country has 317 million\xa0battery chickens\xa0and\xa0yearly productivity of\xa0up to 1.2 billion. — VNS'",1

Volunteers joined together to clean beaches, pick up garbage and sort garbage. An exhibition highlighting activities aiming at protecting the environment and entertainment activities such as games were organised to raise public awareness of environmental protection.In Hà Nội, a dialogue on measures for sustainable energy for the community was held on Saturday as part of Earth Day celebrations.

2065,'Law on Enterprises needs greater reforms',"'HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam must continue to improve on its Law on Enterprises,\xa0experts and researchers said at a law conference in Hà Nội yesterday.The business code, since its formation in 1999 and two major reforms in 2005 and 2014, still has numerous shortcomings and limitations, according to the experts.Compliance costs – expenses incurred to keep up with industry\xa0regulations – remained high. Notably, decreases in compliance, if any, were often results of Government directives or reform programmes when what the country desperately needs is a framework to reduce such costs systematically, said Dr Nguyễn Đình Cung, former head of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and member of the Economic Council under the Prime Minister.Ministries and agencies tend to over-regulate the business sector, especially firms specialised in legal services, finance and banking. Technical barriers often proved to be significant hurdles to starting operations in such fields. Level of policy risk and legal complication remained high. Businesses often found themselves without reliable means to protect their legitimate interests, said CIEM’s former head.Ministries were slow to push for legal reforms thanks to both red tape and a lack of incentives.“One cannot expect changes to come from within the ministries. If what we are hoping for are swift legal reforms we must find the strength to push for them in the private sector,” said Cung.On the other hand, according to Cung, the law has been getting more lax when it comes to State-owned-enterprises (SoEs). Regulatory oversights and poor law-enforcement have resulted in many SoEs being unable to establish an efficient management framework or fail to adhere to good management practices.Phạm Đức Trung, head researcher of CIEM’s business reform and development, said the country has been struggling with the implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 39 principles for corporate governance as a standard for business management.For example, the State has yet to define its strategy and function in many SoEs even after the formation of the Committee for Management of State Capital at Enterprises – a central body responsible for the management of a massive amount of assets owned by the State in SoEs.A lack of autonomy has resulted in SoEs being unable to adopt modern management standards because SoEs cannot make important decisions without approval from\xa0the State, Trung said.Trung called for greater autonomy be granted to SoEs along with accountability for their performance. The State must build a system of performance criteria for SoEs to follow and they must be made to publicise financial information and their management board selection.\xa0— VNS'",2

With a total area of 16.7 ha, its primary investor is the Nhà Bè Garment Corporation Joint-stock Company. The zone houses the Phù Cát Garment Joint-stock Company, the Na Nu Printing Co Ltd and the Delta Galil Việt Nam Joint-stock Company.The investor has not yet built a wastewater treatment system. Raw wastewater is collected and discharged into the environment.Water samples taken from waste produced by Delta Galil Việt Nam had 1.6 times the allowed levels of pollutants.Trần Châu, deputy chairman of the province people’s committee, said he recently signed a decision to fine Delta Galil Việt Nam nearly VNĐ300 million (US$13,000).The company was suspended from its work for 135 days to improve the condition of local waterways.Lương Văn Ngân, chairman of the Phù Cát District People’s Committee, said the district had discussed potential solutions with the provincial Department of Natural Resources and Environment.Concerned organisations used samples of mud and water to develop a detailed treatment plan.The district signed a contract with the Bình Định Water Supply and Sewage Joint-stock Company to supply water for local residents until the problem is resolved. — VNS'",4
308,'Ethnic minority people could have better lives soon',"'HÀ NỘI — The lives of ethnic minority people could be improved and gap between ethnic and mountainous region and others narrowed once a master plan get approval from the National Assembly.A draft resolution on socio-economic development for the ethnic minority, mountainous region, and difficult regions in the 2021-25 period was mulled over by the National Assembly Standing Committee at the ongoing 37th session on Wednesday.According to Đỗ Văn Chiến, head of the NA Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs, the plan was essential to overcome shortcomings and promote the comprehensive development of ethnic minority people.“The implementation of the project will contribute to increasing\xa0incomes for people, contributing to sustainable poverty reduction and basically solving some pressing issues of people living in extremely difficult socio-economic regions,” he said.Among the 54 ethnic groups in Việt Nam, 53 are minorities with more than 13 million people, accounting for 14.6 percent of the country’s population. Ethnic minorities are living in 56 of the 63 provinces and cities nationwide.Although the ethnic minority and mountainous areas in the northwest, Central Highlands, southwestern and western central coastal regions hold strategic position in the country’s socio-economic development strategy as well as guarantee security, they still have with lowest quality of human resources, Chiến said.He also said the regions had lowest access to basic social services and a high poverty rate.Chiến blamed this on the fact the ethnic minority people live in the border and mountainous areas with severe climate and poor infrastructure.High cost of production and circulation of goods have made it difficult to attract social resources for socio-economic development.The low efficiency of using investment capital and failure to exploit the potentials of the regions has also deterred their development.Thanks to implementation of policy to support infrastructure development for ethnic minority and mountainous areas and poverty reduction models, the living standards of local residents has improved remarkably.One such model is a fish farm built in the reservoir of the hydro power plant in Lai Châu which provides employment and salaries for a number of residents in the Than Uyên District.In 2018, it helped see a reduction of 5 per cent of the number of poor households living in poverty compared to the previous year.By the end of last year, there were 24,195 poor households, accounting for 25 per cent of the total households in the province.In 2018, two districts, Tân Uyên and Than Uyên, were no longer on the list of the poor districts of the country.Hà Ngọc Chiến, chairman of Ethnic Council, said the majority of council members agreed with the necessity of building the master plan as mentioned in the Government’s report.“It is essential to have a policy strong enough to attract investment in these regions, aiming at narrowing the development and income gap,” he said.Basing on supervisory results on the implementation of policies to support socio-economic development for ethnic minority and mountainous areas in 2016-18 period, Chiến said, the project would help enhance the effectiveness of policies and investment resource of the State and society.The total capital for the project was estimated at VNĐ335.4 trillion at the minimum level.However, the ethnic council proposed the Government to clarify the foundation for resource estimate because the project failed to show\xa0list of investment.The council also suggested the Ministry of Planning and Investment to make a report on resource assessment before submitting to the NA for approval.The Government should make clear the State budget spending increase compared with the 2011-22 period and how to guarantee the investment resource.Chiến said the Ethnic Council proposed the Government to amend the project and submit to the eight session of National Assembly for consideration.Construction LawEarlier the same day, Minister of Construction Phạm Hồng Hà\xa0was questioned by standing committee members on lax management of\xa0construction violations.Nguyễn Thanh Hải, head of the chairwoman of the National Assembly\'s Ombudsman Committee, said many individuals and organisations that violated construction regulations were punished for their violations, but the constructions were not dismantled.“Such management would make people lose their trust,” she said, adding that works that violate construction law should be stopped and dismantled if it affects people\'s lives.NA\xa0Judicial Committee head\xa0Lê Thị Nga shared the concerns.“If any ordinary citizen who put construction materials at their doors, urban management force would give a warning right away. But many huge construction works that violate the law still exist and the owners of such works are only given fines. Who would be responsible for such violations?” she said.Minister Phạm Hồng Hà\xa0acknowledged the concerns were completely\xa0reasonable.""Such limitations in the field of\xa0construction come from two factors - regulations and law enforcement, which\xa0are\xa0poorly implemented.\xa0We will try to address,"" he said.Also in the discussion session, some participants said it was necessary to revise the Construction Law and relocate construction works which are intertwined in residential areas, affecting people\'s lives and health.Hải from the Ombudsman Committee cited the case of the Rạng Đông factory fire and said many production projects are located in residential areas such as extracting gas, or flammable materials and explosives trading.""With existing construction works that are causing pollution to the surrounding residential areas, relevant authorities have\xa0to strictly comply with the Prime Minister\'s Decree 130 on relocation from urban areas and residential areas,"" she said.\xa0— VNS'",0

The powders are made into drinks by adding water.Besides, since the powders are made by grinding with granite stone mortars, they are very soft.In order to ensure supply of clean produce, Hương and her partners grow them in Tân An Hội Commune in Củ Chi.After starting with pennywort,\xa0her Thiên Nhiên Việt Import-Export Company has since developed various instant powders like perilla, moringa, green tea, lotus leaf, and chameleon leaf.""The company\'s freeze-dried powders have been marketed around for more than three years and received positive feedback from consumers,"" Hương says.They are now available at grocery stores around the country and online, and the company plans to get ISO certification to export, she said.Her project won the first prize at the 2019 Innovation Start-up Project Contest held by the Business Study and Assistance Centre in collaboration with the Rural Youth Committee of Central Youth Union recently.Another start-up that has created a great impact is one that produces compost and breeds earthworms. It belongs to Lê Minh Vương, a graduate of the Saigon University, who won the second prize in the contest in 2015.Vương says: “At the end of my second year and beginning of my third year at university, I realised by chance the great benefits earthworms bring to agriculture when I was doing a thesis on treating the waste in shrimp ponds.“Earthworms can benefit agriculture by improving soil, which is seriously degraded by chemical fertilisers. But people do not pay much attention to them.”So he wants to promote the benefits of earthworms by breeding them and making various products like vermicompost, a kind of organic fertiliser.“The Vietnamese market knows about the benefits of vermicompost, so a lot of people are using it. And currently there is not enough to supply the market.“My company, the Southern Earthworm Company, has enjoyed good growth. We produce various kinds of products such as vermicompost, earthworm fluid, earthworm pellets, dried earthworms, animal feed, and bran pellets.“We plan to introduce a very unique product, not only for Việt Nam but also the world, by the end of this year: cosmetics produced from earthworm mucus, with the worms bred using clean technology.“We will set up a clean earthworm breeding area at our 3,000sq.m earthworm farm to ensure the raw material source for making the cosmetics as well as other products.“We will also provide services of processing pig manure for medium-sized and large pig farms that have from 10,000 to 100,000 pigs to transform waste into compost.”Vương also says he has a 3ha farm where he has been cultivating mango, durian, sugar-apple, mangosteen, and other fruits using vermicompost for almost a year, and a few thousand square metres of land for growing green leafy vegetables.These are among successful start-ups in the agricultural sector.Evaluating agricultural start-ups set up recently, Vũ Kim Hạnh, chairwoman of the High Quality Vietnamese Product Association and member of the Innovation Start-up Project Contest’s jury for many years, says: “Most of the projects know how to utilise their [local] advantages and technologies for growing and processing agricultural products to increase the value of these resources.“Young people are particularly enthusiastic about developing projects and products,” she says.Many start-ups understand how to develop new products that meet the needs of niche markets, which is one of the important criteria in starting a business, she explains.Trần Anh Tuấn, CEO of The Pathfinder, who has been a mentor for many start-up projects, says: “Starting an agriculture business in Việt Nam is quite difficult, so I appreciate the efforts of those who choose agricultural products to start a business.”Besides successful projects, many start-up projects have failed due to a variety of reasons, mostly due to their own faults rather than by the competition, he says.“Many start-ups thought their business model was great, everyone needed their products and liked them, but then their products were not accepted by the market.“Therefore, the message for start-ups is to never live and die with the original idea. On the contrary, they need to be flexible and ready to change to create new products with new values.“Owners of start-ups must constantly gather feedback from consumers to tweak their products and even strategies to meet market needs.”He suggests that start-ups should link up with experts to get advice from them and with their peers to share their experiences in sales, marketing and others.“Without that, start-ups will find it difficult to succeed. Starting up is a journey in which you can learn from many different sources and about the successes and failures of your peers. We should not think we know everything and be open to learning.”Đoàn Sao Mai, another expert, concurs, saying: “Start-ups should enhance closer connection not only in trading but also in production. For example, when buying packaging, if you cooperate and make it a single order, the cost will be lower.”Hương says: “Over the past three years I have played many roles from that of farmer growing vegetables to a producer and economic planner.“With many lessons I have learnt during my start-up journey, I am willing to share experience with other start-ups who also want to improve the value of Vietnamese agricultural products.” — VNS'",1
1003,'City considers\xa0new\xa0vocational-training direction\xa0for rural workers',"HCM CITY — The programme on vocational training for workers in rural areas should be modified amid changes caused by rapid urbanisation, the HCM City's Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs has said.Speaking at a recent conference, Nguyễn Văn Lâm, the department’s deputy head, asked all district officials in the city to consider how the programme should change, and whether vocational training in non-agricultural areas become the focus.He said the districts should conduct surveys of farmers, enterprises and young people to identify specific demands and needs in rural areas.“The most important thing is that people get a job after vocational training. That is the main goal,” Lâm said.In many rural areas, workers and farmers often fail to apply what they have learned in courses. They are usually sent to vocational courses by local labour officials who must reach a yearly quota of workers sent to vocational training.Phan Đỗ Huy Thông, vice rector of the Củ Chi Vocational Training School, said that workers in rural areas viewed vocational training as ineffective and were reluctant to participate.A representative from the department’s division in Nhà Bè District said that work in logistics and at industrial parks in the district would require vocational training to meet enterprises’ demands.Dr Lê Ngọc Đức of the Hi-tech Agriculture Training Centre said that although agriculture accounted for only 0.9 per cent of the city’s gross domestic product growth, nearly 1 million people were still employed in the sector in the city.Vocational training in agriculture is still necessary for these workers, Đức said, adding that the centre this year co-operated with local farmers’ associations to open three short courses in technologies that could be used in farming.Phạm Văn Chiến, deputy head of the department’s labour division in Cần Giờ District, said the department should co-operate with relevant agencies and scientists on researching the most suitable farming or breeding activities for localities.Based on the research, the labour division would then work with vocational training centres to train farmers more effectively, Chiến said, adding that farmers would be eager to follow effective farming or vocational training models.In the 2010-2019 period, more than 717,100 workers in rural areas received vocational training.

You prepare the team, you work, you train, then the game starts and your action during the game is not very important. In other matches you have to play and I had to play.""Apart from an awful feeling in relation to Eric, everything was great.""Last season\'s Champions League finalists can now look forward to the knockout stages for a third straight season, but will go through in second behind Bayern Munich in Group B after the German giants secured top spot with a 6-0 thrashing of Red Star Belgrade.Spurs have now scored seven goals in winning Mourinho\'s first two games in charge to make a good first impression on many supporters unconvinced by the appointment of a former Chelsea manager renowned for a more conservative style of football.However, the first 20 minutes showed the work Mourinho has ahead to make Tottenham as tight at the back as his most successful sides over the past two decades.El Arabi was afforded plenty of room on the edge of the box to line up his shot and find the bottom corner after six minutes before more sloppy defending allowed Semedo to prod home from a corner.Very good ball boyMourinho had seen enough inside the first half-hour to make a change as Dier was sacrificed to make way for Eriksen.""It could have been any of us to come off in that first 20 minutes but thankfully the sub worked,"" said Alli.However, it was a huge error from Olympiakos rather than a moment of inspiration that gifted the hosts a route back into the game.Aurier\'s low cross from the right should have been easily cleared by Yassine Meriah, but he let the ball slip under his foot and Alli was on hand to tap in at the back post in first-half stoppage time.Five minutes after the restart, Spurs were level as Aurier\'s throw-in freed Lucas Moura down the right and his cross was swept home by Kane.However, it was a ball boy who fed Aurier quickly who received special praise from Mourinho.""To do that you have to be a very good ball boy,"" added the Portuguese.""He\'s there living the game and playing the game very, very well.""Aurier was the unlikely hero 17 minutes from time as he sweetly connected with Alli\'s cross at the back post to put Spurs in front.And Kane put the seal on morale-boosting second half when he stooped to head home his 23rd goal of the season in as many games for club and country.""We know that and did not come out with any energy and they got the two goals and put us under pressure, it was an uphill struggle but we got the goals and it feels good to qualify,"" said the England captain.""It was about qualifying, no matter how we did it."" —\xa0AFP'",3

The phenomenon occurs due to dry sunny weather during the day and low surface air temperatures at night.\nAccording to an air quality report for September released on Tuesday by the Việt Nam Environment Administration, PM2.5 levels in Hà Nội over the past few days had reached their highest levels for five years.\nThe air quality index from September 12 to 29 showed PM2.5 levels exceeded the permitted limit according to statistics collected from 13 environmental monitoring stations in the capital.\nDuring that period, Hà Nội enjoyed only five days when the air quality was good. On the other days, the air quality index reached more than 100, which is classed as unhealthy.\nLow rainfall was one of the reasons for the surge in fine dust last month, the report said.\nHeat reverse and people burning straw in fields on the city’s outskirts were also to blame for increasing levels of PM2.5, according to the report.\nAir quality in Hà Nội is continuing to worsen. The Air Quality Index on AirVisual, an international air quality monitoring facility that generates data from public, ground-based and real-time monitoring stations, reached the purple level (very unhealthy) at 7-8am on Tuesday morning and the brown level (hazardous) at 9am. At this level, air quality is deemed toxic and poses a serious risk to the heart and lungs. Everyone should avoid outdoor exertion.\nAssociate Professor Vũ Văn Giáp, deputy director of the Respiratory Centre at the Hà Nội-based Bạch Mai Hospital, said: “Fine dust with super small diameters cannot be felt. When we breathe it in it goes into our blood and organs, causing inflammation and diseases to different organs.”\nIf the air quality worsened, people with heart or respiratory diseases would experience difficulty breathing and cough more, he said.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, air pollution is a silent killer. About 30 per cent of deaths caused by lung cancer and 43 per cent of deaths caused by respiratory diseases in the world are related to air pollution. If there are no measures taken to protect the air, humans will be the first to suffer the consequences.\nNguyễn Minh Tiến, deputy director of HCM City’s Paediatrics Hospital, advised people to use air filter masks which are able to filter 95 to 99 per cent of fine dust.\nNormal masks filter only 30 to 40 per cent of dust. People should keep their houses and bodies clean and eat fruit and vegetables to increase resistance levels. VNS'",4

2882,'Messi fit and firing in Barca demolition of Valladolid',"'Lionel Messi scored twice and provided two assists as Barcelona returned to the top of La Liga. — AFP/VNA PhotoBARCELONA —\xa0Lionel Messi made it clear he is fit and back to his scintillating best by tearing apart Real Valladolid on Tuesday in a thumping 5-1 victory for Barcelona.Messi scored another spell-binding free-kick at Camp Nou after his sumptuous pass had already teed up Arturo Vidal for Barca\'s second. He then drove home his second late on before sliding through Luis Suarez to make it five.Yet in truth his two goals and two assists were just the start of it, the defining moments of another mesmeric all-round performance that was dotted with flicks, passes and dribbles, not to mention two humiliating nutmegs.""I don\'t know what more I can say,"" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde.""There were wonders coming out of his foot,"" said Valladolid\'s Michel. ""You can only applaud and enjoy it.""Valladolid had threatened to make a game of it when Kiko Olivas benefitted from a rare Marc-Andre ter Stegen error to equalise, after Clement Lenglet had struck in the second minute.But with Messi in this sort of mood, the result never felt in doubt as victory sent Barcelona back to the top of La Liga, after Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw by Alaves a couple of hours before.Valverde\'s side have now won seven consecutive matches in all competitions, a run that began by beating Villarreal on September 24, when Messi returned from injury to make his first start of the season.He has needed time, admitting earlier this month he was still short of sharpness even as goals flew in against Sevilla, Eibar and Slavia Prague.But this display sent a resounding message that Messi is back to his best even if Valverde feels there is more to come.""He is still getting back to full fitness,"" Valverde said. ""But he is getting better and better.""Valladolid were perhaps unfortunate the 32-year-old was fresh after the postponed Clasico on Saturday meant Barcelona and Real Madrid were given the weekend off.It meant this was the first game at Camp Nou since violent protests broke out across Catalonia after nine pro-independence leaders were sentenced to imprisonment on October 21.Giant yellow banners with \'Independencia\' and \'Llibertat\' written across them were unfurled before kick-off but there was no sign of unrest. Instead, the mood turned celebratory as Messi got to work.It was his free-kick that Valladolid made a mess of clearing, as Sergi Guardiola lashed the ball against Joaquin Fernandez and Lenglet reacted fastest, his shot deflecting in before two minutes were on the clock.Messi runs the showThe procession was briefly halted when Ter Stegen, perhaps unsighted, slapped a cross straight into the shin of Olivas but the remaining 30 minutes of the first half belonged to Messi.He switched the ball for Frenkie de Jong to slightly overhit a pass for Arturo Vidal and then replicated the Dutchman\'s effort but did it better, this time picking out Vidal perfectly to score at the back post.Five minutes later he sent a free-kick curling away from Jordi Masip, who scuttled across his line but could never reach the ball as it nestled in the top right-hand corner.Messi flicked one through the legs of Oscar Plano, who threw his head back and for a moment stopped dead in frustration. Then it was Guardiola\'s turn, only this time the nutmeg doubled up as a pass.After half-time, Ansu Fati, making his last appearance before turning 17, should have tucked away a Messi pass before two goals in the 75th and 77th minutes put Valladolid out of sight.Messi cushioned Ivan Rakitic\'s cute pass on his thigh and drove it into the corner and then slid in Suarez, who finished for his eighth goal of the season.In injury time, Messi should have had his hat-trick but curled wide of the left post when he seemed certain to score. It might have been his first mistake all night.Atletico Madrid could have done with a drop of Messi\'s attacking inspiration as they were held to a disappointing draw by Alaves.Alvaro Morata came off the bench to score his third goal in as many games but Lucas Perez hit a stunning late equaliser at Menizorrotza to ensure a tight contest between two of La Liga\'s most stubborn defences ended all square.Atletico sit third, two points behind Barcelona and level with Granada, having played one game more. — AFP'",3

Doctors there said there was no hope. We were desperate at the time, and thought he would die. I am happy now knowing that my son will be discharged soon,” said Điển.“Before the operation, he was just 41kg. Now he weighs 47kg and has started talking and eating normally,” she added.According to Nguyễn Hữu Ước, director of Việt Nam-Germany Hospital’s Cardiac and Thoracic Center, post-surgical conditions of organ transplants can be complicated, especially lung transplants as there are many issues including infection control, respiratory care and graft rejection prevention.In K’s case, his condition stabilised after just 6 weeks of intensive care.“He will need to have post-surgical examinations to help the new lungs rehab,” said Ước.The success had encouraged doctors to perform further organ transplants in the future, he added.In mid-December 2018, Việt Nam-Germany Hospital doctors performed their first lung transplant on a 17-year-old person suffering from final-stage connected tissue disease – a rare form of lung cancer - and severe multiple-organ failure.Ước said the operation was technically successful. Ten months after the surgery, the patient is receiving intensive care in hospital. — VNS",1

The agency committed funding of US$183 million for the project, which is scheduled to last 10 years using the remediation methods used at Đà Nẵng Airport.Addressing the event, Permanent Deputy PM Trương Hoà Bình hailed the US side for actively working to support the development of the project, especially the personal support of Senator Patrick Leahy and other US senators.\n\nStatistics show around 4.8 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin, over three\xa0million of whom are Agent Orange/dioxin victims, and the toxic chemical also had effects on the third generation, he said.The Party and Government have defined that the settlement of post-war toxic chemical consequences is an urgent task to help protect the health and ensure environmental safety for people and spur sustainable socio-economic development.He also noted the close coordination between relevant agencies of Việt Nam and the US in activities to survey, assess\xa0and resolve dioxin contamination, and implement projects on healthcare and functional rehabilitation for people with disabilities in the country.These outcomes are initial but important to stepping up the comprehensive partnership between Việt Nam and the US.Located about 30 kilometres from HCM City, Biên Hoà was a major base for the US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine units during the war.Dioxin, a highly toxic chemical contained in the defoliant, stays in the soil and at the bottom of lakes and rivers for generations.The chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects and other chronic diseases, according to Việt Nam Red Cross. — VNS'",0

The film was then banned from being screened in Việt Nam.After the cartoon’s release in Việt Nam, many parents who took their children to see the film expressed anger when seeing the Chinese\xa0nine-dash line map. The map was in the main character’s bedroom. The image appears in four scenes lasting for four seconds in the hour-and-a-half cartoon.The Director of the Cinema Department, Nguyễn Thu Hà, has admitted her responsibility in the case and would co-ordinate with the distributor to stop screenings.In their press release to local media, film distributor CGV said they immediately stopped screening the cartoon on Sunday\xa0after news it contained the map.The company has also withdrawn all advertising for the cartoon.“As the distributor, CGV seriously admits our carelessness in the distribution process,” the press release said.“We recognise that this is a serious problem. CGV sincerely apologise to Vietnamese audiences and will strictly follow the directions from Vietnamese State management agencies,” the release added.According to the release, the cartoon features the journey of a yeti named Everest, during which he receives help from a little Chinese girl named Yi and her friends.Nguyễn Hoàng Hải, Distribution Director of CGV in Việt Nam, said the film was screened for nearly two weeks but did not attract many viewers.The 'nine-dash line' map is a notion introduced by Beijing’s rulers to claim its “historical sovereignty” over nearly the whole East Sea.The notion is contrary to international law. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that China’s announcement lacks legal basis under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The contested area in the South China Sea includes the Hoàng Sa (Paracel) and the Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelagos of Việt Nam.

3787,'Hundreds of smuggled Red lory parrots found at Nội Bài Airport',"'HÀ NỘI — More than 300 red lory parrots – an endangered bird found only in Indonesia – were suspected to have been imported to Việt Nam illegally earlier this week.On Monday, customs officers at Nội Bài International Airport found the parrots alive in ten packages that were reportedly from Indonesia, transited in Malaysia, to Việt Nam.On the packages’ bill of lading, the sender is PT SINAR NATAMA TRANS LOGISTIC while the receiver’s address is in Hoàng Mai District, Hà Nội.On Tuesday, Nội Bài Airport customs transferred the parrots to Hà Nội’s Forest Protection Department for quarantine.According to the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, the red lory parrot is listed in Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)’s Appendix II, meaning that legal documents are required for the import of the bird including permissions granted from CITES agencies in the exporting country and importing country as well as post-import animal quarantine.Vice director of CITES Việt Nam, Vương Tiến Mạnh, said that the agency would contact its counterpart in Indonesia over the exporting permission.If the parrot packages were not eligible for import to Việt Nam, they would be returned to Indonesia, Mạnh said.If the exporting country refused to accept them, the importing country would complete legal procedures for their preservation, he added.In Việt Nam, a red lory parrot can be sold for up to VNĐ5 million (US$214). — VNS'",4
1087,'HCM City tightens land management',"'HCM CITY — HCM City plans to tighten management of public lands and apply information technology to increase the city’s revenues, a city official said yesterday at a meeting.Võ Văn Hoan, vice chairman of the city’s People’s Committee, said that four groups of solutions, including the law, administration, planning and finance, would be applied.The city will also develop a long-term plan for land use in the health, education and transport sectors, as well as strengthen inspections of land management.In addition, the city will strictly revoke any delayed projects and carefully calculate public land revenues.It will also work with agencies to remove obstacles faced by delayed investment projects that are subject to overlapping regulations.To ensure transparency, IT will be used in land management, according to Hoan.Nguyễn Toàn Thắng, director of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment, said there were too many agencies managing public lands and the city should have only one agency responsible for management and commercialisation of public lands.“This will prevent the situation of huge public buildings and lands being wasted and causing a great loss to the city, which has occurred for a long time,” he said.Many agencies occupy large land plots and pay nothing or a nominal fee, and in most cases they leave the land unused or sublet it at much higher rates than they pay.“Many businesses place their own interest above the common interest. Despite their ineffective use of land, they insist on keeping it at their disposal,” Thắng said.Encroachment of public land and illegal sale of public lands to private individuals are rife, even as many build-transfer (BT) projects remain stalled due to delays in handovers of land to contractors as payment for their work, according to Thắng.The Government recently instructed all cities and provinces to improve the management of land use.Public agencies that are found wasting land will lose the land, which will be handed over to the city’s Land Fund Development Centre.The city will work with central agencies to review their land holdings and will take charge in cases of poor management, according to Thắng. — VNS'",1

1189,'Church complex on Thủ Thiêm peninsula to be preserved as national relic',"HCM CITY — The Thủ Thiêm Catholic Church complex will be preserved as a national relic under the Cultural Heritage Law, an official said on Tuesday at a meeting in HCM City.The complex, which includes a number of buildings, will be protected in accordance with the 2001 Cultural Heritage Law and other related legal documents, according to Huỳnh Thanh Nhân, director of the Department of Culture and Sports.Speaking at the meeting on historic preservation held by the People’s Council, Nhân said the decision would affect the city’s planning of the Thủ Thiêm new urban area project in District 2 since the complex is located within the area.Previously, the city government had planned to clear all of these works to build a functional area in the new urban area, but decided to preserve them in early February. But it did not issue a detailed plan at that time.The department said it would submit documents to the city People’ Committee next month. The ranking of the complex of buildings as national relics aims to preserve and promote the architectural, cultural and historic value of the works, according to Nhân.Located on the banks of the Sài Gòn River next to the city centre, the Thủ Thiêm Catholic church was built in 1859, one of the oldest parishes of the HCM City Archdiocese.The Thủ Thiêm Congregation of the Lovers of the Holy Cross, which includes a monastery and other buildings, was established in 1840 and has been expanding in the Thủ Thiêm area since it was an isolated area on the side of the river with only a few small houses.Since the foundation of the church, the Sisters of the Lovers of the Holy Cross have transformed the tropical area into homes, schools and farms from which they earned a living and supported the poor of the area.For the past 20 years, the city government has been carrying out a master plan for the Thủ Thiêm new urban area which covers 657ha, with nearly 30 per cent of land lots being developed for commercial purposes.Other areas in the new urban area are for public services, including a central square, riverside park and children’s palace.Approved by the Government in 1996, the proposed financial district and mixed-use urban area was expected to become the largest inner-city development in Southeast Asia.To develop such a project, it has taken more than 10 years to complete site clearance on Thủ Thiêm peninsula, with nearly 15,000 households already resettled. More than 99 per cent of land in the proposed area has been cleared.Besides the church, the preservation of old villas in the city was also addressed at the meeting. The HCM City Development and Research Institute has proposed preserving 16 villas built before 1975 because of their historical and cultural importance.HCM City has nearly 900 villas built before 1975, mostly located in districts 1, 3, 5 and Thủ Đức, which have been recommended for official classification by owners and authorities.Valuable old buildings, mostly built during the French colonial period, include the HCM City People’s Court (built in 1881), King’s Palace or Revolutionary Museum (1885), Majestic Hotel and Notre Dame Cathedral (1887), Sài Gòn Post Office (1886-1891), HCM City People's Committee Head Office (1907), Opera House (1900), and Bến Thành Market (1912-1914). — VNS",1

It also planned to offer 1,600 free bus ticket to migrant labourers for them to go home ahead of the holiday.The Federation of Labour in Đồng Nai Province – which is an industrial hub in southern Việt Nam – reported that it would present 2,500 gifts worth VNĐ1.25 billion (US$54,300) to labourers, as well as 1,500 bus tickets. — VNS'",1

A friend who waded into one of our heated arguments on some issue on Facebook took his side, and quick as a flash, Robert informed him that he and I were brothers who loved each other, notwithstanding all our arguments. That was Robert.That he could make a guy like me enjoy reading about golf, heck,\xa0look forward to reading it\xa0exemplified Robert’s charm and his talent. I know I am speaking for each and every member of the Việt Nam News family when I say that our hearts are broken, but we’ll celebrate him.As a cancer survivor myself, I had talked at length with him on learning about his diagnosis, and our bonds seemed to strengthen as we discussed it.

1744,Secluded\xa0Islet's only household offers homestay\xa0for visitors,"'Ngọc DiệpĐỒNG NAI — When Nguyễn Văn Long was 26 years old, he moved to\xa0Năm Bầu Islet in the middle of a lake\xa0in the southern province of Đồng Nai. Nothing unusual about that, but at the time he\xa0was the only person\xa0there.Today, Long, 62, lives there with his wife and five-year-old grandson.After leaving\xa0his hometown in Long An Province, Long\xa0settled on\xa0the\xa0islet\xa0that was formed, along with 75 other small islets, on the lake after the Trị An Hydropower Plant\xa0was built on the Đồng Nai River in 1984.The 323sq.km lake was once a forest,\xa0and in the early days, Long made a living\xa0by sawing down trees.The islet, which\xa0covers about 4ha, is\xa0only\xa0three kilometres from the main shore. It can\xa0only be reached by boat.In 1987, local residents began to call the\xa0islet Năm Bầu because Long\'s\xa0wife\xa0was\xa0pregnant at the time. Năm\xa0is his\xa0wife’s\xa0nickname and Bầu\xa0means pregnant.“The\xa0name helped\xa0locals distinguish this islet from the others\xa0on Trị An Lake,” Long\xa0said.His\xa0family later shifted from growing rice, corn and beans to\xa0planting cashew trees because of\xa0the local soil.About 2-3 tonnes\xa0of raw\xa0cashew\xa0nuts are harvested annually if the weather is good. The cashew crop is now Long\'s\xa0main source of income.Though the family\xa0faced difficulties over the years, they have been able to\xa0adapt\xa0to changing situations, according to Long.For extra\xa0income, Long uses\xa0a\xa0boat\xa0to\xa0catch fish and other aquatic species\xa0to sell\xa0in the market.“During the rainy season, I always have a good catch. Sometimes, I\xa0spend the whole night fishing,” he said.Besides cashew and fish, the family also grows mango trees\xa0and breeds chickens and pigs.Many trees, mostly\xa0earleaf acacia, have been\xa0planted on the islet to prevent land erosion.Long\'s wife, Trần Thị Thanh Nga, 57, whose\xa0hometown is\xa0Cần Thơ City, said they once lived\xa0without electricity and tap water, and had to use oil lamps\xa0and store\xa0rainwater\xa0for daily\xa0use.“But our\xa0life has become\xa0more stable,” Nga said.In\xa02011, solar power panels were\xa0installed on the roof of their house to generate power for electricity.In the past, they had to use\xa0a rowboat for transport, but now they have a motorboat.Nga\xa0still cannot swim, but can ""drive the boat well"", she said.Their two daughters and a son are married. The son and his wife now live in a rented house on the main\xa0shore near the islet.“My grandson was born on the island and also likes to live here,” Nga said.Every day, Long take his grandson by boat to school\xa0and they swim in the lake every evening.At noon, the family gathers in the\xa0small wooden house to split the shells of cashew nuts and watches television in the evening.They leave the islet\xa0only for\xa0the Tết\xa0(Lunar New Year)\xa0holiday\xa0and on\xa0special occasions to visit relatives and friends.“We really love the peaceful life here. We have no plan to move to another place,” Long said.Eco-tourism potentialNăm Bầu Islet has seen a rising number of visitors in recent years.\xa0Most of them are young people or families who want to explore pristine nature and enjoy fresh air away from the big city.In recent years, people who\xa0visited\xa0Trị An Lake and stopped on the islet\xa0for rest\xa0asked\xa0Long and his family to cook dishes.As more\xa0people began to hear\xa0about the islet, the number of visitors increased.“We built\xa0a small hut with hammocks to serve them,” Long said.After people suggested that he offer an eco-tourism model, Long built accommodations for a\xa0homestay service\xa0with prices at\xa0only VNĐ50,000 (US$2.15) per person per night.Last year, the family installed more solar power panels to ensure electricity needs for visitors.To promote eco-tourism,\xa0Đồng Nai Province\'s Culture and Nature Reserve plans to add the islet\xa0to\xa0its package tour\xa0on Trị An Lake.Nguyễn Hoàng Nam, a tour guide at the reserve, said he\xa0had\xa0taken\xa0many groups of tourists to the islet.The family can\xa0serve 15-20 people daily, or a maximum of 30 visitors.“This place is one of the best choices for people looking for peace\xa0and\xa0quiet,” Nam said.Visitors can\xa0ride\xa0in\xa0boats and\xa0catch fish in\xa0the lake, taste local dishes\xa0prepared by the family, and enjoy fresh fruits from\xa0their garden at reasonable prices, he said.Many people often buy fresh fish\xa0to take\xa0back home as gifts.“I\xa0feel very relaxed\xa0here. My children enjoy\xa0this place,” a female visitor from HCM City said.As a present to them, she brought them to the islet and\xa0stayed overnight there.She said she would likely return and tell other people about the islet\'s offerings.Long said he was\xa0happy to receive guests. “Tourists are\xa0very welcome if they are well-behaved and care for and protect the environment,” he said.He\xa0hopes the next generation will continue not only to live on the islet, but also protect the natural landscape\xa0and the\xa0peaceful atmosphere. — VNS'",1
3368,'Long An develops advanced farming models',"LONG AN — Many farming models using advanced techniques and offering farmers higher incomes have been adopted in the Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta province of Long An.After three years of implementation, a trial project to grow vegetables on 2,000ha in Cần Đước, Cần Giuộc and Đức Hòa districts and Tân An City until 2020 has been hailed by local farmers for its efficiency.Đoàn Phương Nga, deputy head of the province's Sub-department of Plant Cultivation, Protection and Agricultural Product Quality Management’s plant cultivation and protection division, said farmers participating in the project have achieved high incomes.They have built net houses, installed efficient irrigation equipment and use machinery for cultivation and harvest.The use of organic fertilisers and net houses causes the vegetables to grow well and get few diseases.The farmers also buy disease-free seedlings from selected nurseries that grow well.They have reduced the use of pesticides and get yields that are 5-20 per cent higher than from traditional farming method and profits that are VNĐ2-5 million (US$86-215) per 1,000sq.m higher.Đoàn Văn Út, a member of the Phước Thịnh Co-operative in Cần Giuộc District and a participating farmer, said he grows water melon on an area of 5,000sq.m and receives a 50 per cent subsidy on seedling and other input costs.He harvests 3,000-3,050kg per 1,000sq.m, 200-250kg\xa0higher than normal, he said.He earns VNĐ33-33.5 million ($1,420-1,440) per crop, VNĐ2.2-2.25 million ($94-97) higher than from normal melon.Đặng Duy Dũng, director of Phước Thịnh, said: “Participating in the farming models, the co-operative’s members both apply advanced farming techniques and get higher incomes.”There are 10 agricultural co-operatives and 30 co-operative groups participating in the project, according to the province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.Nguyễn Chí Thiện, deputy director of the department, said the models have received positive responses from farmers.To meet the project’s targets, the department and localities would continue to teach farmers advanced farming techniques and establish model farms for them to visit and learn, he said.The province has 13,500ha growing vegetables, yielding\xa0annual production of 221,000 tonnes.ExpansionThe province's Farmers Association has urged farmers, co-operatives and agricultural companies to expand the use of advanced farming techniques.It has organised training courses for farmers and encouraged them to grow crops to Vietnamese and global good agricultural practices standards.It has encouraged farmers to install drip irrigation and spray irrigation equipment.Phạm Chí Tâm, its chairman, said the association plans to establish 13 model farms that use advanced farming techniques at a cost of VNĐ3 billion (over $129,000) this year.They include two models for growing dragon fruit in Châu Thành District, seven others for growing vegetables in Cần Đước and Cần Giuộc districts and two each for breeding oxen and cows in Đức Hòa District and planting rice in Thạnh Hóa and Vĩnh Hưng districts.Nearly 13,400ha of rice are farmed using advanced techniques, according to the department.They use certified seeds, laser-operated\xa0land levellers, ploughing machines, and combined harvesters.Farmers use organic fertilisers and bio-cides and grow flowers around the fields to attract insects that are natural enemies of brown plant hoppers, the main rice pest.Rice grown this way fetches VNĐ4-6 million ($172-258) per hectare higher than from normal fields.The province has encouraged the creation of large-scale rice fields to reduce costs, increase productivity and guarantee outlets.For the current summer-autumn rice crop, 2,677 farmers have pooled their lands to create 94 large-scale rice fields.They have signed contracts for guaranteed purchases with 25 rice companies.The province plans to have 20,000ha of rice grown using advanced techniques by the end of this year. — VNS",3

2612,'MoIT imposes highest tax on Chinese aluminium products',"'HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) decided to officially impose the highest rate of anti-dumping duties on aluminium products originating from 16 Chinese producers.Accordingly, six Chinese aluminium exporters will face the highest rate of 35.58 per cent, eight others will face rates of between 18.16 and 35.39 per cent, two final exporters will face a rate of less than 10 per cent.The products are used to make aluminium doors, wattle walls, storage cabinets and\xa0interior and\xa0exterior decorations, as well as in\xa0construction.\xa0In addition, they are also used to make\xa0industrial machines and structures.In January, the MoIT conducted an investigation into aluminium imports from China according to regulations from\xa0the World Trade Organisation and\xa0Foreign Trade Management Law, as well as losses to domestic manufacturers.It found that Chinese aluminium was dumped at a margin of 2.49 per cent to 35.58 per cent. In some cases, prices of Chinese products were much lower than the production cost of the product in Việt Nam. As a result, the domestic aluminium industry has suffered in recent years, causing losses to many businesses and forcing employees to quit their jobs.On June 5, after a five-month investigation, the MoIT temporarily applied the lowest anti-dumping rate of 2.46 per cent on the Chinese aluminium products.Last year, the amount of imported aluminium extruded bars from China to Việt Nam reached\xa062,000 tonnes, double that of 2017. The figure excluded a large\xa0amount of\xa0imports to processing zones. Imports from other countries fell\xa0to 5,000 tonnes in 2018.Also in 2018, the US conducted a tax evasion investigation on some extruded aluminium products imported from Việt Nam. In mid-September, the US concluded some of them were evading anti-dumping duties the US has imposed on Chinese products. The US then announced a tax rate of up to 374.15 per cent for those Vietnamese products.According to the MoIT, with some of the local products on which the US imposed anti-dumping duties, there were a number of products with the mentioned Chinese exporters.The MoIT said the US move could seriously damage good aluminium manufacturers in Việt Nam in terms of profitability and reputation, giving them competition with both the cheap imported products from China in the local market and earning a reputation and position in the international market.The MoIT thought the imposition of anti-dumping duties this time will help reduce such pressure on domestic manufacturing enterprises as well as avoid tax-evading products from China.According to regulations, anti-dumping measures will take effect within five years from the effective date of September 28. — VNS'",2

We need the whole society’s engagement in detecting HIV infections, offering appropriate treatments and ensuring privacy of HIV-infected people at healthcare stations to push back against AIDS,” said Đam.Workers at industrial parks in the northern province of Thái Nguyên are given instructions on how to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission. — VNA/VNS Photo Dương NgọcChanges and challengesEamonn Murphy, Regional Director of UNAIDS, Asia and the Pacific, stressed upon Việt Nam’s significant achievements towards the 90-90-90 target set by the United Nations.It aims to have 90 per cent of infected people knowing their status, 90 per cent of that group accessing sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and 90 per cent of those treated patients having the virus suppressed.According to Murphy, from 2010 to 2018, Việt Nam managed to reduce new HIV infections by 65 per cent, recording the greatest leap in the Asia-Pacific region in controlling virus transmission.This year marks the 20th anniversary of the ARV treatment programme in Việt Nam.Over the past two decades, the programme has continuously expanded its coverage to save many HIV-infected people.Since March 2019, Vietnamese people living with HIV have switched to receiving ARV covered by social healthcare insurance, making Việt Nam one of few countries allocating the social insurance fund to pay for the treatment.Many innovative approaches have been adopted to introduce a wide range of treatment options and prevention choices including community led and self-testing, PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and opioid substitution therapy (OST).“Acting together, Việt Nam can remain at the forefront of the HIV response in the region, sharing how to leave no one behind and share its experience with the world. This is such a tremendous force for change for HIV but also to demonstrate what is possible for Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.Since 2018, Việt Nam has worked restlessly to promote the Undetectable=Untransmittable or U=U (K=K in Vietnamese) – a campaign which encourages people living with HIV to have continual ARV treatment to have their viral load suppressed and stop the virus from being passed on.“U=U is a spiritual message of hope which tells HIV-infected people they can have a normal family and normal lifespan because of advances and if you stay adherent to the treatment,” Murphy added.Meanwhile, the gap in access among regions, existing social stigma, new types of drugs putting people at multiple risks of HIV as well as the rise of new infections among vulnerable groups including men having sex with men (MSM) are still setting barriers, hindering Việt Nam from realising the goal of putting an end to AIDS by 2030.“HIV/AIDS has dropped out of the headlines thanks to significant improvements in disease prevention and control,” said Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control under the Ministry of Health.“On the other hand, the less attention is dangerous because if we do not pay enough care, the epidemic may rise again.”According to Long, about 40 per cent of people living with HIV in Viet Nam do not benefit from ARV. To accomplish the ambitious goal by 2030, the number of annual new infections in Việt Nam has to not surpass 1,000. However, at present, each year, 10,000 new cases are reported.“There is a huge gap which needs the collaboration of the whole society to close,” he added. —\xa0VNSDoctor Lê Thanh Lâm (middle) takes care of a patient with HIV at HCM City-based Nhân Ái Hospital. — VNA/VNS Photo Xuân Khu'",1

During the period, Moody’s will assess the practices and systems the Government has or is instituting, to ensure reliable, timely, and smooth payments.\nMoody's would maintain and confirm Việt Nam's Ba3 rating if the rating review were to conclude there is evidence of clear and effective steps being taken that offer very high confidence all debt obligations will be honoured in a smooth and timely manner.\nIn the latest rating on Việt Nam, Fitch said the country's economic expansion had been driven by strong foreign investment and steady export growth.\nExports as a share of Vietnamese GDP rose from 2011-18. Việt Nam's current account surpluses helped build external buffers and its external liquidity ratio was well above the 'BB' category median, although funding costs would rise over time as Việt Nam moves from concessional to market funding.GDP growth remained strong in the first nine months of 2019 at 7 per cent year-on-year and a similar annual growth rate in the last quarter would keep Việt Nam as one of the fastest-growing economies in APAC and in the 'BB' rating category globally.\nViệt Nam appears to be benefitting from production shifts resulting from US-China trade tensions, although large-scale relocation of manufacturing to Việt Nam will take time, and the country's high degree of trade openness means it may feel effects from the trade war, according to Fitch.\nThe revision of Fitch’s outlook on Việt Nam to 'Positive' in May reflected improving economic management, current account surpluses, falling government debt, high growth and stable inflation.

This means we must be more cautious in organising the stock market,” Ngân said.""Therefore, I propose that the Việt Nam Stock Exchange operate under the model of a one-member limited liability company whose 100 per cent of capital is owned by the State,” he said.Ngân’s idea builds on the regulations about the post-merger exchange currently stated in the revised draft Law on Securities, which says that the State holding in the combined exchange will be over 50 per cent.Under the draft law, the two national stock exchanges will be merged into one single stock exchange, headquartered in the capital.But Ngân is opposed to the plan and said this model would constrain the development of the stock market.The post-merger exchange should operate as a parent company and the two bourses in HCM City and Hà Nội still continue to operate independently, Ngân said.Under the draft law, the post-merger stock exchange will be managed by the Ministry of Finance, acting as a focal point for issuing regulations on stock listings and trading, monitoring the stock market, managing risk and directly organising securities transactions.Minister of Finance Minister Đinh Tiến Dũng said that the Ministry of Finance’s Drafting Board will receive and carefully research Ngân’s ideas.Dũng said the stock exchange combination plan will be executed from now till 2023.The combined exchange will be equitised, but not in the next five years. — VNS'",2

Apart from Hà Nội, the seven other creative cities of design are Asahikawa (Japan), Baku (Azerbaijan), Bangkok (Thailand), Cebu City (the Philippines), Muharraq (Bahrain), Querétaro (Mexico), and San José (Costa Rica).The UNESCO Creative Cities Network, founded in 2004, aims to enhance co-operation among the recognised cities with creativity considered a strategic factor of sustainable development. Its membership has reached 246 at present.The network brings together cities that base their development on creativity, whether in music, arts and folk crafts, design, cinema, literature, digital arts or gastronomy.UNESCO creative cities commit to placing culture at the centre of their development strategies and to share their best practices.“All over the world, these cities, each in its own way, make culture the pillar, not an accessory, of their strategy,” says UNESCO director-general Audrey Azoulay. “This favours political and social innovation and is particularly important for the young generations.” — VNS'",1
137,'Environmental violations and property scams focus of NA discussion',"'HÀ NỘI — Environment violations, property scams and judicial sector’s workforce were the hot topic during Tuesday discussions of reports on legal violations and prevention of crime in the ongoing sitting of the National Assembly.Trần Thị Quốc Khánh, a legislator from Hà Nội, said ""pollution is currently one of the public main concerns"" despite efforts from Government.Violations were discovered but not handled strictly enough and did not serve to deter similar acts, she said.“The Government said in its report that the crimes regarding environment violations are ‘hard to define,’ which I find not persuasive. Have the relevant agencies failed to fully carry out their duties and only handled the violations with administrative fines, while forgoing possible criminal liability,” Khánh said, asking the Government to clarify further on this issue.Ngô Sách Thực, from Bắc Giang, said emissions beyond allowed limit in industrial zones, improper treatment of toxic waste or importing of outdated machines or scraps, and water pollution as a result of livestock farming are still commonplace, resulting in health hazards to the public.“Only 1.58 per cent of the environmental violations are treated as criminal cases, which is only a minuscule ratio in the 22,535 cases discovered this year alone,” he said.He added that despite potential widespread impacts, in the current Penal Code, there is no environmental crime considered to be “particularly serious,” given that environmental offenders won’t be given serious prison sentences.He called for all administrative fines against environmental offences to be reviewed and adjusted if needed, especially against repeat offenders.During the discussions, NA deputies also asked for tougher actions against real estate scammers.Gia Lai Province’s deputy Đinh Duy Vượt said real estate is currently a hotbed, rife with scammers – and in many cases – organised gangs are using sophisticated methods to cheat customers.Many unscrupulous real estate agents create imagined property projects, organised huge PR campaigns to attract buyers and ask them to pay up some money as “investors” of the project.The buyers only realised they have been cheated and the projects were either not approved by authorities or did not go through proper legal procedures when it was too late, ruining many lives of innocent investors, Vượt said,He asked police and the courts to investigate whether there is “support” from corrupt officials within Government’s agencies and local authorities.Staff slashRegarding concerns over staffing issues, Chief Justice of the Supreme People’s Court Nguyễn Hoà Bình said cases kept rising at a rate of 10 per cent annually.In 2019, the number of cases increased by 12 per cent or 70,000 compared to last year.Bình said as the scope of the economy and the population rise, it’s expected workload and pressure placed on judges and the court in general will be heavier, leading to many resigning.Facing this situation, the chief justice asked the judicial sector not to streamline the public workforce.""Issues such as housing, transport, hospital, education as well as utilities like electricity or water can all make use of privatisation or public-private partnerships, but the judicial activities can only be the realm of the State,"" Bình said.Deputy Judge of HCM City People’s Court Trịnh Ngọc Thuý said the salary for judges and court workers is not at a “liveable” level while the workload is mounting.“We could only let the judges resign if they are truly ill. In other cases, we encouraged them to stay on and quit at a different time, because we honestly don’t have enough money to cover the job-loss allowances,” Thuý said, adding that these people would no longer work conscientiously during the “wait,” subsequently affecting the morale and performance of the courts. — VNS'",0

5144,'Battle over Marvel comic gay kiss is defused by Brazil court',"'RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil\'s Supreme Court on Sunday made it illegal to ban any LGBT publication, after a lower court allowed conservative mayor to confiscate comic books at the Rio Book Fair containing content he considered ""inappropriate"" for minors.Mayor Marcelo Crivella, an Evangelical Protestant, ordered the comic book removed from sale because of its ""sexual content for minors"" on Saturday.Crivella – a former bishop in the giant Universal Church of the Kingdom of God – was elected Rio\'s mayor in 2016, promising to bring law and order to a city beset by crime.The comic that sparked the mayor\'s ire showed the Marvel superhero characters Wiccan and Hulkling exchanging a kiss, fully dressed.But the federal top court agreed with prosecutor Dias Toffoli and ruled that Crivella\'s actions were illegal because they targeted only LGBT content, violating the constitutional guarantee of equality for all.And Crivella\'s move backfired as copies of Young Avengers: the Children\'s Crusade quickly sold out after he demanded it be withdrawn from the book fair, organisers said.Popular Brazilian YouTuber Felipe Neto, who has more than 34 million subscribers to his channel, also bought 14,000 books on LGBT themes and distributed them free at the fair in protest.The image of the Marvel comic kiss was also on display Saturday at news kiosks across the country, printed on the cover of the Folha de S. Paulo, Brazil\'s largest national newspaper.Publishers and writers accuse the mayor of wanting to censor content.Constitutional law specialist Michael Mohallem, of the Getulio Vargas Foundation, had previously said that the mayor\'s actions, and the court decision permitting them, would violate free speech and discriminate based on sexual orientation.""Since the decision seems to be specifically aimed at prohibiting the circulation of magazines that show gay kisses (rather than any other), my interpretation is that it is motivated by discrimination, both by the mayor and the judge,"" Mohallem said.Brazil\'s Supreme Court in June voted to criminalise homophobia, classifying it as a crime similar to racism.Brazil had already legalised same-sex marriage. — AFP'",5

2942,'Sadio really is the main Man-e',"'There was a quote I read online not that long ago that went something like this:“Don’t believe everything you read on the internet just because there is a picture with a quote next to it.” – Abraham Lincoln.Now, I’m in no position to doubt the validity of these wise words from the 16th President of the United States, but there is something a little fishy about whether Abe did actually say it. I’m guessing probably not.So, bearing all that in mind, it is with a little trepidation that I’d like to repeat something I read this week online, that yes, was a quote, and yes, came with a picture next to it.In this instance, the quote was attributed to Liverpool FC’s Senegalese striker, Sadio Mane.Ghanaian news outlet\xa0NsemWoha.com\xa0claim he said the following: “Why would I want 10 Ferraris, 20 diamond watches\xa0or two planes? What will these objects do for me and for the world?“I was hungry, and I had to work in the field; I survived hard times, played football barefooted, I did not have an education and many other things, but today with what I win thanks to football, I can help my people.”Maybe he did say it, maybe he didn’t. But if you delve a little into the private life of the in-form striker, you will see how much of a down-to-earth, humble person he is.In the past, he has donated old Liverpool shirts for children to wear in places like Malawi and has funded several projects including schools and houses in the village he used to live in as a child.There have also been stories about him helping to clean the toilet at his local Mosque in Liverpool and those who have met him say he is quiet, polite and respectful – most of the good work he does takes place without being recognised or publicised.After the Africa Cup of Nations he wasn’t photographed relaxing on board a luxury yacht surrounded by a bevy of beauties and Hollywood A-listers, nor was he snapped at after-show rap parties in Miami, but instead spotted touring schools in Africa he had supported financially.I’d also like to talk a little about Mane’s WAG – that means wife and girlfriend for those of you who have been living in a cave for the past 10 years.(tumble weed rolls past)He may be married, I don’t know. He may have a girlfriend but again, that’s news to me. One thing is for sure, he is not married to someone like Colleen Rooney (wife of Wayne) or Rebekah Vardy (wife of Jamie).For the past week these two have been involved in a very undignified and very public spat over allegations Colleen made claiming Rebekah had sold private stories Colleen posted on her private\xa0Instagram account to newspapers in the UK.Two things immediately sprung to mind after I read about their catfight. First, why would Rebekah need to sell stories to newspapers? Surely being married to a professional Premier League footballer means she is not short of a bob or two.And secondly, how can these so-called stories Colleen was sharing on social media be private? As she was, er, sharing them on social media?Whatever the truth of this WAG-atha Christie-esque suspense thriller, and whether or not the ‘whodunit’ finger does point in the direction of Mrs Vardy, one thing is for sure:I DON’T CARE.Sorry Colleen, sorry Rebekah, but instead of getting your knickers in a twist over things the general public are not in the slightest bit bothered about, use your fame and privileged position that you are fortunate to have found yourselves in\xa0to do something good.And if you are stuck for ideas, ask your respective husbands to give Sadio a call.

It’s not only a tendency in human resource management. It helps build an open working space where people feel free to create, share their ideas and solve problems in working,” said Davidson.Nguyễn Thanh Sơn, founder of Media Ventures Vietnam (MVV) Academy, said entrepreneurs should be aware of building a learning culture where people are willing to study positively.“Training for the staff will be effective if they love to learn, they acknowledge that studying is necessary to upgrade their skills and update new technology, they learn for themselves, not for their boss,” said Sơn.Sơn introduced online studying programmes which focus on learning experience management. This model doesn’t just provide knowledge, it creates a bank of knowledge and experiences where learners can consult and share the knowledge. It helps eliminate the distance between teachers and learners and save time in studying.“Industry 4.0 has changed the way people learn and train, driving learning culture forward effectively and actively,” said Sơn.“We are heading to a learning organisation where people exploit and share knowledge in a lean and agile way which attaches special importance to practice,” he said.“For example, in coaching sellers, we encourage students to use voice recording applications on smartphones to record all conversations with the customers they approach.

2247,"'VN exporters need to use both online, offline platforms to go global: experts'","'Bồ Xuân HiệpHONG KONG — Vietnamese manufacturers need “integrated marketing solutions” comprising both online and offline platforms to gain access to buyers in both traditional and emerging markets, experts have said.Speaking on the sidelines of the Global Sources Lifestyle and Fashion show last week in Hong Kong, Ronald Ng, general manager of Global Sources Lifestyle Group, said Việt Nam had become a manufacturing hub in the Southeast Asian region.Vietnamese exporters, mostly SMEs, who benefit from operating in one of the world’s fastest growing economies with stable governance and ease of doing business, are very likely to succeed in joining global trade.To build their corporate image, generate sales leads and win orders from global buyers, Vietnamese suppliers should engage in more trade promotion platforms to strengthen linkages with global buyers.“In addition to trade shows, online platforms are considered one of the most effective [ways] for them to boost exports to global markets,” he said.Since China has moved up the manufacturing value chain, a significant number of international buyers now consider Việt Nam an alternative supply market.The number of orders shifting from China to Việt Nam has increased remarkably.“The price advantage is becoming less obvious while the gap in export communication between global buyers and suppliers is growing.”Online platforms are the most convenient channel, providing year-round exposure for buyers to check and learn about suppliers’ capability and then submit online inquiries.Meanwhile, offline platforms enable suppliers and buyers to meet face-to-face and gain credibility.“Combined, online-to-offline (O2O) is the most comprehensive marketing mix for Vietnamese suppliers to win more business.”A recent survey by Global Sources, the event organiser, found that 80 per cent of global buyers preview product and supplier information online before they decide to go to the show\xa0to meet with targeted suppliers.Swandi Wikassa, a buyer from Indonesia, said: “Before coming to the show for sourcing, we spent a great deal of time learning about the product and supplier online.”According to Phạm Thị Hương, former managing director of Việt Nam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex), many Vietnamese products have\xa0good quality and\xa0competitive prices, but global buyers are not even aware of them since they are not available online.“Participation in exhibitions helps Vietnamese suppliers promote their products, but it is not enough. They should also look to promote their products via online platforms to reach more global buyers.”Manufacturers should also study prices, consumer tastes and trends in potential markets, and have labels and packaging in English and the local language, she said.To meet the requirements of global buyers, Vietnamese manufactures should also focus on building brands, using technology in production and improving designs, she added.Experts said in choosy markets like the US, the EU, Japan, and South Korea, exporters should be prepared to face technical barriers that could change unexpectedly.A number of Vietnamese SMEs have little experience in digital or online marketing and lack\xa0information about the\xa0field and quality human resources, according to the experts.More than 35 leading Vietnamese manufacturers of garments, textiles and fashion accessories and garment-related industries, many members of\xa0the Việt Nam Textile and Apparel Association and Vinatex, participated in the show.Last year Việt Nam’s textile and apparel exports were worth US$36 billion, up 16 per cent year-on-year, making the country one of the world’s three largest exporters.The sector has set itself a target of $40 billion for this year and more than $60 billion by 2025.The country’s economic growth is forecast to be 7.05 per cent for this year on the back of robust FDI and manufacturing exports, according to the Việt Nam Institute for\xa0Economic\xa0and Policy Research.The Hong Kong expo was organised by Global Sources, a B2B platform that connects buyers and suppliers online and offline.The platform includes more than 1.5 million global buyers, including 94 of the world’s top 100 retailers, in\xa0more than\xa0190 countries. — VNS'",2

1270,"'Unemployment, inequality plague ethnic minorities'","HÀ NỘI — A lack of job opportunities, limited healthcare services and gender inequality are among the factors holding back the development of ethnic minorities and mountainous areas.National Assembly (NA) deputies on Friday agreed that it was necessary to mobilise resources to fully tap the potential and advantages of these areas to reduce poverty and narrow the development gap with other regions.This is also the main target of a national project on socio-economic development for ethnic minorities and mountainous areas from 2021-30.NA deputy Hoàng Thị Thu Trang from Nghệ An Province said to achieve the project's goals, the State needed to invest in basic infrastructure, especially transport and communications facilities, develop human resources and ensure stable incomes for those living in disadvantaged areas.One of the policies proposed to boost economic development was to attract businesses and factories to the region to take advantage of local labourers and assist locals with start-ups, she said.Deputy Lê Quân from Hà Nội said ethnic minority labourers faced inequality in accessing job opportunities. Việt Nam was lacking a manual labour force, and a lot of companies were struggling to recruit labourers and were tuning to ethnic minority groups and mountainous areas. This had led to migration from mountainous areas to urban areas.“If labour migration is not controlled, we will be unable to ensure labourers’ rights,” he said.Quân said he was concerned about the low level of skilful ethnic labourers. Among the 8 million ethnic labourers nationwide, only 6 per cent had been trained. Short-term training and risk-prone jobs left them with unstable careers.Labour migration leads to unequal distribution. Some areas are lacking workers while others have a surplus.“To reduce poverty, we must create jobs in these localities and move people out of poor areas so that young people can find jobs and earn incomes. When one person in a family has a good income, the family can escape poverty,” Quân said.He proposed apprenticeships for young ethnic minority people should be an important part of the project.NA deputies agreed that developing the socio-economy of ethnic minorities and mountainous areas should not only ensure stable livelihoods and land but also focus on improving human resource quality.Deputy Nguyễn Thị Mai Hoa from Đồng Tháp Province said the project’s target of increasing the number of skilled labourers to 50 per cent in ethnic minority and mountainous areas would be difficult to achieve and needed adjusting because the current percentage was only 6.2 per cent. In some ethnic groups that figure is even 0 per cent.Đỗ Văn Chiến, Minister, Chairman of Ethnic Minority Affairs, argued that only 10 to 15 per cent of labourers were required to have certificates of qualification, according to the project’s target. Others would be instructed on the job and would receive no formal qualification, so the target of 50 per cent was feasible.“This is a new approach to introduce apprentice training for ethnic minority people,” he said.According to Thảo from Nghệ An Province, women from ethnic minority groups lacked access to healthcare services, especially reproductive healthcare.Despite 81 per cent of ethnic minority people owning health insurance cards, only 50 per cent used them, she said. Limited quality of healthcare services, and a shortage of medical workers and infrastructure were the main problems, she added.The project sets the target of 95 per cent of ethnic people having health insurance cards. Thảo proposed focusing the target on the percentage of health insurance users rather than the number of card holders.“The policy should prioritise recruiting doctors and nurses, especially attracting doctors from ethnic minority groups who know dialects to work in mountainous areas,” she said.Constituents’ feedbackThe NA project has drawn attention from constituents in ethnic minority groups and mountainous areas.Lò Văn Khúi from Thanh Xương Commune in the northern mountainous province of Điện Biên said a lot of ethnic minorities and mountainous areas in Điện Biên Province lacked access to electricity, clean water and land for production. The unemployment rate and number of poor households remained high.He said he hoped the NA would approve the project and focus investment on infrastructure and employment.Điểu Mưu, deputy head of the Department of Locality II, Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs, said the project should prioritise its budget in the most disadvantaged provinces first and then other areas to avoid lax disbursement.Along with socio-economic targets, the project should focus on preserving the cultural identities of ethnic minority groups, he said, proposing the allocation of funding to revive traditional products, create jobs for the local community and develop the economy.Constituent Vũ Minh Công, chief of staff in Nậm Pồ District, Điện Biên Province, said a lot of unemployed people had left the province over the past few years to work illegally abroad. If authorities offered jobs or vocational training, the number of cases would fall.He proposed offering preferential conditions to attract investment from enterprises in the sectors where poor provinces held advantages like agriculture and forestries in order to create more jobs for local labourers.According to a Government report, Việt Nam has more than 14 million people from 53 ethnic minority groups living in 51 cities and provinces nationwide, mostly in the northwest, Central Highlands, southwest and central coastal areas.Despite having favourable natural conditions and rich mineral resources, as well as holding an important location to protecting the nation’s defence and security, these areas were still the most disadvantaged.They have the lowest quality human resources and worst access to basic social services in the country, hence they have the slowest socio-economic growth and highest percentage of poor households.The project sets a target of doubling local people’s incomes in 2025 compared to 2020 and decreasing the percentage of poor households by 3-5 per cent every year.The NA will vote on the project’s resolution on November 18. — VNS",1

These factors led to a sharp drop in after-tax profit.The Southern Fertiliser JSC (SFG) reported a loss of VNĐ8.9 billion in nine months. In the third quarter, the company suffered a loss of VNĐ4.3 billion.SFG said its third-quarter consumption volume was much lower than the same period last year, leading to a 19 per cent decrease in sales of goods and services, a 45 per cent drop in gross profit, which reached VNĐ18.1 billion.SFG’s financial revenue fell 86 per cent compared to the same period last year, mainly due to a decrease in deposit interest.Rising input costsPetroVietnam Cà Mau Fertiliser JSC (DCM) saw a rise in revenue but a drop in profit. Its nine-month net revenue reached VNĐ4.95 trillion, up 6 per cent year-on-year and post-tax profit touched VNĐ308 billion, down 45 per cent year-on-year.According to DCM, in addition to a slowing fertiliser consumption market, the company faced the problems of rising raw material prices, which made gross profit margin decline sharply.Since the beginning of this year, the costs of raw materials increased by 71 per cent to VNĐ2.4 trillion. Gross profit margin dropped sharply, from 26 per cent in the third quarter of last year to 8 per cent this year.DCM is working to find new markets and has exported 75,000 tonnes of fertiliser to countries in South Asia. — VNS",2
661,'Women find numbers rising in politics but not status',"'HÀ NỘI – Although the number of women in politics continues to rise, the ratio of women in high positions remains low.These were among the main conclusions of a study of the implementation of the Law on Gender Equality in the last 10 years by the Centre for Education Promotion and Empowerment of Women (CEPEW), which was released by Ngô Thị Thu Hà, its deputy director, on Thursday.The centre polled\xa0more than 900 people in the four provinces of Hà Giang, Hà Nam, Bình Thuận, and Trà Vinh to evaluate the impact of the law, which took effect in 2007, on the country’s political landscape.Over three terms, from 2005-10 to 2015-20, the percentage of women members of the National Assembly rose slightly from 25.8 to 26.5 per cent.The NA also has its first chairwoman now.The 2015 Law on Election of Deputies to National Assembly and Deputies to People’s Councils stipulates a minimum of 35 per cent women candidates to be nominated for NA elections.It has ushered in greater gender equality in politics, especially at the\xa0provincial level, though few\xa0women have achieved high positions.A commune-level woman leader of the Việt Nam Fatherland Front in Trà Vinh Province, who asked not to be named, said: “People’s awareness of gender equality has changed. Women are not restricted from taking part in political activities, they are even encouraged to join capacity building courses.”The study found that more than 79 per cent of male voters and 69 per cent of female voters said they supported women candidates.But gender prejudices and the difference in retirement ages for men and women still pose challenges to women in politics.“Therefore, it is essential to increase the rate of women nominated as NA candidates to higher than 35 per cent, make the retirement age common for both men and women and promote the role of social organisations in accelerating gender equality,” Hà said.Hoàng Thị Kim Quế, a former head of the law faculty at the Việt Nam National University – Hà Nội, said the study only touched upon the number of women in politics.“This makes it impossible to assess how women benefit from such changes. In future studies I hope we will be able to study how women take part in the policy-making process and how it impacts the community.” – VNS'",0

Its numbers again bested breakout pop star Billie Eilish, whose song ""bad guy"" has held the number two spot for seven total weeks.After first grabbing attention on the video-sharing app TikTok, Lil Nas X, 20, soared into the public consciousness after his genre-bending hit booted Ariana Grande from the Billboard chart\'s overall spot in April, also fending off advances from pop royalty including Bieber and Taylor Swift.Since then he has shrewdly goosed his numbers by releasing remix after remix of the snappy track, most notably with country star Billy Rae Cyrus, which is the one listed on the Billboard chart.As long as remixes are in line with the original sound of a song, the streams, downloads and sales are included in one composite number.Just last week Lil Nas X released yet another new version featuring a member of BTS, the wildly popular South Korean group.Controversy stoked his rise to fame after Billboard removed the fusion novelty song from the country charts but left it on the rap list, triggering accusations that the Atlanta musician\'s work was pigeonholed purely because he is black. — AFP'",5

It created good conditions for sending and receiving e-documents to all ministries, sectors as well as administrative agencies in 62 cities and provinces nationwide.According to the People’s Committee of Trực Tuấn Commune, in the past, it took up to two days to send documents via postal service from the commune-level administrative agency to the district-level administration agency before.Additionally, officials of the commune often had to travel dozens of kilometres to attend a meeting. It took a lot of time, the committee said.Now, the situation had changed because the online public service and digital signatures had been operated following the decision No 28/2018/QĐ-Ttg, issued in July 2018 by the Government, the committee said.Trần Văn Cương, chairman of the committee said now the e-documents were sent to the online public service system, it was dispatched to the chairman and vice chairman. After they viewed the documents, they would classify and send to the civil servants.Lưu Văn Dương, chairman of Trực Ninh District, said applying digital signatures helped sending e-documents to direct units and agencies quicker than before.Documents could immediately reach to the person in charge without being lost, he said.Chairman or vice chairman could also handle the documents anytime by using their smart phones, he said.Phạm Thị Oanh, vice chairwoman of the People’s Committee of Nam Định City said the city was ranked first in applying the model in the province.The city had planned to receive and handle e-documents in every administrative agency at all levels since 2017, she said.Data of the province showed that the provincial online public service portal https://dichvucong.namdinh.gov.vn/portaldvc/KenhTin/dich-vu-cong-truc-tuyen.aspx has handled nearly 60,000 e-documents from local residents and businesses so far.— VNS'",1

3054,'We fight for everything': Klopp salutes Liverpool's perfect start,"'LONDON — Jurgen Klopp believes Liverpool\'s unquenchable appetite for success was the driving force behind the 2-1 win at Chelsea that extended their perfect start to the Premier League title race on Sunday.Klopp\'s side made it six successive league wins to open the season as they survived a second-half Chelsea barrage to move five points clear of Manchester City.Trent Alexander-Arnold\'s blistering free-kick and a Roberto Firmino header put Liverpool in control before N\'Golo Kante\'s superb second-half strike set up a tense finish.Liverpool managed the pressure-packed situation with the kind of mature, well-drilled display that is the hallmark of champions.And Reds boss Klopp insisted he never doubted his players would thrive under the cosh because they are such a committed group.""I shouldn\'t be surprised anymore by the character of our team. We expect it from us that we fight for everything,"" he said.""The boys did really well, they fought really hard. It is completely normal that you come under pressure but we defended well.""That is how it is in the top six and in the Premier League. You will never win at Chelsea without putting a proper shift in and we did that today.""After City\'s astonishing 8-0 demolition of Watford on Saturday, this was the perfect response from Liverpool as they try to dethrone Pep Guardiola\'s champions.Chasing a first English title since 1990, Liverpool are on a club-record run of 15 successive league wins and have lost just once in 45 top-flight matches, going unbeaten in the last 23.""It is exceptional. What can I say? We have to keep on going. It is never looks as easy as it did for City yesterday but we have not had these games yet.We have to work for it,"" Klopp said.""We knew how good City were before the game yesterday. I really believe they are the best team in the world.""They are brilliant. We are not bad as well. We have to be ready for each opponent. They are want to give us a knock, rightly so.""\'Character and spirit\'The only worry for Klopp was an injury to Senegal winger Sadio Mane that forced him off in the second half.""It is a knock on the bone around the knee and a dead leg,"" Klopp said.""He\'s OK, but we took him off, he wasn\'t limping but I didn\'t like how he was running.""Chelsea had a greater share of possession, managed 13 shots to Liverpool\'s six and won six corners to their opponents\' four.But those encouraging signs were undermined by poor defending and a lack of cutting edge, leaving Lampard as the first Chelsea manager to remain winless in his first four home matches since Bobby Campbell in 1988.Lampard claimed Chelsea deserved more from their spirited effort, but he \xa0conceded his young side aren\'t mature enough yet.""No home wins, we want to change that and I believe we will if we play like that,"" he said.""Performance wise we were the better team. We had more energy in our game, character and spirit. That\'s why the crowd applauded at the end.""The difference between us and Liverpool is we aren\'t consistent enough. To work towards those levels is hard. It is a daily thing.""That is what we have to aspire to. The reality is younger players have come into the team.""Chelsea were denied a first-half equaliser when Cesar Azpilicueta\'s effort was ruled out for offside against Mason Mount and Lampard admitted it was a momentum changer as Firmino bagged the second goal moments later.""I like to think we might get a couple in our favour. But you can see Mason is a tiny bit offside,"" he said.""It changes the atmosphere in the crowd, on the pitch. We are slightly deflated and they get a boost."" — AFP'",3

He targeted public land in the coastal city and managed to acquire 21 State-owned buildings and seven land projects not via public bidding as required by the law.Vũ was able to buy those buildings and land lots at a much lower price than those regulated by the Đà Nẵng People’s Committee with the help of two top city officials.Minh and Chiến were the tasked with managing State’s assets and public land in the city during their time in office between 2006 and 2014.According to the police, the two repeatedly signed orders to illegally transfer land use rights over to Vũ.Their actions, along with those of 18 others, caused an estimated loss of nearly VNĐ20 trillion ($860 million) to the State.Vũ was already serving his sentence of nine years behind bars after a Hà Nội court found him guilty of deliberately disclosing state secrets last year. — VNS'",0

2033,'Digital farming holds key to solving agriculture paradox',"'Thu NgânHCM CITY — Digitisation of farming is inevitable and Việt Nam should embrace it to resolve the agricultural paradox of producing more while preserving natural resources and to grab the opportunities brought by free trade agreements, experts have said.Reports from research organisations said the world population would increase by 2.2 billion by 2050 and demand for food would increase by 50 per cent.During this period climate change is expected to reduce harvests by 17 per cent while arable land will shrink by 20 per cent.The agricultural sector globally and in Việt Nam is therefore set to face big challenges.A more resilient food future will rely on sharp increases in agricultural research and development; better alignment of government finance and incentives for farmers with long-term, sustainable and climate-smart production; and a steep change in access to information, innovative technologies, and finance to enhance the resilience of millions of small-scale farming households whose livelihoods are most critically impacted by climate change.How to increase productivity and secure a sufficient supply of quality food while protecting resources is a big question which has been asked for a long time.A possible solution lies in modern technologies like IoT, big data and cloud.“To enable us to feed a growing world population, it is critical for agriculture to harness technology to become more efficient, productive and sustainable, especially in light of decreasing natural resources including arable land and water,” Sam Eathington, chief science officer at The Climate Corporation of Bayer, told Việt Nam News on the sidelines of a conference on future farming.“Digital farming solutions enable farmers to make data-driven decisions in real time, and help them utilise fewer and more precise amounts of resources, including water, labour and crop protection inputs.“This helps us to grow more with fewer inputs per unit of output.”Scientists, farmers and authorities in the country have carried out a number of programmes and projects to digitise farming.The benefits brought by digitisation do not stop at solving the produce-preserve paradox, but also enable the country to expand exports to other countries at a time when it has signed several trade deals.Agriculture is one of the sectors to benefit greatly since the EU is the second largest market for Vietnamese farm exports such as coffee, cashew nuts and pepper and the two sides have a new trade deal.Not only will it boost exports and improve the sector’s competitiveness and Việt Nam’s economic integration, but also bring the opportunity to access innovation and technology.Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Lê Quốc Doanh said: “As Europe is also a high-quality market, Vietnamese agricultural products need to be more competitive to seize the opportunity.”Efforts madeThe Government is offering a number of incentives to attract investors in digital farming, conferences have been organised to seek solutions, there are tie-ups with science companies to provide tailored solutions to farmers, and training classes have been organised to help farmers know about technologies.The Việt Nam Digital Agriculture Association was launched in September to upgrade the technology infrastructure to develop digital farming, connect with and expand markets, identify tailored digital solutions for each cultivation model, attract investors, and have human training.Many prestigious companies and entrepreneurs have already joined it.Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường said that there had never been any movement in which many companies are pouring investment to green and high-tech agriculture as well as digital farming.Many large players including Vingroup, Hòa Phát Group and Thaco Group are becoming strategic investors in agricultural companies.Foreign investors and scientists are tying up with Vietnamese companies and bringing advanced know-how to develop digital farming.Bayer Vietnam, for instance, signed an exclusive agreement with Trung An to promote the use of unmanned aerial systems and provide customised plant protection services, targeting the export market.A two-year pilot project began on 200 hectares out of an 800-hectare Trung An farm in Kien Giang Province last May.Another solution from the company includes a trait and bioscience technology to make seeds tolerant to pests like fall army worms, which affect corn. The worm is now a threat, significantly reducing yields all over the world including Việt Nam.The company is also working on a project with some key stakeholders to make Vietnamese agriculture sustainable by enhancing farmers’ capabilities and applying technology in digital farming. — VNS'",2

Two days later, Hằng and Sinh spotted two Phayre's langurs which Hằng shot dead. The same day, forest rangers discovered the two dead langurs, five flintlock pistols, five knives and several traps at the poachers’ camp along with dried boar meat and a live boar.The five were prosecuted for violating regulations on the management and protection of endangered, precious and rare animals according to Article 244 of the Criminal Code 2015.Nguyễn Văn Thái, executive director of Save Vietnam’s Wildlife organisation, said this was the first criminally prosecuted case of wild animal hunting in the park since 2005.Trần Xuân Cường, head of the park, said forest rangers and forest protection groups would intensify patrols in the area, adding that the park had held 12 training classes to educate local residents about the laws on forest protection since late 2018.Phayre's langur is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conversation of Nature (IUCN). The mammal is endemic to Southeast Asia.Many Vietnamese people kill wild animals for food.

5284,Indian Ambassador recommits to stand on Việt Nam's side,"'India celebrates its 73rd Independence Day today (August 15). Ambassador of India Pranay Verma sends a message to Việt Nam News readers to celebrate this anniversary and start his term in Việt Nam.On this day in 1947, people of India had a long-cherished tryst with destiny, gaining freedom after a century of struggle against colonial rule.The year marks many anniversaries including the 150th birth anniversary of India’s Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi.\xa0 As we celebrate our independence, we remember his ideals and struggles which inspired the freedom movements not only in India but across the world, including the freedom struggle of Việt Nam led by President Hồ Chí Minh.This year is also the 90th anniversary of the visit of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore, the poet laureate and author of India’s National Anthem, to HCM City in 1929.When India’s first President Dr Rajendra Prasad visited Việt Nam in 1959, together with President Hồ, he planted at Trấn Quốc Pagoda a sapling of the Bodhi Tree under which Lord Buddha attained enlightenment in Bodhgaya. Today that sapling celebrates 60 glorious years in the heart of Hà Nội, blooming into an icon of millennia-old cultural and civilisational connection between India and Việt Nam.Over the decades, India and Việt Nam have built a truly special relationship, marked by deep mutual trust and understanding and a strong bond of friendship between their leaders and peoples.\xa0 Both have stood by each other in adversities and supported each other’s aspirations.Today, India-Việt Nam relations are characterised as a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’, showcasing the depth and breadth of their multifaceted engagement, covering trade and investment; energy; defence and security; development partnership; culture; and people-to-people exchanges. \xa0A series of mutual visits by their top leaders has been constantly adding new substance and momentum to this special partnership.Today, both India and Việt Nam are among the fastest growing economies in the world. Our bilateral trade has doubled in the last three years alone, reaching close to US$14 billion. We are well on our way to achieving the trade target set by our leaders of US$15 billion by 2020.Business and industries on both sides are excited about opportunities that our growing markets offer to each other. New partnerships are being forged in emerging sectors of industry, especially in the services sector, communication and information technology, renewable energy, scientific research, technological development and innovation.Young demographic profiles of both countries will ensure that their aspirational youths derive maximum benefits from sustained cooperation in these diverse sectors.India’s development partnership in Việt Nam over the last four and half decades has left a successful legacy of institution-building and human resource development. We are proud of the contributions made by these institutions and trained professionals in the rapid development of Việt Nam, especially in the fields of agriculture and food security, engineering and industry, and public administration.Việt Nam\xa0is pivotal to India’s Act East Policy and its Indo-Pacific vision. Việt Nam is also an invaluable link in India’s engagement with ASEAN. As Việt Nam takes over as the Chair of ASEAN and as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council next year, even greater synergy is expected in our regional and global co-operation and co-ordination.As two aspirational societies engaged in the task of national modernisation, India and Việt Nam are bound by shared dreams and values – of progressiveness, pluralism, freedom and integrity. \xa0Their common interests in ensuring peace, prosperity and stability in their shared region bind them closer together.Above all, the cultural affinity between our peoples is the bedrock of this special relationship.\xa0 On the occasion of India’s Independence Day, we recommit ourselves to building even more robust bridges of friendship and connectivity between the peoples of India and Việt Nam.

4662,'Creative city' title - a boon for Hà Nội: expert,"Hà Nội was recently named one of 66 new members of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)’s Network of Creative Cities.Nhân Dân Cuối Tuần (People's Weekend)'s reporter Luân Vũ interviews\xa0Doctor Bùi\xa0Hoài Sơn, head of the Việt Nam National Institute of Culture and Art Studies, on the recognition.Could you explain what is the creative city network?It is a great strategy of UNESCO\xa0to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations.\xa0In the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Culturally Diverse Expressions, UNESCO had\xa0an initiative to establish a network of UNESCO-recognised cities of innovation.UNESCO recognised 66 additional cities\xa0including Hà\xa0Nội on October 31, increasing the total to\xa0246 cities in the world as creativity cities.In Southeast Asia, Hà\xa0Nội\xa0was the second capital\xa0after Singapore\xa0to be recognised. It is a great honour.What does the new title\xa0mean for\xa0Hà Nội?Hà Nội\xa0celebrated\xa0the\xa020th anniversary\xa0of the capital city's recognition as a 'City\xa0for\xa0Peace' by UNESCO in July.The 'City for Peace' title\xa0has been held for 20 years.\xa0It's time for Hà\xa0Nội\xa0to have\xa0another title. At the moment, the whole world is focusing on creativity.Becoming a member of UNESCO's Creative Cities Network will help Hà Nội make strategic changes in the coming years.From now, all Hà\xa0Nội's development orientations will have to take into account creative elements on the basis of a common development philosophy.Carrying out projects on construction, city planning, agriculture\xa0development, handicrafts and art\xa0must prioritise the\xa0creative elements. That will be a condition for us to unify our resources, creating a common power to develop Hà\xa0Nội.Recent efforts of Hà Nội such as launching a smart city project and\xa0innovations in\xa0culture and art such as Hà Nội International Film Festival, International Experimental Theatre\xa0Festival, Monsoon International Music Festival, and other\xa0events\xa0will be a foundation\xa0for the development of creative\xa0activities in the future.In the nomination dossier, Hà\xa0Nội chose\xa0'design'\xa0as the main content. What do you think about this choice?There are many ways to do\xa0creative activities\xa0because Hà Nội\xa0has been powerful in cuisine, handicrafts\xa0and art.In my opinion, it is a visionary option of the Hà Nội\xa0authorities.\xa0If we had chose a particular field, it would not cover the activities of others.For example, if we chose cuisine, film and art would lose out.Is it an issue that\xa0many regional and international cities also choose 'design'?These concerns were raised in the process of the dossier preparation for the title recognition. It would have been simpler and easier if we had chose cuisine\xa0or handicrafts.However, we need greater ambition.Culture is the difference. We must be different from other countries to show the unique identity of Vietnamese culture.What is the state of creativity space and activity development in Hà Nội?The development of creative activity\xa0in Hà\xa0Nội currently faces\xa0many problems.\xa0However, from my perspective, the problems are inevitable.I think that the development process needs time to experiment and learn. Failures are lessons for us to overcome and to achieve better results.Creative hubs in Hà Nội are facing many difficulties.\xa0However, we can also be temporarily satisfied as the number of creative hubs in Hà\xa0Nội\xa0has doubled since 2014 and they have\xa0diversified in type, offering many opportunities for employment and making Hà Nội more attractive.We still have a lot of work to do\xa0to support these creative hubs and\xa0to make them become places to spread creative and\xa0good messages about life from creative people, including\xa0artists and all individuals in Hà Nội.What does Hà\xa0Nội\xa0need\xa0to do first to develop creativity?The first is to focus on raising awareness of creative space for the development of the capital.From there, we must enhance the role of creativity and\xa0integrate creativity into all development strategies with\xa0specific actions, of which the creative element must be the most important factor.Next, we need plans\xa0for the development of the capital, mobilising resources and\xa0drawing strong attention from all sectors in society.More investment is needed for creative activities and we need incentive tax policies and legal status for creative hubs or other support for creative hubs or creative ideas which can be characteristic of Hà Nội. — VNS",5

2078,'Việt Nam attracts world leading hotel management brands',"Compiled by Thiên LýJapan’s Watabe Wedding Corporate recently signed an agreement with Empire Group Việt Nam to organise wedding ceremonies for 1,000 Japanese couples in the latter’s Cocobay Complex in Đà Nẵng in the next three years, and the figure is expected to increase to 16,000 in the next 10 years.This year, Watabe has already organised 120 weddings at Empire Group’s properties.Why is one of Japan’s leading providers of marriage services tying up with Empire Group?The latter’s properties like Coco Ocean Resort with Park Regis and Leisure Inn hotels, and Coco Skyline Resort with Golden Tulip and Coco Ocean Spa Resort offer a number of advantages.The Empire Group’s properties are mostly situated between Hội An and Đà Nẵng along private and pristine beaches that also offer guests direct access to a dining and retail strip.Major tourist attractions there include the cities of Hội An and Đà\xa0Nẵng, the Marble Mountains and Bà\xa0Nà\xa0Hills.But arguably an even more important reason Empire Group has been able to attract Watabe Group is that its properties are managed by world leading hotel management groups.Empire has an agreement with Japan’s Seibu Holdings which allows its Coco Ocean Resort and three GB buildings to carry the Park Regis and Leisure Inn brands.It has got France’s hotel leading group Lourve to manage its Coco Skyline Resort under the Golden TulipBrand and two other buildings under the Campanile Brand.Louvre Hotels Group is a major player in the global hospitality industry, with a portfolio that now includes more than 1,500 hotels in 54 countries.Robert Mcintosh, executive director responsible for CBRE Hotels in Asia Pacific told Đầu tư Chứng khoán (Investment & Securities) newspaper that in recent years, Việt Nam has witnessed the expansion of many famous hotel brands like Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Wyndham Hotel Group, InterContinental Hotels Group and Accor Hotels in addition to Seibu's\xa0Staywell and Louvre.The trend is expected to continue, he said.Đà Nẵng and then Hạ Long cities are considered the most attractive destinations for foreign hotel management groups, he said.The investment potential of Việt Nam’s hospitality and tourism sector remains great, especially for investors seeking long-term growth, he said.Other analysts concurred, pointing out the country’s tourism industry has recently seen rapid growth, and the development of the hospitality sector is a concomitant.In the first nine months of this year, international visitor numbers reached nearly 13 million, a 28.2 per cent increase year-on-year, and tourism revenues were estimated at VNĐ384 billion (US$16.3 million), a 31 per cent increase.The tourism services sector has also registered strong growth.The hotel industry has seen a boom in supply since 2015, with the five-star segment achieving the highest growth as the number of rooms doubled from 24,212 to 52,213 now.The number of four-star rooms also increased sharply from 27,379 to 39,023.By June 2018, nearly 2,000 international travel agencies and over 25,600 accommodation facilities with a total of 508,000 rooms were available across the country. Three- to five-star hotels offered 101,400 rooms. Over 21,000 tour guides have been licensed, and tourism provides an income to some 2.5 million people.The rapid expansion of the high-end hotel segment but without the availability of management experience in the country means international hotel management companies are the only option, and most hotel and resort investors prefer to have leading names.Nguyễn Việt Thung, vice chairman of TMS Group, said that tie-ups with foreign hotel management brands offer a lot of benefits like prestige, global brands and management skills.Foreign hotel managers and operators are in turn partial to Việt Nam and like to work in the country because of its culture, beautiful landscapes and comfortable geographic location.But in fact, it is not easy to invite those professional hotel managers to participate in management of hotel projects.That is a good thing since, professionally, famous brands have stringent requirements of tourism properties in terms of location, construction quality, services, and legal and environmental factors, as Empire Group chairman Nguyễn Đức Thành pointed out.They fiercely protect their prestige, he said.Some analysts pointed to the fact that foreign hotel management companies often refuse to accept offers from Vietnamese hotels claiming the market is not attractive, owners are inexperienced and hotel designs are unsuitable for their brands’ requirements.Is it a good time to buy gold?On November 10, the buying and selling prices of SJC gold were VNĐ41.26 million and VNĐ41.56 million per tael of 37.5 grammes.At Doji, they were VNĐ41.35 and 41.55 million.Market observers said prices dropped by almost VNĐ600,000 on November 7 and have remained there though the fall was not as sharp as in the global market.The corresponding global fall was $60 per ounce, or 3 per cent, to $1,440, the biggest single-day drop in the last two years.The sharp decrease in prices could see individual investors buy gold in the hope to making a quick profit since prices always goes up at the end of the year.What do experts think?They attributed the price fall to positive information about the China-US trade war.On November 7, the two countries agreed to remove the additional tariffs imposed recently in phases once their leaders sign an interim deal towards ending the costly trade war.British broadsheet The Guardian said the prospect of an agreement sent stock markets soaring to all-time highs and prompted the International Monetary Fund to say a deal easing trade tensions between the US and China could persuade its officials to revise upward forecasts for global growth next year.But some experts said that it is not easy to make short-term profits on gold now because the trade war is unpredictable and would not cease immediately.Dr Phan Dũng Khánh of Bizlight Business School said gold prices would possibly fall further to $1,400 by the year end, which would push down Vietnamese prices to VNĐ39-40 million.Short-term gold traders should be cautious, he warned. — VNS",2

1852,"'VN stocks to head up in December, trade war concerns expected'","'HÀ NỘI —\xa0After having declined for four straight weeks, the Vietnamese market may rebound in December as analysts and securities companies expect that cheaper shares will attract hungry investors amid the world’s volatility.The benchmark VN-Index on the Hồ Chí Minh Stock Exchange was almost unchanged on Friday as it gained narrowly by 0.03 per cent to end last week at 963.56 points.Việt Nam’s benchmark VN-Index lost a total of 6.0 per cent in four trading weeks since touching the one-year high of nearly 1,024.91 points on November 6.Before touching that amount, the VN-Index had been boosted by confidence in the possibility of a signed US-China trade truce and strong earnings reports produced by large-cap companies.But after that, the market went into a correction phase with large-cap stocks being hit by increased selling from investors. Among the causes were concerns about the delay, or worse the cancellation, of the US-China deal.Any recovery days during this period proved to be technical only and investors were very cautious and unwilling to participate in the market trading, according to SSI Research.In November, foreign investors net-sold a total of VNĐ104 billion (US$4.6 million)\xa0worth of local shares on HoSE. That was also the fourth month of foreign net selling on the stock exchange.Net foreign selling continued in the first week of December as foreigners offloaded a net value of VNĐ529 billion on HoSE, focusing on selling shares of consumer firm Masan (MSN).But SSI Research forecast the downtrend would benefit the local market as share prices had been demoted to more attractive ranges.Trailing price-to-earnings per share (P/E) ratio of the VN-Index had fallen to 15.74 – the lowest since February 2019, SSI Research said in a note.That means local stocks are becoming cheaper and more attractive to investors as the market’s average base price has dropped.One positive signal was increased trading liquidity, which proved investors were willing to buy in stocks when the VN-Index fell sharply, thus boosting the market, SSI Research noted.According to Yuanta Việt Nam Securities Co (YSVN), the Vietnamese market’s P/E is lower than other regions such as Thailand (18.8), Indonesia (18.8) and the Philippines (16.8) while return on equity (ROE) ratio in Việt Nam is 14.75 per cent – the highest in the region.Therefore, YSVN expects foreign investment fund would see Vietnamese stocks as opportunities in the short term and foreign capital would help boost the index to 1,000 points at the end of the year.After touching the support level of 950 points, the VN-Index declined at a slower pace and is now accumulating before leaping again, Nguyễn Hồng Khanh, director of market analysis department at Vietnam International Securities Co (VIS), told tinnhanhchungkhoan.vn.Some investors may want to make go-ahead runs as they look for stocks with good quarterly and yearly earnings prospects and good preparation for next year, Khanh said.Some sectors are namely steel, real estate, construction, banking and retail, he added.But both SSI Research and YSVN warned the market would not run smoothly in December as worries about the US-China trade war remain.The global markets are still at high risk, posing negative impact on the Vietnamese market, SSI Research said.The market sentiment will be undermined by worries about the US-China trade war with the next deadline for US tariffs on Chinese imports to take place on December 15, SSI Research said.If the US government determines to realise the tariffs on schedule, it would likely escalate the tensions between the two largest economies, YSVN said. —\xa0VNS'",2

2009,'MoIT requires control on products with China’s nine-dash\xa0line',"'HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) has instructed enterprises to review contracts and legal documents to ensure imported goods do not violate Việt Nam’s sovereignty and territory with false images.The move comes after a number of enterprises imported goods which featured pictures of China’s illegal nine-dash line in the East Sea.China has established the so-called nine-dash line to claim more than 90 per cent of the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea. The line was rejected internationally because it did not conform to the prevailing international law of the sea. Việt Nam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have claims in the waters which are believed to be rich in energy resources.MoIT said the content was prohibited because they misrepresented historical facts, causing confusion about territorial sovereignty and national borders.“Businesses that broke the law have been strictly handled with,” the ministry said.The ministry also asked businesses to strictly monitor all goods before importing, ensuring they are not installed with equipment, documents or images that infringed on Việt Nam\'s border.For high-risk items such as publications, maps, globes, display devices and software-based devices, businesses have been told to ask sellers for a written commitment not to attach, install or use equipment, documents or images that violated Việt Nam’s sovereignty and territory.""Enterprises should immediately notify local customs and market watch agencies if they notice any such things,"" the ministry added.In recent months, violations included children’s toys and imported cars.One case was recently found in Hà Nội’s Hà Đông District. An inspection team discovered a toy shop selling jigsaws with China’s illegal nine-dash line in the East Sea.Another violation related to a GPS map in a luxury car spotted by Việt Nam Customs early this month.The five-seater Volkswagen Touareg was imported by the Auto World JSC. Volkswagen Việt Nam later displayed the car at the Vietnam International Motor Show 2019 last month in HCM City.The importer would be fined while the car, which is worth more than VNĐ4 billion ($173,000), would be confiscated, said customs.On October 31, the Customs Office in Hải Phòng City’s Đình Vũ Port found seven Hanteng cars imported from China with GPS maps displaying images of China’s illegal nine-dash line. The illegal information appeared on the screen when the engines were started.In a question and answer session at the National Assembly earlier this month, Minister of Industry and Trade Trần Tuấn Anh said electronic products and software in imported cars installed with the nine-dash line was a new phenomenon.“The ministry will temporarily suspend automobile import business licences until enterprises fulfil their responsibilities,” Anh told NA delegates. — VNS'",2

It will also ensures inspection and assessment of individuals and enterprises as well as accountability of State agencies.However, Dũng expressed his concern over connections between ministries, localities and the website.He took renewals of driving licence as an example.The national public services website would have to connect with the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Health for a renewal. Data from each locality, ministry and agency would link with each other to facilitate procedures, Dũng said.“The homepage of the public service website should be friendly and the authenticity must be simple to make it convenient for people and easy to use,” Dũng said.He said Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc had assigned the Government Office, ministries and agencies to accelerate the setting up of the national public service website.The handling of administrative procedures in localities and ministries must be integrated on a national e-document exchange platform.In the future, decrees on protecting personal information, sharing, authentication and identification would be issued by the Government, he said.According to Dũng, the launch of the website was the first step in a reform process to serve people and businesses.With people and businesses the centre of these services, the Government Office would work with agencies to select and integrate essential public services into the website, he said.“This is a regular activity. The satisfaction of individuals and organisations reflects the quality of public service delivered by State agencies and organisations,” he said.It is expected that such public services as paying tax online for individuals and custom declarations will be provided by the website in December this year.Other services including the collection of transport violation fines, birth registration and granting of licences for business households will be integrated into the website in the first quarter of next year.Hà Nội, HCM City and Quảng Ninh Province have been chosen to pilot the implementation of several public services on the website.Five more public services will be integrated into the website in Hà Nội this month. They include the granting of medical and pharmaceutical practice certificates and practice certificates for practitioners for medical examination and treatment and the issuance of marital status certificates or birth registration.The connection between procedures for household business registration and tax registration will take place in HCM City in November while birth registration will be integrated in Quảng Ninh at the same time. — VNS'",0

The soybeans found\xa0in Hưng Yên pack a punch and provide the flavour for the sauce.The other\xa0ingredients are sticky rice and salt, while it is fermented in an enzyme known as koji.Sticky rice, after being soaked in\xa0water and boiled, is spread out on bamboo tray, covered with the\xa0leaves of longan or sweet potato.The boiled rice is left for three days till it turns yellow with the fungus. The leaves are then removed to let the fungus grow freely for one more day.The fungus is then collected and dried in the sun for two\xa0days.The soybeans are then\xa0baked with sand at a low temperature till they turn\xa0yellow with a\xa0sweet smell.Then they are soaked again for a week.Fungus and salt is added, and the mixture is put in ceramic containers, covered tightly and dried in the sun for between two and six months.\xa0Experienced soya sauce makers sometimes leave it\xa0for up to two years.During the drying period, makers should stir the mixture every two days, but just for a minute.Sunlight is an important factor in the\xa0process. The more sunlight it gets, the better quality the soya sauce will be.Hence, from March to August is the main season for making soya sauce.The final sauce should be a\xa0dark brown colour, with a slightly\xa0unpleasant odour but\xa0sweet taste. The sauce can last for up to three years in good conditions.Tương Bần is a\xa0delicacy found only in Bần Yên Nhân\xa0Ward in Mỹ Hào Town, Hưng Yên Province.As the fungus grows on\xa0longan leaves, the soya sauce produced here has a distinct\xa0smell and flavour\xa0found nowhere else. — VNS'",5

1837,'Better tourist experiences would lead to repeat visits: experts',"HÀ NỘI — The number of foreign visitors to Việt Nam has been growing at a two-digit rate, but the return rate is low at somewhere between 10-40 per cent, experts said at the\xa0Việt Nam Travel & Tourism Summit 2019, that opened in Hà Nội on Monday.According to statistics of the Việt Nam National Administration of Tourism under the Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism, international visitors’ spending in the country for a nine-day tour averaged only US$1,000, partly due to a lack of diverse products and services.“In the recently released Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) 2019 released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), Việt Nam jumped four places from the latest 2017 ranking, which shows the country has improved\xa0in competitiveness,” said Deputy Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Lê Quang Tùng.However, Việt Nam still lags in the region considerably with regards to its tourist service and air transport infrastructure, weakness in environmental sustainability, the lack of product and location diversification, transport and services infrastructure and low-skilled labour force.“Promotion activities have not showed actual effectiveness due to limited resources, loose operation mechanisms, a lack of overseas tourism promotion offices, the yet-operational tourism support fund and the overloaded airport infrastructure, which is unable to keep up with the growth of the number of tourists,” Tùng said.Việt Nam’s visa regime, which has been liberalised in recent years, still lags compared to\xa0more open visa policies of key regional competitors, such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, he said.The forum was a national-scale event aiming to offer initiatives and solutions to overcome the\xa0limitations of Việt Nam’s tourism sector, he said.During the summit, four symposiums took place to discuss bottlenecks in Việt Nam’s tourism.Revitalising national tourism promotion to inspire more foreigners to visit Việt Nam was the theme of the first symposium, during which participants contributed their ideas to improve the nation’s tourism messages and the operation of tourism offices abroad.\n\nOne of the proposals at the symposium was the early launch of a tourism development support fund, while other discussions\xa0dealt with how to address problems such as overcharging tourists, food safety and safety for visitors.\n\nAnother symposium looked at how to improve tourists’ experience in preparing and planning Việt Nam visits, considering the fact many visitors face difficulties in using Vietnamese online tourism services, such as real products not matching advertisements and a lack of direct consultancy.\n\nMeanwhile, increasing tourism products, improving infrastructure, ensuring a safe environment, enhancing human resource quality and applying information technology were key issues discussed at the third symposium titled 'Improving tourists’ destination experience in Việt Nam'.\n\nDeputy Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Lê Quang Tùng addresses\xa0the Việt Nam Travel & Tourism Summit 2019 opened in Hà Nội on December 9.\xa0The forum was a national-scale event aiming to offer initiatives and solutions to overcome shortcomings and limitations of the Việt Nam’s tourism sector, contributing to improving its capacity and competitiveness.

Now, with the appearance of the internet, they have many more choices in their travel plans and journeys,” Kiên said.Kiên suggested tourism enterprises start collecting information on customer data and use the information to provide\xa0services, helping enhance experiences for visitors.The Government also needed to support firms to form a common database to promote Việt Nam's tourism on digital channels.\n\nThe Việt Nam Travel & Tourism Summit 2019 was held by the government’s Advisory Council for Administrative Procedure Reform, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the Việt Nam Tourism Advisory Board (TAB), the Việt Nam Tourism Association and VnExpress online newspaper. — VNS",2

1419,'Việt Nam needs to pay more attention to Whitmore’s disease',"HÀ NỘI Whitmore, or melioidosis, is an infectious disease that has gone largely ignored in Việt Nam.Little research has been conducted on the disease, despite the fact it is relatively common in agricultural countries\xa0like Việt Nam because it's caused by bacteria found in soil.Speaking at the 9th global scientific conference on Whitmore’s disease held on Wednesday, Trịnh Thành Trung, director of the Hà Nội-based Vietnam National University’s Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology, said Việt Nam used to be a hotspot for\xa0the disease during the French Resistance War and the American War.The first case of Whitmore’s disease was diagnosed\xa0in HCM City in 1925. After\xa0national liberation, a few more\xa0cases were discovered\xa0in Hà Nội and HCM City, but then the outbreak died down.The disease has been neglected since then. In local hospitals, doctors have\xa0little knowledge about the disease and don't know how to test for it, leading to\xa0misdiagnoses.As a result, the re-occurance of Whitmore’s disease has led to speculation of what it actually is,\xa0causing public anxiety.Trung said Whitmore, or melioidosis, was a dangerous acute infectious disease caused by a bacteria\xa0called Burkholderia pseudomallei. The bacteria lives\xa0in contaminated soil and water and is transmitted to humans through skin contact or inhalation and consumption of particles containing the bacteria.However, there was no conclusive scientific evidence for human-to-animal or animal-to-human transmission. Thus, Whitmore infections were\xa0often sporadic and not a pandemic.Trung\xa0has worked with 26 hospitals in 17 localities to introduce testing methods.That’s why the number of diagnosed patients has reportedly increased in the past two months.In that time, at least 12 people have been\xa0hospitalised with Whitmore’s disease at Hà Nội’s Bạch Mai Hospital and the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases, and four have died.Đỗ Duy Cường, director of\xa0Bạch Mai Hospital’s Centre for Tropical Diseases, said the disease was reportedly on the rise in many countries,\xa0such as Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, India and\xa0African nations.The disease is especially dangerous for patients with high blood pressure or diabetes as the bacteria can\xa0cause septicaemia or organ failure.International experts said about 50 per cent of infected cases suffered immunodeficiency diseases and about 30 per cent of deaths\xa0were related to septic shock.That's why it was so important to identify the primary infection on the patient's body so it could be treated quickly and effectively.At the workshop, doctors shared different methods of\xa0testing for\xa0the disease. Currently, the test for Whitmore’s disease takes\xa05-7 days.Doctors are encouraging\xa0people, mostly farmers who have\xa0diabetes/chronic kidney or\xa0lung disease to go to a hospital equipped with microbiological laboratories if they start experiencing a high fever.The 9th global scientific conference on Whitmore’s disease was jointly organised by the Vietnam National University’s Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology and the Medical University of Graz’s Institute of Hygiene, Microbiology and Environmental Medicine in Austria.The three-day event is the largest global scientific conference on the research of Whitmore’s disease, and\xa0is held every three years. The event attracted more than 100 leading scientists from 26 countries to share the most outstanding research results about Whitmore’s disease and experiences on early diagnosis and treatment. VNS",1

The source of infection is unknown.According to Sóc Sơn District Epidemiological Centre, the same family had a seven-year-old girl die of sepsis (blood infection) and necrotising enterocolitis (a disease where tissues of the intestines start to die) in April.The hospital’s deputy director said that the girl was treated at Hà Nội’s Saint Paul Hospital. Her medical record shows no infection with\xa0Burkholderia pseudomallei,\xa0the bacterium that causes Whitmore’s disease and exists in contaminated water and soil.The family said as the five-year-old boy got a fever on October 28, he was sent to the National Hospital of Paediatrics, diagnosed with Whitmore's and died three days later.His one-year-old brother fell ill on November 11 and died on November 16. He was also found to have infected with Whitmore's.Whitmore's, or melioidosis, is a dangerous acute infectious disease.According to Trịnh Thành Trung, director of the Hà Nội-based Việt Nam National University’s Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology, direct contact with the infection through skin abrasions or inhalations of dust particles containing bacteria is the most common form of transmission.The incubation period from first exposure to the bacteria to the appearance of first symptom normally takes two to 21 days.However, once the disease activates, it progresses rapidly; an infected patient might die only 48 hours after being hospitalised.Some research shows the consumption of contaminated food can result in infection. However, there is no evidence of disease transmission among humans and from infected animals to human.High-risk people include farmers or gardeners who work directly with soil and have open wounds.In this case, it is strange that the two victims were small, especially the one-year-old boy who had just learned to walk.The hospital has received other child patients allegedly infected with the bacteria.Reports of the two deaths have spread on social networks since Monday, yet Hà Nội authorities have not issued a disease prevention warning.Nguyễn Nhật Cảm, director of Hà Nội Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said as no evidence of transmission among humans had been found and no other similar cases had been reported, the city’s health care sector was taking proper actions.“Information about the disease has been covered by the media for people to acquire detailed knowledge. Hà Nội authorities will soon have warnings,” he said.According to Cảm, Whitmore’s disease was first reported in the early 20th century.Recently, the number of infected patients hospitalised has increased. The percentage of casualties (among adult patients) reaches 40 to 50 per cent.“Whitmore’s disease can be transmitted via open wounds or through contaminated air. In the case of the two deceased children, the hospital is working with the Hà Nội Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the sources of disease, risk factors and whether they had any open wounds and how they were cared for by their parents to compose warnings for the community,” said Điển.To prevent Whitmore’s disease, he recommended people eat cooked food, carefully clean and bandage wounds and use protective equipment when working with soil or doing house cleaning.Although Whitmore's is not a common disease, it is dangerous due to the long treatment time and high fatality rate. — VNS",1
1248,"'Telemedicine helps save patients at grassroots hospitals, train doctors there'","'HCM CITY— Many hospitals in HCM City use telemedicine, which allows doctors to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients from a distance using telecommunications technologies, saving patients with grave illnesses and improving the quality of training for doctors at grassroots levels.Children’s Hospital 1 in HCM City said last week that its doctors used smartphone applications to help save a 14-year-old boy in Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province.The patient was diagnosed with dengue at Xuyên Mộc District Hospital and had life-threatening complications.He was then brought to the Bà Rịa General Hospital, where the deputy director, Phan Văn Thành, called Assoc Prof Dr Phạm Văn Quang, head of the department of intensive care and anti-poison at Children’s Hospital 1, to seek help with his treatment.Since the patient was in serious condition and could die on the way if transferred to Children’s Hospital 1, they opted to use telemedicine.Doctors at the HCM City hospital guided their Bà Rịa General Hospital counterparts in preventing shocks, ensuring breathing, dialysing, and transfusing plasma.When the boy’s health improved and stabilised, he was brought to the Children’s Hospital 1 for further treatment.During the two-hour trip from the Bà Rịa General Hospital too, the doctors continued to co-ordinate using apps to ensure the transfer went smoothly.After two and a half of months of treatment at Children’s Hospital 1, the patient recovered and his kidney functioning has improved. He is expected to be discharged within the next week.Dr Quang of the hospital said the case showed that co-operation in this manner between city-level and lower-level hospitals was proving very effective in treating patients.He called for greater use of telemedicine since the incidence of dangerous diseases was rising.For instance, there had been more cases of dengue fever this year than last year, he said.According to doctors at city-level hospitals, improper transport of patients from provincial and grassroots hospitals to their hospitals is one of causes of patients’ death.Dr Tăng Chí Thượng, deputy director of the city Department of Health, told\xa0Việt Nam News\xa0besides Children’s Hospital 1, others such as Children’s Hospital 2 and Từ Dũ Obstetrics Hospital also used software and mobile phone apps to provide counselling and help to their counterparts at lower-level hospitals.Doctors at Từ Dũ have used a software called zoom.us to train more than 37,000 doctors at hospitals around the country since 2016.Its deputy director, Nguyễn Bá Mỹ Nhi, said: “With this method, the hospital does not need to send its doctors to provincial-level hospitals to provide training, reducing costs and preventing a doctor shortage”. — VNSIn Box:\xa0Dengue fever updateHÀ NỘI — The General Department of Preventive Medicine reported that the country had more than 230,000 dengue fever cases in the first 10 months of this year, up from 125,200 in last year.The numbers in Hà Nội, the Central Highlands and southern and central regions doubled or tripled compared to the same period last year.There have been 50 deaths. — VNS'",1

It not only affects local communities but also raises concerns over food safety.For many years, steam drying kilns full of anchovies in Phú Lợi craft village in Hoàng Mai District have caused pollution, with untreated waste discharged directly into nearby Mai Giang River.“Recently, there are many more steam kilns drying anchovies, with the strong stench getting worse. Many surrounding households have to close their doors, while the Mai Giang River becomes dirty with discharged water,” Phú Lợi villager Trần Văn Hậu told Nông Thôn Ngày Nay (Countryside Today) newspaper.Another resident of Quỳnh Dị Commune Trần Thị Vân complained about the smell of fish on the side of provincial road 537B.“There are sometimes dozens of tonnes of fish piled here, attracting a lot of flies,” Vân said.Quỳnh Dị Commune authorities have repeatedly co-ordinated to examine and prompt local businesses to solve the issue but they have not complied with the environmental sanitation process.In Huỳnh Dương Village in Diễn Châu District, nearly 300 households specialise in making vermicelli noodles. They produce about 10 tonnes of vermicelli every day, creating jobs for hundreds of local workers. Every day thousands of litres of untreated wastewater is discharged straight into the fields, causing a bad smell in hot weather.Many people in the village said although they closed their doors, the unbearable stench still creeps into the house. In recent years, the environmental pollution in Huỳnh Dương Village has impacted agricultural production, meaning many paddy areas are unable to grow rice.Some residents of Huỳnh Dương Village and neighbouring villages repeatedly petitioned local authorities but are still without a solution.Phan Huy Ngân, Chairman of Diễn Quảng Commune People\'s Committee, said it was hard to ask local people to spend tens of millions of dong to treat sewage.“The local authorities can encourage people to cover drainage ditches to reduce the smell, but there is no better solution,"" he said.Lack of capitalAccording to Đinh Sỹ Khánh Vinh, Deputy Director of Nghệ An Environmental Protection Department, the pollution from craft villages is alarming, especially those producing noodles, cake and seafood.In Nghệ An province, there are 153 craft villages, of which villages processing seafood in Quỳnh Dị, Quỳnh Lưu and Diễn Ngọc are causing serious pollution.“It’s very difficult to solve because there is no capital to buy machinery and equipment. The department has set up projects, but the capital is not available,” he said.Thái Văn Nông, Deputy Director of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment, said that building and operating environmental protection facilities requires a lot of capital, while the local budget was limited.“Calling for investment in the form of social mobilisation from private sources is not effective as businesses also have difficulties in capital,” he said.“Departments should focus on guiding the application of advanced, environmentally-friendly technologies; apply cleaner production and technical solutions to handle the environmental issues for the craft villages to operate sustainably,” he added.

The number of locally-assembled vehicles has annually risen 10 per cent in the period 2015-18, reaching 250,000 units in 2018.Weak production is one of the reasons the industry failed to cope with the competition on tax cuts, which was eliminated for cars from ASEAN countries last year.After nearly 20 years of development, there are only segments of passenger cars and trucks meeting local targets of localisation rate (local part supply) at 20 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively.In term of car with less than nine seats, the localisation rate reached an average of 7-10 per cent, much lower than the set figure. The locally-produced products are simple such as tires, seats, mirrors and batteries. Meanwhile, the localisation rate of countries in the region has reached an average of 70 per cent, even 80 per cent in Thailand.Nguyễn Trung Hiếu, Head of Policy Department under Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers Association (VAMA) that by the end of 2018, the country had 358 automobile-related manufacturing enterprises with 50 automobile assembling units, 45 enterprises producing chassis, bodies and trunks and 214 auto parts.“This figure is much lower than other countries in the region such as Malaysia and Thailand,” he said.Hiếu added the domestic support industry enterprises have good capacity in some areas such as moulds, bicycle and motorbike components and standard mechanical components.“The automobile industry is about 20 years behind countries in the region such as Thailand and Indonesia, so there should be special policies to encourage businesses to make breakthroughs,” Hiếu said.Nguyễn Thị Hải Bình, an expert from the finance ministry’s Institute of Financial Strategy and Policy, said it is necessary to focus on studying and planning policies to encourage businesses.Bình also proposed to exempt special consumption tax on domestically-produced goods, which are not imported from foreign countries, in addition to incentives relevant to land and credit to develop automobile manufacturing complexes in chain.According to Deputy Chairman of Vietnam Association of Supporting Industries Trương Thị Chí Bình, it needed\xa0to give more credit incentives to help support industry firms raise competitiveness, like the fund for small and medium enterprises that has given priority to manufacturing and supporting industry firms. — VNS'",2
302,'US diplomat condemns China over militarisation in South China Sea',"'WASHINGTON\xa0— David Stilwell, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, cited Chinese “repeated illegal actions and militarisation” in the South China Sea (called East Sea by Việt Nam) while he testified at \xa0the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday (local time).The committee hearing was chaired by Republican Senator James Risch and Democratic Senator Bob Menedez.Stilwell said since early July, Chinese vessels have conducted maritime surveys near Vanguard Bank with armed Coast Guard escorts and maritime militia in order to intimidate Việt Nam and other ASEAN states away from developing oil and gas resources in the South China Sea.“Through repeated illegal actions and militarisation of disputed features, Beijing has and continues to take action to prevent ASEAN members from accessing over $2.5 trillion in recoverable energy reserves,” he said.Democratic Senator Bob Menedez said China’s aggressive maritime activities in the South China Sea and ongoing building of infrastructure could easily be turned to military use.Stilwell also cited Beijing’s use of market-distorting economic inducements and penalties, influencing operations, and intimidation to persuade other states to heed its political and security agenda.The top US diplomat for East Asia said some are “actively seeking to challenge” the free and open order in the Indo-Pacific region.He added: “Beijing’s pursuit of a repressive alternative vision for the Indo-Pacific seeks to reorder the region in its favour and has put China in a position of strategic competition with all who seek to preserve a free and open order of sovereign, diverse nations.“We are committed to working with any country that plays by the rules, but we will also stand up to any country that uses predatory practices to undermine them.”Talking about US’s vision in the Indo-Pacific region, Stillwell emphasised the region’s central global importance and central role in American foreign policy, as underscored by the President’s National Security Strategy.US vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific is “built on common principles that have benefitted all countries in the region, including respect for the sovereignty and independence of all nations, regardless of their size,” he said.\xa0— VNS'",0

608,'Amended tax and public investment laws passed',"HÀ NỘI — National Assembly (NA) deputies on Thursday passed the draft amendment of the Law of Tax Management with 91.32 per cent of all deputies approving the draft law.Among new items in the amended law is the authorisation of Government officials in the elimination of businesses’ tax liabilities that have been unpaid and overdue for at least 10 years.Under the amended law, chairman of the provincial People’s Committee can erase tax liabilities worth a maximum VNĐ5 billion (US$215,000). Directors of the general tax and customs departments are able to remove overdue tax liabilities worth VNĐ5-10 billion.The finance minister is authorised to eliminate overdue tax liabilities worth VNĐ10-15 billion and the Prime Minister can erase unpaid tax liabilities worth more than VNĐ15 billion.Chairman of the provincial People’s Committee is also responsible for reporting tax collection and management status to the provincial People’s Council at the beginning of each year.The finance minister has to do the same and report tax management to the Government and the National Assembly when the State budget spending is settled.The amended law also asks commercial banks to provide data and information of customers – also tax payers – to tax agencies and work with tax agencies to perform tax collection activities while ensuring tax payers’ information is secure and not falsified.Banks are also authorised to freeze the accounts of tax payers by request of the tax agencies if the payers do not\xa0pay taxes voluntarily.The amended Law of Tax Management will take effect on July 1, 2020.State-funded projectsThe amendment of the Law on Public Investment was also passed on Thursday by NA deputies with 90.7 per cent of all deputies approving.The amended law will still empower the National Assembly to make the final decision on the list of national medium-term State-funded projects instead of giving it to the Government and the National Assembly Standing Committee.Deputies also rejected the Government’s proposal to increase funding for national-scale projects to VNĐ20 trillion ($860 million) from the existing VNĐ10 trillion.During the sixth meeting of the 14th National Assembly held in October 2018, the Government proposed the National Assembly increase the funding for national-scale projects to VNĐ35 trillion from the existing VNĐ10 trillion, but the National Assembly rejected the suggestion.Deputies also voted to maintain funding levels for tier A, B and C projects, which are classified in articles 8, 9 and 10 of the 2014 Law on Public Investment.In addition, the amended law requires local authorities, ministries and Government agencies to develop a financial plan, which includes the public investment projects' total funding estimate and requires\xa0State to provide the counterpart capital.Based on their calculations, the Government agencies are able to approve the project development plans and disburse the exact amount of State funds for the projects.State Securities CommissionDeputy Vũ Thị Lưu Mai suggested the Ministry of Finance keep managing the State Securities Commission (SSC) instead of making the stock market regulator an independent unit under direct management of the Government.“If the SSC is made independent, it may increase the number of staff, amount of payrolls and spending for the State budget,” she said on Thursday.It is not the matter of under which ministry and agency the SSC should be managed, deputy Hoàng Quang Hàm said, adding the commission must stay self-legislating and be empowered to make sure the Vietnamese equity market works properly and transparently.Under the management of the finance ministry, SSC has made great contributions to the rapid development of the Vietnamese stock market, Hàm said.If the SSC status is changed to a government-controlled unit, its organisational structure may be overhauled, causing unexpected changes on the stock market, he added. —\xa0VNS",0

It is the highest value since the bank’s debut on August 5, 2009.Other bank stocks such as Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BID), Vietinbank (CTG) and HDBank (HDB) also advanced.Retail and technology sectors were the two strongest gaining industries, whose indices soared 3.2 per cent and 2.8 per cent, data on vietstock.vn showed.The two largest companies in the sectors – digital retailer Mobile World Investment Corp (MWG) and tech group FPT Corp (FPT) – jumped 3.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively.FPT Corp has recently announced its third-quarter earnings, which rose 17.7 per cent year on year in revenue and 30.2 per cent year on year in pre-tax profit.In the first nine months, FPT recorded total revenue and pre-tax profit gained 20.5 per cent and 28.1 per cent yearly.Expectations for improved earnings at Mobile World Investment Corp boosted the firm’s shares.The company in September announced its total revenue in eight-month period gained 17 per cent year on year and post-tax profit was up more than a third in the same period.Other large-cap stocks also increased to lift the market, including SSI Securities Corp (SSI), realty firm Vincom Retail (VRE), PetroVietnam Gas (GAS) and Phú Nhuận Jewellery JSC (PNJ).Though the VN-Index gained for three consecutive days with the help of large-caps, investors were still cautious as trading liquidity remained low, Thành Công Securities Co (TCSC) said in a daily report.More than 160 million shares were traded on the southern bourse, worth VNĐ3.66 trillion (US$157.4 million).The figures were little changed from Wednesday.What could drive the market up further is improved trading liquidity, Sài Gòn-Hà Nội Securities Co (SHS) said in a note.The VN-Index is forecast to struggle in the 1,000-1,005 point zone over the coming days.On the Hà Nội Stock Exchange, the HNX-Index rose 0.49 per cent to end Thursday at 104.64 points.The northern market index fell 0.34 per cent on Wednesday.More than 20 million shares were traded on the northern bourse, worth VNĐ204.5 billion. — VNS'",2
613,'Local governments have become more transparent',"HÀ NỘI — Local governments have become more transparent with how they spend public money, but more needs to be done, according to a report.The 2018 Provincial Open Budget Index (POBI) report published yesterday by Budget Transparency, Accountability and Participation (BTAP) showed that the average transparency score out of 100 of provinces and cities increased from\xa030.5 in 2017 to 51 in 2018.The research group led by the\xa0Việt Nam Institute for Economic and Policy Research (VEPR) recognised the Mekong Delta province of Vĩnh Long as having\xa0the most transparent administration in terms of its budget, with 90.52 points.The coastal northern city of Hải Phòng placed last with\xa05.14 points.Researchers surveyed 63 provinces and cities on two main pillars – budget transparency and civil participation – to evaluate localities’ efforts to fully disclose all relevant fiscal information in a timely and systematic manner.The index was built on four main criteria of completeness, timeliness, availability and convenience in providing\xa0seven documents that\xa0the 2015 Law on State budget mandates be disclosed and two other documents that need to be published\xa0with\xa0international best practices.These documents should be found on the websites of provincial people’s committees, people’s council and departments of planning and investment.The coastal southern centre and Mekong Delta were the two regions with the highest average POBI points of 60.9 and 59.16, respectively.Meanwhile, northern central provinces were most reticent to disclose\xa0public budget information.Last year, 29 provinces published draft budget estimates in a timely fashion( within five days of their delivery to provinces’ people’s councils), compared to only nine in 2017.However,\xa0completeness and the convenience of accessing\xa0budget-related documents were improved remained poor.Only 10 provinces\xa0fully disclosed all 13 forms of their provincial draft budget estimates in 2018 compared to two provinces the year prior.Although there is a section for\xa0budget transparency on the websites of\xa0provincial departments of planning and investment, information is often difficult to access and rarely updated.On civil participation, the report concluded provincial authorities did not help people engage in budget transparency.The national average score for this was 34.35, with\xa0Bắc Ninh Province leading at 66.6 points.On behalf of the research group, researcher Vũ Sỹ Cường expressed his hopes that the report would help\xa0enhance budget transparency.“I think the National Assembly, when discussing budget allocation, should also take how provinces use the State budget and disclosure related information,” he said.“There should also be mechanisms to ensure localities make\xa0the information available for people to effectively monitor the public budget,” Cường added.Nguyễn Minh Tân, deputy head of the\xa0Finance\xa0and Budget Division under the\xa0National Assembly’s Finance\xa0and Budget\xa0Committee, said budget information remained lacking as provincial authorities had not understood the importance of transparency to local development. At the same time, Việt Nam has not issued any regulations to punish localities who aren't transparent.“It is essential to create pressure and instruct local authorities to improve the availability of budget-related information. This is a legal loophole outside of the report’s scope that needs addressed in the long term,” he said.POBI is a national initiative\xa0implemented independently by non-profit research institutes. The 2018 POBI report was conducted by two members of BTAP including VEPR and the Centre for Development and Integration (CDI) under the framework of the Promoting transparency, accountability and people participation in managing the state budget project sponsored by the EU Delegation to Việt Nam through Oxfam.“POBI along with other indexes such as PCI (provincial competitiveness index) has become a tool to enhance openness, democracy and transparency as well as help Việt Nam demonstrate international commitments of an open government,” said VEPR director Nguyễn Đức Thành.The full report can be found at www.ngansachvietnam.net. — VNS",0

She was 74 years old.One of the contemporary era\'s most revered opera singers, the Grammy-winner died ""surrounded by loved ones"" at a New York hospital due to septic shock and multi-organ failure, the result of complications from a spinal cord injury sustained in 2015, according to a statement obtained by AFP via a spokeswoman.""We are so proud of Jessye\'s musical achievements and the inspiration that she provided to audiences around the world that will continue to be a source of joy,"" said her family.Born September 15, 1945 in Augusta, Georgia, Norman grew up surrounded by music as one of five children in a family of amateur artists.She made a foray into gospel at age four, and as a young girl began listening to radio broadcasts of performances at the Metropolitan Opera, where she would go on to star.""I don\'t remember a moment in my life when I wasn\'t trying to sing,"" she told NPR in 2014.A pioneering young black woman in the white world of classical music, Norman quickly became beloved for her soaring voice and effervescent personality.She studied music at the historically black college Howard University in Washington before going on to the Peabody Conservatory and the University of Michigan.She established herself in Europe in the 1970s, making her operatic debut in Berlin in 1969 before wowing elsewhere on the continent including Italy. She eventually moved to London and spent years performing recital and solo work.Norman became the youngest person in a two-decade history to earn a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor at age 52 in 1997, and president Barack Obama bestowed her with a National Medal of Arts.She has performed at two presidential inaugurations, the opening ceremonies of the Atlanta Summer Olympics in 1996, and at the Bicentennial of the French Revolution in Paris in 1989.The superstar singer was also a Commander in France\'s Order of Arts and Letters, and has an orchid named after her there. — AFP'",5
4258,'Clean-up success at lead recycling village',"'Khánh DươngHƯNG YÊN — After a hard day’s work,\xa0labourers in the lead recycling industrial area of Chỉ Đạo Commune in northern Hưng Yên Province are required to leave their contaminated clothes at work, bathe and then change into clean clothes in a changing room before going home. The hygiene helps eliminate lead contamination that may affect other people.The separate\xa0industrial zone was created by moving all lead recycling households out of\xa0Đông Mai Village by the end of 2015.Lead was recycled in the residential area of Đông Mai Village for more than 40 years. Residents were surrounded by piles of batteries that were broken up and smelted down for their lead content.Chemicals were directly discharged into the environment, absorbed into the soil and water sources and diffused into the air.A series of health check-ups by scientists showed the lead had serious impacts on human health. A comprehensive study of exposures was conducted by the Health Ministry’s National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health and the University of Washington School of Public Health in 2011.All of the 109 village children tested had lead levels in the blood exceeding 10 µg/dL, a level of concern recorded by the US\xa0Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.Thirty three out of \xa0the children had blood levels exceeding 45\xa0µg/dL,\xa0which meant that their posisoning had reached a medium or high level.The shocking statistics prompted scientists to take action to save human - and environmental - \xa0health. And they made changes. The changing room for workers was one of their contributions.The intervention was jointly implemented by US and Vietnamese researchers from Pure Earth and Việt Nam’s\xa0Centre for Environment and Community Development between July 2013 and February 2015. Working on a budget\xa0of US$118,750, the project outcomes and follow-up results, released recently, show its sustainability.Under the project, contaminated yards at local homes have been covered with compacted clean soil, alluvial soil, clean sand, paver stones or concrete to isolate the contamination from leaking out and affecting humans and animals.This type of soil mitigation was applied at 49 households highly contaminated with lead. Capping with a clean layer soil of more than 10cm is an internationally accepted approach to dealing with such contamination and has been used in the United States and Australia, according to the research report.In addition to the homes made safe by the project, 47 other home-owners spent their own money following the project’s protocol.Dương Thị Tơ, director of Centre for Environment and Community Development said: “If all contaminated soils were moved to another place, the process would be enormously costly. We use a simple and\xa0optimal\xa0solution, which is low-cost.”According to researchers, at the close of the project in 2015, average surface soil-lead concentrations in all 96 targeted yards were confirmed to be below the clean-up threshold value of 100mg/kg.This compares with average soil concentrations of 3,940 mg/kg before the intervention. In 2016, the research team measured 20 randomly selected points in the village and was unable to identify lead in surface soils above the instrument detection limit of 5mg/kg.Local authorities paved village roads using local budget and mobilising funds from enterprises.Trịnh Văn Hiến, a resident of Đông Mai Village told Việt Nam News: “Now I feel the air fresher than it was 10 years ago. Main roads, alleys and every local yard look cleaner.”Positive improvementMore importantly, the intervention has resulted in positive reduction in the lead blood levels of local people.Blood lead levels in 196 children below six years old fell by an average of 67 per cent from a median of 40.35 µg/dL in late 2013 to 13.3 µg/dL in the middle of 2015.Lỗ Văn Tùng, vice head of Department for School Hygiene and Health at the National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health, one of the researchers, said that the effort to help locals release the lead in their blood did not end there.The institute, in collaboration with Pectin Technology Company, gave free medicine called Pectin complex to 333 children and 107 labourers in July and August 2016.\xa0“Positive results were seen after two months of taking the medicine,” he said.A total of 118 children taking the medicine had their lead levels fall from 20.9\xa0µg/dL to 16.5 µg/dL. And 44 labourers had their lead levels decrease from 43.17µg/dL to 31.55 µg/dL.\xa0Nearly 60 per cent of children and nearly half the labourers who took the medicine said that their health had improved.Researchers said that the success of the project was also due to people becoming aware, keeping dust out of their homes and keeping their homes clean.Bret Ericson, a Pure Earth researcher, said low-cost, rapid and well-coordinated\xa0interventions could be readily applied elsewhere to significantly reduce lead poisoning.“I presented the findings recently to the Department of Environment in Bangladesh. We are working with many countries, such as India, trying to replicate the experience from Việt Nam. In Zambia, we applied these lessons recently to protect the health of thousands of people,” Bret said.More needs to be doneTùng said that although the environment and health of local residents had been improved, there were still potential health risks from the untreated lead slag dump stored in the village. Technical solutions must be studied to remove this waste.Workers in the industrial area still face the risk of being poisoned with lead and can take lead back home if they do not clean their clothes and shoes carefully.They must strictly follow hygiene regulations at work, use protective equipment, such as specialised masks, boots, follow personal hygiene and change clothes before leaving work. They are absolutely not allowed to smoke, cook or eat at work because these activities create conditions for lead to be distributed, Tùng\xa0said.“We also need to assess the long-term impacts of the intervention by testing blood level of vulnerable groups such as residents, workers and children below six years old.”Dr Dương Khánh Vân, Tùng’s college at the National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health is pushing for the separate lead recycling area to be strictly controlled so that its emissions are not released into the air and waste from the area does not spread. —\xa0VNS'",4

He thought it was a desperate situation and he nearly gave up.Not longer after, when he lay down at a rock in the mountain, he suddenly saw about 10 langurs playing with each other among the tree branches, Dân Việt online newspaper reported.The retired border solider immediately realised that were actually Hatinh langurs (Trachypithecus hatinhensis) – named as an endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list.Before retiring, Tú attended training courses for border soldiers to identify endangered and endemic species, he said.Voluntary protectionThe story actually began when Tú decided to voluntarily protect the langurs from being hunted by poachers.During days of watching and protecting the langurs, Tú found Nguyễn Văn Hồng, a resident of Đồng Hoá Commune and a skilled hunter, who could kill the langurs at any time.Tú tried to meet Hồng.He explained to Hồng that the langur was an endangered species, named to both international and Vietnamese red lists. The langur is protected by law so that hunting them is illegal.At first, Hồng rejected those words. Hồng argued that he earns his living by hunting.But Tú still clung to a fragile hope and tried to persuade Hồng to stop hunting.Then, one day, Hồng went to the mountain to hunt the langurs. Two langurs, one female and one male were trapped. When the female langur died, the male langur hugged the dead animal with his sorrowful eyes.“The moment still haunts me,” he said.The moment and the words of Tú made Hồng change his mind. He quit hunting and participated in protecting the langurs with Tú. Hồng’s family income now mainly depends on farming.The pair teamed up to not only protect the langurs but also to take care of them. On dry days, Tú and Hồng also took water to the mountain for the langurs.Hồng said many people told him that he already performed a thankless task because no-one hired or paid them.But Hồng said, “Tú and I voluntarily really want to do the job.” They wanted to contribute a small thing to endangered-species protection.Thanks to the protection of Tú and Hồng, the number of langurs in the commune is now much higher than in 2012.Tú said that since the number of langurs was increasing, many langur protectionists in the world came and see him in his house. They came to see and record images of the langurs for documentaries.However, Tú still has great concern for the safety of the langurs.According to Tú, people are still allowed to freely visit the area where the langurs live. It poses risks to the langurs.“Recently, I found a person taking his gun with the aim to hunt langurs,” he said.The people only stopped when Tú informed local police.Therefore, Tú said he really hoped the local administration quickly rezoned the area where the langurs were living in order to set up a small conservation area for the species in the coming time.In March 2016, Tú was awarded the certificate of merit from the Government for his untired contributions to langur protection in the province.In May 2018, the provincial Forest Management Department gave a certificate of merit to Hồng for his protection of the langurs. —VNS'",4

Therefore, units that do not meet 50 per cent of criteria in terms of natural area and population will be merged in the first phase.”He said the city would submit two proposals to the home affairs ministry. The first option is to merge three wards together. However, he said it couldn’t guarantee meeting the area criteria after the merger. The second option is merging two wards.Lê Thị Thìn, deputy chairman of Thanh Hóa Province’s People’s Committee said the province has 143 communes which were to be rearranged. After the mergers, it will have 559 administrative units at commune level, a reduction of 12 per cent.“The arrangement of officials should be organised in an objective and transparent manner. The gathering of opinions from contingent of commune officials and protecting the interests of involved personnel was also a must,” she said.Even the name of merged communes should be chosen carefully.

So research in the country should be strengthened, he said.Many foreign and Vietnamese scientists are presenting their research in AI, the internet of things, decision support systems, and others at the conference, he added.The 14th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems aims to facilitate technology and knowledge exchange by international researchers and scholars in the fields of knowledge science, information systems, system science, creativity support systems, and complex system modelling.It is being held by Hoa Sen University in co-operation with Vintech City, which is a comprehensive eco-system supporting tech research and start-ups based on the Silicon Valley model in the US.

5329,'I wanna hold your Hà Nội',"By Paul KennedyHÀ NỘI — On October 5th, 1962, a new boyband from Liverpool in the United Kingdom released their first song.It was called Love me do and it peaked in the UK charts at number 17, a moderate success. Their second song, Please, please me, did a little better and the rest, as they say, is history.The group was The Beatles, who went on to become the biggest band in the world. The Fab Four as they were affectionately known changed popular music forever.Fifty seven years later and more than 9,000 kilometres away from the city of Liverpool, the music of The Beatles is as popular now at Tranquil Books & Coffee in Việt Nam’s capital city as it was in the Cavern Club, the venue The Beatles regularly played in the northwest of England back in the early sixties.Here a new generation of Fab Four fans sing along to the tunes made famous when their grandparents were around their age.They may be slightly less raucous than fans of the past, but their love and knowledge of the group is on a par with all who have followed before them.“When listening to The Beatles, I can feel the lyrics, the melodies and the combination of John Lennon and Paul McCartney who created hits which are still popular now,” said 20-year-old student Lương Đức Quang.“The composing styles of Lennon and McCartney are genius. With John Lennon, we can feel the music was more about his life and he brought it into the song when writing the lyrics.“As for McCartney, while listening to his music, listeners can feel a part of themselves in it. These values have never changed, especially when it comes from heart. So I think, when the two styles get together, with Ringo's drumming, and George Harrison's guitar solos, it all comes together to create immortal hits.”Trịnh Linh Chi, 33, of The Beatles Việt Nam – Official Fan Club added: “In my fan club there are many people from previous generations who are in their 40s and 50s and youngsters who are born after 2000.“Anyone can find something they can relate to in The Beatles' music, and whenever having a certain emotion, mood or story, everyone can certainly find parts of themselves in The Beatles' musical treasures because this band has so many amazing songs.“The Beatles’ music, I think, is very suitable for the tastes of many ages;\xa0the more you hear, the better it gets. So I am very happy because until now, The Beatles music in Việt Nam has still been loved by many people and especially by those who are very young.”Last week the songs were sung with even more passion and effort than normal as auditions were held to create a Vietnamese tribute band.They need Johns, Pauls, Georges and of course, Ringos. And there was no shortage of takers packed into the tiny venue ready to try out.Classic songs were belted out with gusto. Michelle, Ticket to Ride and\xa0Hey Jude to name just a few.Hoang Nguyet Cam may only be 18 years old, but she’s already a dab hand on the piano playing Beatles songs.Cam said: “I’ve been a fan of The Beatles for a long time, since I was in the seventh or eighth grade.“Back then there was a friend of mine who used to play and share Beatles songs.\xa0I clicked on those songs and the first song I listened to was And I love her and since then I started to like this band.“Among The Beatles albums, I like Rubber Soul the most, and I performed two songs from that album on the piano.”The idea is to bring together Việt Nam’s very own Fab Four to play a small number of gigs in the coming months.And there’s little doubt the fan base exists to ensure a warm welcome whenever they appear on stage.“I have been one of the core members of the club since the first performances,” Chi added.“Currently, I’m one of the main singers of the band. The Beatles Việt Nam – Official Fan Club has been in operation since the end of 2015, up to now it has been nearly four years.“The number of our members is also the number of fans on our Facebook page.

2731,'Five-star Liverpool thrash sorry Everton',"'LIVERPOOL — Liverpool surged eight points clear at the top of the Premier League as Divock Origi was the scourge of Everton once more in a thrilling 5-2 Merseyside derby win for the European champions at Anfield.All but one of the goals came before half-time as Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri, who replaced the rested Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah, put Liverpool 2-0 up inside 17 minutes.Michael Keane pulled a goal back for Everton before Origi got his second and Sadio Mane finished off a blistering counter-attack to make it 4-1.The scoring did not stop there as Richarlison cut the deficit once more, but Georginio Wijnaldum hammered the final nail in the Everton coffin a minute from time as an eighth defeat in 11 league games sees the Toffees slip into the bottom three.""All the goals were incredible,"" said a delighted Jurgen Klopp, who made five changes in total. ""Wonderful goals, sensational passes, super pieces of football. I loved it a lot.""Klopp insisted this fixture remained the ""standout"" one in Liverpool\'s season despite the massive points difference between the sides at either end of the table.However, the German\'s actions spoke louder than words as he could afford the luxury of leaving out Firmino and Salah at the beginning of a hectic month for the Reds in three competitions.""We needed fresh legs and I had to show my respect to the boys in the squad,"" added Klopp. ""They proved it. It is much more fun making changes, all of the boys are ready to deliver performances like this.""Origi scored the 96th-minute winner when the sides met last season at Anfield and proved his worth within six minutes this time with a calm finish to round Jordan Pickford and slot into an empty net after a sensational pass from Mane cut Everton open.Shaqiri was making his first start of the season, but also showed no signs of rustiness in front of goal by finishing off another Mane assist on his trusty left foot.""My biggest dream is to win the title with this club and give it to the fans,"" said the Swiss midfielder.""We have to focus on the pitch, stay grounded and work hard every day. If we win, it will be amazing, but we still have a long way to go.""Everton mistakes \'not normal\'At the other end, Liverpool were without the suspended Alisson in goal and looked poor at the back all night as their long wait for a clean sheet at Anfield this season continued.Keane took advantage of a slip from Dejan Lovren to lift a delightful finish over Adrian to briefly breathe new life into Everton.That was extinguished on the half-hour mark as Lovren made amends with a brilliant ball over the top which Origi cushioned into his path before lobbing Pickford.Liverpool then struck again from an Everton corner as Trent Alexander-Arnold led the charge from one end of the field to the other before squaring for Mane to curl into the bottom corner.Under-fire Everton manager Marco Silva had made a substitution just 35 minutes in to try and turn the tide with Bernard replacing Djibril Sidibe and the Brazilian made an impact as from his cross the ball came off Richarlison\'s shoulder to leave Adrian helpless.But Silva must now wait to see if he is offered another stay of execution by the Everton board ahead of Chelsea\'s visit to Goodison on Saturday.""I am not the right person to answer about the situation, this question is for different people,"" said Silva over growing calls for him to be fired.""The type of mistakes we are making is because the players are playing under big pressure because of the position in the table.

She visits Việt Nam from time to time to meet her young audience.During her latest visit to Việt Nam in May, many Vietnamese children took part in a workshop with her and\xa0listened to her stories.

Therefore, electricity planning must also be linked to capital planning.Nguyễn Tài Anh, Deputy General Director of Electricity\xa0Vietnam (EVN), said too many solar projects in Ninh Thuận and Bình Thuận provinces have put great pressure on the transmission grid. EVN has called investors to build a transmission system for those regions under the planning.By June 2020, EVN expects to complete transmission grid projects\xa0in the two provinces.Nguyễn Tuấn Anh, Head of Plan and Planning Division at the Electricity and Renewable Energy Department, said the Ministry of Industry and Trade supports calling for private investment to develop the transmission grid.

Two-way trade has reached only about US$100 million per year.\nIn order to improve the partnership, they agreed to hold the 24th meeting of the Việt Nam-Bulgaria Inter-Governmental Committee on economic cooperation soon, while strengthening trade and investment promotion activities, encouraging and creating optimal conditions for businesses of both sides to seek partners, especially in areas of Bulgaria’s strength and Việt Nam’s demand such as agriculture, pharmaceutical chemistry and IT.\nBình thanked the people and Government of Bulgaria for supporting Việt Nam during the past struggle for independence and current national construction and development, affirming that Việt Nam always attached great importance to developing friendship and all-round cooperation with traditional friends in central and eastern Europe, including Bulgaria.\nHe highly valued the growth in traditional friendship and multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries, especially in politics, with the regular exchange of delegations, including many high-level ones.\nThe Vietnamese Deputy PM conveyed invitations from Vietnamese leaders to Bulgarian leaders to visit Việt Nam for the 70th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations in 2020.\nBulgarian Deputy PM Donchev showed his admiration for the achievements that Việt Nam has gained over the years, especially high economic growth and stable social welfare as well as its rising international and regional status.\nHe affirmed his country’s support for strengthening the relations between Việt Nam and the European Union, including the early signing and ratification of the EU-Việt Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) and the EU-Việt Nam Investment Protection Agreement (EVIPA).\nHe lauded the efforts and contributions of the Vietnamese community in Bulgaria to the host country’s growth and the development of ties between the two countries.\nHe described the nearly 4,000 Vietnamese people who used to work and study in Bulgaria as an important basis for the development of bilateral friendship and all-round cooperation.\nThe two sides concurred to further strengthen cooperation in culture, tourism, science-technology, labour, security and defence, while speeding up the signing of an agreement on education collaboration in the 2019-22 period.\nAt the talks, Bình thanked Bulgaria for supporting Việt Nam’s run for the position of non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the 2020-21 tenure.\nThey pledged to continue cooperating with and supporting each other at multilateral forums and international organisations.\nRegarding the East Sea issue, the two Deputy PMs underlined the significance of maintaining peace, stability, maritime and aviation security in the region, the need to solve disputes by peaceful means and respect for international law, especially the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS).\nEarlier the same day, Deputy PM Bình met President of Bulgaria's Supreme Court Lozan Panov, during which he affirmed that Việt Nam wished to learn from Bulgaria’s experience in personnel training and court reform, thus enhancing the efficiency of court activities in Việt Nam.\nBoth sides agreed that authorised agencies of the two sides should work more closely in judicial and administrative reform as well as law building.\nBình conveyed the Chief Judge of Việt Nam’s invitation to President of the Supreme People’s Court Panov to visit Việt Nam.\nPanov held that Việt Nam and Bulgaria had great potential for cooperation, especially in court activities, organised and hi-tech crime prevention and combat. — VNS",0
1649,"'In the fight against sexual assault, victim-blaming means deadlock'","by Khoa ThưIt is all rooted in a common myth that it is easier to bring up a baby with an ugly name.“Evil demons will leave them alone and instead\xa0disturb children with\xa0beautiful names,” an old granny\xa0may tell you.Hardly anyone now still believes in this\xa0myth as a name obviously cannot offer parents any help in raising and educating a child, and sometimes, an odd name can\xa0spell trouble\xa0for the bearer.Ironically, even in\xa0the 21st century, a lot of people still hold other unfounded beliefs\xa0and use them as useless measures to protect themselves against real danger and discomfort.“Women wearing revealing clothing are more vulnerable to sexual assault” is among those misleading ideas.And be\xa0– a Vietnamese ride hailing service which has recently joined the market,\xa0in what appears to be a frantic effort, has kindly\xa0offered online advice\xa0called “two minutes of safety with be” in which female customers are recommended to “put on\xa0an extra jacket, wear a skirt long enough to cover your legs or consider booking a beCar (instead of beBike) for your privacy and comfort.”To pass on this “little friendly” advice, be had to construct a scenario which could not\xa0be more absurd.“The way you dress can impact the quality of your trip, dear\xa0customers,” the firm sweetly started.“An outfit that is a bit revealing\xa0or skintight can sometimes make a driver lose focus, then unintentionally affect the safety of your ride,” it continues, with\xa0an illustration of a female passenger.The advertisement, before being removed from\xa0be’s Facebook fanpage, stirred outrage and\xa0at the same time\xa0exposed an ugly truth that there are lots of people, besides be’s marketing team, that still cling\xa0on to the myth that liberal clothing may lead to sexual abuse.“The real danger here comes from men’s natural instincts, not be’s (male) drivers. And instincts are uncontrollable. If you say this advice to wear an extra jacket or long dress to keep yourself safe is unreasonable, it is just like saying building dams to protect against floods is unreasonable as well. You cannot blame the floods, why not take control of the situation by yourself?,” said a Facebooker.It seems the user has\xa0fallen for a common logic trap as it is humiliating to both genders.\xa0Here are be’s female customers and male drivers, with the\xa0men considered to have no self-control and\xa0full slaves to their sexuality.Let us make it clear that rape\xa0is not about biological urges; it's\xa0violence against women and even men.It has nothing to do\xa0with what people wear.Last year, an exhibition entitled “What were you wearing” took place in Brussels featuring clothing to items worn by\xa0sexual assault victims the moment they were attacked.A pyjamas, a tracksuit, and even a police uniform were featured as irrefutable evidence of\xa0the fact that a person’s outfit does not incite rape.“It is an excuse for violence against women by saying clothing can be seen as provocation for rape, just like a man blaming alcohol for\xa0beating up his wife and children, ” said Thuỳ Linh, a gender-based violence specialist in Hà Nội.“Acts of assault\xa0and rape are motivated by different factors, mostly social, gender norms and unequal power between men and women, but never clothing,” she added.The responsibility of\xa0ensuring\xa0safety is not only in the hands of drivers and customers but also be’s as a co-ordinator and service provider.By saying provocative outfits are the reason\xa0for sexual assault, be makes me wonder whether it\xa0has\xa0any protocol in place to deal with the issue.Blaming is easy, taking action is hard, especially when they don’t have a full understanding about what is really going on.Eight out of ten rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, while only 19.5 per cent of sexual assault cases are carried out\xa0by strangers, according to research by the US-based Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network)Instead of continuing to\xa0play\xa0the blame game, it is time to look directly\xa0at the problem and find\xa0for more impactful solutions.For be, an attentive hotline or safety centre may help.As a beautiful name poses no threat to a baby, it is not an outfit that hurts. —\xa0VNS",1

She has taught Vietnamese culture and language at Tam Kang University\'s Southeast Asia Research Institute since 2007.Reporter Quỳnh Yên, from Sài Gòn Giải Phóng (Liberated Sài Gòn) newspaper talks to her about her work.You are popular in Taiwan\xa0but your name is unfamiliar in Việt Nam. How do you feel\xa0when your poetry\xa0book is introduced\xa0here?This is the first time I have had the opportunity to introduce a book of poetry in Việt Nam. In 1994, I had my first trip back to the country\xa0then I returned\xa0once or twice a year. I looked forward to introducing my poetry to Vietnamese readers but I have not had a chance until now.The biggest problem is the translation,\xa0because I often move to many places so I don\'t have\xa0time. Last year, translator Trúc Ty translated my work. I was\xa0really touched\xa0because I had the intention but I could not do it. Now I have friends to help me.The poetry collection Khi Đêm Nở Rộ Như Hoa\xa0is the result of fellowship between friends.The poetry\xa0collection is very\xa0emotional and moving. What inspired you?I have a hobby of travelling. I have been traveling\xa0and living\xa0in\xa0many places but there is no place to give me the feeling of being home.\xa0These things I often write in my poetry.I was born in the southern province of Mỹ Tho. Every time\xa0I return to Việt Nam, I visit my homeland\xa0but my family is no longer there.I visit\xa0and look at the old house that used to be mine.\xa0My mood is like a lyric\xa0of Li Bai, ""cúi đầu nhớ cố hương"" (bow down to remember the homeland).Although living and having a child in Taiwan and\xa0going to school in France,\xa0my hometown is not in these places.Sometimes, I find myself like sand drifting day after day. I hope the newly released poems will help me to calm down. Sand will not drift and I will find peace of mind.Is language merely a means of expressing your thoughts and\xa0feelings?For me, language or text is not only a means of expressing thoughts and emotions.\xa0For those who are in exile and\xa0often moving,\xa0language is also a good way to see the light in lonely and sad moments.I always speak out\xa0or use a pen to write what I think not only for literary work but also for my own feelings and\xa0other people.These people may be next to me or on the other side of the road or\xa0on a passing train who I make eye contact with.In these moments, I use\xa0all languages that I know including Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, Arabic, German, Italian and Spanish to record the thoughts and feelings.How do you feel when you write in Chinese?My maternal grandfather is a Chinese Hakka and my grandmother is Vietnamese. When I was small, I started reading poetry, novels\xa0and many literary works by famous Chinese writers\xa0in the 1930s.At aged seven\xa0and eight\xa0years old, I read all the books in the school\'s library and the books and newspapers published in Hong Kong that my father bought.Writing in Chinese is a natural process.You are one of\xa0the rare female poets in Taiwan to write about war and the American war in Việt Nam in particular. What do you think about this topic?In Taiwan, perhaps I am the only female poet to write about war. There are\xa0male poets who do\xa0but female poets do not.I stopped\xa0writing for 10 years because every time I thought about the past\xa0I could not write.At these times, I often shed tears. I used to write about war. There are many wars in the 20th century such as the First World War, the Second World War, the American war in Việt Nam and Lebanon war.I write many poems about war because I don\'t understand why people have\xa0no experience or lessons. There are\xa0too many wars in the world, why don\'t we remember about\xa0suffering.Lately, I write\xa0more about food and culture\xa0because I often travel a lot and\xa0eat new things. I have experiences and\xa0inspiration to write poetry.Do you plan to translate all your works\xa0into Vietnamese?Hopefully I can translate the best\xa0poems into Vietnamese and French in the future.\xa0Of course, it must be poems worth translating, not everything\xa0because sometimes there are poems that I don\'t really like. — VNS'",5

977,'Developing raw material areas essential for Việt Nam’s agricultural growth',"'HÀ NỘI — Despite having gained access to nearly 200 countries and territories with an annual turnover of US$40 billion, Việt Nam still struggled to sustainably expand and develop markets for its agricultural commodities in harsh conditions.Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyễn Xuân Cường pointed out the country’s disadvantages in increasing consumption of its agricultural products at the International Support Group Plenary Meeting 2019 in Hà Nội yesterday.According to Cường, Việt Nam’s agriculture does not have effective productivity as most of farms are small in size, exposing the sector to threats of loss and crop failure, especially under the impacts of climate change.“Besides shrimp, catfish and milk, most of Việt Nam’s agricultural products have very short value chains,” he said, adding that Vietnamese farmers were the most vulnerable as production still depended heavily on weather conditions while farming infrastructure was limited.In the context of global integration, the public-private partnership needs accelerating to allocate resources to develop a completed agriculture management ecosystem which will not only satisfy the food demand of nearly 100 million citizens but also the international market, the minister said.“Việt Nam has to continue agricultural restructure, focusing on products that the country has comparative advantages, applying innovations and enhancing international cooperation,” said Cường.Ousmane Dione, World Bank Việt Nam Country Director, raised concerns over quality and sustainability of Việt Nam’s agricultural growth, saying profits earned by small households were low and post-harvest loss was considerable.Meanwhile, food quality and safety have not ensured, hindering the country’s agriculture sector from expanding.He recommended Việt Nam strengthens ties among stakeholders and provinces in planning production areas and improving trade promotion besides increasing productivity.Đặng Kim Sơn, former head of the Institute of Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development, stressed upon the development of sustainable raw material areas and cooperatives as the breakthrough to further set up value chains for agricultural products.In its presentation at the event, representatives of United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) briefed the model of “Centre of Excellence” which was piloted in Mekong Delta province of Đồng Tháp and Hà Nội as an approach to develop agri-business and value chain.According to UNIDO, the model “represents an interface between farmers and the market and acts as a model for the application of appropriate technologies and its transfer to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) acting in the sector”.Many supporting services are provided including vocational training in food processing and entrepreneurship management.Two enterprises in Đồng Tháp Province have successfully exported mangoes to the US and tripled the raw material areas, from 300ha to nearly 1,000ha, under the model’s framework.Việt Nam Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and UNIDO signed a project implementation agreement on increasing quality and standards compliance capacity of the mango value chain in Mekong River Delta. — VNS'",1

He performs bolero duets with both male and female voices. It is a one-man show where he sings, writes scripts for the programme, remixes and produces all the clips. Each song attracts millions of views.With the theme Spring of Love, the show will be a gift for audiences for the new year. It will feature various guest artists such as Chế Linh, Dương Ngọc Thái and Yuuki Ánh Bùi (first runner-up of the Bolero Idol singing contest in 2018).“The concert is a gift for my fans for the New Year,” said Cường. “I expect that people will enjoy the romantic and sweet bolero songs with a spring atmosphere.”Cường will perform songs with folk melodies originating from the central province of Nghệ An, where he was born. Cường left his homeland to work around the country. He wants to send a message that wherever he goes, he still remembers his home.Cường is a singer with a strong will, said veteran singer Chế Linh. Cường competed in the X Factor singing contest in 2017.“In the bolero genre, Cường is very successful because he sings with his heart and mind,” said Linh. “I think apart from a good voice, a bolero singer needs true emotion and experiences in life to touch people’s hearts. That’s something singers can’t achieve with training and practice.”Cường had the chance to join the military but he quit to pursue singing. He left home to move to HCM City and started a career with a loudspeaker. He worked as a busker selling chewing gum at restaurants, food shops and public places in HCM City.“I wandered the streets and sang with a broken heart when my girlfriend and family abandoned me, however the passion for music is always in my heart,” he said.Through the concert, Cường also wants to inspire and motivate other people. He’s an artist who has overcome many difficulties.What Cường can do, you can do too, he said.“From a busker on the street to a singer at the Hà Nội Opera House, I have walked a long road with obstacles.

They showed signs of a lack of oxygen.The households said they did all they could to save the fish, including using oxygen aerators and pulling fish cages towards lower\xa0areas of the river. However, the fish still died en mass.On May 18, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment required the provincial People’s Committee to take water and fish samples to evaluate the pollution of the river and re-examine wastewater sources being discharged into the river.The ministry also asked the committee to direct departments, sectors and agencies to assess losses of\xa0the affected households and to instruct them how to\xa0collect dead fish properly to avoid environmental\xa0pollution.Notably, the ministry said a similar mass\xa0fish death\xa0occurred at the same time last year.The results of the inspection must be publicised to local people and press agencies, the committee said.The provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development estimated that more than 1,900 tonnes of fish from 132 local households were found dead along the 5km river last June.Locals suspected that discharged wastewater from nearby factories might have caused the deaths.Water and fish samples were collected for testing two weeks later.The results showed the low oxygen content in the water and the high density of fish were the main cause of the mass fish deaths.The heavy rainfall, which swept the polluted water\xa0upstream, worsened the incident.As of last\xa0December, the provincial People’s Committee spent more than VNĐ12 billion (US$516,000) to support\xa0affected households in Phú Ngọc and La Ngà communes. — VNS",4

Volodin in Moscow on Wednesday as part of her official visit to Russia.Ngân said Việt Nam was delighted at the enormous achievements the Russian people had made to\xa0raise Russia’s stature in the region and the world.The country viewed\xa0parliamentary co-operation as an important field in the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership, she said, adding that it highly valued the State Duma Chairman’s initiative to set up the Inter-Parliamentary Co-operation Committee, which is the highest parliamentary co-operation mechanism recognised by\xa0the Vietnamese NA.The top legislator also applauded the mutual support and close co-ordination between the countries’ parliamentary bodies in the international arena, as well as their active participation in multilateral forums.As Chair of the 41st General Assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly (AIPA), the Vietnamese NA would\xa0continue to promote the strategic partnership between ASEAN and Russia, helping to raise Russia’s standing in the region for peace, stability and development in the world, she said.Ngân also asked both sides to increase exchange and co-operation between their parliaments, step up co-ordination in supervising and promoting the implementation of co-operation agreements signed between the two Governments, and\xa0perfect legal frameworks to help localities, businesses and people to bolster win-win co-operation.Bilateral trade and investment ties had\xa0enjoyed progress since a\xa0free trade agreement was signed\xa0between Việt Nam and the Eurasian Economic Union, of which Russia is a member, that took effect in October 2016. Trade reached US$4.5 billion in 2018, up 30 per cent from 2017, and $3.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019.Meanwhile, partnerships in energy, oil and gas remained an important pillar in economic links, she said, noting that during the visit, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ had held talks with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Kozak to discuss co-operation in this domain and seek ways to tackle difficulties.The leader stressed that room for economic co-operation, trade and investment between the two countries remained\xa0high, and expressed her hope that Russia would\xa0increase co-operation with Việt Nam in the fields it had\xa0advantages in and Việt Nam had\xa0demand for.She thanked Russia for increasing its scholarships for Vietnamese students to 1,000 each year, saying\xa0she hoped\xa0the two legislatures would\xa0facilitate the issuance of visas for Vietnamese citizens.During the talks, Ngân informed her host of the socio-economic situation in Việt Nam, stressing that Việt Nam would\xa0continue to implement its foreign policy of independence, co-operation and development.Việt Nam highly valued\xa0Russia’s stance on the East Sea issue, under which Russia supported\xa0the settlement of differences by peaceful measures\xa0on the basis of international law, including\xa0the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, contributing to the maintenance of peace, stability, freedom, safety and security of navigation and aviation in the East Sea.For his part, the Russian leader said his country attached\xa0importance to the trip made by the NA Chairwoman, during which the two officials co-chaired the first meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Co-operation Committee between the Vietnamese NA and the State Duma of Russia.Under the new\xa0mechanism, the two parliaments would\xa0further enhance their comprehensive strategic partnership, he said.He added that the two countries were capable of achieving\xa0bilateral trade of $10 billion.Volodin also stressed the two sides would try to find out the causes of the decrease in the relations of bilateral trade this year to boost\xa0economic relations and trade and investment, on the basis of which concrete decisions could be made to reach the\xa0$10 billion target. — VNS'",0

The strategy, which has a vision until 2050, \xa0identifies three key tasks – reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting clean and renewable energy, and practising environmentally-friendly production and consumption.The meeting heard that five ministries and 30 cities and provinces in the country had formulated action plans on green growth and were implementing them.\xa0— VNS'",4

CEOs need to proactively ensure that their companies are compliant and send the message that use of illegal software is not acceptable,\xa0and, in fact, puts themselves and their customers at serious risk.”The solution, according to the software industry, involves both stronger enforcement of existing international copyright laws and proactive behaviour on the part of Việt\xa0Nam’s business community. Examples of intensified enforcement include expanded investigations of companies using illegal software.Since January 2018, copyright infringement is a criminal offence in Việt\xa0Nam, with punishment of up to VNĐ3\xa0billion or a two-year suspension of\xa0business licences for commercial entities.“Vietnamese companies can avoid negative consequences by thoroughly and voluntarily auditing software on their computers to ensure they are\xa0all appropriately licensed,” said Sawney. “Doing so will require hands-on efforts from CEOs and C-suite leadership, who have vested interests in protecting their clients’ data, their corporate digital assets, their reputations, and their companies’ financial well-being. That is the idea behind this campaign.”According to BSA, the Vietnamese Government has become a leader in Asia Pacific at taking steps to create a legal and safe digital environment. So far in 2019, relevant departments have conducted dozens of investigations and company inspections in pursuit of this goal, with an estimated 80 to 100 by the year-end.The ""Clean Up to the Countdown"" campaign is part of the ""Legalize and Protect"" initiative launched earlier this year.

They use\xa0the internet not only to communicate but also to provide information. This has\xa0created fierce competition against mainstream news.“As such, press agencies are\xa0not only competing\xa0with each other, but also with their own traditional readership who are using social networking platforms to spread information. While the press needs to verify information, conduct interviews and\xa0collect relevant data to provide\xa0objective information to the public, many organisations and individuals are using\xa0social media accounts to spread unlimited amounts of unchecked and subjective information with only one click, some with negative intentions of making profits and causing social chaos,” Lợi said.\n\nFurthermore, the co-existence of real and fake information across many communication platforms had\xa0made the public lose faith in mainstream news, he said.Addressing the opening ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam, a member of the CPVCC, said in recent years, in the wake of numerous forms of communication\xa0based on modern technologies as well as fast and widespread fake\xa0news, the OANA not only served\xa0as a direct channel to provide information to news organisations and partners but also as a fact checker to help bolster public trust in the traditional press.Đam said since the renewal era, Việt Nam had\xa0made development efforts\xa0which had\xa0been recognised and appreciated by the international community.During that journey, the Vietnamese press had\xa0been standing side by side with the country, he said, adding there were currently almost 100 news organisations in Việt Nam that employed 41,000 workers, of which 19,000 were journalists.“The\xa044th OANA Executive Board Meeting in Hà Nội has significant meaning as it marks the 50 year\xa0the VNA has been part of the OANA. We believe the 44th OANA meeting will bring a breath of fresh air to the development of the organisation as well as member agencies,” Đam said.OANA President Aslan Aslanov, who is also Chairman of the Board of the Azerbaijan State News Agency (AZERTAC), said the VNA was one of the most active members of OANA and its Executive Board.By organising the\xa0meeting and demonstrating its commitment to excellence and professionalism in the news industry, the VNA had once again proved itself to be a\xa0leading media outlet in the region, he said.Fake news stormAccording to VNA Deputy General Director Lê Quốc Minh,\xa0Việt Nam is not an exception in the fake news storm.“It is worrying that Facebook newsfeeds, YouTube channels and Google\xa0are full of fake news, while users naive enough to like and share them, and even the mainstream media runs this\xa0false information,” Minh said.Việt Nam was in the world’s top 10 countries with the largest number of social media users, Minh said, adding that Vietnamese people spend on average 2 hours 37 minutes every day on\xa0social media.According to Minh, thousands of websites were booming to feed hungry audiences with sensational and fake news. When a typhoon was hovering offshore Việt Nam, a number of Facebook users live-streamed videos with captions like “Typhoon No\xa06 Live”, “Typhoon is destroying my home village” or “Typhoon is so horrible”. In fact, they\'d used a video of a typhoon in the Philippines.In June 2016, a number of newspapers and news websites ran a story about an eleven-year-old boy in Gia Lai Province who committed\xa0suicide because he did not have a new T-shirt for the school year. There was no such incident but the massive coverage on mainstream media led to an outcry about\xa0ethnic discrimination.“To regain the audience’s trust in mainstream news, we need to come back to the core values of journalism, professionalism, balance and multi-dimension. Journalists need to verify information carefully, especially amidst the spread of\xa0fake news, and improve the quality of their products, enhance professional ethics, and master new technologies in the working process,” Minh said.OANA president\xa0Aslanov\xa0remained steadfast that members\xa0with their long-standing reputations as premier news services\xa0served as “a\xa0shield” against unverified information and news that plagued and confused\xa0society.“Our principles of identifying and fact-checking before publishing have earned us high confidence. That’s why OANA is truly a team of the most reliable news producers,” he said.“As long as there are news agencies that hold on to the principles of journalism, society can feel safe, because although fake news is widespread, we are capable of retaliating with accurate and reliable news,” Aslanov said.Lee Dong-min, a representative of the Yonhap News Agency, said the Republic of Korea’s media outlets were improving their fact-checking mechanisms to prevent spreading fake news and allowing\xa0readers to decide what the facts were when there were conflicting versions of stories.She spoke about Yonhap’s fact-checking team, which was officially launched in April 2018 as part of the newsroom and its video fact-check service named ""Weekly Fact Check"" to deal with fake news on YouTube. Yonhap had\xa0tried to monitor the spread of fake\xa0news on the internet and distorted articles in the media, Lee said.At the closing ceremony, the Executive Board announced the OANA Award for Excellence in News Agency Quality, which is designed to further experience exchange between OANA members and to improve the quality of making news.The Việt Nam News Agency and Xinhua News Agency (China) shared the first prize for their Chatbot apps on e-newspaper Việt Nam Plus and AI Media Brain.\n\nTASS news agency of Russia won second prize for the\xa0Astronauts database project and the Azertac State News Agency of Azerbaijan secured third prize for its knowledge portal for children Portal.azertag.az.The OANA was established on December 22, 1961 as an initiative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). It aims to facilitate information dissemination and exchange between news agencies in Asia-Pacific – a dynamic region that makes up more than half of the global population.OANA members, including many major agencies, are responsible for two-thirds of information circulated throughout the world.

3253,'The wait is finally over',"'At around 2am on Saturday morning Liverpool will play Norwich City in the opening game of the new Premier League.And let’s be honest, if this season is half as good as last, then we are in for a treat. This time last year I put together a list of my predictions for the season ahead, and not to\xa0sugar coat it, they were rubbish. So time to go again.CHAMPIONS – LiverpoolI know, I know. I sound like a broken record. But let’s be honest here, Liverpool were damn unlucky last season. Losing once and finishing with 97 points would, and should, have been enough to win the league. It would have been enough in just about all the seasons previously in Premier League history. But last time around, it wasn’t to be due to an incredibly strong Manchester City. But, and I accept I’ve been saying this since as far back as I can remember, I think this will be Liverpool’s time. City will have their eyes on another prize which I’ll get to later.TOP FOUR – Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur, ChelseaOnce again I think it will be a two-horse race with City and Liverpool vying for the top spot. As for third place, well sorry to sound boring, but again I will think Tottenham will do it. In Mauricio Pochettino I think Spurs have a first-class coach, and while they have not managed to make any massive signings so far, keeping the manager who led them to the Champions League final last season is amazing. Spurs will improve this year, albeit not enough to win the league. As for the final Champion’s League spot, I fancy Chelsea. Young coach and Stamford Bridge legend Frank Lampard is the right man to get the best out of the team. He just needs a little trust from the usually trigger happy owner, Roman Abramovich.FIFTH AND SIXTH – Arsenal and Manchester UnitedSure, they have both spent heavily in the transfer winder, United signing Harry Maguire for a bank-busting amount of cash and Arsenal splashing\xa0out on striker Nicolas Pepe. Both great players in their own right, but will they be enough to kick-start two teams who massively underperformed last season? No, not in the slightest.FA CUP – EvertonMarco Silva has quietly gone about his business well in the transfer window. Moise Kean has come in from Juventus and midfielders Fabien Delph and Jean-Philippe\xa0Gbamin are both good additions. Everton have also done well to keep hold of Brazilian Richarlison who showed promise last season and will grow this year.LEAGUE CUP – Manchester UnitedUnited are clearly no longer the force they were and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a tough job on his hands rebuilding. Maguire will obviously improve the defence but there are much bigger, deep-rooted problems at Old Trafford. That said, I do think if they get the right draws, United could do well in this second string cup competition. Other teams around them certainly won’t be taking it too seriously as they have much bigger fish to fry. This could be United’s best chance of a trophy.RELEGATION – Newcastle United, Norwich City and Sheffield UnitedOut of the three teams promoted, all but Aston Villa will go straight back down. Villa have that little bit more in the tank I feel to stay up this season but as for the Canaries and the Blades, sorry guys, the Premier League will be a step too far. And I feel it will be Newcastle who will join them dropping out of the top tier. Steve Bruce taking over from Rafa Benitez is a massive disappointment for the Geordie faithful. And while they may possess amazing supporters, it won’t be enough to avoid the inevitable.DARK HORSE – Wolverhampton WanderersLast season Wolves were amazing, qualifying for Europe for the first time since 1981. While I don’t think they will be challenging for any of the major trophies on offer, none of the top teams will fancy away days at Molineux Stadium. Wolves, along with Everton, I feel will be challenging Arsenal and United for a top six\xa0place.CHAMPIONS LEAGUE – Manchester CityWatching Pep Guardiola pace up and down looking as cool as they come in his white t-shirt and cargo pants in Sunday’s Community Shield, I thought to myself this year could be his year to finally lift with City the one trophy that’s eluded him, the Champions League. As the season goes on, I feel City will more and more concentrate on lifting Europe’s top prize. And who would bet against them facing Pep’s old club Barcelona in Istanbul next year? Not me. — VNS'",3
2575,'Smart city challenges Gov’t and localities',"'by Thu GiangHÀ NỘI — In efforts to embrace the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), cities and provinces in Việt Nam are pushing smart city programmes, combining technology with internet-connected devices to enhance municipal management and economy.Smart cities, with new technologies and integration based on sensor collection and analysis of data, are expected to drive economic, environmental and social benefits in many cities and provinces in Việt Nam – optimising traffic flows in real time, reducing energy consumption and automating waste management.However, despite the countless benefits of smart city projects, major cities including Hà Nội and HCM City, which are pioneering in this field, are facing difficulties and challenges when it comes to deployment due to city-specific requirements and needs of new policies and regulations from the Government and relevant sectors.Speaking at the Industry 4.0 summit\xa0held in Hà Nội last week, Deputy Chairman of HCM City Trần Vĩnh Tiến said the city had been building its smart city project for two years with consultation from VNPT and Viettel Group. The city has gathered experience from many cities around the world and discovered that smart cities are different.“From East Asia to South Asia, from the US to Europe, all smart cities are different. We are advised that we should conduct a smart city project suited to the characteristics of the city because the application of Industry 4.0 will solve specific problems of each city such as traffic congestion, flooding and environmental pollution,” Tiến said.However, to develop it, Tiến said the city would need\xa0an information centre allowing interaction among local authorities, businesses and people. In which, the State and businesses would be able to exploit each other’s data while people could share contributions and ideas. All of these interaction must be digital.Therefore, the Government should build a legal corridor for data management soon.“The data area is even more important than land. If we want to manage the data area effectively and synchronously we need to have a legal corridor.”Tiến also proposed the Government set up a smart city architectural blueprint for all cities and provinces nationwide, ensuring synchronisation – which is the most basic principle of technology – and efficiency.“In addition, as the Government has approved the digitalisation project, we want to volunteer. If we do not digitalise, technology of the city will be not effective,” Tiến added.According to Deputy Chairman of Hà Nội People’s Committee Ngô Văn Quý, Hà Nội is building an e-government and smart city. It has achieved some initial results in the construction of information infrastructure, applying corporate information, State management and residential data, moving towards a smart city model, including smart transport and travel.“During the implementation process, there are several problems that need to be solved. We lack standards relevant to the building of e-government and smart cities. The Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) has developed this content, but it is not yet completed. It should be issued as soon as possible,” Quý said.Regarding information application, Quý wanted the Government to build software for localities from the central to the grassroots level. “If each locality researches and develops their own software, it is wasteful while causing difficulties in integration and connectivity. Recently, I saw some very good implementations, such as corporate management software of the Ministry of Planning and Investment and software to manage drugstore and pharmacies of the Ministry of Health.”Technology solutions are just a part of the smart city programme, Quý said, adding that the capital city is facing shortages in human resources. The general trend of qualified information technology (IT) staff is moving to work for non-State enterprises, which pay a higher salary.“We expect the State to have special policies to encourage IT staff to work for the State management agencies, building e-government and smart cities,” Quý said.According to the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC), smart cities are the basic driving force for socio-economic development of the nation and regions across the country. Việt Nam has more than 830 urban areas with the urbanisation rate of 38.6 per cent.Economic growth in urban areas averages 12-15 per cent, 1.5-2 times higher than the national average. About 30 cities and provinces nationwide have implemented smart urban construction projects, including HCM City and Hà Nội.However, according to MIC the current development of smart cities is still inadequate. Some localities have started deploying some basic applications and services for smart cities. Meanwhile, ministries and agencies continue to research and complete building guidelines, mechanisms and policies for smart cities.Deputy Minister of MIC Nguyễn Thành Hưng asked localities to see the development of e-government as a key factor to building smart cities, in addition to ensuring cyber security.“We should select capable businesses to organise the implementation of smart city projects. Lastly, it’s essential to develop human resources suitable for a smart city. It is indispensable for leaders who have decisive vision and qualified human resources to operate technology solutions in smart cities,” Hưng said. — VNS'",2

863,'ASEAN urged to uphold communal identity',"'HÀ NỘI — Whichever country holds the ASEAN chairmanship must take the lead in consolidating the bloc’s identity and enhancing its adaptability in a changing world, said Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyễn Văn Thảo yesterday.“Taking the role of ASEAN 2020 Chairman demonstrates Việt Nam’s responsibility and is an opportunity for the country to make contributions to the ASEAN Community,” Thảo said at workshop on the ASEAN community, which Việt Nam is set to chair next year. “Việt Nam attaches great importance to making careful preparation for the chairmanship.”The workshop, held by the Diplomatic Academy of Việt Nam and Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), drew the participation of more than 100 experts and diplomats from Việt Nam and ASEAN member states to discuss the ASEAN Community’s identity and role in the changing world.Thảo said that over the more than 50 years since its creation, ASEAN had demonstrated its important role for each member state, Southeast Asia as a whole and the Indo-Asia Pacific regionASEAN’s identity had been shaped to realise the primary target of building a people-centred, united community as stated in ASEAN Community Vision towards 2025, Thảo said, adding that the organisation’s identity acted as a “glue” connecting the peoples of its member states. ASEAN’s central role was to maintain regional peace and stability and assure member states have a powerful voice in global issues to protect their own interests.“The identity and centrality have become two key elements that will determine ASEAN’s vitality and growth prospects in the future,” he said. “Preserving ASEAN identity and fostering its central role requires active engagement of all member states at both inter-Governmental and national levels.”Marty Natalegawa, former Indonesian Foreign Affair Minister told the workshop there were two critical, challenging areas ASEAN must deal with. They were the nexus between internal and external domains – the national and regional – and the nexus between the regional and global domains.ASEAN’s relevance in managing the internal and external nexus could not be ensured simply by the adoption of formal declarations and agreements. It required the development of a co-operative outlook between member states that could only be accomplished through deliberate development of state practice, he said.Participants agreed that in the context of unstable world affairs, ASEAN should concentrate on fostering internal power by taking advantage of the more than 600-million-population and fostering intra-bloc liberalisation. It could do this by shifting growth models and reducing reliance on the young labour force and depleting natural resources, former deputy prime minister Vũ Khoan said.To ensure ASEAN’s goal of creating a caring community that puts people at the centre, Peter Girke, country representative of KAS in Việt Nam, said: “We must involve people more, listen better and keep in mind that the purpose of politics is for people. Only this can assure long-term success for a regional bloc like the EU and the same is true for ASEAN.”Việt Nam had built a strong community at home, but it was also an active player in regional and global affairs. The country was open to learning from past experiences and international best practices, he said. These experiences would benefit ASEAN when Việt Nam takes the chairmanship. — VNS'",0

In general, Việt Nam’s agricultural economy had been developing on the right track.“With only total cultivation area of 10 million hectares, the country had produced 4.5 million tonnes of food, 5.5 million tonnes of meat and 8 million tonnes of fish,” he said.However, the biggest shortcoming of the sector was processing and consumption.“If this is not fixed, the problem of ‘bumper crops but low prices’ would repeat themselves again and again,” he said.Pepper was an example. In recent years, in the Tây Nguyên (Central Highlands) provinces, the crop had been overproduced.Việt Nam produced 350,000 tonnes of pepper every year, accounting for 60 per cent of the world’s output.""That was too much,"" Cường said, adding that therefore, in the future, it was necessary to find solutions to re-organise production in terms of production chains and enhancement of processing and consumption.The minister would continue his Q&A session in the afternoon. — VNS'",0

It is followed by the northeastern mountainous region and the Tây Nguyên (Central Highlands) region.\nThe southeastern region has the lowest poverty rate, with less than 1 per cent.\nThu said that a national database should be created to unify all information related to the programme on multi-dimensional poverty standards.\n“Localities should build poverty-reduction policies and integrate them into their socio-economic development plans, depending on each locality\'s condition,” she said.\nCommunication activities should also be improved to raise public awareness about sustainable poverty-reduction goals, multi-dimensional standards, and the multi-dimensional poverty line.\nLò Thị Đức of the Việt Nam General Statistics Office\'s Social and Environmental Statistics Department said that multidimensional measures should focus on education, healthcare, clean water and sanitation, better access to information, and social security services.\n“Multi-dimensional poverty criteria, measurement and standards should be simple to identify and measure,” she said.\nVương Phương Nam, vice chairman of Bạc Liêu Province’s People’s Committee, said: “Many of the solutions applying multidimensional poverty standards are contributing to the province’s sustainable poverty reduction.""\nLast year, the province spent VNĐ26.5 billion (US$1.14 million) to support 7,400 poor households, offering financial support, providing seedlings and breeding varieties, and instructing them in production models and livelihood diversification.\n“Most households have escaped from poverty in a sustainable way,” Nam said.\nThe province also used VND1.5 billion (US$546,500) to offer a year of health insurance for people who escaped poverty to ensure that they remained in good health.\nHowever, difficulties still exist in poverty reduction.

1597,'Non-agricultural cooperatives struggle to receive loans',"'HA NỘI — Less than 20 per cent of cooperatives are financially independent while access to credit and capital remains limited, accounting for under 1 per cent.The issues were raised by Phạm Công Bằng, director of the Central Cooperative Assistance Development Fund, at Monday’s national conference to review the 15-year implementation of Resolution No\xa013-NQ / TW on the renewal, development and improvement of collective economic efficiency in the non-agricultural sector, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ.According to Phan Huy Sự, director of Nhơn Trạch Transport Cooperative which has nearly 6,000 cars and some 10,000 workers, their demand for capital to pay for fuel, wages and other expenses is huge.However, it is difficult to get access to preferential loans.“To solve urgent needs, some members have to seek black credit and receive payday loans which negatively impact their income,” said Sự.Acknowledging the situation, Nguyễn Kim Anh, State Bank of Việt Nam Deputy Governor, said people’s credit funds did not effectively implement lending activities and kept interest rates high, restraining their role of connecting and supporting cooperatives.Nguyễn Văn Thịnh, deputy head of Việt Nam Cooperative Alliance, said Việt Nam had more than 64,000 non-agricultural collective groups and 23 non-agricultural cooperative alliances. Most of them are unable to get access to loans offered by commercial banks as they fail to meet terms and procedures.Bằng stressed upon capital as the biggest obstruction to cooperatives, making it impossible for cooperatives to expand their businesses.“Cooperatives might be exposed to the threat of bankruptcy when unable to pay back a loan. The barrier is also set for those who want to apply the latest technologies. Once the challenge remains, there will be no transition to supply chain and sustainable development,” said Bằng.The fund has granted more than 5,700 loans for non-agricultural cooperatives with some VNĐ6 trillion (US$258 million). The average loan interest rate is 5.4 per cent.“The Government needs to offer transport cooperatives preferential loans to ease financial burdens, promote productivity, raise incomes and help cooperatives develop sustainably,” said Sự.Sharing the opinion, deputy transport minister Nguyễn Nhật, urged the Government to support cooperatives, especially investing in transport infrastructure.“It is essential to upgrade and develop domestic waterway and road systems, creating a logistics network to reduce transport costs and boost cooperatives,” said Nhật.“Enhancing administrative reforms will also help cooperatives and their members to conveniently access assistance mechanisms and policies,” he added.Speaking at the event, Deputy PM Huệ asked related ministries and agencies to develop and efficiently implement policies to encourage the development of cooperatives.By 2018, Việt Nam had 64,081 non-agricultural collective groups with more than 665,000 members and 23 cooperative alliances, a rise of 16 compared to 2003.There are some 8,700 non-agricultural cooperatives with nearly 3,200 million members and total charter capital of VNĐ18.4 trillion ($791.2 million).

About 2,167 organised crimes had been discovered and 137 victims of human trafficking had been rescued.\n“The investigation of cases under the direction of the Central Steering Committee on Anti-Corruption has been accelerated to meet the schedule,” Vương said.\n“Difficulties in asset evaluation have been solved as well as assessment of evidence, identifying crimes and recovering assets.”\nHowever, despite a decline in the number of criminal cases, an increase in complicated crimes and rampant violations in land planning, management and use have become a new challenge for law enforcement across the country, Vương said.\nAccording to Vương, the number of murders has increased. Many murders or intentional attacks were carried out by people with mental illness or those affected by the use of drugs, causing concern among the public. New methods of human trafficking have been recorded, including surrogacy or foetus trafficking.\nEconomic crimes and corruption have become more sophisticated and occurred in many sectors, with the use of high technology to dodge tax or lengthen toll collection at Build-Operate-Transfer booths.\nPetty corruption in settling administrative procedures still took place in many localities, causing outrage for residents and enterprises.\nViolations relating to land planning, use and management were also common, he said, saying it was the main reason leading to long-standing disputes.\nWhile agreeing with the government’s report, NA deputies pointed out shortcomings in crime prevention and combat and made proposals to increase the effectiveness of the work in the future.\nNguyễn Duy Hữu, a member of the NA’s Judicial Committee, proposed the Government strengthen the handling of violations of environmental laws. Although this kind of crime left long-term consequences and took a lot of time to recover, the criminal penalty was far too lenient. Most of the cases only received administrative punishments.\nHoàng Văn Hùng, an NA deputy, said although traffic accidents had declined in the number of cases, injuries and deaths, about 22 people died each day on average.\nThe deputy suggested the government set forth preventive solutions.\nThe punishments for violations relating to traffic safety regulations should be tightened, he said.\nMany NA deputies proposed that measures to enhance the competence of State management, inspection work in construction, commerce and information and technology to restrict violations as well as detect and strictly deal with crimes in these fields.

Fortunately they were two stories that went my way.""Aguero confirmed, but not MessiScaloni was giving little away about his team selection, although he\'s expected to stick with much the same line-up as beat Venezuela 2-0 in the quarter-finals.That means Messi and Aguero would line up alongside Lautaro Martinez in attack.""Aguero will play, I\'m saying that because I\'ve read there\'s a doubt, so to be clear,"" said Scaloni.That\'s as far as he would go, though.""No-one\'s confirmed for the team, not even Messi. Only Aguero,"" he added.Aguero has had a mixed tournament so far, having a quiet game in the opening 2-0 defeat to Colombia before he was dropped for the 1-1 draw with Paraguay.But he made a goalscoring return to the starting line-up in the 2-0 defeat of Qatar and was involved in both Argentina\'s goals against Venezuela.Little was expected of Argentina before the tournament but they have been improving and this clash between the continent\'s two heavyweights is eagerly anticipated.The pressure, though, is on Brazil ""because they\'re the hosts and have something to prove in front of their fans,"" said Scaloni.Although he said they were at an advantage as ""they\'ve been together a long time with the same coach and players who\'ve played together for a long time.""Argentina, on the other hand, are in a period of transition since their dismal 2018 World Cup exit, with several new and inexperienced players in the squad, as well as a new coach. \xa0AFP'",3

2629,'Exchange rate management policy proves\xa0effective',"HÀ NỘI The State Bank of Việt Nam (SBV)'s exchange rate management policy has been appropriate and effective, creating benefits for the economy and confidence for the market.Speaking at a press conference held in Hà Nội on Tuesday to review the performance of the banking industry in the third quarter of 2019, SBV’s Governor Đào Minh Tú said the assessment was made by members of the National Monetary Policies Council in its recent meeting.While countries worldwide devalued or appreciated their currencies sharply, the SBV had kept the local currency relatively stable, with the management policy based on the overall balance of the economy such as import and export, public debt, balance of payments and current accounts, Tú said.Reports from the SBV showed currently, the foreign exchange rate in the domestic market is relatively stable, increasing and decreasing slightly in comparison with the large fluctuations of currencies around the world.Specifically, on the first two days of this week, the USD Index on the international market increased continuously to reach a two-year record high of 99.2 points. However, in the domestic market, the exchange rate at commercial banks only increased and decreased slightly.According to the nine-month economic report by the General Statistics Office, despite big economic changes in many countries, including the US Federal Reserve (Fed)’s decision to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in mid-September, the USD/VNĐ exchange rate did not fluctuate significantly thanks to the SBV’s flexible exchange rate management policy. Specifically, the dollar depreciated slightly by just 0.11 per cent against the previous month, 0.49 per cent against December 2018 and 0.39 per cent against the same period in 2018.As a result, the domestic market liquidity has been ensured while foreign currency transactions have been conducted promptly and smoothly. It has also helped the central bank net buy dollars to build up the nation’s foreign reserves.According to Tú, many people think that the Vietnamese đồng needs to be devalued to support exports as they are slowing. However, Tú said, the slowdown is seen with all countries and it isn’t feasible to use exchange rates as a tool to promote exports as import volume – mainly materials and equipment to produce goods for export – is also very large.In the future, Tú said the SBV would conduct open market operations and regulate the credit institution's liquidity at a reasonable level to stabilise the monetary market.It would also combine other monetary policy instruments and take flexible market interventions to stabilise the foreign exchange market, which would contribute to stabilising the macro-economy and supporting reasonable economic growth and build up the nation’s foreign reserves when there are favourable conditions, Tú said.

Howard Hunt (Harrelson) and G. Gordon Liddy (Theroux), the administration officials who coordinated the effort.After five of their men were arrested, Hunt and Liddy were snared and eventually given stiff prison terms.The fallout from the Watergate arrests, together with Nixon's attempt to obstruct the investigation, led to his resignation in August 1974, before his impeachment proceedings could reach their conclusion.The Watergate scandal is familiar fodder for American movies and television series, the most famous being Alan Pakula's 1976 film All the President's Men, which won four Oscars.Harrelson, who starred in HBO's True Detective, has been nominated for three Oscars. Theroux starred in HBO's The Leftovers. — AFP",5

4887,'German artist inspired by Truyện Kiều displays work',"'An exhibition entitled A Girl Named K… displaying works by German\xa0artist Franca Bartholomai is running at the Goethe Institute until\xa0October\xa027.She was inspired by Vietnamese epic Truyện Kiều (The Tale of Kiều) to create a wall installation of woodcuts and papercuts that offers a whole new view of\xa0the time-honoured epic.Wilfried Eckstein, director of the Goethe Institute in Hà Nội, interviews Bartholomai about the new take on\xa0Truyện Kiều.The exhibition A Girl Named K... is a reflection of your personal approach to the epic Truyện Kiều (The Tale of Kiều). What challenges did you encounter as you processed the literary work?The text immediately spoke to me. Its visual language was very much in tune with my own:\xa0metaphor-heavy imagery.But that was also exactly the challenge. I carry strong, very intense images inside of me, some of which have been with me since childhood.It is not always easy for me to open this distinct inner world of mine to alien, external influences. But fortunately, there is some overlap with my world, such as the prophetic dream motif at the beginning, or the conflict between fate and personal freedom, between duty and true love.As you conceived your artwork, how did you create a synthesis between the enchanting language of Nguyễn Du and the gloom of its plot?I actually didn’t find the text gloomy, but rather – what should I call it –“realistic”? Kiều experiences awful things.Sometimes you think it can’t get any worse, but then it does. But there are always moments of hope, of improvement, and in the end, she even returns home to her family and her lover.It seems as if her life is destroyed and her soul broken. But she lives, and her dignity remains unscathed,\xa0despite, or rather, because of her dire fate, even despite the desperation to which she surrendered herself to.The book does not sugarcoat anything. Life is hard, often cruel, but yet small islands of happiness are always possible.This“realism”, which is what I call it for lack of a better term, is in stark contrast with artful language, which sounds even “florid” to the European reader.But this contradiction is precisely what makes the epic so appealing to me - beautiful language to talk about ugliness. Overcoming, sublimating the bad with beauty. This is perhaps the goal, the ideal of all art: to transform evil into beauty.The medium of woodblock printing is at the center of your artistic work. To what extent does this medium lend itself to the lyrical language of Kiều?I have already touched on the basic idea. I find contradictions artistically appealing. The point where notions start “grinding” against one another is the point where things get interesting. There is something collage-like about disparities colliding, and I generally like that. It creates a tension that opens the mind and sharpens the senses.Which works/figures did you enjoy the most - and which have taken the most time\xa0and effort?It is difficult to say. In retrospect, I find that I enjoyed all of it. I like to work. There is no other place where I feel safer and more at ease with myself than at work.The biggest challenge for me was and still is the long journey, because I have a deep fear of flying.What relationship do you see between Kiều and the reality women face today in a social or artistic context?This question triggers a veritable cascade of thoughts in me, which I’m afraid is too much to discuss in this context.Undoubtedly, times have changed - in Asia as well as in the European western world. No woman today must apathetically be subordinate to her parents or husband. For Kiều, that was a matter of course.On the other hand, unfortunately, there are still enough situations where women are much worse off than men.Leadership positions are still mainly filled by men. Works by female artists are statistically worth less than those of their male colleagues. Neither reverse discrimination nor gender-support programmes will change that. Perhaps they are even counterproductive because they institutionalise the “small difference”.What were your first impressions of\xa0Truyện Kiều?At first, it takes 21st-century European reader a little while to get used to the style. It is a verse epic, very artificial, and the metaphor-rich language seems almost “florid”.But the content is not. The woman’s fate is difficult, full of unpredictable twists. It is an exciting read from the first to the last line. And it is precisely the remarkable linguistic imagery that triggered something in me and that found its way into my work.Which aspect of the epic did you focus on in your work?That is difficult to say, because when I absorb books or pictures, I always tend to let the totality of them\xa0sink in and I don’t focus on any specific aspects.I’m concerned with moods, with feelings – in this case, primarily with the coexistence of despair and devotion, of duty and love.Kiều may submit to her fate and it almost breaks her, but there are always moments when she improves her situation thanks to her poetic and musical talent.Rescue, even salvation, through art, creativity and invention is a beautiful and comforting thought that really hit home with me.

1430,'Revised Labour Code needs to promote rights of female labourers',"HÀ NỘI — The revised Labour Code is expected to be submitted to the National Assembly for approval this month. However, major changes to\xa0the law are still under discussion in an attempt to ensure gender equality and enhance\xa0the development of female workers.An increase to the\xa0retirement age, the promotion of support related to childcare and fair payment for female workers are among the controversial issues.Nguyễn Thị Thu, a female worker at Garment 10 Company in Hà Nội’s Gia Lâm District, said she had\xa0been enjoying\xa0support\xa0policies for female workers, especially during maternity and motherhood,\xa0at her workplace.Thu and\xa0other female workers are allowed to take\xa0days off when their children are sick, among the other benefits. However, the increase in the retirement age, which has been raised from 55 to 60 for female workers in the draft revised Labour Code, is\xa0not good for her.Thu said garment workers had to stand up at\xa0work for nearly eight hours per day, so she didn't think she'd be healthy enough to work until she reached 60. The policy should be flexible for\xa0different careers, she said.Bùi Đức Thịnh, chairman of Sông Hồng Garment Joint Stock Company in northern Nam Định Province,\xa0told Nông thôn\xa0ngày nay (Countryside Today) newspaper that the increased\xa0retirement age could help solve the ageing population problem and the shortage of jobs in the future. However, it would create difficulties for labourers and enterprises in the garment industry.The life expectancy of labourers who produce\xa0garments is very low. Most can\xa0only work until they are 45 as their health is not good enough to continue the job.The increase in the retirement age would put female labourers in a difficult situation as enterprises did not\xa0want to hire old and weak employees, he said.Thịnh said there were more than 10,000 labourers working at his company. Of that, nearly 80 per cent were\xa0women.Policies on gender equality would have a great impact on the production and business\xa0of the company, he said.The regulation related to childcare has also caused\xa0concerns.Nguyễn Xuân Dương, chairman of Hưng Yên Province’s Textile and Garment Association, said\xa0allowing female workers a 30 minute break when they were on their periods\xa0would affect the workflow and\xa0reduce productivity, especially for those who worked on a\xa0production line.Professor\xa0Giang Thanh Long of the National Economics University said parental leave provisions should be applied for both female and male workers. Both female and male workers should be eligible for time off related to childcare as a way of promoting shared\xa0family responsibilities.Fair payment is another issue that needs to be looked at, Long said. \xa0The draft law should ensure a fair assessment of work efficiency and salaries\xa0for male and female workers in the same jobs.Thu, the garment worker, agreed, saying she hoped female workers would be paid the same as men in the same jobs.Bùi Sĩ Lợi, vice chairman of the National Assembly’s Committee for Social Affairs, said there were always different opinions on the\xa0issues, but it was necessary to prioritise the interests of female workers.Although some contents of the draft could affect female workers' productivity, they should be included to ensure\xa0the best interests of female workers.The break time during menstruation was an example, he said. Employers and employees could negotiate if the provision affected the job. In case employees could not have a break as stipulated, employers must compensate for employees.The increase in the retirement age, according to Lợi, was necessary and should be implemented step by step.Currently, 36 per cent of the member countries of the International Labour Organisation have\xa0applied a\xa0retirement age of 62 for male workers and 60 for female workers.Nguyễn Văn Bình, deputy head of the Ministry of Labour, Invalid and Social Affairs’ Legal Department, who is also a member of the drafting committee, said the committee had\xa0collected a wide range of\xa0opinions and adjusted the draft accordingly to ensure\xa0the benefits of workers, enterprises and the country.The committee will\xa0finalise the revised law to submit to the 8th\xa0session of the 14th\xa0National Assembly, which begins on Monday.

189,'Long Thành international airport will operate by 2025: transport minister',"'Watch our video to see the plan for the new airportMinister of transport Nguyễn Văn Thể, on behalf of the Prime Minister, made the statement on Thursday as he presented the report on the feasibility study for the airport’s first phase. The study will be reviewed by the National Assembly (NA) during the ongoing 8th session of the 14th tenure held in Hà Nội.The planned airport, situated near its namesake township in the southern province of Đồng Nai, is a national key project and expected to become a major international aviation hub in the region when it becomes operational,\xa0Thể said.The first phase of the project costs an estimated VNĐ111.689 trillion or about US$4.779 billion, a little lower than the previously NA-approved figure of $4.782 billion, with ground clearance costs not yet accounted for.According to the report, the project is made up of three investment phases with the ultimate goal of making the airport capable of serving 100 million passengers and handling 5 million tonnes of goods a year.In the first phase of the project, one runway and one terminal will be built, together with other components.Chair of the NA’s Economic Committee, which was charged with assessing the Government’s report, said that many NA deputies want the Government to add another runway to the first phase of the project, to make sure that if any incident were to occur, traffic at the airport\'s operation would not be disrupted.However, the committee still gave the nod to the Government’s plan on the first phase\xa0but asked that the Government quickly formulate the second and third phases of the projects.The Government has also requested the NA to approve its plan to assign the State-owned Airports Corporation of Việt Nam (ACV) JSC as the main investor for Long Thành international airport right away, instead of going through open bidding as stipulated in the Law on Investment.“Carrying open bidding and weighing which investors to choose will certainly cost us another 1.5-2 years, while truth be told, there couldn’t possibly be any company other than ACV who has the experience, the capacity, and can satisfy the demands for the insurance of national security in a highly important project like Long Thành international airport,” Thể told the parliament.According to the Government’s plan, ACV will be the investor and operator of the airport, who will use its own capital to invest into the construction of the State management administrative building and essential component buildings of the airport.ACV can make use of concession contracts to partner up with private businesses to carry out service components of the airport.For construction components that are meant for air navigation management, the Government plans to assign the State-owned Việt Nam Air Traffic Management Corporation (VATM) to be the investor since this is the only company that is allowed to provide air navigation management services.LoansACV expects to contribute about $1.566 billion in capital in the 2019-25 period, or 37 per cent of the total investment for the first phase of the airport project, with the remaining $2.628 billion coming from loans.So far, ACV has worked with 12 foreign and domestic credit organisations and signed memorandums of understanding (MoU) to secure loans of $5 billion, with the borrowing term set for 15 years, a grace period of 5 years and an annual interest of 5-5.5 per cent.The Government said the loans would not raise public debt level since there’s no official development aid involved. But the NA’s Economic Committee is concerned that since this is a project guaranteed by the Government, meaning that any cost overruns or financial problems met by ACV then the Government will have the responsibility to resolve them and the loans will certainly add to the rising amount of public debt, hindering efforts to keep it at manageable level.Therefore, the committee asked the Government to fully assess the risks posed to public debt as a result of this plan.VATM, on the other hand, reportedly could contribute\xa0VNĐ2.125 trillion\xa0and intends to borrow the remaining VNĐ1.110 trillion from Vietnamese commercial banks, with interest of 11 per cent a year.Law on Cadres and Civil ServantsOn the same day, legislators discussed amendments and supplements to\xa0the Law on Cadres and Civil Servants and the\xa0Law on Public Employees.The\xa0issues included officials\' appointment policies, punishment for those who have retired or resigned, and policies targeting talented people, among others.Deputy Tô Văn Tám from Kon Tum Province said current appointment procedures for ministries’ officials and cadres lack transparency.""In fact, there are cases where a young cadre is appointed, a usual question would pop up from the public: \'Who are her or his parents?\'. It implies that people lack\xa0trust in the integrity of appointing procedures,” Tám said.He said that, in principle, all civil servants have the same opportunities for promotion, regardless of their background.“The problem here is the need to be open and transparent in the process of appointing staff. Therefore, it is essential to supplement the draft regulations on issues of openness and transparency in appointing individuals to the selected titles so people have full information. Based\xa0on such, people can exercise their rights in supervising cadres appointing procedures,” he said.Regarding regulations on punishment for retired or resigned officials who violated State laws, Deputy Nguyễn Văn Hiển suggested either reducing or cutting off permanently the pensions of such officials and cadres. The favourable\xa0policies these retired officials enjoyed should also be reduced or cut off, for instance, their titles, medals and\xa0orders, Hiển said.Hiển said he had consulted German experience on this matter, according to which retired public servants are still responsible for their violations when they were in office and disciplinary measures are to reduce and remove permanent pensions.At the same time, the legal consequence is that the disciplined person will no longer have the right to introduce and be introduced as the former Minister, Deputy Minister, etc.According to the draft, talented people in public duties are cadres and civil servants with outstanding professional capacity, making great and effective contributions to agencies, organisations and units. The State has a policy to reward those who are talented in public service.Deputy Nguyễn Quang Tuấn from Hà Nội, said talented people need a good training environment to develop well. However, he also said talented people who do not have integrity might not be of much help to the country.“There are people with talent\xa0but who only want to do good for themselves and not for the community. So I think the definition of \'talented people\'\xa0has to be more precise – they have to have talent, but they also have to have integrity, enthusiasm and devotion to contribute to the nation’s development,” Tuấn said.Minister of Home Affairs Lê Vĩnh Tân said it was rather difficult to give a comprehensive definition for “talented people” in many fields in the context of their possibile contributions to the country, so the draft only refer to them as those who are “talented in public services”. — VNS'",0

3771,'HCM City to fill in wells to prevent land subsidence',"'HCM CITY A number of wells that have been supplying large quantities of water in HCM City are being filled up since the city’s 100,000 or so wells have been identified as one of the main reasons for land subsidence.On June 21, for instance, the well at Nguyễn Đăng Dương’s home on Nguyễn Văn Đậu Street in Bình Thạnh District was closed by workers from the Gia Định Water Supply Company.The well provided water for Dương’s family for over 15 years. He said when he dug the well there was no water supply in his house.“Now that clean water is available I accepted the proposal to fill in the well to prevent ground collapses and prevent groundwater pollution.”The Gia Định Water Supply Company\xa0has been entrusted with closing 17,000 wells in districts 3, Bình Thạnh, Phú Nhuận, and Gò Vấp.Nguyễn Văn Đắng, its director, said the company has collaborated with district authorities to persuade people living in these districts to fill their wells and use tap water instead.Đắng said the company plans to fill up some 2,000 wells this year and 3,000 drilled next year, and 12,000 families would switch from groundwater to tap water between 2021 and 2025.The company provides a subsidy of VNĐ1.2 million to a household that fills up its well.Bùi Thanh Giang, deputy general director of the Sài Gòn Water Corporation (Sawaco), said the company has pledged to reduce the volume of groundwater used per day from the current 100,000cu.m to 30,000cu.m by 2025.To achieve these targets while ensuring supply of clean water to households, Sawaco will use water from new facilities like the Thủ Đức Water Plant No 3 and Tân Hiệp Water Plant No 2, which provide a total of 600,000cu.m a day.However, it will take several years to fill in the existing drilled wells, while huge investments are required to build the pipeline networks to bring clean water to the city’s residents.Giang said his company has a road map for reducing the use of groundwater: 90,000cu.m per day this year, down 10 per cent from 2018; 70,000cu.m in 2020, and 49,456cu.m between 2021 and 2023.It would also cut the use of groundwater at the Tân Phú Plant to 33,000cu.m per day this year and 30,000cu.m by 2025, he added.In addition to filling up wells, other solutions are also required to prevent ground subsidence, according to Trần Văn Tường, a HCM City Engineer, who said construction of high-rise buildings on weak foundations is another reason for it.Filling wells is much easier than shoring up high-rise buildings built on weak foundations, he pointed out.Official agencies must be firm in rejecting applications for building high-rise buildings and drawing ground water for household use in vulnerable areas, he said.Reservoirs should be built to store water and groundwater must be carefully managed, he said.For the long term authorities must conduct studies on wastewater treatment so that it could be used again after treatment, he added.

Both moves were designed to protect the natural landscapes of the UNESCO site.Chairman of the Quảng Ninh People’s Council Nguyễn Xuân Ký said that by\xa02030, all of the cement plants would be moved to more suitable places.

Her family was listed as a poor household.Her husband worked\xa0as a building worker with an income of about VNĐ120,000 (US$5.2) per day.Her first daughter suffers\xa0from cerebral palsy. She is 10 years old now, but is bedridden and often cries all night, making\xa0Thắm’s life very hard.After Thắm got married, she stayed at home to take care of their daughter.Thắm believed the\xa0safe fruit and vegetables she grew in her garden were the healthiest option for her child, and\xa0she often used the gấc fruits\xa0to make\xa0soup and cakes for her.One winter, Thắm used the\xa0oil from a ripe gấc fruit\xa0to sooth\xa0her chapped\xa0lips, and that gave her the inspiration to start making lipstick from the fruit.Thắm discussed her idea with her older sister, Khuất Thị Duyên, who thought it was a good idea.Thắm set her idea into motion in 2016, but everything was very difficult to start with.“I tested hundreds of different samples, but they either broke or were too rough on the lips,” said Thắm.Thắm tried adding more materials to the lipstick such as vitamin E and beeswax, and at last she was successful.With the established trademark\xa0K’Duyen Lipstick, Thắm and her older sister have made thousands of products.Each lip balm\xa0is sold for\xa0VNĐ50,000-80,000 ($2.1-3.4), while the\xa0coloured lipsticks go for\xa0VNĐ120,000 ($5.2).Without any added preservatives,\xa0 the products can last for up to\xa0six months once opened.This year, the Hà Nội Women’s Union launched a\xa0competition themed “Creative ideas for a start-up”, and Thắm's lipstick from the fruit\xa0was chosen as one of 10 most creative products.“The recognition is a great motivation\xa0for me to continue making better lipsticks,” said Thắm.“For me, the lipsticks are\xa0not only a product, they are a bright dream helping my life become more meaningful,” she said.Sharing Thắm’s joy, Nguyễn Thị Thu was also awarded at the event on Monday to honour the businesswomen.Thu, 29, lives in Khánh Hà Commune, Thường Tín District.Starting with a passion for\xa0medicinal herbs and aspiring to enrich the community in her hometown, in July 2017\xa0Thu founded the Tâm An Co-operative with six colleagues. The co-operative's goal was to\xa0make\xa0tea from medicinal herbs\xa0and grow\xa0clean vegetables using\xa0organic fertiliser.Thu said that medicinal herbals sources in Việt Nam were abundant and diversified. They were easy to plant and care for. Each plant had its own strong point and economic value, so she decided to make use of them in\xa0her products.At first, the co-operative sold the herbs to pharmaceutical companies in Hà Nội and neighbouring provinces.Then it invested in a production line to make tea with the trademark Tâm An.The co-operative now has more than 1ha of medicinal herbs on what used to be a rice field. The area had subsided so rice productivity was low, she explained.Now the land has rich economic benefits.Tâm An tea is now\xa0sold in\xa0big supermarkets across\xa0Hà Nội such as Lotte, Aeon\xa0and Vinmart.Besides, the co-operative plants seasonal vegetables using organic fertiliser on a 1.800sq.m\xa0field.“Organic agriculture is a sector with great potential, so\xa0the co-operative is\xa0trying its best to take advantage of that,” said Thu.Making progress togetherAt the awards ceremony, Lê Kim Anh, chairwoman of the Hà Nội Women’s Union, praised the women's efforts, creativity and talent, saying they had enriched themselves and the community.The ceremony took place in Hà Nội on Monday to mark the anniversary\xa0of the Vietnam Women’s Union, which will fall on Sunday.The 10 women to receive awards had taken the initiative to create\xa0different products including silk towels, cloth bags, organic rice and leaf hats.Anh said the winners\xa0represented women of the capital city, who always contributed to the cause of economic development for equality and women's empowerment.The union would continue to create good conditions for women to shine, she said. — VNS",1
2374,'Việt Nam set to be among top ten remittance receivers in 2019',"'HÀ NỘI Việt Nam was expected to remain one of the top ten remittance receivers in 2019, according to the latest edition of the World Bank’s Migration and Development Brief released recently.A sum of US$16.7 billion in remittances was projected to flow into Việt Nam for the full year, making the Southeast Asian country the ninth largest remittance receiver – in dollar terms – in the world.The value inches up against $16 billion in 2018 and accounts for some 6.4 per cent of the country’s GDP.In the East Asia and Pacific region, Việt Nam is expected to rank third in terms of remittances after China and the Philippines.Financial and banking expert Nguyễn Trí Hiếu told\xa0Việt Nam News\xa0that the country’s high remittance flow was mainly because Vietnamese people working abroad believed in the stability of the economy and saw better investment opportunities in the domestic market.Hiếu said that remittances to Việt Nam were largely used to invest in production, business and the real estate market.“The central bank’s policy to keep zero interest rate for deposits in US dollars will encourage remittances into Việt Nam to be used for investment rather than being kept in banks,” Hiếu said.Remittance to Việt Nam has kept rising for the past two decades, from more than $1.3 billion in 2000 to $16 billion last year (except the year of 2009 due to adverse impacts of the global financial crisis).According to the WB’s brief, in 2019, the top five remittance recipient countries are projected to be India ($82.2 billion), China ($70.3 billion), Mexico ($38.7 billion), the Philippines ($35.1 billion) and Egypt ($26.4 billion).Remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to reach $551 billion in 2019, up by 4.7 per cent compared to 2018. Remittances have exceeded official aid – by a factor of three – since the mid-1990s. This year, they are on track to overtake foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to LMICs.This year, remittances will increase moderately in South Asia (5.3 per cent), Sub-Saharan Africa (5.1 per cent) and East Asia and Pacific (3.8 per cent) due to the buoyancy in inflows from the US being offset by slower growth of receipts from the Euro area and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).Growth of remittance flows slowed to 4.7 per cent in 2019 compared to a robust 8.6 per cent in 2018, the brief noted, adding that cyclical factors affecting the growth of remittance flows include economic growth in source countries, oil price and variations in exchange rates.According to the brief, assuming that outward remittances growth in tandem with the nominal GDP (in US dollar terms) of the source countries, these flows are projected to reach $574 billion in 2020 and $597 billion by 2021.This forecast methodology is conservative, as it does not account for increasing migration flows, falling remittance costs, and progress in technology of remittance services, the brief noted.

3424,'‘I wouldn’t bet against her’: Coco Gauff’s first coach on her meteoric rise',"'TennisPeter CowanAt 15-years-old most of us only dream about scoring the winning goal at Wembley or smashing aces at Centre Court, but Cori ‘Coco’ Gauff is no ordinary teenager.The American tennis prodigy became the youngest player to ever qualify for Wimbledon last week and proceeded to dump out the legendary Venus Williams in straight sets in the first round.Two victories later, including an epic comeback from two match points down against Polona Hercog, Gauff has set up a fourth-round meeting with seventh seed and former world number one Simona Halep today.The teenager’s fairytale run has captured hearts and minds across the world and shaken up the women’s tennis landscape, but Sylvester Black, Gauff’s first coach, is far from surprised.That’s because he’s known for years that Coco was destined for greatness.Early potentialKnown as Sly Black in the tennis world, the Jamaican coach has known Gauff since she was six, and even then, he saw hints of her potential.Speaking to Việt\xa0Nam News via phone from Đà\xa0Nẵng, where he is combining a holiday with coaching a group of players from around the world, Black recalled the first time he met Gauff in 2010 when he was based in the US.Black, who works as a development coach specialising in the formative years of a tennis player’s career, was asked by Gauff’s father to evaluate his daughter’s skills.“She was very skinny, very tiny,” Black said, noting that he initially was more impressed by the shy girl’s athletic potential (both her parents were top-flight college athletes) than her skills with her “baby racket”.Black, who has also coached 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens, asked her father what his goals for Gauff in tennis were and he replied with the modest and achievable aim of winning the prestigious ‘Little Mo’ under eight tournament.However, when he asked the six-year-old what she wanted, she told Black she wanted to the best player in the world.“She didn’t look shy then,” he said with a laugh. “Usually the dad says that, but he had a small goal and she said something really big.”Black decided to train Gauff and her determination to succeed and willingness to listen and learn quickly shone through.He recalled one drill that left Gauff in tears after she struggled to reach balls he would hit for her to return.Her father apologised for the outburst, but Black said it was a good sign.“She wanted to get to the ball so bad,” he said, adding that “then I saw there was something special”.Gauff’s development rocketed over the next two years and titles followed, including the ‘Little Mo’ tournament. From there she went from strength to strength and records tumbled, becoming an under-12 national champion at 10-years-old, the youngest US Open girls’ finalist in 2017 and the world’s top junior player.None of this was a surprise to Black, who worked with her for about five years and predicted she would be the world’s best by the age of 17.“She was always five years ahead of her age,” he said, noting that the same determination he saw in her as a child helped her rally from the brink of defeat against a seasoned pro like Polona Hercog.“She wins matches she shouldn’t win,” he said, adding that “she finds a way.”Sky’s the limitFormer Wimbledon champion and pundit John McEnroe has said he fears Gauff’s success is “too much too soon”, but Black has no such concerns.He explained that attention and column inches are part of professional tennis, and Gauff’s support system will keep her grounded.“If anyone can keep up with the pressure it is Cori,” he said.As for her chances of lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish at Wimbledon, Black, who plans to open a training centre in the beach town of Hua Hin in Thailand in the near future, has a hard time seeing anyone stopping Coco.“I wouldn’t bet against her.” — VNS'",3
4656,'Bringing American food and beer to the Central Highlands',"'Lê HươngThe last thing you may expect to find at the foot of\xa0Lang Biang Mountain in Lạc Dương District, the Central Highlands province of\xa0Lâm Đồng is a pizza restaurant.But find one you will in K’Be Wood Fired Pizza,\xa0run by James Reelick,\xa0a middle-aged man from Connecticut, the US.Love for hiking and history and economic brought\xa0him to Việt Nam in 2011. He decided to settle down in Lạc Dương due to the good weather and the proximity to the mountain.Reelick and his wife Nguyễn Thị Liên opened K’BE Wood Fired Pizza and BBQ five years ago.“I built a wood-fired oven for myself and family so\xa0that I could roast chickens\xa0the way I liked and be able to bake bread,” he told Việt Nam News.“Over the course of the year many friends, Vietnamese and foreigners, enjoyed eating with our family and encouraged us to open a restaurant. So, we did.”K’BE specializes in pizza, roast chicken and BBQ pork ribs. They also have mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.“We are a farm to table restaurant, which means everything is sourced from local farmers of Lạc Dương,” he said.Reelick said they are very conscious of sustainability and only use\xa0coffee wood in their oven as\xa0coffee trees need\xa0to be cut every 15 years so they can rejuvenate.“We buy this wood for the oven, we do not go to the forest to cut trees to make pizza,” he said.They are also very conscious about chemicals in their food.“We buy from farmers we know and who use as little chemical as possible,” he said. “The vegetables we buy are not the largest or most beautiful, but, we know they have a very low chemical input.”Two years ago, he also started Langbiang Mountain Brewery.“I saw that Đà Lạt did not have its own craft beer brewer,” he said. “It was then that I decided, I would brew beer here and ride on the coat-tails, so to speak, of the ever-growing craft beer industry in Việt Nam.”Langbiang Mountain Brewery currently only\xa0makes a Belgium farmhouse wheat ale.Reelick said it is a style of beer Vietnamese people can easily drink.“Another reason I only make an ale, is that an ale can be fermented at a temperature between 18 and 24C degrees, which is the average temperature in Đà Lạt,” he said.This saves the use of electricity, which, would be needed to cool the beer during fermentation.“Just\xa0another part of our working towards sustainability,” he added.Reelick said K’BE restaurant offers a very unique experience and would be very difficult to duplicate.In the meantime, Langbiang Mountain Brewery is set to expand.“At present we only sell the beer at our restaurant. But, over the next few months we will be selling into restaurants in Đà Lạt,” he revealed.They are also working on opening another brewery in Hội An within a year and collaborating with his wife’s family and Hội An Brewery Company.He also plans to start Pizza Tony in Đà Lạt, offering a pizza delivery service\xa0specialising in New York-style pizza.The service will be located in Đà Lạt Night Market by the end of this month.On his wife, Reelick said she is “the hardest working woman” he has ever met, who wakes up at 5am and sleeps at 10pm.“When I was introduced to her, it was love at first sight,” he recalled. “At the time she had a mask and helmet on and I looked into her eyes and knew instantly we had met in a past life and were meant to be together again.”Reelick said she is the backbone of K’BE Wood Fired Pizza and BBQ. She does all the cooking, which is a “very difficult” job.“To understand cooking in a wood-fired oven takes years to learn,” he said.Their daughter, Reelick Nguyễn An Trưng, will be seven years old in January and speaks three languages: Vietnamese, Kơ Ho and English.She speaks Kơ Ho language, which is spoken by neither her mother or father, with their neighbours.“She also works in the restaurant bringing dishes and glasses to the tables and also helps her mother in translation\xa0if\xa0English-speaking people come into the restaurant,” he said. “She is kind, thoughtful and on the most part polite.”“I love Việt Nam!” he added. “It has been a great pleasure to be able to watch Việt Nam grow over the last eight years. It is changing so fast.”He said if he could say one thing to Vietnamese people, it would be: “Thank you for allowing me to live in your country, Việt Nam is a special place.” VNS'",5
5246,'Dancesports clubs want their own confederation',"HÀ NỘI — A total 147 dancesports clubs across the nation have asked the General Department of Sports and Physical Training to remove dancesports from the Việt Nam Gymnastics Federation's jurisdiction to reform a separate\xa0body.In January, a group of dancesports athletes and coaches asked the Ministry of Home Affairs and the general department\xa0for approval to set up the Việt Nam dancesports confederation. The establishment is still pending.Wishes of dancesports admirersIn a letter to the department, the clubs say there are 40 cities and provinces which offer dancesports activities. Large cities\xa0provide the largest number of athletes, with many individuals performing well internationally.“We represent coaches, athletes, referees, heads of clubs, and dancesports community to sign this letter to show our will to the department and confederation. We would like the department to promptly guide us to establish the new confederation. It will help manage and develop dancesports to meet the will of the community,” read the letter.Though present in\xa0Việt Nam for a long time, it wasn't until 2005 that dancesports was listed in the sports managing system and became a top competition sport\xa0in 2006.In those 14 years, dancesports has continued to grow, prompting the call for specialised management to continue this\xa0development.Nguyễn Chí Anh,\xa0dubbed “the king of Việt Nam dancesports,” said the sport's admirers greatly\xa0desire to set up a confederation, but the process has been slow.According to Trần Chiến Thắng, chairman of the Việt Nam Gymnastics Federation, it is completely understandable that all sports want their own confederations.“I totally support the confederation establishment of dancesports. We are still waiting for the Government's\xa0decision to detach the dancesports from the department. It is not an easy decision and the executive board has no right to decide on the establishment of a dancesports confederation,” said Thắng.Nguyễn Hồng Minh, deputy head of the General Department of Sports and Physical Training, said inthe department will submit to the Ministry of Sports, Culture and Tourism’s approval to set up 10 new sports confederations, not only dancesports.“All procedures must be implemented under the regulations of the State,” said Minh.Meanwhile, Vương Duy Biên, deputy head of the ministry, said he hopes all procedures will soon be completed so the dancesports confederation can be launched.

3161,'Time to lend a hand',"'GETTING SHIRTY: This is Liverpool’s 24th kit in eight seasons and they are about to sign another new deal. — Photo AFPBy Paul KennedyLiverpool Football Club are about to sign the kit deal of all kit deals which by all accounts will be the most lucrative ever signed by a Premier League club.Nike’s famous ‘swoosh’ logo will soon be appearing alongside the Liver Bird crest on LFC shirts in the not so distant future and new kits galore will be sold across the world.The deal is reportedly worth more than $91m a season. That will make it the third largest kit deal in the world behind only Barcelona and Real Madrid.Since Liverpool were taken over by their American owners Fenway Sports Group eight years ago, the team has produced 24 different kits. That’s three each season.The current home shirt, shorts and socks for an adult will set you back £115 (VND3.2m) so it wouldn’t be wrong of me to suggest selling replica kits is a nice little earner for Liverpool Football Club.Meanwhile 68 kilometres north of Liverpool is Bury.For those of you not familiar with the north western mill town\xa0it’s particularly famous for its open-air market, it was the birth place of former UK Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel and the traditional local food is black pudding which is made from pig’s blood and fat.It also used to have a team in the English Football League.Founded in 1885, Bury FC is one of the oldest professional football clubs in England.In the early hours of Wednesday morning Vietnamese time, cash-strapped Bury FC’s 125 year membership with the English Football League came to an end.A last-gasp plea by politicians to extend the deadline to save the club fell on deaf ears.Not that far from Bury is another north west mill town called Bolton. Comedian Peter Kay is from Bolton and so is Nat Lofthouse, one of the greatest English footballers of his generation.Like Bury, Bolton too are in serious financial dire straits and were placed into administration back in May.And like Bury, they could too end up being booted out of the EFL having been given a 14-day deadline to find a new owner.Bolton, and Bury before them, could have done with a new kit deal, like Liverpool, to survive. Actually, that’s not true. What Bolton and Bury need to survive is a tiny fraction of the money Nike will pay to Liverpool just to have their logo on the kits.Now I’m not for one minute suggesting Liverpool FC are doing anything wrong. At the end of the day, they are a business, and looking at some of the deals they have made in recent times, a very shrewd one.But surely with all the money in football at the highest level, there has to be a way clubs can do something to help out.I don’t know exactly what went on at Bolton and Bury for them to land in the mire, and any money owed by individuals through mismanagement or wrongdoings should not be paid simply to line their pockets and get them personally out of debt.But Bury and Bolton have thousands and thousands of loyal supporters who right now have either lost or are about to lose the clubs they love.Both towns are in Greater Manchester, as are Manchester United and Manchester City. At those clubs, there are individual players who make enough money in just a few weeks that would ensure the survival of their neighbours for years to come.The gulf between those four Manchester clubs, and indeed the top and bottom of professional football is gargantuan.If every single Premier League player decided to give a slice of their salaries, let’s say a single week’s wage, to help Bolton and Bury, none of them would even notice the money missing from their bank accounts.This of course is a simple way of putting it, but surely there has to be a way for the rich to help the poor? — VNS'",3

McClelland, and representatives from ministries and sectors.USAID plans to clean up 37 hectares at\xa0the airbase. The objective is to first eliminate the risk of further dioxin migration off base, working with Đồng Nai authorities to clean up surrounding areas, and treating contaminated soil.The US has government committed US$300 million to restoring the airbase and its surrounding areas, which will take 10 years to complete.Speaking at the event, Deputy PM Bình hailed the efforts of\xa0Vietnamese and US experts for their meticulous preparations for the project.Over 3.6 million hectares of forest were destroyed while 4.8 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange/Dioxin, he said, adding that the toxic chemical was still taking its toll on the third generation.He highlighted the project at Biên Hòa Airbase was an\xa0illustration of\xa0US\xa0commitment to work with\xa0Việt Nam on the post-war recovery efforts.He ordered the Ministry of National Defence to co-ordinate with relevant ministries, sectors and localities to remove bottlenecks to accelerate the implementation of the project, while working to ensure safety during the detoxification process.McClelland said\xa0the project at Biên Hòa Airbase was being carried out\xa0following the\xa0successful detoxification of\xa0Đà Nẵng Airport,\xa0and was a notable example of\xa0the sound partnership between Việt Nam and the US, who were trying to overcome the past and pave the way towards a future of friendship and prosperity.Located about 30km from HCM City, Biên Hòa\xa0was a major US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine base\xa0during the war. In 2016, USAID, in partnership with the Government of Việt Nam, completed an assessment of dioxin contamination at the airbase. The assessment identified almost 500,000 cubic metres of dioxin-contaminated soil and sediment in need of remediation – almost four times the volume that was treated\xa0at Đà Nẵng Airport.On the occasion, Deputy PM Bình and the US diplomat witnessed the signing of an agreement to implement a $65 million programme to support people\xa0with disabilities in eight priority provinces over\xa0the next five years between USAID and NACCET. — VNS'",0

333,'Balanced care for ethnic minority people urged',"HÀ NỘI — National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân has emphasised the necessity to improve, facilitate and preserve cultural and spiritual life of ethnic minority people alongside attention to social and economic development.\nShe made the request while speaking at the ongoing 37th session of the National Assembly (NA) Standing Committee in Hà Nội yesterday, where the deputies listened to the brief report and discussed the implementation of policies and laws focusing on national targets of sustainable poverty reduction in ethnic minority and mountainous areas in the period 2012-18.\nCommenting on the results of the implementation of the hunger elimination and poverty reduction goals, Ngân said thanks to the policies, the infrastructure to serve the people had been significantly improved, thereby improving people's lives.\nNgân suggested that ministries and agencies should focus on supporting policies to help people of 10 ethnic minority groups with the highest poverty rates get out of poverty and have stable lives.\nChairman of the NA’s Ethnic Council, Hà Ngọc Chiến, said that policies on investment in socio-economic development and poverty reduction had created a clear change in infrastructure with about 25,000 works invested in and built in underprivileged communes and villages, ethnic minority and mountainous areas.\nAccording to the council’s report, most of the communes have had concrete roads to the centres, 88 per cent of villages have motorised roads and 42 per cent of villages have standard roads. Up to 99 per cent of commune centres and 80 per cent of villages have had electricity, 65 per cent of communes have small irrigation systems to meet production and living requirements. Up to 76 per cent of communes meet national criteria for health.\n“The rate of poor households, especially ethnic minority households, decreases by an average of 3.5 per cent a year,” Chiến said.\nBy the end of 2018, more than 1.4 million people of ethnic minorities benefited from loan programmes at the Bank for Social Policies with the total funds of VNĐ46.1 trillion (over US$2 billion).\nHowever, the report shows some shortcomings in the implementation of the Government’s policies including the proportion of ethnic minority households falling back into poverty, generating poverty and near-poor households was high, the average income per capita per year of poor ethnic minority households was lower than the national level. People still faced many difficulties and had unstable livelihoods.\nIt cited unfavourable natural conditions, small area of arable land, poor transportation, severe weather, and divided terrain as reasons for the shortcomings.\n“The consequences of climate change, drought, natural disasters, floods and saltwater intrusion have greatly affected the results of poverty reduction, which is a reason for relapse into poverty and a rise in poverty among ethnic minority and mountainous areas,” said Chiến, adding that some places still maintained backward customs, practices, funerals, filial piety, which cost people money, limited education level and caused a lack of business knowledge, jobs and production capital.\nNA deputy chairman Phùng Quốc Hiển said that ethnic minority people were very interested in forest protection policies, but the allowance for this activity of only VNĐ400,000 ($17) per hectare a year was too little, unable to attract and ensure the minimum living standards for people.\nRegarding the situation of poverty relapse and illiteracy, Hiển said that the rate was still quite high and different from other regions.\nMinister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Đào Ngọc Dung admitted that the quality of life and human development coefficients of ethnic minorities were still low, and the gap in income rates among regions was still high. He said his ministry would issue an action plan to overcome limitations and weaknesses to have the best solutions, gradually improving the lives of the people.\nEarlier yesterday, the NA Standing Committee discussed and gave opinions on the revision of the 2005 Youth Law.\nNA Chairwoman Ngân commented that many policies in the revised law project were still general and overlapped with other fields. She asked the drafting board to abide by the provisions of the Constitution and relevant laws.\n“The issues of rights and obligations of the youth are quite well defined in specialised laws, so when approaching the rights of young people, it is necessary to avoid overlaps,” she said. — VNS",0

These blocks are connected by multi-level circulation paths, offering views and quiet areas for studying, and are surrounded by a pool, which helps to regulate its microclimate.Judges said that this project is “incredibly experiential, and architecturally very clever and well-calibrated.""They also added that the “juxtaposition of circulation, courtyard and building is very well articulated"", and that it’s “simply great architecture"".The VTN Architects also won the Highly Commended title for Urban House of the Year 2019 for its Stepping Park House in HCM City.The house incorporates plants throughout and connects with nearby green park space.A large diagonal void through all three floors of the building and tropical trees feature in the common areas.The architects wanted to create a forest environment in the house despite being indoors.As many as 53 nominees were on the\xa0shortlist in 10 categories of the annual awards.The Dezeen Awards are an annual awards programme, now in its second year, which aims\xa0to identify the world\'s best architecture, interiors and design, as well as the studios and the individual architects and designers producing the best work.This year\'s entries were judged by an international panel\xa0comprised of 75 leading figures from the architecture and design world. — VNS'",5

5261,'Why you should have a longing for longan',"'Bảo Hoa & Paul KennedyIf you were to translate literally the name of a popular fruit in Việt Nam from Chinese to English, it may not sound so appealing.Longan means dragon’s eye and it was given its moniker because when peeled, the seeds embedded in the juicy flesh look a little like the eye-ball of the fire-breathing mythical creature.But if you don’t have any particular\xa0problems with dragons then there is no reason you shouldn’t have a longing for longan.Aside from tasting amazing, there are some little known facts about longan you really should learn.Health experts say longan is a real gem of a fruit that provides an endless list of feel-good benefits.It is documented to help anti-inflammatory problems, treat anemia and iron deficiencies, reduce stress, help insomniacs and, we’ll save the best for last, even give you young and glowing skin.Maybe that’s why Vietnamese natives seem to defy the aging process.Right about now is longan season, and this is particularly evident in Hưng Yên Province, also\xa0known as\xa0longan country.Forty kilometres or so from Hà Nội, Hưng Yên is renowned for producing some of the best longans in all of Asia.Farmer Đặng Thị Kim Anh has been growing there for 15 years, and often travels into the capital to sell her produce.“Longan from Hưng Yên Province smell good, taste sweet and are crunchy,” she said.“And they look good as well. A lot of people travel to Hưng Yên to eat our longan fruit.“I’ve been growing longan fruit for some 15 years.“I often use hay as fertiliser for the longan trees. As well as wood ash, and kali fertiliser. Other than that I don’t use anything else.”There are many dishes that can be created using longan. Soups, desserts, teas and salads to name but a few.In Hà Nội’s Old Quarter, café owner Vũ Hương Giang uses longan to create what she believes is the perfect summer drink.“It’s an elaborate process making this drink,” said Giang.“We buy fresh longan, peel them, take out the seeds while trying to keep the flesh intact so we can put lotus seeds in. And we do this very carefully so the longan flesh embraces the lotus seeds.“The longan has to be taken from Hưng Yên Province because it’s their harvest season now. The fruits should be big and taste good to make the drinks appealing.“We have our own way of cooking lotus seeds. Our lotus seeds are always soft and juicy and have a nutty taste. I also add coconut water and lotus seed water to increase the lotus flavour.”Phạm Thị Gấm, is a regular visitor to Chè Bốn Mùa (Four Seasons) café, and a regular consumer of longan drinks.“I find this drink very cool and light for the summer,” she said.“It’s got a little bit of tapioca, lotus seeds wrapped in longan. The longan tastes sweet, crunchy and the lotus seeds have a creamy and nutty taste. I like it very much.”It tastes great, cools you down and, if you believe in traditional medicine, is packed full of health benefits.Time to put an end to those longings for longan. VNS'",5
3435,'Peru stun champions Chile 3-0 to reach Copa America final',"'FootballPORTO ALEGRE\xa0 Peru stunned defending champions Chile 3-0 to reach the final of the Copa America for the first time in 44 years on Wednesday.Goals from Edison Flores, Yoshimar Yotun and Paolo Guerrero handed Peru a deserved win which sends them into a final against Brazil at the Maracana Stadium on Sunday.The stunning upset prevented Chile\'s golden generation from challenging for a third straight title, following their wins over Argentina in 2015 and 2016.Instead the finalists from the previous two editions will meet in Saturday\'s third-place play-off in Sao Paulo.Little was expected of Peru in the knock-out stages after they ended the group phase with a humbling 5-0 thrashing by Brazil.But after riding their luck -- and being saved by VAR three times -- to beat Uruguay on penalties in the quarter-final, they were a completely rejuvenated outfit in Porto Alegre.""The team has gone back to its essence, passing the ball and running hard,"" said goalscorer Yotun.""The game against Brazil was tough but this will be a different match. It\'s a final that\'s there to be won. We have to work hard and lift this cup.""Goalkeeper Pedro Gallese, the villain of that 5-0 defeat, was again faultless, as he had been in the quarter-final when decisively saving Luis Suarez\'s shoot-out penalty.He again saved a penalty and made a number of other vital stops.""It\'s painful for all of us because we fought for another title,"" said Chile captain Gary Medel.""Peru played a great match and we have to congratulate them. The played really well, worked really hard and deserve to be in the final.""From the start Peru dominated the reigning champions, with Christian Cueva wastefully shooting wide two minutes in after he was teed up in space by his captain Guerrero.On seven minutes Chile\'s Charles Aranguiz started and finished a superb passing move involving Alexis Sanchez and Jean Beausejour, by placing a precise shot just past the post.Flores took advantage of an Erick Pulgar slip in midfield to dart towards goal but he dragged his weak shot woefully wide.But a minute later he was alone at the back post to lash home left footed from an Andre Carillo flick on from Cueva\'s cross.Timely interventionStriker Guerrero made a timely intervention in his own area to prevent a Sanchez corner from sneaking in at the near post.Yotun doubled the lead on 38 minutes after punishing Chile goalkeeper Gabriel Arias\'s rush of blood to the head.Carillo chased a long ball down the right hand side and beat Arias, who ill-advisedly had charged from his area, to the ball before picking out Yotun on the edge of the 18-yard area.Faced with four back-tracking defenders, Yotun calmly controlled the ball on his chest and sent a low volley straight down the middle of the empty goal.Equally importantly was Gallese\'s one-hand save to tip over a Jose Fuenzalida volley a minute before the break.A 2-0 half-time lead was the least Peru deserved after an enterprising performance against tentative opponents.Chile were a lick of paint away from getting back into the match on 51 minutes when Eduardo Vargas\'s flicked header beat Gallese but agonisingly came back off the post.Peru should have put the game to bed on a rapier counter-attack on the hour but Guerrero and Cueva passed rather than shooting and Yotun ballooned over from six yards with the goal gaping.Peru started sitting deeper, inviting Chile to attack and Aranguiz sent a rasping shot whistling past the top corner with Gallese a mere spectator.Gallese then tipped over a looping volley from Beausejour and 15 minutes from time he stayed big to block a shot from Vargas one-on-one.He was unbeatable and dived low to his right to palm out a venemous Sanchez effort from 20 yards.Guerrero put the icing on the cake in injury time after rounding Arias, but Gallese had the last word from the penalty spot. — AFP'",3

914,Institute's\xa0acupuncture treatment helps smoking addicts,"Gia LộcHCM CITY — Earlier this year, a\xa057-year-old man from\xa0Tây Ninh Province was desperate to kick his smoking habit after he suffered a stroke. For treatment, he chose\xa0the HCM City Traditional Medicine Institute\xa0where doctors recommended that he receive\xa0auricular acupuncture to stop his cravings for cigarettes.The treatment consisted of four one-millimetre and\xa01.5- millimetre needles inserted into\xa0four acupuncture points on the external ear surface for a period of three to four days.“After three treatments on the same points, my cravings stopped\xa0even when I was in front of smokers,” the man, who declined to reveal his name,\xa0said.He\xa0continued treatment to ensure that he would no longer smoke.Another patient, a\xa023-year-old man\xa0from\xa0Tân Bình District, who did not want to reveal his name,\xa0received the same acupuncture treatment,\xa0which stopped his cravings.“I smoked for two years. Whenever I felt sleepy, I would\xa0smoke\xa0to stay\xa0awake. And at\xa0work, many people around me did not like the\xa0smoking smell. So I was determined to give it up,” he\xa0said.Dr Trần Minh Quang, deputy head of the institute’s general planning division, said that acupuncture needles stimulate the central nervous system which helps\xa0to diminish cravings.The inserted needles are kept in one ear for three or four days\xa0after which the patient\xa0returns to the hospital where doctors remove the needles and then perform the same procedure on\xa0the other ear.“Whenever addicts feel cravings, they are told to press acupuncture points\xa0on the external ear surface,” Quang said.At the institute, patients are told to\xa0meet doctors to receive\xa0counseling to ensure that they follow the procedures.This year, the institute conducted research from April to June on the effectiveness of using auricular acupuncture on 35 smokers. Of the group, nearly 60-65 per cent of them were able to give up smoking.In 2016, Nguyễn Thị Tân, dean of the faculty of traditional medicine at Huế University of Medicine and Pharmacy, conducted research on 300 smokers\xa0with Kyung Hee University in South Korea and Quảng Nam Province's Department of Health on auricular acupuncture.The result showed that 66 per cent quit\xa0smoking after five sessions of auricular acupuncture. The research was sponsored by the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare.Last month, at a conference on treatment of smoking addiction with a combination of traditional and\xa0modern medicine, Trương Thị Ngọc Lan, the institute’s deputy head, said that auricular acupuncture helped\xa0to reduce craving rapidly.The therapy should be used with other kinds of\xa0traditional treatments because smoking can lead to other\xa0health disorders.“Giving up smoking is not difficult, but how to prevent re-addiction is very important,” Lan said.Smoking addiction is a serious public health issue in Việt Nam, and the demand for treatment\xa0is\xa0high.At least 70 per cent of smokers want to give up smoking and two-thirds of people who resumed smoking again\xa0wanted to treat it, according to the\xa0institute.Dr Trần Thái Hà, head of general planning division at the National Hospital of Traditional Medicine, said that counselling for treatment of smoking addiction with and without medicines\xa0doubles the success rate for smoking cessation.According to the US\xa0Center\xa0for Disease Control and Prevention, 20 minutes after quitting, the\xa0heart rate drops to normal. Twelve hours after quitting, the carbon monoxide level in the blood drops to normal. And\xa0one\xa0year after quitting, the added risk of coronary heart disease is half that of a smoker’s.Quang said that the cost of auricular acupuncture is low and therefore accessible to many people.

864,'NA leader hails Gia Lai Province for economic performance',"'GIA LAI – National Assembly Chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân hailed the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai for its strong socio-economic performance in 2018 – particularly for its growth rate of 8 per cent – during a working session with the province’s senior officials yesterday.The NA leader noted that the province’s per capita Gross Regional Domestic Product in 2018 reached VNĐ45.36 million (US$1,950), higher than the figures of other localities in the region, and the household poverty rate dropped to 10.04 per cent.She also recognised Gia Lai’s efforts in building new rural areas, with 60 out of the 184 total communes having earned the new-style rural area title.Ngân approved the key tasks that Gia Lai had set for itself and urged the province to build on what it had achieved to further reduce the poverty rate among ethnic minority people and build more new-style rural areas.She suggested the province strive to attract investment for essential transportation infrastructure to improve its connectivity with other localities.The NA leader recommended Gia Lai call for investment in farm produce processing and restructure its agricultural sector towards products of higher value based on local potential in terms of land and climate, such as fruits for export and medicinal herbs.Mentioning Gia Lai’s role in the tourism development plan for the Central Highlands region by 2020, Ngân advised the province to pay attention to developing transport links with Kon Tum Province and the coastal province of Bình Định via National Road 19.She noted the province’s proposals that the Government consider building a highway connected with National Road 19 and investing in an irrigation work in Kbang District, which was the only district in Gia Lai selected as the model for new-style rural area building during the 2011-2020 period.The same day, the NA Chairwoman attended a conference of village patriarchs from Central Highlands provinces, held to review the ten years of implementation of a letter they had sent to express their resolve to work for the development of the region and contribute to national construction and defence. The letter was issued at a conference in March 2009 held to honour outstanding village patriarchs in the Central Highlands. — VNS'",0

5092,'Foodwise: Cuốn đập Đà Nẵng and its\xa0Hà Nội brother are must-try dishes',"'By Hà Nguyễn & Hoàng HồDiffering from spring rolls in the north, cuốn đập Đà Nẵng (boiled pork and other ingredients\xa0wrapped in rice paper) is well-known nationwide for its unique taste and aroma, said culinary expert Lê Kim Chi.Chi, from Đà Nẵng, said making the dish is simple because it is a cold dish but to ensure its great taste one needs to select the best ingredients.Rice paper should be made from fragrant rice which is dried before being ground into rice powder. It should not break when wrapped, while the pork should be chosen from heo cỏ, because this kind of pig has a thinner skin and less fat.“You should boil the pork and let it soak in the boiling water for 10 minutes so the fat looks white and soft. Pork cooked over a fire would dry out,” Chi said.Apart from pork, there are more than 10 different fresh ingredients used in this dish. They include cucumber, fresh banana, green beans, lettuce, mint and several others.“These ingredients give the dish its distinctive flavour,” she said.Equally important is a bowl of dipping sauce locally known as mắm nêm. It is also a specialty of Đà Nẵng. The sauce is made from fermented cá cơm (anchovies) in salt and ground roasted rice (locally known as thính), Chi told Việt Nam News.After being fermented for three months, the mắm can be eaten with popular dishes in Việt Nam’s three regions, such as gỏi cuốn tôm thịt (pork and shrimp, noodle and herbs wrapped in thin rice paper) and cakes made from rice and glutinous rice powder, she said.Mắm nêm is mixed with pineapple, garlic, lemon and chili dipped in cuốn đập, make the dish an unforgettable part of visiting Đà Nẵng, Chi said, noting that there are many shops that sell the dish, but each has its own secret to create mắm nêm.The dish is a must-try at Quán Ăn Ngon chain’s Ngon Garden Restaurant in Hà Nội.\nRestaurant owner Phạm Bích Hạnh told Việt Nam News that before introducing the dish, she visited Đà Nẵng to learn how to cook it from Chi, and invited her to work as a culinary expert in Hà Nội.\nHạnh said she has added more ingredients in her cuốn đập Đà Nẵng in Hà Nội . They are pork leg, shrimp, nem Phùng, and tré Bà Đệ.Nem Phùng is made of pork and pork skin cut into thin strips and mixed with thính while tré Bà Đệ is also a specialty of Đà Nẵng made by Mrs Đệ more than 60 years ago. Its ingredients are lean pork, bacon, and boiled pork skin cut into thin slices then mixed with minced galangal root and garlic, salt and also thính and fermented in Đệ’s own way.“I ordered the original tré Bà Đệ from her only daughter to serve to our customers. Many of them said they love the combination,” Hạnh said.Hoàng Thu Thủy from\xa0Hai Bà Trưng District said she likes the dish at Ngon Garden.“The dish is a very good combination between the tastes of Đà Nẵng and Hà Nội cuisine. The boiled pig leg is crispy while the fresh shrimp is sweet. Together with a number of fresh herbs wrapped in special rice paper and dipped in mắm nêm, it is so enjoyable that I couldn’t stop eating it,” she said.Ngon Garden’s dish is not only a street snack, but has becomes a specialty for not only locals but also foreigners visiting Hà Nội, said Hạnh.Meanwhile, Thủy says\xa0if a diner doesn’t have the chance to go to Đà Nẵng to try cuốn đập, Ngon Garden is a perfect alternative.

1563,Hải Phòng orders police probe into gangsters' land theft,"'HẢI PHÒNG — Hải Phòng authorities have demanded the police investigate and handle criminal gangs who allegedly destroyed houses on military land and threatened residents.The coastal city People’s Committee also asked the People’s Committee of Hải An District – where the property theft occurred – to co-operate with the police and the Air Division 371 to deal with the crimes.The police received reports of several incidents since late September, in which dozens of gangsters armed with swords, knives and metal rods gathered to demolish houses, change the locks or set up aluminium fences around empty lots along the East-West Boulevard. By doing so on hundreds of land lots, they tried to gain de-facto ownership of the neighbourhood.The East-West Boulevard, which is in the final stages of construction, was a key urban axis in the city’s master planning. The 20km-long road built with loans worth US$276 million\xa0from the World Bank is due to open soon, which is expected to increase prices of land along the boulevard.Hải An District People’s Committee Chairman Phạm Chí Bắc told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) that the Việt Nam Army General Staff in 1993 agreed to let Aviation Division 371 give part of the military land in Thành Tô Ward to build housing for their soldiers and staff.The division, however, failed to finish the paperwork at the time so the local administration was unable to grant house dwellers their\xa0land use certificates. Many have moved away since then and sold their land to others, though without any paper, Bắc said.The gangsters recently took advantage of uncertain ownership to raid houses and empty land in the neighbourhood and claim ownership, he said.“The difficulty is it will take time to track and identify the current owners of the land and to see what they think on the matter. Only then can the authorities move on with legal proceedings to handle the issue,” the official said.“But it is very possible that the gangsters are already finished with the encroachment and sell off the land by the time the work is completed.”According to Thành Tô Ward People’s Committee Vice Chairman Đoàn Văn Đông, the authorities managed to identify three gangs involved in the case. They were gangsters operating\xa0under ‘Buck-toothed’ Hải, ‘Black’ Hùng and ‘Crippled’ Bình who are all based\xa0in Hải An District.Đông said that the district authorities established a task force to monitor the area but it was unable to keep watch around the clock.\xa0— VNS'",1

They also pledged to accelerate the signing of an aid agreement for the construction of office buildings for the Secretariat and committees of the Cambodian National Assembly, along with some items of a community-based rehabilitation centre for drug addicts in Preah Sihanouk province.Việt Nam and Cambodia agreed to undertake a number of measures to promote economic, trade and investment cooperation, and facilitate border trade through upgrading border infrastructure and enhance connection of roads, waterway roads and tourism.They will expand cooperation to new areas in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, especially support to small- and medium-sized and micro enterprises, cyber security and safety, and nuclear medicine.Cambodia spoke highly of the fact that Việt Nam is one of the country’s biggest investors with 214 projects worth over US$3 billion.Both countries agreed to coordinate closely to create optimal conditions for their businesses to cooperate and seek partnerships.The two sides appreciated the efforts of relevant agencies to soon finalise and sign two documents on the workload already completed in border marker planting (84 per cent).They shared concerns about the lowest water level on the Mekong River recently, stressing the significance of close coordination among countries in the Mekong Delta subregion in maintaining effective and sustainable use of Mekong River water, especially in information and data sharing as well as consultation before building hydropower plants.Both sides agreed to work with Laos to foster tripartite affiliation in the Development Triangle, while effectively implementing the master plan on connecting the three economies and striving to attract more financial resources from development partners and international financial organisations.They pledged close coordination in 2020 when Việt Nam serves as both the Chair of ASEAN and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the 2020-21 tenure and Cambodia hosts the 13th Summit of the Asia-Europe Meeting. — VNS'",0
3848,'Appropriate technology needed to treat solid waste',"'HÀ NỘI — People passing Trường Chinh Street in\xa0Hà Nội every day are used to a pile of trash in front of Alley 554 blocking traffic on one of the city’s most congested roads.The trash is dumped by local households and scrap\xa0from nearby construction sites.This example is just a drop in the ocean compared to the\xa06,500 tonnes of solid waste dumped in Hà Nội each\xa0day.Dumping domestic waste on the streets is a common problem here.Instead of keeping garbage at home and waiting for waste trucks to\xa0pick it up, many people throw their trash in public areas near\xa0their houses, polluting the environment.According to the Việt Nam Environment Administration, about 25.5 million tonnes of domestic solid waste nationwide was discharged\xa0every year.Urban citizens dump about 38,000 tonnes of solid waste per day while people in rural areas throw 32,000 tonnes away.This huge amount of untreated solid waste had\xa0challenged major urban areas nationwide due to a lack of\xa0investment in rubbish dumps, environmental experts pointed out at a workshop on solid waste management this week held by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE).Hoàng Văn Thức, deputy head of the Việt Nam Environment Administration, told Vietnam Television there were 50 solid waste treatment factories nationwide, and most of the remaining waste was buried.Among the big piles of trash dumped every day in big cities, about 85.5 per cent of waste was\xa0collected. The number in rural areas is only 40-55 per cent, he said.In many rural areas, dumps were located far from residential areas, and rubbish trucks found it difficult to reach remote mountainous areas, Thức said.Although burning waste in\xa0small incinerators has been warned against by MONRE, it is still common in many rural and mountainous areas.In Văn Bàn District in\xa0northern mountainous province of Lào Cai, local residents spend their own money on incinerators to treat their daily waste.There are more than 1,000 small incinerators\xa0in the district. However, there are\xa0no emission treatment systems.Hoàng Thị Mến, a local in Hòa Mạc Commune, told Vietnam Television that burning waste caused an\xa0unpleasant smell but residents did\xa0not know how to deal with\xa0it.Other localities like Hà Tĩnh, Quảng Ngãi and\xa0Vĩnh Phúc have waste treatment factories but the situation does not look much better.Local residents from\xa0Kỳ Tân Commune in\xa0Hà Tĩnh Province have been complaining that since the local waste treatment factory was put into operation, flies and mosquitoes had\xa0swarmed the area.Thức from the Việt Nam Environment Administration said the problem was not waste treatment technology because the most advanced technologies had\xa0already been introduced in Việt Nam. What needed\xa0to be put in place were facilities\xa0suitable for local conditions.Waste treatment budgets were\xa0allocated from provincial budgets. Many poor localities lacked the funds\xa0to invest in advanced technologies, he said.At the workshop,\xa0MONRE deputy minister Võ Tuấn Nhân said Việt Nam should prioritise selecting domestic solid waste treatment technologies in relevance to each locality, for example, garbage sorting, organic fertiliser composting and\xa0incinerators.Đồng Phước An, deputy director of Hà Nội’s Construction Department, said the city would call for investment in waste-to-energy factories. By doing so, garbage sorting would\xa0be encouraged.Lê Trung Tuấn Anh, head of the solid waste management division under HCM City’s Department of Natural Resources and Environment, said the city’s authorities were thinking about building more dumps\xa0and installing underground facilities. — VNS'",4

2501,"'Diversity, inclusion in businesses promote innovation, throw open niche markets: conference'","'HCM CITY — Embracing diversity and fostering inclusion is critical to business success in the 21st century, the Inclusive Business Forum heard in HCM City on October 11.It does not just make social sense to promote diversity and inclusion, but also business sense, delegates said.Inclusive businesses go beyond philanthropy by integrating diversity and inclusion into their operations, combating discrimination in both the workplace and society, while continuing to grow the business, they pointed out.In his opening remarks, Đào Xuân Lai, UNDP’s Assistant Resident Representative in Việt Nam, said: “Diversity and inclusion bring about new market niches, innovation and productivity for businesses.”A McKinsey study estimated that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 per cent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry medians, he said.“Diversity triggers new ideas and innovations. With a diverse work staff, from diverse backgrounds, sexual orientations and gender identities, and people with disabilities, businesses can tap into a pool of new talents and innovative ideas to keep up with rapidly changing markets.“Embracing diversity and inclusion will also help businesses open up and get access to new products and service lines in the market.”There is a growth of diversity and inclusion globally, he said.“Many Vietnamese businesses are already greening their investments, generating decent jobs, creating opportunities to reduce inequalities in the workforce and challenging stereotypes of persons with disabilities and LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex).”But the fact is that there are many challenges to creating a culture of inclusion in business.A 2016 study by iSEE and UNDP found that on average 30 per cent of LGBTI respondents in Việt Nam reported being denied employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Futhermore, in the 2018 report, Ending Stigma, 66 per cent of persons with disabilities said they had never even attended a job interview, and of those who had, 54 per cent said they had been denied a job because of their disability.“For Việt Nam’s continued economic growth, it is crucial to fully embrace this new way of doing business, which will also help and reduce inequalities for vulnerable groups,” Lai said.Warrick Cleine, chairman and CEO of KPMG Việt Nam and Cambodia, said Việt Nam could only meet its potential if everyone is part of the story.“This means businesses must create a positive, inclusive and diverse experience. At KPMG, this means a happy, healthy and safe workplace, where everyone can bring their whole selves to work. This is great for Việt Nam, and fantastic for business”.Imagtor, which won the UNDP SDG Challenge in 2017 and received equity-free seed funding and a business incubation programme, explained how it championed diversity and inclusion.Cao Thi Ngoc Dung, chairperson of Phú Nhuận Jewelry JSC, spoke about her company’s marketing campaigns using same sex couples to model their jewellery.This messaging helps challenge stereotypes and combat discrimination against LGBTI people, while PNJ could broaden its consumer base to niche market segments, she said.She also emphasised the need to integrate customers’ and society’s benefits with the company’s interests.Francesco Trần Văn Liêng, president of the Việt Nam Cacao Joint Stock Corporation, said: “Vietnamcacao focuses on enhancing social responsibility by keeping pace with industry 4.0 to help disabled and [other] less competitive [workers] to integrate into the working environment and contribute to the business growth thereby redistributing benefits to society.”The forum was part of the Én Xanh (Blue Swallows) programme organised by the Centre for Social Initiatives Promotion, UNDP, the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Việt Nam Union of Science and Technology Associations. — VNS'",2

4980,'Solutions needed as Hà\xa0Nội chokes under smog',"'by Ollie ArciOver the last few days, the air quality in Hà\xa0Nội has hit hazardous levels. The smog continues to blanket the capital, with AQI indicators soaring past safe levels and seeming to stay there. In less polluted environs online, social media feeds are full of concerned citizens scrambling for the best face masks and most efficient air purifiers.The panic is only partly justified, as the city has seen a number of days over the last few years on which the air is thick with PM2.5.The quality of the air we breathe is a tricky beast, with a range of factors impacting the local climate on a day-to-day basis. Việt Nam’s rapid pace of development, which has averaged about 7 per cent annually recently, has worsened the quality. However, the increasing traffic density, agricultural practices and the activities of our neighbouring countries also play a part in the phenomenon.Hà\xa0Nội, and other Vietnamese cities, regularly make an appearance on must-visit travel lists and top experiences, yet there are few celebrations for topping the charts for ‘world’s most polluted’. The image of Việt Nam, and its capital, should rightly be based on rich cultural heritage and cuisine, not the sight of people wearing masks.Other big cities have previously suffered the same fate, often to a much greater degree. For example, the five-day ‘Great Smog of London’ in 1952 and the New York City smog in 1966. Both events were born from the unfortunate combination of pollutants and weather, with coal dust trapped by masses of stagnant air. Even today, major cities across the world see days or weeks where air quality plummets and emergency measures are needed to clear the haze.The coalescence of heavy industry and weather phenomena were once enough to choke citizens and reduce visibility to zero. Luckily, we are not at that stage yet.However, downloads of air quality monitoring apps have soared, indicating an increased awareness of pollution and its effects on health. People around the world have been inspired by\xa0Greta Thunberg’s example and staged\xa0‘climate strikes’ in major cities.The young girl’s campaign, if nothing else, has brought the issue much-needed attention and pushed the problems of rapid development and environmental ignorance to the forefront of discussion. Accelerated growth picks people up from poverty, but weighs the other side of the scale with more construction, production, vehicles and subsequent emissions.The vast amounts of energy needed to power Việt Nam’s future expansion are currently derived from the same coal that dirtied the skies of London and New York over half a century ago. So it’s no wonder we now see the AQI number skyrocketing past the safe limit and into the 200’s and 300’s.Meteorological factors may well be out of our control – Hà\xa0Nội’s position between mountains and sea is prime for trapping air until cold fronts come and sweep the smog from our skies. Additionally, the burning of rice straws north of the border is sure to continue. But measures can be taken to ensure air quality doesn’t reach extreme levels quite so regularly.The Vietnamese capital is home to 5.5 million motorbikes and more than 500,000 cars. With a rapidly increasing population and burgeoning middle class, these figures will only rise. The causes for Hà\xa0Nội’s haze are manifold and bikes can’t shoulder all the blame for the bad air, but clogged streets are clear contributors to the problem.New York has adopted congestion pricing in Manhattan, while London has introduced the world’s first 24-hour Ultra Low Emission Zone alongside the existing congestion charge. Madrid, Paris and Oslo all have their own ‘car-free’ policies to varying degrees.Authorities in Hà\xa0Nội plan to ban motorcycles from downtown areas by 2030. According to the Director of Hà\xa0Nội’s Department of Transportation, Vũ\xa0Văn Viện, a ban is crucial to solving these problems and will push people towards public means of transport.Notice, however, that the ban fails to include cars, which are both a bigger threat to the smooth flow of traffic on narrow city streets and greater contributors to pollution.Hà\xa0Nội also plans to boost the use of public transport, opening new bus routes and moving to make the existing ones more prompt and efficient.Attempts to limit the use of small coal-burning stoves have seen varying degrees of success, but perhaps with increased awareness over the long-term health impacts of bad air, these activities will begin to fade out naturally.The biggest contributor to the problem – the use of fossil fuels – is a more difficult one to solve. The country has ample potential for the development of renewable power, but these sources do not yet meet the needs of reliable energy.These efforts can all contribute to making sure the drop in air quality is a blip, and we start to see clearer skies ahead. The current pace of growth needs a healthy dose of sustainability – ensuring the capital city remains a healthy and desirable place to live, topping the charts for tourist arrivals in the years to come.

Innovation-driven start-ups must start from researchers and universities.”Joanna Wood, Education Counsellor of the Australian Embassy said the Industry 4.0’s research shows 40 per cent add to global GDP by 2030 – but a new way of working and collaborating is required to maximise benefits.“It requires governments, institutions, industry and the community to work together if we want to make the most of this opportunity,” she said.Associate Professor Bùi Đức Thọ, deputy rector of the National Economics University said to enhance the start-up spirit in Việt Nam, the National Economics University established an innovation centre with domestic and international co-operation activities. The university also opened a major in start-up and business and has paid attention to carrying out research.“Innovation and science technology are not separate sectors. If they stick together, start-up ideas will have more chances of success and research will be soon applied to practice,” he said.Phạm Hồng Quất, head of National Agency for Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialisation Development, Ministry of Science and Technology proposed Việt Nam should create mechanisms and grant autonomy to universities in terms of start-up investment.Associate Professor Trần Xuân Tú, head of Department of Science, Technology and International Relations of University of Engineering and Technology under Việt Nam National University - Hà Nội, said government should offer assistance and call for investment from businesses to develop start-ups at universities, he said.The workshop was co-organised by the Australian Embassy in Việt Nam and Vietnamese Ministry of Science and Technology within Skills and Innovation Week which runs from October 8 to 11.The week is an opportunity for policy makers, knowledge institutes, associations and enterprises to discuss challenges in developing the Vietnamese innovation system and to learn more about best practices from Australia in encouraging economic growth through innovation. — VNS'",1
3783,'9 companies launch Packaging Recycling Organisation Vietnam',"'HCM CITY — Nine leading companies in the consumer goods and packaging industries joined hands to launch the coalition Packaging Recycling Organization Vietnam in HCM City on June 21.PRO Vietnam seeks to help create to a clean, green and beautiful country by driving the circular economy and making recycling of packaging more accessible and sustainable.The coalition marks the first time that competing businesses are collaborating in Việt Nam to collectively work on improving the environment.The nine include Coca-Cola, FrieslandCampina, La Vie, Nestlé, NutiFood, Suntory PepsiCo, Tetra Pak, TH Group, and URC.PRO Vietnam will work towards its ambition through four pillars of activities: educating consumers on recycling awareness and segregation, strengthening the existing packaging collection eco-system, supporting recycling programmes of processors and recyclers, and working with the Government in the “Recycle” aspect of 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle).Through its voluntary public-private partnership it aims to improve livelihoods and create jobs for individuals and businesses working on post-consumer packaging.It will also coordinate with research institutions to find the most suitable solutions for the environment.Phạm Phú Ngọc Trai, the first chairman of PRO Vietnam, said the founding members of PRO Vietnam are united in their mission.“PRO Vietnam’s ambition is that by 2030 all packaging materials put into the market by its members is collected for recycling.”Urban solid waste is forecast to increase by 38 per cent from 11.6 million tonnes in 2016 to 15.9 million tonnes in 2030, according to the World Bank.Việt Nam is one of the five largest contributors of plastic waste in the ocean, its share being 280,000 tonnes a year.Trade data shows that the country was until recently heavily reliant on imports of scrap plastic and paper as feedstock for its recycling industries.With the growth in waste generation, this challenge of packaging waste is likely to worsen without concerted public-private intervention.Thus the need to support a packaging collection and recycling eco-system which can increase recycling rates and reduce packaging leakage has become imperative. — VNS'",4

Talks were at an early stage and terms could change, they said.In Việt Nam, Aviva started operating in the life insurance in 2011. It was formerly known as VietinBank Aviva – a joint venture between Aviva and Commercial Joint Stock Bank for Industry and Trade of Vietnam (VietinBank).As of April 2017, Aviva completed the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in VietinBank and officially wholly owned the unit. It signed an exclusive 18-year agreement to distribute life insurance products through VietinBank’s network. Thus, if the transfer is successful, VietinBank will have a new partner.Commercial Joint Stock Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (Vietcombank) is also likely to announce an insurance distribution agreement with a foreign partner in the near future as it was reported that Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li’s FWD Group has surpassed many rivals, including Prudential, to co-operate with Vietcombank.Vietcombank is expected to receive an initial payment of about $400 million from the deal and could get more based on the performance of the business. Previously, Bloomberg estimated that the total agreed value may reach $1 billion, the biggest bancassurance deal to date.Meanwhile, it was reported that Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam (BIDV) is also exploring selling its stake in a life insurance joint venture with MetLife Inc.In early September, two life insurance firms with large market shares in Việt Nam, including Prudential and Manulife, also officially announced their new banking partners.On September 9, Asia Commercial Joint Stock Bank (ACB) and Manulife held a signing ceremony for a co-operation agreement on the distribution of insurance products. Accordingly, during the initial rollout, ACB customers will have access to Manulife’s two key life insurance products – one unit-linked and the other a critical illness product called ‘Enhance’.On the same day, Prudential Vietnam Assurance also signed a bancassurance agreement with Korea’s Shinhan Bank Vietnam Ltd to distribute its life insurance solutions. Shinhan is the seventh bank in Prudential’s bancassurance network.Experts have so far remained upbeat about the Vietnamese insurance industry’s health in the coming years, forecasting that it would maintain an annual double digit growth rate. The insurance industry expects a growth rate of 20 per cent this year.The fast-growing domestic insurance market should thrive thanks to rising living standards and a high gross domestic product (GDP) growth of more than 6 per cent annually over the next three years, experts said.The growth potential is great as the country has one of the world’s lowest life insurance penetration levels at less than 1 per cent of GDP. The average insurance premium in Việt Nam stands at $30, much lower than the global average of $595 and Southeast Asia’s average of $74.The Ministry of Finance’s Insurance Supervisory Authority reported that the country has 64 insurance companies, including 30 non-life insurers, 18 life insurers, two reinsurance companies and 14 insurance brokerage companies.

4623,'Netflix wants to produce in Việt Nam',"HÀ NỘI Netflix wants to produce content in Việt Nam, said CEO of Netflix Reed Hastings in a meeting with Minister, Chairman of the Office of the Government Mai Tiến Dũng in Busan, South Korea on Monday.The Office of the Government reported that its chairman emphasised the need to build institutions and policies to attract foreign investment into Việt Nam.He welcomed the co-operation of foreign partners in film production with the country, and hoped Netflix would build an official presence in Việt Nam.Netflix was present in Singapore three years ago, then Tokyo (Japan), Mumbai (India), Seoul (South Korea) and the future would be in Việt Nam, said the Netflix CEO.Việt Nam had a high rate of internet users, many of whom use online entertainment services, he added. Therefore, he also believed that Netflix would grow in the country.Welcoming Netflix to invest in Việt Nam soon, Minister, Chairman of the Office of the Government Mai Tiến Dũng said that with a population of nearly 100 million and about 60 million internet users, the Vietnamese market had great potential for development.Television service products, including online services, were in high demand in the country, he noted.Dũng suggested Netflix produce films and shows in Việt Nam.Netflix bought the copyright for Hai Phượng (Furie) starring Ngô Thanh Vân (Veronica Ngo) after its successful premiere in the US.He also said that Việt Nam was currently continuing to complete institutions for businesses to increase investment in this area. Therefore, he wanted Netflix to exchange experience in this sector.The Vietnamese Government always listened and cared about the problems of investors, he said.Earlier in August, Netflix's managing director for Asia Pacific Kuek Yu-Chuang had a meeting with Minister of Information and Communications Nguyễn Mạnh Hùng.Chuang said that Netflix wanted to invest in Việt Nam and was\xa0committed to complying\xa0with Vietnamese laws and paying adequate taxes.He also suggested a Memorandum of Understanding be\xa0inked between Netflix and the ministry on buying Vietnamese films to air on its network, co-operating in human resource training and exporting Vietnamese films to international markets.Netflix is one of the largest media service providers in the world with around 151 million registered accounts from 190 nations and territories. — VNS",5

33,'Experts gather to discuss anti-corruption',"'HÀ NỘI — The enormous demand for infrastructure investment across Asia-Pacific had led to greater risks of corruption, Deputy Inspector General Trần Ngọc Liêm said yesterday.He made the remarks in the opening speech of the 10th regional conference on preventing and combatting corruption in infrastructure projects in Asia-Pacific that took place in Hà Nội. The four-day conference has been jointly organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government Inspectorate of Việt Nam.Liêm said that building and developing infrastructure was deemed the backbone of economic growth, laying the foundations for the Government to provide basic public services for the people.“Investment demand for infrastructure in many countries in Asia-Pacific through large-scale projects has shot up dramatically in recent years, but it also brings with it greater risks of corruption,” he said.“It is a big challenge that many Asia-Pacific countries and nations around the world are dealing with.”Diana Torres, Project Manager, Transparency and Accountability at UNDP in Asia and the Pacific, said that estimations from the Global Infrastructure Hub (GIH) expected as much as US$97 trillion was required for global infrastructure investment by 2040, but there was a shortfall of about $18 trillion.The thirst for infrastructure funding would even be exacerbated as up to 30 per cent of the resources for infrastructure was going to be lost through mismanagement, inefficiency and on corruption, said Torres.“Poor governance, lack of transparency and corruption can undermine any efforts (for quality infrastructure development) due to weak human resources, increased operational costs and the selection of unqualified contractors,” she said.VCCI Chairman Vũ Tiến Lộc said the conference would offer the country ideas to prevent and combat corruption, especially in the relationship between the Government and the business community.“Integrity is the heart of the business community. Integrity means doing business in a fair and square manner, or in other words, abiding by general principles, “ Lộc told the conference.He also said the business community had to be fully aware of the role of integrity while working with the Government in order to eliminate the so-called culture of greasing the wheels. — VNS'",0

It reached the purple level with AQI of 272 at 6.30am.Hoàng Dương Tùng, chairman of the Vietnam Clean Air Partnership, said it was abnormal and\xa0needed careful research to find out why, he said.Tùng warned that people should limit morning exercises that would lead to them inhaling more\xa0dust.He added that monitoring in the country remained\xa0limited. Hà Nội has two fixed stations whereas HCM City has none.Air pollution in Việt Nam is caused by fine dust, specifically known as PM2.5, which is particulate matter that can be found in the air and\xa0is incredibly small.\xa0A\xa0single particle has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres. At this microscopic size, when inhaled, they penetrate directly into the bloodstream and travel to important internal organs.Direct contact with PM2.5 can lead to serious respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. A PM2.5 pollution index of\xa012 microgrammes per cubic metre is considered to be at a safe level. This index is equivalent to AQI level 50.The AQI is a metric used by multiple governmental agencies to determine how polluted the air is. An AQI level above 100 is considered polluted or unhealthy for humans. Children and people with respiratory and heart diseases are recommended to avoid outdoor activities when AQI levels reach 150 or above. — VNS'",1

Both of them use lacquer panels as the foundation for the artworks.Thắng carves shapes onto the lacquer panel then paints on the surface, while Thịnh paints on lacquer panels or, sometimes, canvas. He follows the steps of traditional lacquer art such as forming;\xa0inlaying gold and silver leaves, eggshells and mother of pearl;\xa0sanding; shining and polishing.“Some people consider lacquer panels as the material for a lacquer artwork, like paper, canvas and silk, while some people value it as an inseparable part that constitutes the quality of artworks,” said Thắng.“To me, wooden lacquer panels play a decisive role in making a perfect lacquer painting, and if I don’t have a good panel, I don’t want to paint.”“In an effort to modernise lacquer art, many artists have tried to reduce the weight of wooden panels, change the graphic style and renovate the colours used in lacquer,” said Thắng.“I highly appreciate that effort, because lacquer plays a role as Vietnamese cultural identity in contemporary fine arts.”While Thắng stays loyal to traditional slender, shy and discreet postures, Thịnh shows a different social and aesthetic view on modern women. Thắng’s paintings include the romantic love that seems to echo from the old days. Thịnh’s paintings evoke rapid rhythms and more fiercely sensual emotions of today’s love.“We started with traditional lacquer and wanted to develop it to adapt to the new era. We are not all conservative and are willing to change painting materials, to change the way of shaping and drawing to have contemporary feelings,” said Thắng. “That is our contribution to the development of Vietnamese lacquer art in the context of contemporary fine arts.”The exhibition will run until August 11 at VICAS Art Studio, 32 Hào Nam Street, Hà Nội. — VNS'",5

4807,'Early Renaissance painting found in French kitchen fetches 24 mn euros',"'SENLIS, France — A rare masterpiece by Italian early Renaissance master Cimabue that was discovered in a French kitchen was sold on Sunday for 24 million euros (US$26.6 million), about five times the initial estimate.The Acteon auction house did not identify the winning bidder for the painting, Christ Mocked, at the sale in Senlis, outside Paris.The selling price, which included costs, smashed the initial estimate of between four million and six million euros.Bidding began at three million euros, with only three of the eight bidders present at the auction.It is the first time in decades that a painting by Cimabue, a pioneering primitive painter who lived from 1272-1302 and is also known as Cenni di Pepo, has gone under the hammer.Acteon said the figure was the highest ever reached for a mediaeval painting and the eighth-highest ever reached for a mediaeval or old master painting.The highest figure ever reached for a painting was the $450 million paid for the Salvator Mundi attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and sold at auction in 2017.Experts in September announced the sensational discovery of the painting by Cimabue which was owned by a woman in the northern French town of Compiegne, who had it hanging between her kitchen and her sitting room.She believed it was merely an old religious icon when she took it to the auctioneers to be valued.Rare example of a CimabueThe tiny unsigned work, measuring just 26 by 20 centimetres, was found to be in excellent condition, though covered in grime from having been displayed right above a cooking hotplate.Art experts at Turquin in Paris used infrared reflectology to confirm that the piece is part of a larger diptych from 1280, when Cimabue painted eight scenes of the passion and crucifixion of Christ. Each of the two panels in the diptych had four scenes.Only two other elements of the diptych are known to exist: ""The Flagellation of Christ"" displayed at the Frick in New York, and The Virgin and Child with Two Angels at the National Gallery in London.Cimabue is renowned for his mosaics, frescoes and altarpieces.Historians say only about a dozen works on wood – all unsigned – are thought to have been made by the Italian artist.His more natural and nuanced depictions marked a turning point for Italian painters still influenced by highly stylised Byzantine art.Art historians consider him a trailblazer for the creative Renaissance that would flourish under greats like Giotto, one of Cimabue\'s pupils. — AFP'",5
3722,'Hasty planning plunges tourism spots under water',"'KIÊN GIANG It may be unusual for hilly areas and islands surrounded by ocean to grapple with flooding, but historic floods last week in two of the country\'s best-known paradises,\xa0Phú Quốc Island and the city of\xa0Đà Lạt, sent local people and tourists into a nightmare scenario.The natural and human factors that caused the flooding will require deeper analysis to understand how best to balance growth and protecting the environment, but we can draw some initial conclusions.Architect Ngô Viết Nam Sơn blamed the floods on unsustainable planning of tourist areas that fail to leave space for water to drain.“Not only Đà Lạt and Phú Quốc, but many other urban areas in Việt Nam also ignore this important factor,” he said.“The two tourism spots were submerged as a consequence of ‘greedy’ urban development,"" he continued.\xa0""Concrete surfaces have sprung up for commercial purposes. Many have even filled up canals, ditches, lakes and rivers for business purposes and ignored spaces for water drainage.”The island district of Phú Quốc in southern Kiên Giang Province, dubbed the pearl island, was hit by\xa0torrential rains which resulted in the heaviest floods in 100 years.In the first 10 days of August alone\xa0the island experienced more than\xa01,100mm of rain, estimated to be equivalent to half the rainfall it usually sees in an entire year.Water levels reportedly rose up to two metres. All activities from fishing to tourism on the 600sq.km island were paralysed. More than 8,400 houses were inundated with more than 2,000 people being relocated to safe places.Phú Quốc Airport flooded and was temporarily closed, preventing dozens of flights from landing.The total losses from\xa0the two consecutive floods on the island last week were\xa0estimated to reach more than VNĐ107 billion (US$4.6 million).The Central Highlands province of Lâm Đồng last week shared a similar\xa0fate\xa0with Phú Quốc, even though rainfall was reported to be at an average level.Although not exceptionally large, the prolonged rainstorms caused flooding of up to 1.5m in many areas including the tranquil tourist site of\xa0Đà Lạt. The flooding led to dramatic scenes, with more than 40 people in Lát Commune, Lạc Dương District having\xa0to hang onto a rope to escape after being stranded.Cam Ly Garbage Dump in Đà Lạt was one of the most seriously flooded areas. Until the rain finally stopped on Tuesday, the accumulated rainwater swept thousands of tonnes of rubbish down the hill, burying a local neighbourhood in up to five\xa0metres of waste in some areas.Nature and humansPhú Quốc authorities blamed the floods on streams and water drainage facilities that were overloaded by the\xa0rainwater that was accumulated over many days while the sewers were blocked by domestic waste.Mai Văn Huỳnh, secretary of Phú Quốc District’s Party Committee and chairman of the district’s People Committee, pointed out another factor that worsened the historic floods\xa0– densely-populated areas of new construction along the coast that stopped water from draining.The island has been developing rapidly thanks to an influx of investment and is at the core of the Government\'s effort to develop the nation into an international hub for tourism and finance.The plan to turn the country\'s biggest island into a special economic zone sent land prices skyrocketing. According to experts, development projects have spoiled the landscape, blocked streams and\xa0rivers and eliminated forests which acted as natural water storage.According to Phú Quốc’s Economic Zone Management Board, as of July this year, there have been nearly 300 projects with investments totalling\xa0VNĐ370 trillion ($16.1 billion) on the island. Most of them are real estate and resort projects.The longest and most stunning beaches like Khem, Dài, Trường and\xa0Gành Dầu no longer have their natural beauty. Areas around these beaches have been divided into smaller zones covering just dozens or hundreds of hectares\xa0to be sold\xa0to\xa0investors.Lê Hoàng Châu, president of HCM City’s Real Estate Association, said the Phú Quốc authorities had allowed rapid\xa0construction without considering whether existing infrastructure could keep up with the changes.“As a result there are\xa0a number of places where\xa0buildings are under construction even though there are no\xa0roads, water supply or drainage system,""\xa0Châu said.GreenhousesEnvironmental expert Lâm Ngọc Tuấn from Đà Lạt University told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper that flooding\xa0in Đà Lạt and neighbouring areas occurred with more frequency\xa0over the past\xa0seven years mostly because of the proliferation of greenhouses at\xa0hi-tech agricultural projects.""The areas which\xa0witnessed the most serious floods in Lâm Đồng were\xa0where trees were chopped down to make room for greenhouses,"" he said.\xa0""Destroying forests to grow vegetables is not as devastating as cutting trees to build greenhouses.""“Land where greenhouses are located can no longer absorb water. The rain hits plastic panels and pours down into streams, which makes water levels suddenly rise and creates floods with strong currents,” Tuấn explained.“If the rain is heavier, its consequences will be uncontrollable.”According to the latest statistics from\xa0Lâm Đồng’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, greenhouses make\xa0up 10,000ha out of 18,000 ha of vegetable and flower growing areas in\xa0the province.Greenhouses and net houses will continue to dominate the Central Highlands city as local authorities have targeted covering 75 per cent of vegetable growing areas and 90 per cent of flower areas with hi-tech projects by next year.Deforestation is expected to continue as demand grows for space to build greenhouses.\xa0The province has lost 90,000ha of forests since 2010. Forest coverage now stands at only 45 per cent.Lại Thế Hưng, head of the provincial Crop and Plant Protection Sub-department, said the greenhouse builders did not consider whether the location was suitable. When greenhouses are built in the wrong location, they limit the amount of water the land can absorb.In 2018, the local agriculture sector compiled a set of standards for greenhouse construction which included\xa0water drainage systems to deal with\xa0torrential rain. However, the regulation has not yet been implemented.SolutionsHeavy floods over the past week are likely to influence\xa0Phú Quốc authorities as they map out and approve future development plans.The district\'s chairman Mai Văn Huỳnh said: “We will invite experts to assess\xa0rain and wind capacity to map out climate change scenarios, adjust our plans\xa0and upgrade the water drainage system.”Associate Professor Lê Anh Tuấn, former deputy head of the Climate Change Research Institute under Cần Thơ University, said Phú Quốc should place less of a burden on the drainage system and save\xa0spaces\xa0to absorb\xa0water.“These solutions need to be taken into account by planners right now unless they want to see the island flooded more seriously in the future,”\xa0Tuấn said.Dr Vũ Ngọc Long, former head of the Southern Institute of Ecology, said Lâm Đồng and other Central Highlands provinces need to review a number of factors which serve as an important foundation to prevent floods, including\xa0whether new buildings\xa0change the landscape or\xa0reduce water absorbance capacity, urban construction density and the location of agricultural projects.

3887,'MoNRE rejects Hà Nội pollution report',"'HÀ NỘI — Hà Nội ranking as the second-worst polluted city in Southeast Asia was inaccurate, according to deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE), Võ Tuấn Nhân.Environmental pollution often occurred in winter and early spring or in December, January and February and might last until March, Nhân told a Government meeting in Hà Nội on Tuesday.According to results from observation stations of the Environment General Department, and 10 automatic air observation stations of the Hà Nội Natural Resources and Environment Department and reference data of the US Embassy’s station, the PM2.5 level exceeded the allowed threshold in the first quarter this year, he said.“The pollution of superfine particles occurring partially in Hà Nội was real”, said the deputy minister.“The increasing pollution was due to traffic density, many construction sites, factories and garbage burning activities”, he said.Earlier this week, the 2018 World Air Quality and Greenpeace and IQAir AirVisual’s Report reported that Hà Nội stood second in Southeast Asia in terms of air pollution, just behind Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.The report was made with data from dozens of air quality monitoring stations across the world.According to the report, up to 99 per cent of South Asian cities; 95 per cent of Southeast Asian cities and 89 per cent of those in East Asia surpassed the allowed PM2.5 levelPM2.5, also described as superfine particles, is a fraction of the width of a human hair, which is released from vehicles, industry and natural sources like dust.In Southeast Asia, Jakarta was the most polluted city with a PM2.5 level of 45.3 μg per cu.m. It was followed by Hà Nội with 40.8mg per cu.m.Nhân said the information was not accurate because the report just showed pollution results of 20 cities of four among 11 nations in the Southeast Asia.“So it was such a baseless conclusion”, he said.He admitted the city’s air was polluted and the municipal government had carried out measures to control the situation such as moving polluting factories out of the city.According to the Environment General Department, the air quality in Hà Nội in the first three months was at medium level.In outskirts areas or locations with many trees such as Long Biên, Mỹ Đình or Tây Mỗ, the air quality was good while the roads of Phạm Văn Đồng, Minh Khai or Hàng Đậu with dense traffic and construction activities air quality was at bad level.The PM2.5 level, which was measured daily, varied between 40-80 μg/cu.m. The level increased at rush hours, said the general department.The high humidity and fog slowed the air flow, so pollutants could not rise high in the atmosphere so the pollution was worse, according to the general department.In fact, pollution in Hà Nội and HCM City was not as bad as in many other Asian cities, per the department.Last year, the PM2.5 level of Hà Nội was 40.8 μg per cu.m, of HCM City – 26.9 μg per cu.m while in Dhaka of Bangladesh was at 97.1 μg per cu.m, India’s New Dehli – 113.5 μg per cu.m, and some cities of China, the levels ranged from 65.5 to 116 μg per cu.m, said the general department. – VNS'",4

3916,'Central province to restore forest for endangered langurs',"'QUẢNG NAM — The central province plans to allocate a fund of VNĐ100 billion (US$4.4 million) to restore a 100ha forest as a safe habitat for a herd of gray-shanked douc langurs (pygathrix cinerea) living in Đồng Cổ Village, Tam Mỹ Tây Commune of Núi Thành district in 2019-28.Vice chairman of the provincial people’s committee, Lê Trí Thanh said the state budget would provide 60 per cent for the fund, while the remainder would be taken from NGOs or community and businesses.Thanh said the fund would help isolate human activities on log farms in the area from the gray-shanked douc langurs, and conserve 30ha natural forest as a safe shelter for the endangered primates.The fund would be used for compensation of 70ha acacia log farm of 30 households living in six villages in the area.As planned, the province would design the habitat of the langurs as an eco-tour site in serving for research and the primates study centre among conservationists in the world and Việt Nam.The province, in co-operation with the Centre of Biodiversity Conservation, GreenViet and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), plans to include the forest area as part of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Green Annamites Project.According to the province, the Green Annamites Project will be invested with approximately US$24 million in Quảng Nam and Thừa Thiên-Huế provinces in assisting Việt Nam’s transition to climate-smart and low-emission development through improved forest protection, enhanced biodiversity conservation, and increased resilience of communities in 2016-20.Currently, the herd of the langurs has been narrowed in a 10ha primary forest as the fast growing development of acacia log farm – one of the most profitable woods in the central region.In a recent report by the province’s Forest Protection Division, a herd of about 50 gray-shanked douc langurs was found living in the forest over the past 10 years.Local community and the district ranger force established a voluntarily team to protect the endangered primates from being hunted in recent years.According to experts from the Frankfurt Zoological Society’s Việt Nam Primate Conservation Programme, some 1,000 gray-shanked doucs have been found in forests of five provinces, including Quảng Nam, Quảng Ngãi, Bình Định, Kon Tum and Gia Lai.The gray-shanked douc langur is listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list as one of the world’s 25 critically endangered primates.Last year, the province allocated nearly 19,000ha for an elephant conservation centre in two communes – Quế Lâm and Phước Ninh – in the mountainous Nông Sơn district. — VNS'",4
1995,"'Fast-growing Bình Dương appeals to local, foreign investors'","'Bồ Xuân HiệpBÌNH DƯƠNG — As one of the fastest-growing provinces in the southern key economic zone and among Việt Nam’s hottest investment destinations, Bình Dương is opening its doors to investors in a diverse range of fields.Trần Thanh Liêm, chairman of the province’s People’s Committee, said: “Bình Dương Province has all the conditions needed to become one of Asia’s most attractive investment destinations. With its modern infrastructure, it has become one of the leading localities in attracting FDI (foreign direct investment) in Việt Nam.”As Việt Nam’s emerging gateway for technology, trade and services, the province is well positioned to serve as a commercial hub for Southeast Asian economies, he added.The province is the most vibrant business region in the country, with a growth rate 1.5 times faster than the country as a whole, according to Liêm.Investment in a wide range of fields, including industry, trade and services, education, and human resources, is now being sought.Just two decades ago, Bình Dương was an agricultural area with modest infrastructure, but now is the third largest FDI destination in the country, behind only HCM City and Hà Nội.More than 3,700 FDI projects from 64 countries and territories operate in the province.“Investment priorities are in the high-tech industry, supporting industry, IT, precision engineering, trade, and services,” Liêm said.“Bình Dương is proud to host the Horasis again this year as the country aims to become an export economy that is growing rapidly and providing more high-paying jobs,” he said.Bình Dương New City, where the event opens today, is a 45-minute drive from HCM City’s Tân Sơn Nhất international airport.Many CEOs and investors from Southeast Asia, Japan, South Korea, India and other parts of the world have been invited to Bình Dương to look at the huge FDI opportunities there.Horasis Chairman and Founder Frank-Jürgen Richter said that Bình Dương had sufficient “hard” infrastructure but now would need “soft infrastructure” such as more high quality human resources, and would need to continue to catch up with more developed countries in Asia and other regions.Nguyễn Văn Hùng, chairman of Becamex IDC, noted that Horasis was one of the most important events which Bình Dương was proud to host and would be vital to the smart-city plan of Bình Dương.According to Don Lam, CEO of VinaCapital, besides good infrastructure development, competitive labour costs, and good training facilities, Bình Dương is known for its proactive and pro-business authorities.Bình Dương jumped from 14th in 2017 to sixth nationwide in 2018 in the 2018 Provincial Competitiveness Index from the Việt Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In the southeast region, Bình Dương has surpassed HCM City and is now in first place, with a score of 66.09 points on a scale of 100 in 2018.“The time is ripe for us to talk about Bình Dương’s potential to attract investors and investment,” Lam said.Smart city schemeBình Dương Smart City is part of the Bình Dương Smart Zone project that includes fast-growing localities such as Thủ Dầu Một City, Dĩ An Town, Thuận An Town, Tân Uyên Town, and Bến Cát Town.Launched in 2016, the smart city scheme is a major part of the province’s “breakthrough” development programmes. Its core mission is to build interaction between the state, scientists and entrepreneurs.To execute the project, the province has coordinated with Eindhoven City in the Netherlands, as well as the South Korean city of Daejon and the World Technopolis Association.Under the smart city scheme, Bình Dương aims to strengthen workers’ skills and education; expand R&D activities and build a start-up eco-system; attract more FDI in high-tech manufacturing; and improve transport, the ICT infrastructure, the business climate and people’s living conditions.Bình Dương New City will be the centre of the smart province and house the most important urban areas, and research and educational institutions, as well as industrial zones.Bình Dương Smart City is home to a growing number of Techlabs and Fablabs located in schools, universities and vocational colleges around the province. The labs collaborate closely with industrial partners and the province’s Department of Science and Technology.Techlabs offer practical education in the latest technology, including equipment provided by industry partners. They also provide a space for joint research projects between universities and local employers.Bình Dương’s Techlabs include a lighting lab at Eastern International University, a mechanical electrical lab at Việt Nam-Singapore Vocational College and an ICT lab at Thủ Dầu Một University, with a robotics and intelligent systems lab, a power electronics system lab, and a data analysis and artificial intelligence lab in the works.Bình Dương also aims to join the Intelligent Community Forum (ICF) before 2021, which will allow it to link up with a network of 160 smart provinces and cities around the world.Local agencies have been told to prioritise projects related to semiconductors and LED lighting projects, and e-government. Provincial agencies will seek more partnerships with neighbouring cities and provinces, as well as businesses and local and international experts, to help with the project.Bình Dương was the only area in Việt Nam named as one of the world’s Smart21 communities of 2018 by the New York-based Intelligent Community Forum, a non-profit policy research organisation focused on job creation and economic development in the broadband economy.Last year the province hosted the World Technopolis Association Summit 2018, attracting around 100 members from the World Technopolis Association from nearly 50 countries and territories. — VNS'",2

4257,'VN seeks to boost environmentally friendly brick production',"'HÀ NỘI — Province and city authorities have been told to stop investment in fired clay brick production and to prioritise investment in other environmentally friendly construction materials.The order was one of the highlights of a recent official paper issued by the Deputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng. The paper followed a month of study and the consideration of feedback at a national conference on the development of construction materials held in mid-December.It is estimated that in 2020, Việt\nNam\ncould need as many as 42 billion bricks for construction works. In the next 10 years, the total output could reach 330 billion clay bricks, requiring up to 40 million tonnes of coal to process. The brick production will release into the atmosphere 148 tonnes of green house gases amongst other pollutants. The unfired counterpart, however, don’t have such a large environmental footprint, as they don’t require the use of natural clay or\xa0burning of fossil fuels.Việt\nNam\n’s rapid economic growth continues to generate enormous demands for infrastructure. The cost of construction materials alone takes up 30-50 per cent of the total budget for infrastructure investment. There are also the hidden costs stemming from the environmental impacts at every step of the materials’ ‘life cycle’: mineral mining, manufacturing, construction, use and demolition.Therefore, “developing sustainable material construction will bring beneficial contributions to socio-economic development,” the paper says.The new order to contain the expansion of conventional fired bricks comes seven years after a programme (Decision No 567/QĐ-TTg) aiming at encouraging the production and use of unfired materials was launched in 2010 with a vision towards 2020.The programme aimed to substitute at least 20-25 per cent of fired clay materials with unfired variants by 2015 and 30-40 per cent by 2020. The construction ministry’s data showed that in 2017, the country produced some seven billion standardised unfired bricks, or 28 per cent of the total bricks produced.While the first-phase target was achieved, construction authorities said the latter target might be elusive for several reasons. The unfired bricks are relatively more expensive, the public retains a cautious attitude towards new products and enforcement is weak, the\xa0Vietnam News Agency\xa0reported.Phạm Văn Bắc, head of construction materials department under the Ministry of Construction, said that the raw materials to produce unfired bricks are ash, slag, plaster, stones and other industrial and construction wastes, which are all easily accessible due to the country’s ongoing modernisation and industrialisation process.Towards the end of 2017, 40 million tonnes of ash and flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD), a byproduct of the desulphurization process in coal burning plants, remain unhandled in the country. Another 15 million tonnes are expected to be added to this figure annually. But expanding unfired brick production could chip away at the waste.“If this enormous amount of waste is not properly handled, it will be a burden on the environment as vast tracts of land would be needed to store [it]. However, this waste would be a boon to the production of unfired bricks. Two birds with one stone,” Nguyễn Minh Tuấn, deputy general director of Viglacera, a State-controlled construction materials company that has received praise from the government for its efforts in pioneering unfired materials, told\xa0Thời báo tài chính Việt Nam online newspaper.Deputy PM Trịnh Đình Dũng has asked all relevant ministries and State agencies to thoroughly review the implementation of the 2010 programme and to make appropriate amendments to State management regulations to help the programme achieve its targets.The Ministry of Construction has been told to work with the Ministry of Science and Technology in develop new building materials that are affordable, high quality and “green, consistent with climate change adaptation policies.”Deputy PM Dũng also ordered environment agencies to boost inspection and monitoring of mineral extraction, especially sand mining near estuaries, an activity that has drawn public criticism over its environmental impacts.The report also asks for the quick completion of several plans to be submitted to the Prime Minister. The plans include one on developing the cement production industry in Việt Nam, an accompanying master plan on surveying, processing and using mineral natural resources to produce cement, and a project to develop construction materials for use in coastal and island areas.The Ministry of Finance shall review and amend policies on natural resource taxes, export taxes and environment protection fees to ensure the sustainable development of construction materials; to craft incentives to encourage businesses to reduce the use of mineral resources and instead use materials from waste and new green materials. — VNS'",4

5342,'Creative centre promotes development',"'Hanoi Creative City is the largest creative complex in Hà Nội. Launched in September 2015, it brings together organisations, businesses, individuals, products and services as well as creative activities.Bảo Khánh, reporter from Hà Nội Mới’s Weekend,\xa0interviews architect Đoàn Kỳ Thanh, who is one of Hanoi Creative City’s founders.How do you assess the creative industry in Việt Nam?The creative industry has prevailed in the world for a long time, while in Việt Nam this concept is still quite new. In fact, the creative industry is not something that is far away. What people imagine is turned into a product through their hands. It is creative industry.But to be creative it is necessary to create an environment for creativity to grow and develop. That environment requires transparency in intellectual property rights. Certain creators must be protected for the products they create. That is the motivation to encourage and acknowledge the efforts and talent of creative people.The creative industry has been showing its great contribution to the GDP of nations. In developed countries, the creative industry even accounts for the largest proportion. Innovative industries in countries such as Japan or Singapore contribute greatly and have high growth rates.The creative industry only appeared\xa0in Việt Nam recently. Compared to other countries in the region, we have been delayed by one step.Recently, the Hà Nội Committee\'s Commission\'s for Publicity and\xa0Education organised a workshop to assess and re-examine the benefits of creative spaces in urban areas and the role of creative activities in socio-economic development.This recognition shows the changing perception of managers about the role of creative spaces in socio-economic development and their contribution to the creative industry.However, there needs to be specific policies and missions.What is the most important thing for creators?It is tolerance. In the office of Hanoi Creative City, we put the word ""tolerant"" at the highest level to remind our colleagues that to be creative, there must be tolerance to accept the ‘new’. Only tolerance makes people accept the difference of others. Then the difference and tolerance will be the cornerstone of creativity.So where should we start?The first thing that can be done right now is to create hubs that connect resources together.The Vietnamese game Flappy Bird was very successful. To be like that people need to create, write music, graphics, sales and marketing, communications, etc. There must be a lot of capacity to be together to create a product that can convince the market.For that, first, there must be creative hubs, infrastructure, which are hubs for people to share with each other.This is very suitable for the knowledge economy that our country and the world are pursuing. Sharing resources, opportunities or legal issues and governance will create an entrepreneurial ecosystem.A business that starts will cost a lot but if it joins hubs it can reduce costs and spend resources investing in innovation and development.Hà Nội should create creative hubs. It can be seen that the benefits of innovative hubs are to connect the resources that inspire society and those who inspire creativity, attract tourism, and promote trade and production.All these are socially beneficial when people; tourists and the youth in particular enjoy and consume innovative products. It also contributes to the economy. These hubs will create many other opportunities.What role does traditional cultural heritage play in creative hub development?In fact, creators always consider cultural heritage as an asset, an inspiration, and a material to create from.Selling products is just a normal business. We need to sell cultural products and sell ""joy"". To sell cultural products people must know how to exploit and use culture appropriately.Cultural and creative heritage need each other because creators need these materials. In particular, the more the original elements are kept, the more people benefit economically and commercially.So what role does the creative hub play in developing the creative industry?The art district is a place where young people have a place to play, enjoy art and interact with artists. Hà Nội does not have such art districts.Art districts are where artists show, experiment and commercialise their art products and bring them to the public faster and more efficiently.Hoàn Kiếm District seems to form a creative hub with cultural heritage spaces such as book streets, walking streets or mural streets.In addition to creating creative spaces and cultural spaces, these creative hubs also contribute to preserving heritage spaces and developing tourism.Hà Nội used to have Zone 9. It once attracted many tourists. Tourists could watch, drinking coffee, buying some items and painting and watching artists work.In your opinion how should we connect traditional culture to youth?Many artists around the world and in Việt Nam have done that. There needs to be creative hubs or art districts to have space for the creators show their artworks.Young people today do not have or have very few opportunities to access and transform traditional values. They don’t see and they are not inspired to get to know and like traditional culture.I believe that if there are spaces for artists to perform surely young people will love traditional culture.

His goal was to attract as many users as those of foreign social networks in Việt Nam – most notably,\xa0Facebook.“After one year, Vietnamese social networks have gained growth of 30 per cent with some 65 million users,” the minister said.Three new domestic social networks, namely Lotus, Gapo and Hahalolo, were introduced within months in 2019, joining in the race to attract users against other Vietnamese networks Zalo and Mocha as well as the biggest player being\xa0Facebook. The US social network has between 60 and 65 million monthly active users, according to the company.“Now what we think, say, buy and even whom we love, all can be found on social networks. It means that the Vietnamese’ brains are staying in one place and it’s not in Việt Nam,” Hùng said.“What will they (foreign networks) do with it? It’s a very dangerous matter, a matter of national security.”The minister, however, affirmed that the Government did not set the goal of replacing foreign social networks with domestic ones.“Việt Nam has integrated and opened for investment. But anyone in Việt Nam to do business must abide by Vietnamese law and make Việt Nam more prosperous. Foreign social networks can exist alongside domestic ones if they follow Vietnamese law,” Hùng told the NA. — VNS'",0

But then his film was stolen.“I could not claim back the copyright when the film was stolen, even though I had registered copyright for the film,” he said.Phần, who has also worked with foreign partners, said foreign companies have clear contracts on the benefits of the author after two, five and 10 years.“Though I’m wondering a bit whether the association will work well, I really hope it will strictly follow the law and protect members’ rights,” he said. — VNS'",5

She also appreciated the European nation’s assistance in boosting relations with international financial and monetary organisations.Crown Princess Victoria voiced her delight at the development of bilateral connections, noting it was her first visit to Việt Nam.

3042,'From ruthless to spineless',"'By Paul KennedyFormer Manchester United player Ryan Giggs was in Việt Nam\xa0over the weekend, his second visit this year.I know this because on Sunday my Facebook blew up with photographs of friends of mine with Ryan at various spots in Hà Nội.One particular picture stood out from the rest. It showed the current Wales manager outside New York Sports Bar on Bà Triệu posing with Rory Price, the bar’s general manager.At first glance it was a pretty innocuous snap, but on closer inspection, you can see Giggs has his hand on Rory’s chest covering the emblem on his shirt.Why? Simple, Rory’s a Liverpool FC supporter and Giggs rightly so, hates Liverpool.A bit of fun? Maybe, but it also proved to me how Ryan Giggs will be Manchester United through and through until the day he dies.How many of current team who were beaten on Sunday by West Ham can say the same? I’ll give you a clue, the answer is none.United on Sunday were nothing short of appalling. They have been for ages, but Sunday’s gutless effort was diabolical.Sure, they were missing Paul Pogba, but he’s far more miss than hit and is desperate to leave, and the same can be said for another absentee, Anthony Martial, who for me always has a look on his face like he has just spotted a friend who owes him money.Seeing Giggs happily posing for pictures after United’s dire display, made me think of the brilliant United team he played with. In fact let’s get things straight here, Giggs didn’t play for a brilliant United team, he was part of a brilliant United generation.And right now, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad are years away from emulating, or even getting close, to the United of days gone by.From the mid-1990s Manchester United were a well-oiled machine being driving to the ends of the earth by Sir Alex Ferguson, crushing everyone in their path.They were completely ruthless, and now, they are just spineless.Sure, there were blips along the way and they faced tough competition from first Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal and later from Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea, but on the whole United are the greatest team of the last 20 years, just like Liverpool were 20 years before then.Liverpool aretop the table right now, and are Champions of Europe. They are not just 10 points ahead of United, but a gigantic chasm in front of their north west rival.So how do United turn the corner? How do they get back to where they once where? How do they get back onto the perch they’ve clearly been knocked off?The answer is they won’t. Or at least they won’t for a very long time.Judging by the weekend performance they are miles away from breaking into the top four and the closest they’ll ever get to the Champions League is by visiting the Etihad Stadium on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening.They are worse now than they were when Mourinho was the manager. Worse than when Louis van Gaal was the manager and worse than when David Moyes was the manager.United fans sing: “Ole’s at the wheel, how good does it feel?”Well on Sunday they for sure were not feeling good by any stretch of the imagination.Solskjaer was a fantastic player, a legendary striker at Old Trafford but as far as managing the club goes, the wheels have fallen off.Next week they play Arsenal, then a trip to Newcastle, followed by a home match against Liverpool.Even if they win all three, which they won’t, it will not be enough.The club needs an overhaul. It needs a new coach, new players, new backroom staff and, after listening to United fans, new owners and a new board.They are exactly what Liverpool were in the early 90s. A spent force clinging on to past glories.They need players who care more about the club than they do about their newly formed fashion brands or social media followers.The need players like Ryan Giggs, an entire squad of them. And that will take years to find. VNS'",3

I have spent more time with manual clearing work on grass and pests,” Tùng said.“Formerly, we had to have at least 15-days off after spraying herbicide, but now we work every day in the field by reducing chemical-based pesticide,” she said.The old farmer said she had to do more manual work, but suffered less exposure to toxic pesticides and weed-killer.She said the quality of vegetables has improved since urea was not used by farmers in the village now.Huỳnh Tấn Hoàng, 67, said using less chemical fertilier also helped cut 30 per cent of production costs.“Our safe vegetables are sold at the price\xa0two times as much as that of farm produce from other chemical-using\xa0farms. We also fill information into a daily field book before products are sealed and branded. It’s easy to track the source of products after sale\xa0through strict procedures and paperwork,” he said.“Only qualified vegetables will be collected by the Túy Loan co-operative on orders from supermarkets and shopping centres in the city.”Hoàng, however, said manual work occupied 80 per cent of production costs, so they needed machinery and innovation to cut\xa0labour costs.Đặng Thị Thanh Sang, a member of the co-operative, said at least 200kg of herbs and vegetables are harvested and packaged for delivery to big shopping centres in the city’s downtown daily.“We have connected with big trade centres – Big C, VinMart and international schools – in supplying qualified safe farm produce,” Sang said.“The co-operative helps farmers deliver their products to the market with a negotiated stable price. This means farmers do not need bring vegetable to the market themselves, while the co-operative helps them link up with\xa0trusted suppliers of seed and bio-fertiliser,” she said.Lê Mỹ, an official from the city’s Plant Protection sub-department, said useful bugs were bred to kill worm larvae at farms, while solar-powered pest catching lamps were installed to deal with caterpillars.Nguyễn Thanh Quang, from the city’s science and technology associations, said Túy Loan farmers have built links with 14 shopping centres and weekly farmers'\xa0fairs in the city to sell their produce.He said farmers did cross-check procedures for fertiliser and bio-pest spraying to ensure farm products are fresh and safe.Quang said the city has assigned seven safe farm zones to meet 30 per cent of the city’s vegetable demand.Nguyễn Quang Dũng, head of the Túy Loan Co-operative, said the farmers also plant flowers\xa0to attract bees and ants, while powdered lime was used to fight pest larvae.Dũng suggested hi-tech solutions such as drip irrigation, bio-pest automatic sprayers and agri-motors are needed to reduce manual work on farms.The Túy Loan Co-operative has\xa0also received supports from Rikcolto-funded project from Belgium to boost supply of safe vegetables.Hoàng Thanh Hải, co-ordinator of the RIKOLTO project, said it helped build a PGS system for farmers in the two farm zones as well as retail market links.The\xa01.1 million population in Đà\xa0Nẵng City\xa0consumes 145,000 tonnes of seafood and 140,000 tonnes of vegetables per year, but 70 per cent is supplied by neighbouring provinces of Lâm Đồng, Gia Lai, Kon Tum and Quảng Nam. — VNS",1

Total lending rose 19 per cent in the nine-month period to VNĐ57.8 trillion, and the NPL ratio fell to 2.87 per cent from 3.00 per cent.From January-September, MSB earned VNĐ2 trillion in\xa0total net revenue and VNĐ868 billion in\xa0post-tax profit. The figures were up 28 per cent and 350 per cent\xa0from last year.MSB shares are currently traded on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) market. Its shares traded at VNĐ10,500-10,600 ($0.45-0.46) on Tuesday.Previously, MSB shareholders had failed to offload their stakes. Those included the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC), the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) and the Vietnam Debt and Asset Trading Corporation (DATC).Meanwhile, the Vietnam Rubber Group – JSC (VRG) will become the third State-owned group to trade shares on HoSE after the National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) and insurance-finance firm Bảo Việt Holdings.VRG plans to move four billion shares from the Unlisted Public Company Market (UPCoM) to HoSE. The company has filed its listing to the southern bourse regulator for approval.VRG shares (UPCoM: GVR) ended Tuesday at VNĐ13,800 per share.The State in early 2018 cut its holding to 96.77 per cent in the firm’s charter capital from 100 per cent.VRG debuted on UPCoM in March 2018, becoming the largest firm in terms of charter capital. It has VNĐ76 trillion worth of total assets.After three quarters, the group recorded VNĐ12.95 trillion worth of total net revenue and VNĐ2.3 trillion in post-tax profit.Other companies that are switching to HoSE include Đức Giang Chemicals Group, Investment and Industrial Development Joint Stock Corporation (Becamex IDC), and Military Insurance Corporation.Market volatilityBusinesses have delayed HoSE-listing plans in 2019 because\xa0market conditions have been quite rough.The benchmark VN-Index on HoSE gained total 11.5 per cent to close Tuesday at 979.03 points year-to-date.Between January 3 and February 25, the VN-Index rose 13.2 per cent.But the benchmark has moved in a wide range between 943 points and 1,000 points ever since.Large-cap companies have been the driving factor for market growth, with\xa0the large-cap VN30-Index moving\xa0in the same direction as\xa0the VN-Index.The VN30-Index gained 7 per cent between January 3 and February 25 and 12 per cent year-to-date.Meanwhile, the mid-cap VNMID-Index and small-cap VNSML-Index have declined gradually since early March 2019.The Vietnamese stock market has been pressurised by negative developments of international markets such as the US-China trade war, the protest crisis in Hong Kong and concerns about the global economic recession. – VNS'",2

If I don\'t think I can win the match then I won\'t even step on the court,"" she said.Her confidence is justified. She has yet to drop a set at the tournament having played five matches, including three in qualifying.In her two matches in the main draw, she has been broken just once and committed a meagre 18 unforced errors.Despite that, Gauff insists she is staying grounded in the face of her sudden fame.She is unwinding by watching YouTube videos of make-up tips while giggling along to online pranks.Her phone is busy with goodwill messages.""One is (14-year-old actress) Navia Robinson. My little brother actually watches one of the shows she\'s on.""Storm Reid, another actor, she\'s in a new series \'Euphoria\',"" she explained to a generally mystified press corps.""Surprisingly social media relaxes me before the match. That\'s what I do. Not really Instagram so much. I just watch YouTube videos before my match. It gets me in a laughing spirit.""Despite her nods to everyday teenage past-times, Gauff insists she has a serious streak.During qualifying, where she played on a wildcard, she needed to complete a high school science exam.It\'s all part of her strong work ethic instilled in her by parents Corey and Candi Gauff, both successful college athletes.""They just told me, You have another match. The tournament\'s not over.Don\'t focus too much on what happened. My goal is to win it,"" she said.Practice is also key, even if it means driving herself harder and harder on the courts.""These last couple weeks, when they say, practice over, I say let\'s do one more. Hit the ball harder to me.""I was telling my training partner Courtney, I need you to hit the ball harder, we need to do more rounds.""I didn\'t know this would happen. Looking back on these few weeks, I can see how maybe that little extra time definitely helped.""Next up for Gauff is a last 32 clash against world number 60 Polona Hercog of Slovenia on Friday. — AFP'",3
4966,'£9.9mn chimp parliament painting smashes Banksy record',"'LONDON — A Banksy painting depicting the British parliament populated by chimpanzees smashed the record for the mysterious British street artist on Thursday, fetching nearly 9.9 million pounds, Sotheby\'s auction house said.The 2009 work entitled Devolved Parliament sold for 9,879,500 pounds (US$12.1 million) following a 13-minute battle between 10 different bidders.""Record price for a Banksy painting set at auction tonight. Shame I didn\'t still own it,"" the artist said on his Instagram account.The previous auction record for a Banksy artwork was $1.87 million, achieved by Keep it Spotless at Sotheby\'s New York in 2008.Devolved Parliament was expected to fetch 1.5 million to 2 million pounds in Thursday\'s sale.The oil painting measures 4.2 metres by 2.5 metres unframed – the largest known canvas by the anonymous artist.It shows chimpanzees on the green benches of the House of Commons, from the viewpoint of the main entrance.The sale comes after the controversial five-week suspension of Britain\'s parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson was deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court, with time running out before Britain is due to leave the European Union on October 31.Parliament was due to return on October 14 but instead reconvened on September 25 after Britain\'s highest court quashed the suspension.When parliament returned, MPs spent their time angrily arguing over the suspension, and then arguing about whether their language in doing so was too strong.Commons Speaker John Bercow said they were the most toxic scenes he had ever seen in his 22 years in the elected lower chamber.""Inevitably what we have been seeing in the Houses of Parliament over the last few months and weeks has become a daily soap opera, not just in the UK... but also across the rest of Europe and indeed the world,"" Alex Branczik, Sotheby\'s European head of contemporary art, said ahead of the sale.""What he\'s pointing to here is the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into tribalistic animalistic behaviour, the sort that we\'ve seen broadcasted on our televisions,"" said Branczik.""The real genius of Banksy is his ability to reduce this incredibly complex debate into one single simple image, which importantly is very readily shared in this age of social media and a very image-consuming population.""‘Tumultuous face of politics’Banksy first unveiled the painting, then entitled Question Time, a decade ago for an exhibition in his home city of Bristol, southwest England.He later reworked and retitled the painting, snuffing out the lights and making an upturned banana face downwards.The seller bought the painting from Banksy in 2011.""Potent and poignant, bold and brash, Banksy\'s monumental oil painting of the House of Commons offers a premonitory insight into the increasingly tumultuous face of politics in contemporary Britain,"" the sale catalogue says.""His derisive art has provoked divisive opinion, but love him or hate him, his wide-reaching influence on contemporary art and urban culture cannot be denied.""It also notes: ""This work is accompanied by a pest control certificate.""Banksy got the painting out again for March 29 this year, when Britain was originally due to leave the European Union.Thursday\'s auction took place almost a year after Banksy\'s Girl With The Balloon partially shredded itself as the hammer came down at Sotheby\'s, becoming the freshly titled Love Is In The Bin. — AFP'",5

It is difficult to explain this wonderful feeling. I am really proud!” Hoàng told Việt Nam News.“It was my first time competing in a 10-round fight and I faced a rival who had great physique and he was tough under my consecutive attempts.“He made me change my tactics so that I could box with him throughout 10 rounds.

Industrial projects were mainly concentrated in Hà Nội, Hải Phòng and Bắc Ninh such as Samsung, LG, Microsoft and Canon, and just stopped at processing and assembling with low added value, the PM noted.\n\nThe region should maintain its role as the country’s centre of politics, economics, culture and science-technology, and strive to become one of the nation’s two biggest economic hubs besides the key southern economic region, he said.\n\nThe region must take the lead in science-technology and innovation as well as economic restructuring, the PM added.\n\nHe also urged the region to push ahead with building rural areas and reforming administrative procedures, improving the business environment, preventing corruption and wastefulness, and ensuring social safety.\n\nRegional links were\xa0a focal point at the conference, with local\xa0leaders\xa0proposing several measures to promote regional connectivity.\n\nChairman of Hà Nội's People’s Committee Nguyễn Đức Chung submitted six key measures, emphasising the development of transport networks, industrial parks, clean water supplies, waste treatment, housing and environmental protection.\n\nChairman of Hưng Yên's People’s Committee Nguyễn Văn Phóng asked the\xa0Government to help\xa0Hà Nội and Hưng Yên implement transport projects, including connecting the\xa0Hà Nội – Hải Phòng and Cầu Giẽ – Ninh Bình expressways.\n\nLeaders from Quảng Ninh Province suggested speeding up the construction of the Hà Nội-Cái Lân railway and building a high-speed rail route linking Hà Nội, Hải Phòng and Quảng Ninh.\n\nThe northern key economic region, comprising Hà Nội, Hải Phòng, Bắc Ninh, Quảng Ninh, Hải Dương, Hưng Yên and Vĩnh Phúc, covers nearly 16,000 sq.km, making up 4.7 per cent of the country’s total area. It has a population of over 16 million, accounting for 17 per cent of the nation’s\xa0population.\n\nThe region boasts a modern and synchronous transport infrastructure network linking regional localities such as the Hà Nội – Hải Phòng, Hà Nội – Cầu Giẽ – Ninh Bình, Hà Nội – Thái Nguyên, Hà Nội – Lào Cai, and Hạ Long – Hải Phòng highways, along with domestic and international airports such as Nội Bài, Cát Bi and Vân Đồn, and important seaports like Lạch Huyện and Cái Lân.\n\nAccording to Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng, the region’s average gross regional development product (GRDP) growth exceeded 9 per cent in 2016-18.\n\nLast year, its total GRDP made up about 31.73 per cent of the country’s total, ranking second after the key southern economic region. The region contributed over 31 per cent to\xa0State budget\xa0revenue\xa0and accounted for over 30 per cent of national exports.\n\nThe total development investment in the region reached nearly VNĐ1.6 quadrillion (US$70 billion), making up 29.76 per cent of the country’s total investment.

1912,"'FTAs encourage food imports, investments in Việt Nam'","HÀ NỘI – Free trade agreements (FTAs)\xa0had\xa0created opportunities for food imports and foreign investment in the domestic food industry, according to experts.Countries with developed food processing industries\xa0such as Japan, the US and\xa0Australia and the EU have already\xa0promoted exports of their food products to Việt Nam.Last week in HCM City, 18 Canadian food companies met with\xa0potential partners.Keith Colwell, Nova Scotia’s Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, expressed his hope that the\xa0trip could provide\xa0opportunities for Canadian food companies to export their products to Việt Nam thanks to tariff reductions under\xa0the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).The minister told Thời báo Kinh doanh (Business Times) newspaper that Canadian food businesses had shifted their focus to Việt Nam after developments in the Chinese market.These companies want to bring high-end Canadian products like seafood, agricultural products and beverages to new markets like Việt Nam, Colwell\xa0said. Tariff reductions under the CPTPP had helped Canadian products become more competitive in Việt Nam’s market.Last year, Canada's agricultural and seafood exports to Việt Nam reached a turnover of CA$ 312.7 million (about US$235 million).In the first nine months of this year, Việt Nam imported more than 14,824 tons of pork with a total value of $29.2 million, much higher than the imports of 14,295 tonnes in volume and $23.6 million in value last year.According to Lê Hồng Minh, director of Vietrade’s Investment Promotion Centre for Industry and Trade, total FDI poured\xa0into Việt Nam’s food processing sector was estimated at $11.2 billion with 717 projects, excluding foreign investors buying shares or conducting merger and acquisitions.Foreign capital flows in the food industry were mainly from Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and China. These factories produced food for the domestic market and export.Most of FDI\xa0projects in the food processing sector were concentrated in big cities and provinces like Hà Nội, HCM City, Bình Dương, Đồng Nai and Long An.However, these FDI projects had\xa0little or no investment in developing raw materials, Minh said. Therefore, the industries supporting the food processing industry like cultivation and husbandry had\xa0not been developed according to modern standards.He said domestic raw materials did not meet the production requirements of FDI enterprises in the food processing sector. For example, the domestic dairy industry could only meet the 25 per cent of the domestic market demand, while the nation had to\xa0import 90 per cent of its cooking oil.According to experts, the State should encourage foreign invested projects in the food industry to transfer technology from\xa0developed countries in the fields of processing, packaging and preserving agricultural and aquatic products. – VNS",2

2578,'Different scenarios for VN-Index in Q4',"HÀ NỘI — Brokerages proposed different scenarios for the movement of VN-Index from now until the end of the year depending on the world's economic growth prospects.\nThe benchmark VN-Index on the Hồ Chí Minh Exchange slid 0.49 per cent to close at 987.59 points.\nThe index lost 1.03 last week.\nOn the Hà Nội Stock Exchange, the HNX-Index dropped 0.05 per cent to end Friday at 105.16 points, totalling a weekly rise of 0.37 per cent.\nAn average of 217.3 million shares were traded on each session last week, worth VNĐ4.8 trillion (US$204 million).\nAccording to BIDV Securities Company (BSC), based on the evaluation of domestic and foreign impact factors, the VN-Index can range from 940 to 1,050 points, of which the key price area is around 980 points.\n“We forecast that the VN-Index will rebound up to 1,015 - 1,025 points in October. If this short-term peak is not reached, the VN-Index is likely to return to accumulate around 980 points in November and recover gradually in December,” BSC said.\nIn the fourth quarter, BSC proposed two scenarios for VN-Index.\n“In a positive case, VN-Index closed above 1,000 points at the end of the year (an increase compared to 980 points in the six-month report). The trend is still moving around large-cap stocks, stocks that had full foreign ownership in the new index are expected to attract new foreign capital inflows.”\nIn the second scenarios, “VN-Index may drop below 960 points when encountering unfavourable news from the world and international capital flows are not strong enough to spread to markets.”\nIn September, foreign investors were net sellers on the HSX with VNĐ378.9 billion, and they net sold VNĐ28.4 billion on the HNX.\nIn Q3, foreign investors net bought VNĐ162.5 billion on the HSX, and net sold VNĐ413.3 billion on the HNX.\nAccording to Hoàng Thạch Lân, head of individual investor division at Việt Dragon Securities JSC (VDSC), the world was still in a state of instability.\n“When there's still no clear outcome to the ongoing trade war between the US and China, the US and EU are on the verge of a new tariff war, which will strongly affect the investment decisions of ETFs,” Lân said.\nThe stocks that contributed the most to the increase of VN-Index in the first nine months of this year were Vietcombank (VCB), Vingroup (VIC), Vinhomes (VHM) and PetroVietnam Gas JSC (GAS).\nVietcombank contributed 31.81 points (3.56 per cent) to the VN-Index. In nine months, VCB's share increased from VNĐ53,500 per share to VNĐ82,100 per share, equivalent to 53.5 per cent.\nVCB’s rally was attributed to positive business results. In the first six months of 2019, the bank's profit after tax reached VNĐ9 trillion, an increase of 41 per cent over the same period last year, continuing to maintain the leading position in the banking system's profits.\nVingroup (VIC) contributed to the VN-Index 23.98 points (2.69 per cent), while VHM added 17 points (1.92 per cent). After nine months, VIC shares increased by 25.7 per cent, VHM rose by 23.1 per cent.\nVingroup is still the largest enterprise in the stock market by capitalisation with VNĐ394.8 trillion. Vingroup operates in various fields of real estate, hospitality, retail, education, healthcare, car and smartphone manufacturing, artificial intelligence research.\nVinhomes, a subsidiary of Vingroup, achieved VNĐ26 trillion in revenue in the first six months this year, up 72 per cent year-on-year. Profit after tax reached VNĐ11 trillion, up 36.6 per cent year-on-year.\nIn the opposite direction, Bảo Việt Holdings (BVH) put the biggest pressure on VN-Index in the past nine months.\nBVH took away 3.02 points (0.34 per cent) of VN-Index by reducing by nearly 6 per cent in nine months, from VNĐ89,000 per share to VNĐ74,800 per share.\nAfter-tax profit of BVH reached only VNĐ670.8 billion in after-tax profit, down 20 per cent over the same period last year. — VNS",2
2070,'10-year-old Keieijuku proves to be successful business course',"HÀ NỘI — Some 400 entrepreneurs across the country gathered in Hà Nội on November 15 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Keieijuku Business Course.Keieijuku is a course provided for managers of Vietnamese enterprises. It is organised by the Việt Nam-Japan Institute for Human Resouces Development (VJCC) and supported by the Japan International Co-operation Agency.The 10-month course focus on providing participants with the opportunity to learn and acquire practical knowledge and tools for\xa0business administration. Learners can also create links with Japanese enterprises during and after their time in Japan. The knowledge they got from the programme is expected to help enterprises renovate and improve their business and production efficiency, gradually reaching Japanese standards.According to Toshiyuki Nakamura, Director General of JICA's Department of Industrial Development and Public Policy, Keieijuku is a training programme to draw content related to corporate governance.During a training course there would be different sessions with different intensive content. At the end of the programme, students would visit Japan to see management practices as well as current issues for Japanese businesses, he said.Since the programme was first launched in 2009, some 600 learners have taken part in\xa0Keieijuku courses, forming a business community which Japanese enterprises are interested in when seeking\xa0partners, especially in the supporting industry. They now manage\xa0enterprises with more than 52,000 employees and generate total revenue of more than VNĐ100 trillion (US$4.4 billion) each year.After training courses\xa0in Việt Nam, Keieijuku lecturer Chosaku Toda pointed out one of the weaknesses of Vietnamese enterprises was long-term strategy. He said for Japanese people, the most important point in business was the mindset of the manager always follows the business philosophy, through specific questions 'What was the business born for?' and set a clear vision.“This is the basis for generations of management in the business to operate and continue the goal,” he said.According to Toda,\xa0also former CEO of Panasonic in Europe and the US, Keieijuku is a Japanese-style business management programme which covers a wide range of aspects, from business philosophy, personnel, business strategy and production management.“Such contents can be shared with Vietnamese businesses because Japan has undergone the process of business development for the past 60 - 70 years so the problems that Japanese businesses encountered in the early days are very similar to the reality that small and medium enterprises in Việt Nam are facing,” he said.Doctor Bùi Anh Tuấn, President of the Hà Nội-based Foreign Trade University (FTU), said the Keieijuku course was\xa0an important part of co-operation between FTU and JICA. It had proved to be the most successful co-operation project, he said.He said one of the interesting points of the training course is that each enterprise can be taken as a case study.“Through the programme, Vietnamese entrepreneurs have got modern business philosophy from Japan and can apply into their business,” Tuấn said, adding that most of participants had\xa0positively changed\xa0their enterprises to Japanese style\xa0thinking were the customer comes first and human resources are valued.“The biggest change to mention is in their mindset in business, production organisation, long-term vision and mission.”According to Tuấn, the programme’s success also comes from the connection among enterprises after the training courses finish.“Not only within the Keieijuku community, the enterprises also can connect to enterprises outside the community, especially Japanese ones,” he said. — VNS",2

2708,'Take a chance on Big Dunc',"'by Paul KennedyI had the pleasure of meeting Everton’s caretaker manager, Duncan Ferguson, on two separate occasions back in the 90s.I say a pleasure, but the first time our paths crossed wasn’t very pleasurable.I had just covered an Everton Premier League match and found myself stood next to (or rather towered over by) the imposing Scot in the reception area of Goodison Park, home of Everton FC.It was fairly common knowledge at the time that Big Dunc wasn’t very forthcoming when it came to giving interviews with the press, but, being the daring (and stupid) reporter I was at the time, I thought I would try my luck.“Mr Ferguson, great win today. Quick word about the game?”“%*&?!# *&%%$” was his reply, and I’m not writing that in Scottish.I wasn’t particularly offended, it was to be expected.A few years later I found myself stood next to him at the urinals in the toilet of a bar in Liverpool City Centre after the Grand National Race Meeting.We chatted briefly about our wins and losses (he won more than me) and, unaware I was a reporter, he was a thoroughly nice guy.On Saturday morning, Big Dunc took charge of his first match at Everton against Chelsea following the dismissal of Marco Silva.And things could not have gone any better for the caretaker boss. Watching Everton v Chelsea compared to their match a few days earlier against Liverpool was chalk and cheese.Sure, I get that a new manager will always give a team a boost, but Ferguson gave Everton something the Goodison faithful have not seen for a long time, passion.His sprint down the touchline was Jurgen Klopp-like, and great to see.The next day I saw a meme online that was basically Dunc getting interviewed for the manager’s position and was asked what experience he had as a manager?The cartoon Scot replied: “None, but I have an Everton tattoo.”Maybe he doesn’t possess the experience of others in contention for the job will surely have, and yes, I understand good footballers don’t necessarily make good managers, just look at Roy Keane.But why not just roll the dice and say to the big man: “Tell you what Dunc, you’ve got to the end of the season, do your best.” If that happens, Everton fans will have no doubt a manager who understands the club, which is a lot more than others will be able to offer right now.He knows Everton inside out.He knows the city of Liverpool inside out. And he really gets the supporters.For me, for the time being at least, they are all the qualifications needed.Whatever happens, Everton are highly unlikely to get relegated come to the end of the season, and will not be challenging for a top-four spot, so why not let Ferguson have a go?I remembering watching him on the pitch, and even from the comfort of the press box, and he scared the living daylights out of me.He was tough, talented and a nightmare to play against.Saturday’s Everton performance was full throttle and no nonsense, just like Ferguson’s own style when he wore the number nine jersey for the Blues.It wasn’t Spanish-style tiki-taka or total football, mastered by the Dutch.It was gritty, it was hard, and it was very, very effective. Just look at the scoreline.Although on Merseyside Everton have been a laughing-stock for as far back as I can remember, I can see the tide slightly turning, but only if they give the big man a shot.

The play’s message is about the hypocrisy and shallowness of wealthy people and how money controls their lives,” said Phong\xa0in an interview with local media after his work’s premiere\xa0impressed audiences.Phong invited young talents Lê Chi Na, Thanh Tuấn, Lương Mỹ and Hồng Đào to play the leading roles.“Our actors have been working\xa0every day to perfect their characters. Today, only quality performances can bring theatre closer to audiences, particularly to young people,” he said.Lão Hà Tiện\xa0was chosen to be a part of a theatre project launched by the HCM City Centre of Performing Organising and Cinematography this year.The project\xa0provides\xa0financial support to private drama troupes that offer experimental plays.Hồng Hạc Drama Stage began business in 2015. Its owners, Linh and theatre director Phạm Hoàng Nam, and young actors have worked hard to offer experimental shows in drama and musicals, helping audiences become closer to contemporary theatre offered in New York and Paris.Lão Hà Tiện\xa0is staged on Saturday and Sunday at 155Bis Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa Street\xa0in\xa0District 3.At\xa0the Small Theatre of HCM City, young actors are heating up their audiences this summer with a serious play on love and money.Their latest play,\xa0Tiền Là Số Một\xa0(The Power of Money),\xa0became a hit\xa0two months after\xa0its\xa0release.The tragi-comedy is written by Hoàng Mẫn, a famed playwright of theatre in the Sài Gòn style.It is about the life and love of Tửng and Phèn, both poor farmers who become millionaires after winning the lottery.“Money creates many things that make people enjoy. However, it destroys people when it controls their life,” said the play’s director Quốc Thịnh.“Our work features a very old story, but also contains social issues of today.\xa0”Thịnh’s play includes sound and light effects to help express the actors’ emotions.He used young actors such as Phương Linh and Ngọc Sơn because “they make the play fresh,” said Thịnh, who plays a small role in the play.For their performance in\xa0Tiền Là Số Một, Thịnh’s actors have worked several hours a day to improve their singing and dancing skills. They perform without microphones.""Our troupe, the Small Theatre of HCM City, made its fame in the 1990s. I hope my young actors will\xa0developthe theatre and their art\xa0in the most professional way,"" said Thịnh.Trần Thị Mỹ Dung of Bình Thạnh District said: ""I was entertained and educated after watching\xa0Tiền Là Số Một.\xa0I believe the play will be nominated for the 2019\xa0Mai Vàng\xa0Awards.""Tiền Là Số Một\xa0is staged every weekend at 5B Võ Văn Tần Street\xa0in\xa0District 1.The\xa0Mai Vàng Awards began in 1995 and aims to honour the year’s artists and productions in theatre, music and TV shows.The list of nominations for the 2019 Mai Vàng Awards will be\xa0disclosed\xa0next month.

4304,"'Bắc Giang favours forestry firms, ignores residents: investigators'","'BẮC GIANG — A move by the northern province of Bắc Giang’s administration to lease 1877ha of forest land to a State-owned forestry company with a track record of violations and mismanagement has evoked strong protests from local residents.The protestors said they were native caretakers who had been managing parts of it for decades and their livelihoods were threatened by this move.More than 600 households from 10 communes and townships of Yên Thế District in Bắc Giang Province protested against a decision issued in January 2015 by Vice Chairman of the provincial People’s Committee, Lại Thanh Sơn, to lease the land to Yên Thế Forestry One-member Ltd Company.“We are native residents. Our livelihood is the forest. We are the ones who have been carrying out the State and Party’s policy on ’Greening the Barren Hills.’“Now, if the province’s People’s Committee takes away our forestland and gives it to the Yên Thế company, what will we live on?” asked Bùi Thị Hoè, a resident of Tam Hiệp Commune.While the area leased to the company and those managed by the locals seems to be clearly delineated on a map, it is harder to distinguish this on the ground.Vũ Thanh Hiền, head of Centre of Research and Development in Upland Areas (CERDA), a Vietnamese NGO, said dispute was “unavoidable” in this case since many local residents say their families has been living off these lands for four generations. It is natural that they feel their legitimate rights are being stripped off, he said.A Vietnam News Agency report has noted that the overlapping of forestland leased out to State forest enterprises (SFEs) and those managed by natives are not a rare occurrence across the country.Responding to local people’s concerns, Chairman of Bắc Giang Province’s People’s Committee Nguyễn Văn Linh had in late July this year, signed a decision to form a working group – headed by Ngô Văn Xuyên, deputy director of the provincial environmental department – to “thoroughly investigate the management and use of forestry land in the Yên Thế District.”Series of wrongdoingsTwo months later, the working group delivered its report to the chairman of the provincial People’s Committee, pointing out a series of wrongdoings committed by the Yên Thế District People’s Committee and the Yên Thế Forestry One-member Ltd Company.According to the report, the company handed 246.8ha of forestry land then under its management and use to local-level governments. However, large portions of this 246.8ha are plantations that have not been harvested, making it difficult for commune administrations to proceed with their plans.In previous years, the handing over of forestland completely failed to refer to cadastral records, the report said, adding that the work was done purely “on paper,” without any field trips to verify the information. This has led to the current ambiguity over forest land allocated to the company and the land that natives have been managing.The report also said that because due process was not followed, some communes that were supposed to receive forest land were unable to determine how much land they’ve got.The working group also pointed out the Yên Thế company has demonstrated “negligence” in its forest management tasks for a long time.It has been seen that after the company exploits the resources of a natural forest, including its trees, it has failed to designate it as an off limits area to allow re-growth. This, in turn, has allowed locals to further destroy tracts of natural forest to grow crops.The report also criticised Yên Thế District authorities for negligence in forest management, especially its failure to maintain accurate maps and update cadastral records.The group recommended that the disputes with local resident be settled clearly in line with existing regulations.Residents’ rights ignoredMany protestors have noted that in all of the State’s afforestation programmes, like the “Greening the Barren Hills” Programme 327, the World Food Organisation-supported PAM afforestation programme, or the 5-million-hectare reforestation Programme 661, the guiding principle has been to make locals the main protectors of the forest, and that in this process, they use the natural resources sustainably.In addition, forest use permits were to be issued to households to ensure stability and evoke a natural desire to protect the source of their livelihood, the forest.But the perception that this guiding principle has been ignored to favour companies is further strengthened by another recent decision by Bắc Giang Province to lease 1,400ha of forestland to the Trường Lộc Company for a mind-boggling VNĐ43.2 (less than US$0.002) per sq.m per year, not to mention a land lease waiver for 15 years, the Tài nguyên & Môi trường (Natural Resources and Environment) newspaper reported.In light of this information, the public have raised concerns about major wrongdoings in the implementation of the forestland allocation policies and policies that trample the rights of residents of remote and disadvantaged areas who directly live off the forests. — VNS'",4

However, the HCM City People’s Procuracy said the drugs were fake.\nLast week, Hùng pleaded guilty at the second-instance trial at the city’s court.\nAccording to Hùng, VN Pharma was established in October 2011 with capital of VNĐ25 billion (US$1.07 million), rising to VNĐ40 billion in 2014. He owns most of the shares.\nSince its operation, the company has imported various kinds of drugs, but Hùng told the court that he could not remember the exact number of times.\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Hùng ordered Cường to buy imported medicine allegedly manufactured by Canada’s Helix Pharmaceuticals Company and supply the drugs to Vietnamese hospitals.\nThe order included 9,300 boxes of 500mg capsules of H-Capita, a cancer treatment drug. The consignment was worth around VNĐ5.3 billion.\nHùng said he ordered his staff to make fake documents related to the drugs and submit them to the Drug Administration of Việt Nam.\nHe also faked receipts and payment procedures to acquire import licences from the ministry.\nIn April 2014, the Drug Administration of Việt Nam questioned the origin of the drugs and decided to inspect the company’s shipments.\nThe Ministry of Health concluded that the H-Capita 500mg batch contained 97 per cent of the active ingredient capecitabine, which is of unknown origin, of poor quality, and must not be used as a medicine for humans.\nIn November 2015, the Ministry of Public Security started legal proceedings.\nOn August 25, 2017, at the first-instance court trial, Hùng and Cường were sentenced to 12 years in prison for “smuggling”.\nSeven others were sentenced to between two and five years in jail for smuggling and counterfeiting documents and seals of agencies and organisations.\nHowever, on October 30, 2017, the higher-level People’s Court of HCM City decided to annul all previous judgments as the inspection conclusions contained many contradictions not in accordance with the provisions of the law.\nAccording to the court, charging the defendants with smuggling was inappropriate. The court also asked for further investigation of individuals related to the case.\nHowever, based on the documents collected, the Ministry of Public Security discovered that the imported batch of medicines did not originate from Canada.\nThe defendants were prosecuted under Clause Four Article 157 of the Criminal Code with the highest penalty being the death penalty.\nThe court yesterday also asked the Ministry of Health to review and handle the problem that import companies inflated drug prices to give commissions to doctors in order to sell the drugs.\nThis resulted in high prices of imported drugs in Việt Nam, seriously affecting the quality of life, especially the poor. The court said there were “loopholes” in the regulations that grant import licences.\nRegarding the wrongdoing at the Drug Administration of Việt Nam in licensing VN Pharma to import fake drugs, on September 18, the Ministry of Public Security’s Security Investigation Agency decided to prosecute the case for “lack of responsibility, causing serious consequences”. — VNS",1

It is high time for us all to start thinking about what we eat and how it equally serve\xa0not only ourselves but also the\xa0fauna, the water, the soil, the air and the existential resources of our planet,” Albert Lieberg.The FAO representative said unhealthy diets, combined with sedentary lifestyles, have sent obesity rates soaring, not only in developed countries but also in middle and low-income countries, where hunger and obesity often coexist.“Now, while over 800 million people suffer from hunger, more than 670 million adults and 120 million girls and boys (from 5 to 19 years of age) are obese.\xa0Every year, health problems linked to obesity and malnutrition are costing national health budgets up to US$2 trillion.”He said\xa0that besides the harm to human health, dietary changes also contributed substantially to environmental degradation and climate change.Research showed environmental damage caused by the food system could increase 50 to 90 per cent, due to increased consumption of processed food, meat\xa0and other animal-sourced products.\xa0A rapid loss of biodiversity is related to intensified and unsustainable food production, combined with climate change.“This year's World Food Day is a call with urgent action across sectors to make healthy diets available and affordable to everyone,” said Lieberg.“We need to be health-conscious and change our eating habits. We can start with learning to understand the nutrition labels, becoming critical consumers and being more aware of the impacts that the foods we eat have on the environment and on our health,” he added.On the occasion, the Ministry of Health also launched a campaign\xa0'Nutrition and Development Week'\xa0from October 16-23, to respond to World Food Day and call on the population to have proper nutrition and healthy diets.Speaking at the event, the health ministry’s Preventive Medicine Director Trần Đắc Phu said Việt Nam faces\xa0the double burden of malnutrition and obesity along with non-communicable diseases related to nutrition and lifestyle, especially in urban areas.“To handle the situation, we need to improve our knowledge to have the right nutrition practices, change unhealthy lifestyles and eating habits to a healthy diet and maintain a positive and active lifestyle to bring the best nutritional and health status to everybody,” said Phu.World Food Day, October 16, is an initiative of the FAO since 1979. Since then, World Food Day has been celebrated annually in more than 150 countries and territories, aiming to raise awareness of poverty and hunger issues, and rational use of food and foodstuffs. — VNS",1

124,'VNA leader suggests ways to win public trust in battle with fake news',"'SEOUL — General Director of the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) Nguyễn Đức Lợi has highlighted the need to win public trust in the fight against fake news.Lợi yesterday addressed the 17th General Assembly of the Organisation of Asia-Pacific News Agency (OANA) that is taking place in the Republic of Korea (RoK) from November 6-9.In his presentation, he said fake news continues to be a major concern for news agencies and media outlets around the world – and the VNA is no exception.Fake news has come in a more sophisticated manner as technology develops and cost reduces, he said.“Experts have predicted that as artificial intelligence is applied widely in the process of producing media content, fake news made by machines will also be born with overwhelming quantity,” Lợi noted.He called on journalists to act instead of waiting for agencies to promulgate new laws, for technology firms to change algorithms, or for users to become better at distinguishing fake news, as they bear heavy responsibility for society.Lợi cited many studies on the future of the press showing that the goal of the press now is not to attract public attention any longer, but to regain their trust.“How to rebuild public trust in high quality press content is always a big question for managers, news agencies, editorial offices and journalists themselves,” he said.According to the VNA leader, to combat fake news, his agency has worked hard to interact with leaders through the Chatbot software that won the OANA Award for Excellence in News Agency Quality in 2018.He suggested news agencies act to cope with information that incites hatred and racial discrimination or distorts the truth to harm individuals, organisations and countries, apart from pouring more investment into technology to produce high-quality news.In his remarks, Cho Sung-boo, President and CEO of the host country’s Yonhap News Agency, said global news agencies are facing unprecedented challenges, and they should turn these into new opportunities.He also called on news agencies to continuously make new products in new forms, and revamp the ways they deliver them.At a working session on Friday, OANA member news agencies elected Yonhap as OANA Chair for 2019-2022. This is the first time the news agency has held the position since its establishment in 1980.News agencies from Azerbaijan (AZERTAC), Russia (TASS), Turkey (Anadolu) and China (Xinhua) will assume the post of OANA Vice Chairs.The 17th General Assembly also elected the OANA Executive Board with 13 news agencies, the Technical Committee comprising of seven news agencies and a four-member ethics committee for 2019-2022. The VNA again won a seat on the OANA Executive Board.The WAFA News Agency of Palestine has become an observer of the organisation.OANA members agreed to adopt the minutes amending the OANA Statute, which was approved at the 44th Executive Board Meeting in Ha Noi in April.In the Seoul Declaration adopted at the meeting, the agencies pointed out challenges they are facing amidst the development of technology and the spread of fake news.On this occasion, the 45th and 46th meetings of the OANA Executive Board were also held in Seoul.The Executive Board elected Lee Dong-min, a journalist of Yonhap, as OANA Secretary General.Within the framework of the 17th General Assembly, the VNA and Xinhua, first-prize winners of the OANA Award for Excellence in News Agency Quality as announced at the 44th Executive Board Meeting, were honoured.On the sidelines of the event, VNA General Director Lợi met with Yonhap President and CEO Cho, who said he highly valued the fruitful relations between the two news agencies.The host expressed his hope for more support and co-operation from the VNA in the future.Lợi said the relationship with Yonhap was one of the most successful, effective and diverse ties between the VNA and its partners.The VNA’s VNEWS TV Channel and e-newspaper were using effectively TV news of Yonhap, he said, calling on the agency to produce and share news of more diverse content in both Korean and Vietnamese with the VNA.OANA now has 44 member news agencies from 35 countries in the region. The agencies are responsible for two-thirds of information produced throughout the world. Every day, they publish around 200 news stories, photos and video clips on the OANA website\xa0http://www.oananews.org.Since joining the OANA in 1969, the VNA has proven itself as one of the active members of the organisation.

The bank's capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.2 per cent, much higher than the minimum level of 8 per cent, calculated under the Basel II standards.Buying back stocks will not affect the capital source for the expansion of business operations because VPBank still has many other options to increase capital, VPBank said. — VNS",2

Whether it’s providing support for small businesses to grow, teaching Southeast Asians digital skills, expanding Internet access to more people or advocating for smart policy and regulation.” — VNS",2

1363,'No hope for popular train street’s cafés to resume',"HÀ NỘI — Authorities of Hà Nội's Hoàn Kiếm District, where the famous train track street is located, remain adamant that the cafés along the rail line will not be allowed to do business again, citing safety reasons.They said that since October 10, the day authorities shut down the busy street that has drawn international headlines and foreign tourists who seek the thrill\xa0of seeing a train passing by in close proximity, permanent patrol posts have been set up to ensure the makeshift establishments don't resume business.In recent days, tourists who have tried to take photos of the popular ‘train street’ at the Điện Biên Phủ-Phùng Hưng area in downtown Hà Nội have been turned away by\xa0officials.Local police and transport inspectors have regularly carried out inspections and told the households along the train track to not\xa0lay out tables and chairs upon the track.Previously, on October 15, owners of the ‘train café shops’ submitted a petition to authorities, asking for the removal of barriers at rail crossings that were erected five days before.They also requested permission\xa0to continue doing business\xa0and said the authorities should craft measures to make sure traffic safety is still upheld while tourism at the unique site could be promoted.The shop owners promised the cafes will ensure there remains a minimum 1.5m distance between their businesses and the rail track, put up bilingual Vietnamese and English signs, and install speakers to notify customers of approaching trains.Phạm Tuấn Long, vice chairman of Hoàn Kiếm District People’s Committee, told the media that the district reviewed the petition and sought feedback from transport authorities, and came to the conclusion that traffic safety along the tracks cannot be compromised and the residents’ request\xa0to resume business cannot be approved.The 1.5m distance as suggested by the café shop owners is simply not enough, he said.Regarding complaints that barriers corralling the two ends of the train track have inconvenienced local residents' commute, Long said the authorities intend to continue with\xa0patrols\xa0and keep the barriers up for the time being.\xa0— VNS",1
2478,"'WEF: East Asia, Pacific the world’s most competitive regional economy'","'PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Economies of East Asia and the Pacific as a region together outperformed other regions of the world with the highest media score – topped off by Singapore which elevated as the world’s most competitive economy, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s 2019 Report.The annual 2019 competitiveness index, calibrates as drivers of productivity and long-term growth in its 40th annual assessment, saw eight of the 19 listed economies in the Indo Pacific region improved their rankings with the world’s second largest economy – China – holding on to the 28th position.Meanwhile, a peek below the surface of the rankings shows a wide gap between the highest-performing East Asia and Pacific countries, and the lowest. The gap is larger than comparable data for Europe and North America.Thanks to an improvement in its overall score – combined with a diminished performance by the United States – Singapore\xa0has overtaken the US as the world’s most competitive economy.The WEF particularly highlighted Singapore’s scores regarding its financial system, market efficiency and macroeconomic stability. The country scored less well, however, when it comes to markers like freedom of the press – it ranks 124th – and sustainability.Rising 4 places since last year’s report,\xa0Hong Kong SAR\xa0ranks third overall, behind Singapore and the United States. Hong Kong features in the top 10 of eight pillars – a new record. In addition, Hong Kong ranks first on four pillars –the most of any economy. But the ongoing protests – now in its fourth month – is likely to dampen this impressive gain.Japan\xa0ranked sixth in the overall rankings this year, down one notch from 2018. Despite the small drop in overall score, the economy’s performance across the 12 pillars the WEF grades on remained almost unchanged. The WEF lists Japan’s technological capacity as one of its major boons, calling it “one of the most technology-savvy nations in the world”. In terms of areas in which Japan could improve, the Forum suggests that Japan should look to tackling rigidities that exist within its labour market that are currently holding it back.Taiwan\xa0rose one spot to finish this year’s ranking at the 12th position. Taiwan also has the distinction of being one of one four economies to score above 80 on the Innovation capability rankings – the other economies at this same level were Germany, the United States, and Switzerland.The\xa0Republic of Korea\xa0rose two spots to finish 13th globally. Korea features in the top 10 of five of the competitiveness pillars, and leads the world in ICT adoption. The report particularly highlights Korea’s achievements in fibre optics and internet penetration. “The country boasts the most optical fibre connections per capita in the world (31.9 subscription per 100 people) and 96 per cent of the population uses the internet on a regular basis.” Areas where Korea showed less promise included market inefficiency, partly due to a lack of domestic competition and high trade barriers.Another factor holding Korea back is its labour market, a category in which the county ranks toward the bottom. The WEF writes of Korea’s job system as one that “is characterised by a rigid, de facto two-tier system of ‘insiders’, who enjoy permanent contracts and generous benefits, and precarious ‘outsiders’.Việt Nam stands out globally as the most improved economy according to the report. The country rose 10 spots to land at 67th on this year’s rankings. Two countries, however, which in comparison to Việt Nam’s success illustrate the sheer drop-off between Asia’s most competitive economies and its least, are\xa0Cambodia\xa0(up four spots to 106th) and\xa0Lao PDR\xa0(down one spot 113th), both of which the WEF describes as having “significant competitiveness deficits.”As far as the region goes, another country with a good improvement is\xa0Sri Lanka, which WEF highlighted as South Asia’s most improved economy, coming in at 84th this year. There was no mention of the impacts of the Easter bombing on the country, however.Nepal\xa0rose in this year’s rankings, up one spot to come in at 108, but that isn’t much reason to celebrate. The country has the unfortunate distinction of having one of the least competitive economies in South Asia, only coming out ahead of Pakistan. Overall, the WEF took issue with the economy in terms of innovation capability, information, communication and technology adoption, product market development, judicial independence and government’s long-term vision.China\xa0ranks 28th overall this year, a position that is unchanged from 2018’s report. China is by far the best performer among the BRICS economies: 15 places ahead of the Russian Federation, 32 places ahead of South Africa and some 40 places ahead of both India and Brazil. China benefits from the sheer size of its market and macroeconomic stability.But, the report warns that as the shadow of the Great Recession approaches, with a possible slowdown of the global economy looming, emerging economies like China’s are at risk of their own slowdown or stagnation.One particular bright spot, however, that the WEF chose to highlight when it comes to China’s economic strength are the promising overtures the country is taking toward greater environmental sustainability, including greater investment in renewable energy. The country has invested US$132 billion in clean energy technologies so far, with potentially more on the horizon.For ASEAN,\xa0Malaysia, which once again took the second spot in ASEAN for the\xa0third year in a row, sank 2 spots to rank 27th this year. Thailand, which takes the third rank in ASEAN (down 2 places to 40th) in part because it simply didn’t keep up with the speed at which other economies were improving.Coming in fourth out of ASEAN countries is\xa0Indonesia,\xa0which ranked 50th this year, down five places from 2018. The WEF, however was quick to point out that Indonesia’s economy’s performance remained essentially unchanged from the previous year’s report. A large part of Indonesia’s strength comes from the sheer size of its economy, as the largest in Southeast Asia, but the country also scored high when it came to macroeconomic stability and business dynamism.Also seeing a dip in its ranking this year was the\xa0Philippines, the fifth ranked country in ASEAN. The Philippines saw a drop in 8 positions compared to last year’s report, now coming in at 64th.This year,\xa0India\xa0came in at 68th, a drop of 10 places in 2019. This drop, WEF points out however, is only partly the consequence of a relatively small decline in score. More significant was the progress made by several countries ranked close to India.India ranks beyond 100th on five of the pillars and features in the top 50 of just four pillars. However, it did relatively well in terms of its scores on macroeconomic stability and market size. India also performs well when it comes to innovation, well ahead of most emerging economies and on par with several advanced economies.Another weak point for India is in the labour market, which WEF points out is characterised by a lack of worker rights’ protections, insufficiently developed active labour market policies and critically low participation of women.One bright spot for India, as with China, has to do the country’s efforts to boost the environmental sustainability of its economy. As with China, India making big investments in the field of renewable energy.Bangladesh\xa0fell two places this year to 102nd. Bangladesh’s competitiveness relative lack of competitiveness is owed partly to weakening macroeconomic stability, deterioration of labour market conditions, lack of ICT adoption and inadequate progress in infrastructure, according to the report. The country’s lack of preparedness when it came to the fourth Industrial Revolution technologies was a particularly weak point.And finally,\xa0Pakistan\xa0slipped by three spots this year to come out at 110th out of 140 countries. The county’s economy scored toward the bottom when it comes to infrastructure, macroeconomic stability, market product, and labour system, but had some relative bright spots when it comes to market size and business dynamism. — ANN'",2
1330,'Hải Dương farmers enjoy bumper ragworm season',"HẢI DƯƠNG — As the sun sets, Lê Văn Quạt from Vĩnh Lập Commune in the northern province of Hải Dương sets out on a mission to catch ragworms.The perfect time to find the wriggly treats is between 6 and\xa011pm.Farmers in Hải Dương have started the first worm\xa0harvest of the year, which runs\xa0from September 20 to October 5 in the lunar calendar. The catches depend\xa0on the\xa0tides, and each lasts from two to three days.After they're caught, the worms are left to dry before packaging. Traders come to buy the worms and sell them to neighbouring localities.Ragworms are the main ingredient of a famous dish called chả rươi (ragworm fritters). The pancake-shaped patties are made from worms mixed with pork, eggs, fresh dill and citrus rind.Quạt said ragworm productivity at the beginning of the season this year had\xa0increased by 30 per cent compared to last year, and they were selling out at prices between VNĐ350,000 to VNĐ400,000 (US$15-17) per kg.Some years ago, farmers in the province bought rice paddy fields which had low productivity and instead used them to\xa0raise ragworms.Quạt harvested his\xa0first worms in 2016 and has land covering 36,000sq.m now.“Last year I caught 30kg of worms for every 360sq.m, earning VNĐ12million ($522),” he told Vietnam News Agency.Farmers have localised farming areas and pumped water into the fields to catch more worms.Over the past few years, local authorities in\xa0Thanh Hà District have also offered loans to farmers.According to Nguyễn Văn Khoa, vice chairman of Vĩnh Lập Commune’s People’s Committee, when ragworms appeared in the province many years ago, farmers used simple tools to catch them in the river.In\xa0recent years, they've invested in chemical-free fields and taken advantage of tidal water to increase productivity, he said.Vĩnh Lập Commune now has about 45 worm breeding households, covering about 50ha around the Văn Úc and Thái Bình rivers.Hải Dương Province has about 400ha of worm farms\xa0in Tứ Kỳ, Thanh Hà, Kim Thành, Kim Môn and Chí Linh.Many farmers in the province earn a living from ragworms. They can earn VNĐ8-10million for\xa0every 360sq.m of land\xa0each year.Phạm Văn Tình, head of Aquaculture Division under Hải Dương Province Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said in rice fields and fruit tree growing areas located around worm raising areas, farmers say no to pesticides, chemical fertilisers and only use organic fertilisers and manure to protect worms.“Ragworm quality in Hải Dương is very good. We ensure worms’ safety thanks to local farmers’ awareness of environmental protection,” he said.Worms bring high economic values to farmers while investment in breeding worms is not high.Raising worms requires uncontaminated water and soil. According to a representative of the provincial Aquaculture Division, local authorities planned to hold workshops to instruct farmers how to raise worms without\xa0harming the environment.Farmers in Vĩnh Lập Commune are hoping\xa0that waste treatment factories in the area will follow safety standards in order not to pollute the rivers where the worms are raised. — VNS",1
3425,'Brazil win Copa America despite Jesus dismissal',"RIO DE JANEIRO — Ten-man Brazil held on to win the Copa America on home soil despite Gabriel Jesus's dismissal with a 3-1 victory\xa0over Peru on Sunday.Jesus scored the decisive goal after a penalty from Peru captain Paolo\xa0Guerrero canceled out Everton's opener for hosts Brazil at Rio de Janeiro's\xa0Maracana stadium.A last minute penalty from substitute Richarlison sealed a win for Brazil which handed the South American giants their ninth Copa triumph and first since\xa02007.Jesus's evening went sour 20 minutes from time as he was sent off for a second booking.The Manchester City striker was in tears as he left the field, making\xa0obscene hand gestures, angrily kicking a water bottle and almost knocking over\xa0the trophy plinth.Brazil's players rallied after the dismissal however to claim a battling victory.Earlier, after a minute's silence was held for bossa nova legend Joao\xa0Gilberto -- who died on Saturday -- underdogs Peru made a confident start and\xa0didn't appear overawed by either their opponents or the occasion.But it quickly became apparent that they were up against more accomplished players.Peru coach Ricardo Gareca had said on Saturday they needed to prevent Brazil from dominating possession, but that was easier said than done.Individual brillianceBrazil started to stroke the ball around commandingly, and as they did that, they looked dangerous.Their opening goal came from a piece of individual brilliance by Jesus,\xa0whose drag back fooled two defenders, creating space for him to cross for the\xa0unmarked Everton to drill home at the back post on the quarter hour.Brazil were in control and playing like champions elect as Roberto Firmino found space on the left and crossed for Philippe Coutinho to stab wide.Left-winger Everton was clever with his movement in dragging the athletic\xa0right-back Luis Advincula out of position and Brazil's left-back Alex Sandro\xa0found acres of space to put in a deep cross that Firmino headed over.Just as it looked as if Brazil would stroll to victory, Peru went on the attack and a Christian Cueva cross hit the arm of a sliding Thiago Silva,\xa0giving Peru a penalty that was confirmed after a VAR review.Guerrero sent goalkeeper Alisson the wrong way from 12 yards and Peru were back in it just before half-time.But they paid for their lack of guile and experience with almost the last\xa0kick of the half as Arthur was allowed to drive at the defence from midfield following a slip from Renato Tapia that left him space to attack.Center-back Carlos Zambano also slipped, allowing Arthur to feed Jesus in the middle of the area and the Manchester City striker made no mistake, finding\xa0the bottom corner.Changed dynamicBrazil had a few speculative shots at the start of the second half but Silva, Dani Alves and Coutinho all failed to hit the target.After some wing trickery from Everton, Alex Sandro crossed but Firmino headed wide.Brazil were in complete control at this stage as Peru could hardly string\xa0two passes together.But the dynamic changed 20 minutes from time as Jesus was given his\xa0marching orders for a second yellow card after a late challenge on Cueva.The onus was now on Peru to attack and Miguel Trauco brought a near post save out of Alisson while Edison Flores fizzed a volley from outside the area\xa0just wide.But amidst a flurry of substitutions, fouls and injury stoppages, the steam went out of Peru's efforts and they were unable to exert any sustained pressure on the hosts.Any hopes they had were extinguished when Zambrano was adjudged to have barged over Everton in the penalty area and substitute Richarlison drilled home\xa0the spot-kick into the bottom corner. — AFP",3

The\xa0city\xa0pays over VNĐ2 trillion (US$86.5 million) per year\xa0from the city’s State budget\xa0for the collection, transportation and treatment of\xa0solid waste.Under\xa0a decision issued in 2008, the average garbage collection fees of VNĐ15,000 to VNĐ25,000 per month paid by each household are just enough for\xa0garbage collection, while the remaining fees for garbage transportation and treatment must be covered or paid by the State budget.To reduce pressure on the State budget\xa0and make polluters pay\xa0for garbage collection and treatment, the\xa0city's People’s Committee last year issued a\xa0decision to\xa0charge\xa0VNĐ364 per kg of waste collected by traditional methods and VNĐ166 per kg collected by\xa0motorized methods.The decision also defines fees for transport\xa0of household solid waste, from VNĐ40 per kg in 2019; VNĐ133.5 per kg\xa0in\xa02020; VNĐ227 per kg in 2021, and VNĐ247 per kg in\xa02022.It also sets out the\xa0maximum price\xa0of VNĐ475 per kg for treatment of household solid waste.Thus,\xa0a household could pay a total of\xa0VNĐ110,000 to VNĐ150,000 per month for garbage collection, transportation and treatment.The new garbage collection, transportation and treatment fees could be applied by\xa02022.A resident of Bình Thạnh District who declined to be named\xa0said a four-member household that discharges about\xa04kg of solid waste\xa0would\xa0pay garbage collection fees of 59,000 per month in 2020. The\xa0fees will increase to VNĐ130,000 per month in\xa02022.With the garbage collection and transportation fees under the\xa0city's recent decision, the State must pay a small part of\xa0the garbage collection, transportation and treatment in the 2019-21 period, according to Nguyễn Thị Thanh Mỹ,\xa0the deputy director of the city's\xa0Department of Mineral Resources and Environment.As garbage collection fees will increase periodically, HCM City residents will be scheduled by 2022 to pay all costs for garbage collection, transportation and treatment. — VNS",1

The database is built with the participation of 122 credit organisations and foreign banks’ branches, nearly 1,200 people’s credit funds and four official micro-financial organisations.In the same move, another agency of the SBV – the National Payment Corporation of Việt Nam (NAPAS) – also announced a reduction for its local switching system service fees. The system is\xa0interconnected by more than 170,000 ATMs nationwide, starting from October 1 this year.Specifically, it has reduced 24/7 interbank money transfer service fee for banks by 13 per cent. ATM withdrawal service fees have been also cut by 70 per cent for banks that issue the ATMs and 100 per cent for banks that conduct the payment.NAPAS has also provided free internal transfer service and non-financial transactions such as information inquiry and statement printing for banks.In addition, the agency has also continually implemented a promotion programme to reduce 50 per cent of its service fees for transactions at ATMs and 24/7 interbank transfer transactions from October 3, 2019 to December 31, 2019 for banks.On September 16, the SBV decided to make the first interest rate cut since October 2017, which helped credit institutions access more affordable capital from the SBV, enabling them to improve liquidity and keep market interest rates stable.Accordingly, the annual refinancing rate and rediscount rate has been lowered from 6.25 per cent to 6 per cent, and from 4.25 per cent to 4 per cent, respectivelyThe annual overnight electronic interbank rate and rate of loans to offset capital shortage in clearance between the central bank and domestic banks have been also cut to 7 per cent. — VNS'",2

Oh, and also Juventus.Liverpool’s young full back Trent Alexander-Arnold is heading to Barcelona and taking his Anfield teammate Andy Robertson with him.Sadio Mane meanwhile is moving to Real Madrid and Arsenal will be signing Getafe centre-half Djene Dakonam in the summer who is also going to be playing for Everton next season.Gareth Bale is desperate for a reunion at his old club Tottenham Hotspur and at the same time desperately wants to play for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at United.Yes, you’ve guessed it, it’s that time of year again, its silly season.For those of your unaware with this particular period in the Gregorian calendar, silly season begins around the end of May and runs until somewhere around mid-August.Coincidentally, that is also the time of year when there is no competitive club football taking place and sports journalists find themselves with nothing better to do than make up stories about transfers.It’s not all the hacks' fault though, agents too have a massive role to play during silly season.Telltale words to look out for include ‘could’ ‘may’ and ‘possibly’. These are the writers get out of jail cards for when their transfer tips disappear down the plug hole.They’ll take a punt and if it comes true then you’ll never hear the end of it.I could marry Halle Berry next year and I may find myself going on a date with Charlize Theron. There’s also a possibility, albeit a slim one at best, that I might bump into Angelina Jolie while walking along Hàng Bông Street in downtown Hà Nội, fall head over heels in love and live happily ever after with my new ready-made family.But what makes silly season even sillier in the modern era, if that was even possible, is the huge amount of football websites plastered all over the internet that take transfer tittle tattle to a whole new level.Some of stories I’ve seen in recent weeks are nothing short of ridiculous.One claimed that because Memphis Depay of Lyon was seen wearing a red suit and travelling onboard a red private jet, then he must be joining Liverpool.Another claimed Egyptian striker Mohammed Salah will be leaving the Champions of Europe to ply his trade at, er, Old Trafford with Manchester United, who last season finished sixth in the Premier League.I get that agents have a job to do and first and foremost they are there to represent the best interests of their players, but a hefty chunk of stories you will read during the season of silliness are simply planted by agents in the hope of bumping up transfer fees and increasing already over-bloated pay packets.In days gone by it was a mate in the pub who knew a bloke who’s sister’s best friend from school used to work with the brother of a woman who is employed as a secretary at a football club. And she said Manchester City will be signing Ronaldo.Nowadays it’s all about social media sites like Twitter that are awash with rubbish, rumours and downright ridiculousness.Take it from me, the only time you will know for sure a club has signed a player is when you open a newspaper or log on to a reputable sports website and see him donning the football strip of his new team.Said player will then conduct an interview with the club’s official TV channel and say: “I have always been a (insert name of club here) supporter ever since I was a young boy and I can’t wait to get started with my new teammates.”Then, and only then, will you know 100 per cent beyond any shadow of doubt that your team has signed a new player.Until that happens believe nothing and trust no one, because chances are the story you have just read claiming that Lionel Messi is unhappy in Barcelona and has set his sights on playing for Wolverhampton Wanderers because he has heard there’s some amazing Argentinian steak houses in the Black Country\xa0is probably not true. — VNS",3

4234,'Provinces improve response to climate change',"'HÀ NỘI — Lessons learned from the strategic mainstreaming of ecosystem-based adaptation\xa0(EbA)\xa0was\xa0a good foundation for Việt Nam to prepare for climate change, according to Dr.\xa0Nguyễn Thế Chinh from the Natural Resources and Environment Strategic Institute.Dr Chinh was speaking on Tuesday at a workshop reviewing a project on the subject. It was held by the Institute for Strategy and Policy on Natural Resources and Environment in collaboration with the German Development Co-operation Agency.\xa0The event marked more than three years of productive collaboration.The Euro 4-million (US$4.9 million) project funded by the German Society for International Co-operation (GIZ) worked with the Vietnamese Government to mainstream ecosystem-based measures into pilot models in Hà Tĩnh and Quảng Bình provinces.""After three years of implementation, the project evaluated the vulnerable ecological situation in Hà Tĩnh and Quảng Bình provinces,"" Chinh said.“The project also helped to set up\xa0a national plan of land use for 2016-2020, and an updated action plan for climate change preparedness until 2020 in the provinces,” he added.The EbA project aims to support efforts in the strategic mainstreaming of ecosystem-based approaches into national policies on climate change adaptation, land-use and development planning.EbA has been identified as an effective adaptation measure given that Việt Nam is heavily affected by the adverse effects of climate change.Climate change vulnerability assessments have been conducted at both provincial and commune levels to introduce appropriate EbA solutions for implementation in the selected provinces.From 2016, the project began pilot EbA activities in coastal areas suffering erosion and sand movement in Quảng Bình Province by planting and rehabilitating coastal forests in combination with livelihood activities, such as cattle-raising, fresh- water fish farming, and vegetable cultivation.In Hà Tĩnh, the project piloted EbA approaches in a mountain ecosystem under drought conditions, enriching natural forest by using indigenous plants, oranges and pineapples grown in contour lines - plus bee-raising.The two areas selected for the pilot EbA approaches shared common characteristics. Firstly, the communities in both areas showed real enthusiasm to participate; and secondly, they lived in areas suffering from difficult economic conditions, with limited access to the technologies required for agricultural production.Strengthening the capacity of stakeholders at central and local levels was a key aspect of the project.To improve knowledge and the sharing of information on EbA measures and activities, the project organised a series of training workshops on mainstreaming them into the development planning process.The project also focused on mainstreaming EbA into the climate-change-adaptation legal framework by supporting Government agencies. For example, the Department of Land Management will implement strategic environmental assessments to collect inputs for revising national land-use planning for 2016-2020; the Department for Planning Management will mainstream EbA and climate-change issues into developing the Planning Law; and the departments of Natural Resources and Environment of Hà Tĩnh and Quảng Bình will mainstream EbA into the updated Provincial Climate Change Action Plans to 2020.Ivo Litzenberg, GIZ expert, said after three years of implementation, the two provinces had cleaner water resources and a healthier ecological system which was less vulnerable to climate-change impacts.Land erosion was also reduced, which helped local people produce rice crops on slopes, said Litzenberg.The project had also helped local people understand the importance of production thast was less harmful to ecological systems, he said.Meanwhile, according to Phan Lam Sơn, deputy head of Hà Tĩnh Province’s Natural Resources and Environment Department, the project helped people become aware of main reasons for climate change, such as improper use of natural resources, waste discharge and polluting the environment.Việt Nam was assessed as one of nations worst affected by climate change.If the sea water level rise by one metre, 40 per cent of land area in Cửu Long (Mekong) Delta, 11 per cent of land in the Hồng Delta, and 3 per cent of land areas along other coastal regions would be submerged.About 10-12 per cent of population would be affected and losses would account for 10 per cent of the country’s GDP, said experts.Understanding the consequences, the Government has issued several legal documents to deal with the situation, including a National Programme on Climate Change Preparedness, National Strategy on Climate Changes, National Strategy on Natural Calamity Reduction by 2020. — VNS'",4
1568,'First provincial hospital uses robot in surgery',"'PHÚ THỌ — The Phú Thọ General Hospital has become the first provincial hospital in the country to successfully use a robot in spinal column surgery.The news was announced on Thursday by the hospital. The surgery was conducted on September 28.The patient Trương Thanh Bình, 43, from Hạ Hòa District, was hospitalised with serious pain on her spine. She could not walk by herself. She had used painkillers for many months leading to stomach problems.Bình said that four years ago, she was examined at the Hà Nội-based Việt Nam-Germany Hospital and doctors advised her to have surgery. However, she refused as she thought that it would affect her health.Recently, serious pain meant she could not walk, so she visited the doctor once again who advised her to have surgery as soon as possible.After hearing that the Phú Thọ General Hospital was preparing to use a robot in spinal column surgery, she decided to have the operation at the facility. She was also the first patient to undergo the procedure at the hospital.Nguyễn Văn Sơn, deputy director of the hospital, said that the location for the screws was the most important part in spinal column surgery.The robot will help doctors pinpoint the location and minimise harm to neighbouring tissues. The patients can avoid many risks during surgery. They will lose little blood, experience less pain and recover more quickly.Without robots, the surgery lasts about an hour and a half. Now with the robot, it lasts just 30 minutes.Bình is now recovering and is expected to be discharged from the hospital in the next ten days.Phú Thọ is about 90km from Hà Nội. — VNS'",1

1765,'Measures needed to reduce work-related accidents',"HCM CITY — Compliance with\xa0occupational safety\xa0and hygiene regulations remains lax, affecting the lives of workers and their families, an official from\xa0the HCM City Federation of Labour said at a conference held on Wednesday.Nguyễn Thành Đô, head of the Policy Department under the HCM City Federation of Labour, said many policies and measures had\xa0contributed effectively to reducing labour accidents and occupational diseases.“However, the number of work-related accidents is still high in the country,” he said.Representatives of labour federations of Hà Nội, Đà Nẵng, Hải Phòng, Cần Thơ and HCM City attended the conference\xa0which\xa0discussed solutions\xa0to limit work-related accidents and occupational diseases.According to the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs'\xa0occupational safety\xa0report for 2018, nearly 8,000 work-related accidents were reported last year, killing 1,039 and injuring more than 8,200.The main cause of occupational accidents was\xa0lack of\xa0compliance with regulations on occupational safety and hygiene of businesses and workers, accounting for 46 per cent of incidents.A majority of employers failed to create safe working procedures, did not provide training on labour safety, and did not\xa0guarantee the quality of protective equipment and\xa0workers' working condition.Violations of occupational safety\xa0and hygiene\xa0regulations and work\xa0safety procedures were accounted for more than 18 per cent of the incidents.Another 35 per cent of incidents were caused by other reasons.Tạ Văn Dưỡng of Hà Nội’s Labour Federation said that inspection,\xa0examination\xa0and preventive measures\xa0must be carried out thoroughly\xa0at\xa0businesses.“The most important element in\xa0raising awareness of\xa0employers\xa0and\xa0workers\xa0is\xa0observation of\xa0occupational safety and hygiene\xa0regulations,” said Nguyễn Văn Tuấn, president of the HCM\xa0City Export Processing and Industrial\xa0Zones Authority’s Trade Union.Trade unions and businesses need to work with other units\xa0to build\xa0a\xa0network\xa0of businesses that can learn from each other about\xa0labour safety, he said.Đinh Thị Thanh Hà, vice president of Đà Nẵng City’s Labour Federation, said that\xa0work-related accidents usually occurred at construction sites, mostly small construction projects\xa0or works built\xa0by subcontractors, creating difficulties for control and\xa0inspection.Foreign-invested companies and local enterprises in industrial parks and export processing zones have the highest level of awareness about\xa0labour\xa0safety and hygiene regulations.“They are always concerned about human factors and regular maintenance of\xa0equipment and machinery, so\xa0the number of labour accidents has\xa0significantly reduced,” she said.She said\xa0that\xa0ministries, departments and agencies\xa0should try to\xa0improve\xa0the legal system regulating\xa0labour safety\xa0and other regulations\xa0in various fields, increase inspections of occupational safety and hygiene regulations, and strengthen the handling of\xa0violations\xa0of\xa0labour safety.In addition, changing\xa0the\xa0minimum allowance required\xa0for occupational safety and hygiene standards\xa0in\xa0hazardous\xa0or\xa0dangerous jobs should be considered, she added. — VNS",1

Efficient irrigation is being used on\xa07,000ha of crops.The Việt Nam-Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project in Đắk Lắk provides\xa050 per cent of the cost of installing efficient irrigation facilities for farmers.\xa0The cost is about VNĐ65 million ($2,800) per hectare.The\xa0facilities, which use dripping or spraying irrigation methods,\xa0can irrigate and fertilise at the\xa0same time. They save\xa0labour costs and prevent\xa0surface soil erosion caused by traditional irrigation methods.The Central Highlands region, which is the country’s largest producer of many industrial plants, has more than 622,200ha of coffee, 91,400ha of pepper, 81,000ha of cashew and 246,811ha of rubber, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.The region\'s\xa02,354 irrigation works can only provide irrigation water for 214,645ha of crops.Nguyễn Văn Tỉnh, head of the ministry’s Irrigation Department, said\xa0the region\xa0should target having\xa0500,000ha of crops\xa0next year under advanced irrigation methods.\xa0“The provinces should have support policies for farmers to install these facilities,” he said. \xa0VNS'",1

The current minimum wage approved by the national wage council is based on 48 working hours. If the working time is reduced to between 40 and 44 hours, wages must be recounted.The NA Standing Committee proposed two options for overtime hours. The first is to increase from 30 to 40 hours per month and add regulations for specific cases allowed to work overtime 300 hours per year.The second is to increase extra hours from 300 to 400 hours and there is no monthly overtime cap. The Government must continue to study NA deputies’ proposals and prepare a list of jobs allowed to increase extra hours.Lộc is in favour of increasing total extra working hours to 400 maximum a year, saying that employers and employees can negotiate the amount of time.Employees in a minority of sectors have the right to accept or refuse overtime during peak seasons, he said.The current overtime working regulations are not relevant to seasonal sectors. In the fishery sector, shrimp supply is abundant in three to five months. That is when employees work overtime to take advantage of the sources, he said.Deputy Nguyễn Thị Quyết Tâm from HCM City said the economic competitiveness does not and should not depend on the strength of labourers. It depends on management capacity, technological innovation, working conditions and social progress.Not in favour of increasing extra working time, she said labourers do not want to but they need to work overtime.“Why do they need to work overtime? Because their current incomes are not enough to live on.”The NA must study a law that creates conditions for labourers to earn a living to afford their expenses, have time to study, improve skills and spend time for entertainment, families and other social relationships with an aim to realise human’s rights as regulated in the Constitution, she said.On the sidelines of NA meeting on Wednesday, NA deputy Bùi Sỹ Lợi from central Thanh Hóa Province told Vietnam News Agency that trade unions want to reduce working time from 48 hours to 44 hours per week. But many employees do not want this because it will affect their incomes. There should be assessment and feedbacks from enterprises and labourers.According to surveys, employers propose the Government map out a timeline so they can prepare for changes, he said.Giving opinion on rising retirement age, deputy Nguyễn Văn Sơn from central Hà Tĩnh Province proposed those working heavy load and in toxic environment should be allowed to retire ten years earlier than the normal age. The Government should prepare a detailed list of early retirement jobs and submit it to the NA for consideration.After listening to deputies’ opinions, Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Đào Ngọc Dung said the ministry would work with relevant agencies to complete the revised law.According to NA vice chairwoman Tòng Thị Phóng, the NA will collect opinions of deputies on controversial points of the revised law before it is put on approval next month. —VNS'",0

1855,'Experts call for risk management to boost VN-Africa bilateral trade',"'HÀ NỘI — Bilateral trade between Việt Nam and African economies has made significant growth in the past decade, however, there is still room for improvement.Two-way trade jumped 250 per cent to US$6.6 billion in 2018 from $2.52 billion in 2010, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Đặng Minh Khôi told a seminar on Friday.During that time, Africa became a favourite destination for Vietnamese companies that operate in telecommunications, agriculture and education such as the military-backed telecom group Viettel, he said.The two sides had also made improvements in political, social and diplomatic relations. Those facts prove the potential of bilateral co-operation between Việt Nam and African nations is huge, Khôi added.General Secretary of the International\xa0Organisation of\xa0la\xa0Francophonie (IOF) Louise Mushikiwabo said Africa was a large market with a population of 1.2 billion. The continent benefited from a young labour force, better connection with the international community and it was rising to become the new centre of the world.It was important for Vietnamese and African businesses to be informed of opportunities and information by regional governments, she said, adding the logistic and transporting system between the two sides must be improved to meet the travel demand.However, there are challenges that have put Vietnamese companies at risk when they come to Africa and set up business relations, experts said.Issues in the bilateral trade included financial payment and trade fraud that are damaging Vietnamese companies’ confidence when they decide to do business in Africa, they said.But experts at the seminar suggested companies on both sides should seek support from arbitration units to resolve any problems and disputes with trade relations.In addition, business relations should be built through government agencies that help organise connection events for Vietnamese and African companies to exchange ideas, they said.Phan Thị Thanh Nhàn, Direct of Trade Finance Centre at the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV), said one of the issues between Vietnamese and African companies was reliability.Payment methods played an important role in global trade but most African banks had not met international standards, she said, adding it has hinder trade\xa0as Vietnamese firms found it difficult to make payment through local banks.She warned Vietnamese firms to not advance payment to African sellers or accept late payment for local buyers. “Letter of credit is a creditable method if the issuer of the letter is highly reputable.”Nguyễn Phúc Nam, deputy general director of the Asia-Africa Market Department at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said issues between Vietnamese and African businesses came from the differences in culture, language, legal system, travel distance and limited co-operation in the banking sector.The majority of African economies were still underdeveloped with poor of transportation, infrastructure, telecommunication and logistics, he said.In addition, Vietnamese embassies and trade offices in Africa cannot evaluate all local businesses due to lack of resources, he said.There are only eight Vietnamese embassies and five trade offices to cover 55 African countries, Nam said, adding it was difficult for Vietnamese companies to cross-check partners’ information if they were suspicious.But it was still a must that Vietnamese companies ask for consultancy of Vietnamese embassies and trade offices in Africa about the information of local clients and partners, he said.They should look for partners though trade promotion activities organised by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and African government agencies to make sure partners are reputable and creditable, making co-operation less risky.Lawyer Phạm Liêm Chính, director of Chính and Partners Law Firm, said Vietnamese companies should come to Africa and see the market with their own eyes, but many firms cannot afford that.“There are always risks. Higher risk often comes with higher profit, but if the risk is too much, companies should re-consider,” he said.To manage and minimise\xa0risk, Vietnamese companies should work with law firms and arbitration units when negotiating contracts with foreign partners, Chính said. — VNS'",2

4624,Netflix makes deal to keep one of NY's oldest theaters open,"'NEW YORK — Streaming giant Netflix will use New York\'s historic Paris Theatre, which had been shuttered earlier this year, for special events and screenings of its films – the latest twist in the company\'s ongoing spat with the traditional film industry.The theatre – the city\'s last single screen movie house, located in the heart of Manhattan on 57th Street, not far from Central Park and the Plaza hotel – closed in late August after 71 years in business.It had reopened in early November for what seemed like a one-off event – a limited theatrical run for Netflix\'s Oscar contender Marriage Story by New York director Noah Baumbach.But it would seem that Netflix had bigger plans.""Now, the iconic theatre will be kept open and become a home for special Netflix events, screenings, and theatrical releases,"" the company said Monday in a series of Twitter messages.The details of the deal were not disclosed, but industry site Deadline Hollywood said it was a 10-year lease agreement.Netflix has been in a low-grade battle with traditional Hollywood for some time over the Oscar eligibility requirements that films in contention run in regular theatres for a certain period of time.But many major theatre chains have refused to deal with Netflix unless it consents to longer runs of its films – and a longer waiting period between any film\'s theatrical release and its streaming debut.Currently, the waiting period generally agreed upon by studios and the major chains is 90 days.That means Netflix has relied thus far on indie movie houses for its releases, but the leasing of the Paris Theatre would seem to mark a new phase in its strategy.For months, it has reportedly been in talks to buy the historic Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood.On Monday, Deadline Hollywood reported that Netflix had indeed acquired a majority stake in that Los Angeles venue, but Netflix has yet to confirm the deal.The Paris opened in 1948, when screen legend Marlene Dietrich cut the ribbon.It turned into one of the country\'s most notable art house theatres, focusing on films often ignored by multiplexes. — AFP'",5

1114,'Hùng Vương Hospital recognised as a Center of Excellence for Breastfeeding',"'HCM CITY — Hùng Vương Hospital has been recognised as a Center of Excellence for Breastfeeding by the Ministry of Health and Alive & Thrive on Wednesday.Hùng Vương also is the first medical facility in HCM City that received the previous award, a recognition for its intensive efforts to implement early essential newborn care and support breastfeeding.More than 90 per cent of mothers who gave birth at Hùng Vương Hospital in the first nine months of 2019 lauded the breastfeeding counseling and support they received from medical staff. And more than 70 per cent of mothers breastfed their babies exclusively (without resorting to water or formula milk) during their hospital stay.“Those figures speak for themselves. They are concrete evidence of Hùng Vương Hospital’s tremendous effort over the nine months it has participated in the “Center of Excellence for Breastfeeding” initiative from the Ministry of Health, with support from Alive & Thrive and Irish Aid,"" said Roger Mathisen, Regional Director of Alive & Thrive Southeast Asia.""The hospital has invested in its human resources, forming a team of 18 staff specialising in supporting breastfeeding to ensure that every mother feels confident in breastfeeding her children,” Mathisen added.Hùng Vương Hospital has photos, posters and breastfeeding tutorial videos in strategic locations right as mothers walk into the facility. Each mother receives a checklist to record each completed breastfeeding counseling step: antenatal visits during the last three months of pregnancy, breastfeeding initiation within 90 minutes after birth, and breastfeeding babies during postpartum care. This checklist helps mothers and doctors communicate and stay on track, while ensuring mothers receive the breastfeeding counseling and support they need.“Breastfeeding counseling is not easy, especially when misleading information about the benefits of breast milk substitutes like formula milk is all over the media. To address such challenges here at Hùng Vương Hospital, we don’t provide one-sided information or try to impose our will, but rather we inquire about their awareness, experiences and the current circumstance of each mother, and based on that, we determine the appropriate approach and guidance,” said Dr. Phan Thị Hằng, deputy director of Hùng Vương Hospital.In Hùng Vương Hospital, 80 per cent of newborns have skin-to-skin contact for 90 consecutive minutes after birth, and 83 per cent of baby’s breastfeed for the first time during this skin-to-skin contact with their mothers.“I didn’t know that early initiation of breastfeeding is one of the nine instinctive steps increasing the possibility of exclusive breastfeeding to 50 per cent until my prenatal visit during a counseling session with my doctor. It was pure bliss feeling my newborn child on my chest, crawling to my breast for her first feeding. Though this was my second time giving birth, such a breastfeeding experience is new to me,”\xa0said Phạm Hoài Thu, a mother who delivered at the Hùng Vương Hospital.In Việt Nam, 95 per cent of mothers give birth in health facilities, presenting a golden opportunity to raise awareness about the benefits of breastfeeding among mothers like Thu.“Not only is breastfeeding the mission of mothers, but it also demands a share of responsibility and support from families, community and especially health facilities. Counseling on and supporting breastfeeding are essential components of maternal and newborn care for all hospitals with obstetric services across the country,” Nguyễn Đức Vinh, director general of the Department of Maternal\xa0and\xa0Child Health said.Hùng Vương Hospital is among the first five hospitals in Việt Nam to be designated as a Center of Excellence for Breastfeeding. Breastfeeding counseling is not the only fundamental component for successful exclusive breastfeeding – early essential newborn care is also a crucial element. According to the World Health Organisation, babies that receive prolonged, uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact are three times more likely to\xa0breastfeed during the first 90 minutes after birth. — VNS'",1

2243,"'Bank lending interest rates to remain steady, say experts'","'Compiled by Thiên LýAfter increasing steadily in recent times, deposit interest rates at most banks are standing at rather high levels, including 8.5 per cent for 12-month terms at ABBank, Viet Capital Bank and VietABank.Some others such as OCB, BacA Bank, NCB, Bảo Việt Bank, and Nam Á Bank are offering around 8 per cent.Only a few banks have kept their rates moderate: MB is offering 7.5 per cent for 12-month deposits and BIDV is offering 7 per cent.Some credit institutions are selling certificates of deposits to individual customers with coupons rates of over 10 per cent.Viet CapitalBank is offering 10.2 per cent for 60 months.Analysts said most banks increased interest rates on long-term deposits to implement the central bank’s roadmap for reducing the use of short-term deposits for medium- and long-term loans.The State Bank of Viet Nam required banks to reduce the use of short-term deposits for medium- and long-term funds to 40 per cent this year from 45 per cent last year.Dr Đặng Đức Anh, deputy director of the National Centre for Information and Forecast, said banks had to increase deposit mobilisation since the central bank had tightened money supply while demand for loans remained\xa0very high.It is self-evident that any increase in deposit interest rates will have an impact on lending interest rates, but this time experts are divided on this.Some said\xa0there was a possibility that banks would continue to hike deposit interest rates for the rest of this year, and it would result in higher credit interest rates.But many others strongly believed there would be no such impact.According to Dr Cấn Văn Lực, a banking expert, the increasing deposit interest rates do not reflect the banking sector’s liquidity as seen by the fact that many major banks have\xa0kept their deposit interest rates steady.MB still offers only 7.5 per cent for 12-month deposits while VietinBank and BIDV are keeping it at 7 per cent.The inter-bank interest rates have been steady and even shown signs of falling.Dr Trần Du Lịch, a member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Group, said it was clear from this that lending interest rates would remain unchanged from now until year-end.Other experts said lending interest rates relied on many factors including foreign exchange and inflation rates, and these had remained stable since the beginning of the year.The central bank would strive to ensure deposit interest rates do not increase any further, they said.SBV deputy governor Đào Minh Tú said the central bank’s recent decision to reduce key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points was also aimed at enabling banks to cut lending interest rates, especially on loans to businesses in priority sectors.It was likely to make another 0.25 percentage point cut at the end of this year or early next year, he revealed.Tax policy hits fertiliser companies’ bottom lineIn the first nine months of the year Petrovietnam Fertilizer & Chemicals Corporation (DPM) reported net revenues of VNĐ5.4 trillion (US$234.7 million), a year-on-year decrease of 22.6 per cent. Its after-tax profit was down 73 per cent to VNĐ152 billion ($6.6 million).A report from Viet Capital Securities Company said DPM’s profit target in 2019 would likely decrease by 17.3 per cent.Bình Điền Fertiliser Company (BFC) reported a similar situation with turnover and profit declining by 8.8 and 72.7 per cent.The Southern Fertiliser Group made a loss of VNĐ8.9 billion with the third quarter alone accounting for VNĐ4.3 billion.A company spokesperson said sales fell sharply in the third quarter.Why is this happening to fertiliser companies?The DPM management said the bad weather was one of the main reasons the company found it difficult to sell products in the third quarter.A BFC spokesperson concurred with this, adding that the agricultural sector also faced a deep drop in prices meaning many localities had to reduce their production targets.Imports of foreign fertilisers remain at a very high level, which also causes difficulties for the domestic industry.According to the General Customs Department, in the first five months of this year Việt Nam imported more than 1.7 million tonnes of fertilisers for US$488 million.A DPM spokesperson said besides the market difficulties they also had to cope with a sharp increase in fuel prices.But analysts said the biggest problem for fertiliser producers was the value added tax (VAT) policy, which significantly eroded their profits.Fertilisers are not subject to VAT, and this means producers are not entitled to VAT refunds on inputs including machinery and equipment and other fixed assets, which increases cost by 5-8 per cent.Many fertiliser companies have repeatedly petitioned lawmakers to amend Law No.71/2014/QH13 that waives VAT on fertilisers to help them in their current plight.They explained that this waiver badly hit\xa0companies, especially those that had invested in modern technology.PVFCCo, for instance, should have got VAT returns of VNĐ1 trillion between 2015 and 2017.Analysts said lawmakers should add fertilisers to the list of products that are subject to VAT. —VNS'",2

The SEA Games gold medal is the only thing lacking from her\xa0medal collection.Thêm won gold medals at the Asian Pencak Silat Championship in India last October and the World Pencak Silat Championship in Singapore last December.Thanks to\xa0Thêm, Việt Nam also proved their power at big events. They finished\xa0second at the World Pencak Silat Championship with six golds, three silvers and four bronzes, and topped the Asian tournament with 13 gold medals, leaving behind them\xa0runners-up Indonesia with only\xa0three gold medals.“At continental competitions, referees are usually impartial. That is why\xa0Vietnamese martial artists achieve more at these events,"" said head coach Nguyễn Văn Hùng.At the Hà Nội-based National Sports Training Centre, Thêm is training hard for the Games.She is determined\xa0to win fairly so the\xa0referees have no choice but to judge her performance.“I feel\xa0comfortable and don’t have any pressure on\xa0the upcoming Games. In the women’s 55kg category, all the athletes are very strong. However, I am ready for the Games,” said Thêm.“I\'ve prepared very carefully for the event and I\'m determined to win. The referees are\xa0an issue that my teammates and I have to accept. However, I think that if I put on a strong show, the referees will have to recognise it,” Thêm added.Born in 1996 in Thạch Đồng Commune, Hà Tĩnh Province, in a poor family, Thêm started training when she was in eighth grade without permission from her parents. In 2012, she signed up for the provincial junior team, and two years later\xa0she was called up to the national senior team to train\xa0professionally in Hà Nội.“I began to train when I was in eighth grade and skipped school to go to classes.\xa0My teacher phoned my mother and I was spanked.“My mother thought that learning martial arts for a girl was very dangerous and would make it difficult for me to find a husband, so she tried to stop me. But I found a way to train, and after seeing my passion, my mother supported me,” said Thêm.“When I started training professionally, my family backed me totally and my mother said I had made the family proud,” Thêm added.According to Thêm, even as a martial artist, she is really afraid of confrontation.“When I trained in martial arts, I also learnt many things about morality so I have never had to use\xa0kung fu,” said Thêm.One of the difficulties Thêm faces is ensuring her weight ahead of the competition.Thêm often weighs 57kg so she needs to drop 2kg to meet her weight division.“In the summer, it is very hot, but I\xa0wear a raincoat to run. I follow a strict regime\xa0to keep my weight down,” said Thêm.Due to the heavy training, Thêm sometimes loses sleep and suffers shoulder and neck injuries.

3875,'Renewable-energy plan could help VN meet power goals by 2030',"'HCM\xa0CITY\xa0—\xa0A long-term plan for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind must be devised for Việt Nam to realise its goal of connecting the entire country to the national grid, experts have said.Renewable energy will play an essential role in helping Việt Nam accomplish the\xa0goal by 2030, but more Government efforts are needed to attract investment in the sector, they noted.Speaking at an international conference on renewable energy held last week in HCM City, experts said that annual energy consumption in the country had risen by 10 per cent in recent years, and the country was at risk of facing power shortages in the 2020s.Việt Nam has the potential to reach 35,000MW generated by the sun by 2030, according to researchers. Solar energy projects, including rooftop solar, is viewed as one of the major solutions to reduce pressure on the electricity sector.The generation of 1kWh of solar energy will help reduce CO2 emissions by 0.6612 kg, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.Solar energy, a clean energy resource with relatively high output, would also reduce the amount of state spending on power generation and transmission facilities.If only two million rooftops have solar panels (with a capacity of 10 kW per roof), the country would cut by 16 million tonnes the amount of coal needed per year for coal-fired power plants.Trần Việt Nguyên, deputy head of the Electricity of Việt Nam (EVN) business division, said that EVN offices last year installed rooftop solar systems at 54 locations with a total capacity of 3.2 MWp.Some 1,800 customers, including offices, businesses and households, are installing rooftop solar systems with a total capacity of 30.12 MWp, he said.In HCM City, EVN has installed rooftop solar systems with a total capacity of nearly 1,130 kWp and is continuing to deploy other systems.However, Trần Đình Nhân, EVN general director, said this amount was far below the potential of Việt Nam, attributing the reason to a lack of specific regulations about electricity purchases when households connect their solar power systems to the national grid.In addition, information about rooftop solar power remains unclear and the cost of solar power investment at VNĐ20-25 million ($1,000) per kWp is still high, while there is little Government support policy for solar power projects.Customers continue to be reluctant to invest in solar systems due to a lack of information about product quality, operating methods, and equipment warranty.Solar energy goalsWith the goal of reaching solar output of 1GWp by 2020, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc recently approved Việt Nam’s renewable energy development strategy to 2030.The Ministry of Industry and Trade has also issued Circular 16 on solar project development and power purchase agreements (PPAs) in order to solve issues related to taxes and payment methods for rooftop solar power projects.As of the end of last year, about 10,000MW of solar energy had been generated by large solar projects,\xa0according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.More than 100 power purchase agreements (PPAs) were signed with two of them having total capacity of 86MW,\xa0the ministry said.PPA is a financial agreement in which a developer arranges for design, permits, financing and installation of a solar energy system on a customer’s property, at little to no cost.The developer sells the power generated to the host customer at a fixed rate that is typically lower than the local utility’s retail rate.This lower electricity price serves to offset the customer’s purchase of electricity from the grid while the developer receives income from the sale of electricity as well as any tax credits and other incentives generated from the system.At the end of the PPA contract term, a customer may be able to extend the agreement, have the developer remove the system, or choose to buy the solar energy system from the developer.PPAs usually range from 10-25 years and the developer remains responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system for the duration of the agreement.EVN currently cannot sign PPAs with customers because of the lack of official instructions on how to buy solar electricity from households.More effort neededNhân, EVN general director, said the electricity sector would assist households and enterprises in installing solar power systems and help them with procedures to connect to the national grid and sign power purchasing agreements.He said the buying of solar electricity connected to the grid would be done as soon as there are guiding circulars issued by the authorities.EVN will pay for installation of electricity meters to measure the volume of electricity consumed as well as connected to the grid.Samresh Kumar, managing director for principal investments at VinaCapital, said it was important to mobilise international capital to improve the development of rooftop solar energy.Hoàng Quốc Vượng, deputy minister of Industry and Trade, said that a circular to amend Circular 16 would soon be issued by the ministry after collection of comments from ministries and sectors is completed.The new document will specify the method of payment for the purchase of solar output via specific contracts.\xa0The legal document is also expected to encourage investment in and development of rooftop solar energy in the future, he said.Speaking at an international conference on renewable energy held last week in HCM City, Nguyễn Tâm Tiến, CEO of Trung Nam Group, said that renewable energy generation had already significantly increased.Mai Văn Trung, business development director at SolarBK, said the country\xa0has favourable conditions to develop solar energy\xa0and that commercial and industrial solar PV rooftop applications have great development potential.Samresh Kumar of VinaCapital said that solar rooftop power is an effective solution which provides a commercially viable option, especially for commercial and industrial segments.John Rockhold, head of the power and energy sub-working group under the Việt Nam Business Forum, said rooftop solar panels were key to reducing pressure on the national grid, and that modest annual price increases and a road map for efficient energy were both needed. —\xa0VNS'",4

Dump trucks limited transporting rubbish from the city's downtown to bury at Khánh Sơn dump as residents living in Hòa Khánh Nam ward, near Khánh Sơn dump, protested a plan to develop\xa0a solid waste treatment complex at the site.As of yesterday,\xa0rubbish was still piled up.The municipal People’s Committee asked the city's Department of Nature Resources and Environment and Liên Chiểu District to deal with the 1,200 tonnes of garbage that remained at living quarters and in temporary storage.The committee's Huỳnh Đức Thơ\xa0said the department and administration of Liên Chiểu had\xa0to persuade people living near the Khánh Sơn dump to end the blockade.Despite a dialogue between local administration and local people in the area, households still protested and prevented dump trucks getting to the dump.In a meeting last month, the city said it planned to build a waste-to-energy project at Khánh Sơn dump worth US$80 million.The project investor – the Việt Nam Environment Joint-Stock Company – said it would\xa0develop from the already invested first phase of a rubbish recycling plant from 2015 in processing 650 tonnes of garbage each day to supply fuel for power generation from 2021.Nguyễn Văn Tuấn, director of the company, said it would\xa0work with Ever Bright International company from Hong Kong to build a waste treatment complex at the dump.Tuấn said Ever Bright International had already developed a waste treatment project in the southern province of Cần Thơ with a capacity of burning 400 tonnes rubbish as material for generating 150,000 Kwh of power daily.However, residents are suspicious of the use of unhealthy technology in the project to be built at Khánh Sơn dump.Nguyễn Đức Sinh, a resident of Hòa Khánh Nam ward, who joined a field trip to the waste treatment project in Cần Thơ last month, said an updated technology waste treatment plant could stop harmful operations, and the plant should be built at another site, not near living quarters.“We had a visit to the waste processing plant in Cần Thơ that was developed by Ever Bright International. It’s quite smooth operation. However, we could only see a processing test with three dump trucks in two hours,” Sinh said.Phạm Văn Long, a man living near Khánh Sơn dump, asked the local administration and the Khánh Sơn dum-based project investor to be transparent on the planned facility's technology.“We want a clear\xa0demonstration and explanation on the waste processing technology that will be used for the Khánh Sơn dump-based project, and it needs a public\xa0and independent\xa0assessment on the health impact of the project,” Long said.He said\xa0more than 3,400 people had lived in the area since 2004\xa0and Khánh Sơn dump had been seriously\xa0polluted with wastewater leaking from the dump and smelly air over the years.Long said the project should be built at an isolated area\xa0far away from living quarters.Chairman of Hòa Khánh Nam ward\xa0Võ Khoa Nguyên admitted air and wastewater pollution from Khánh Sơn dump had badly impacted thousands of residents.He said the ward asked the city and project investor to build a\xa0modern waste processing plant at the site that wouldn't pollute the area.Vice chairman of the city’s people’s committee\xa0Đặng Việt Dũng said the city had asked Đà Nẵng urban and environment company – the managing unit of Khánh Sơn dump – to plant more trees and carry out wastewater treatment.Dũng said the dump should be replaced by a hi-tech and healthy waste processing project.He said the city would speak\xa0with local people before developing the waste treatment project.Nguyễn Thị Thành, who has lived in the area more than 30 years, said bad air came\xa0from the dump between 8pm to 4am – the busy time of dump trucks operation.She said the dump was scheduled for removal from 2019, but now\xa0a waste treatment complex with unclear technology could be on the way.According to the city’s Department of\xa0Natural\xa0sources and Environment, the Khánh Sơn waste recycling\xa0plant, which was built on 20ha from 2015 by the Việt Nam Environment Joint-Stock Company, failed to treat rubbish effectively in its three years\xa0of operation.However, the Việt Nam Environment Joint-Stock Company was assigned to develop\xa0the second stage by building a waste incinerator\xa0to turn\xa0waste into electricity.Once operational, 100 tonnes of solid garbage could be used to produce from 1.5MW (megawatt) to 2MW of power, a report from the company showed.Đà Nẵng produces nearly 900 tonnes of garbage each day, of which 95 per cent is collected, and only 10 per cent recycled, while an incineration system only processes 200kg of medical solid waste in one hour. — VNS",4

Meanwhile, the macroeconomy remained stable and inflation was curbed at 2.5 per cent, the lowest level in the past three years, he said.\n\nThe exchange rate was stable, the government leader noted, adding that confidence in the Vietnamese đồng\xa0was confirmed, while many countries' currencies depreciated against the US dollar.\n\nExports increased significantly and the trade surplus reached a record of more than US$3.4 billion, he noted.\n\nThe protection of national territorial sovereignty has seen complicated developments, however, competent forces have done their best under the leadership of the Party and Government, PM Phúc stressed.\n\nThe PM also mentioned shortcomings such as the slow disbursement of public investment capital, landslides in the Mekong Delta and difficulties in agriculture and transport infrastructure, requesting relevant departments and sectors to quickly address the issues.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Government discussed the socio-economic development plan in 2020, the report evaluating the implementation of the State budget in 2019 and State budget estimates in 2020 as well as the State budget financial plan in 2020-22.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the socio-economic performance in August and the first eight months of 2019 was positive.\n\nIn the January-August period, the disbursement of foreign direct investment (FDI) reached about $12 billion, a year-on-year rise of 6.3 per cent.\n\nNearly 90,500 new businesses were established with total registered capital of over VNĐ1.15 quadrillion ($49.45 billion), up 3.5 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe number of enterprises that suspended operations decreased by 7 per cent and those resuming operations increased by 21.8 per cent.\n\nThe index of industrial production (IIP) was estimated to expand by 9.5 per cent, lower than the same period in 2018, but still higher than the same period in 2016 and 2017.\n\nTotal retail sales of goods and services were estimated at over VNĐ3.2 quadrillion ($137.6 billion), up 11.5 per cent year-on-year.\n\nThe country welcomed 11.3 million international tourists, a yearly increase of 8.7 per cent.\n\nGoods exports hit nearly $170 billion, up 7.3 per cent year-on-year, of which exports of the domestic economic sector increased by 13.9 per cent. — VNS",0
495,'PM tells Mekong Delta to catch up',"CẦN THƠ — Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has asked the Cửu Long (Mekong Delta) to catch up with other parts of the country.The Government leader said the region needed to change its mindset to cope with the impacts of climate change to achieve\xa0sustainable development.Phúc made the request at a working session in Cần Thơ City on Tuesday between the Socio-economic Sub-committee of the 13th National Party Congress and officials of the 13 Mekong Delta localities and HCM City.Highlighting the country’s socio-economic achievements, he said in the 2019 Sustainable Development Goals Index, Việt Nam ranked 54th among 162 countries and territories, up three places from last year, and second among ASEAN nations, after Thailand.The PM attributed those successes partly to\xa0the Mekong Delta, which makes up 20 per cent of\xa0global rice market share and 80 per cent of Việt Nam’s shrimp production.The local economic structure has\xa0shifted in a positive manner with the expansion of agricultural processing and industrial product manufacturing and export.The PM also pointed out challenges to the region, including climate change, lacking infrastructure, poor human resources, limited regional connectivity, and local residents’ modest incomes.The Government leader underlined the need to finalise a plan with a new mindset and vision that can link the Mekong Delta with HCM City, an economic hub of Việt Nam.He told the Ministry of Planning and Investment to work with\xa0localities, ministries, sectors and experts to build this plan and submit it for approval in mid 2020.The leader also called for\xa0a mechanism\xa0mobilising resources for the plan's implementation, he said, asking the localities to capitalise on private resources.Meanwhile, the Mekong Delta needs to restructure its agriculture by promoting the sector’s technology, efficiency and adaptation to climate change, along with developing agricultural brands and the market for farm produce.Localities should also pay attention to cross-border and sea-based economic activities and different forms of businesses, PM Phúc noted.He asked\xa0regional provinces and cities to\xa0improve local human resources, which is now an urgent need, and form chains of cities to create a driving force for development.Representatives of the provinces and cities said the Mekong Delta needed to remove “bottlenecks” in terms of infrastructure, transport, land and irrigation, make breakthroughs in energy systems and expand connectivity between the localities and HCM City and the whole country.\xa0— VNS",0

2088,'Việt\xa0Nam companies facing longer downtimes from cyberbreaches',"'HÀ NỘI — Organisations in Việt Nam are facing longer downtimes caused by cybersecurity breaches, compared to the regional and global averages, according to a recent Cisco study.The Cisco’s 2019 Asia Pacific CISO Benchmark Study was released this week.Almost a third of companies in Việt Nam were offline for 24 hours or more after their most severe breach in the past one year, compared to just four per cent globally and 23 per cent in the Asia Pacific region.The Việt Nam number is a huge rise from last year, when only 15 per cent of organisations in the country suffered downtime of 24 hours or more.The study is based on a survey of almost 2,000 security professionals from across the region. It highlights that security practitioners in Việt Nam are being kept busy.According to the study, 36 per cent of respondents reported receiving more than 10,000 threat alerts a day, while 26 per cent said they received more than 50,000 alerts per day.With a high number of cyber threats, the real challenge lies in what comes after an alert is received, how many of the alerts are investigated, and how many of those found to be genuine are eventually remediated.The good news is that companies in Việt Nam are doing better than the Asia Pacific average on both those fronts.According to the study, businesses investigated 51 per cent of the threats, compared to 44 per cent across Asia Pacific.Of the threats found to be genuine, 45 per cent were addressed, up from 44 per cent last year.Companies in Việt Nam are doing better in remediating legitimate alerts compared to the regional and global averages, which stood at 38 per cent and 43 per cent respectively.Vietnamese companies have also seen a big decline in the financial impact of cyber breaches. Among the respondents, 18 per cent said the most severe breach in the past one year cost them more than one million dollars. This is a huge decline from a year ago, when 77 per cent of companies reported a financial impact of a million dollars or more.According to Lương Thị Lệ Thủy, managing director at Cisco Việt Nam as digital maturity and adoption increases across Việt Nam, there has been an increased awareness of cybersecurity among businesses.“This is crucial because we will see more users and devices come online in the next few years,” she said.“While this means greater opportunity for businesses, it also means the attack surface would increase exponentially, exposing businesses to more threats and cyber risks.“Security can no longer be an afterthought; it needs to be the underlying foundation of any digitalisation effort.”The study highlights that the use of multiple vendors is adding to the complexity for security professionals.According to the report, 31 per cent of companies are using more than 10 vendors. While the number is better than the global average of 39 per cent, it is still posing a challenge for companies.When asked how challenging it is to manage a multi-vendor environment, 76 per cent said it was somewhat or very challenging to orchestrate multiple vendor alerts. This is in line with the global trend, with 79 per cent of respondents across the world highlighting this as an issue.Kerry Singleton, director of cybersecurity for ASEAN at Cisco, said: “Complexity due to a multi-vendor environment and the increased sophistication of businesses with operational technology networks and multi-cloud adoption continue to challenge security practitioners in Asia Pacific.“As organisations look to reduce the impact of a cybersecurity breach, they need a simplified and systematic approach to security in which solutions act as a team, and learn, listen and respond as a coordinated unit.”The study also pointed out the top three barriers for adopting advanced security technologies in Việt Nam, including lack of trained personnel (47 per cent), lack of knowledge about advanced security processes and technology (40 per cent) and budget constraints (36 per cent).The lack of trained personnel is an issue for a greater number of companies in Việt Nam this year compared to 2018, when only 37 per cent of organisations cited it as a main challenge.When it comes to data breaches and the improvements that were made following a breach, the top improvement among Vietnamese companies was to increase security awareness training among employees (62 per cent), followed by increased investment in security defense technologies or solutions (48 per cent) and increased focus on preventing security breaches caused by employee-owned mobile devices (46 per cent). — VNS'",2

1804,'Revised GDP in line with international practices',"HÀ NỘI — The revision of the size of Việt Nam's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2011-2017 is in line with international practices and serves as a foundation for the country's development path in the next 10 years, an official has said.Chief of the General Statistics Office Nguyễn Bích Lâm made the statement at a seminar in Hà Nội on Friday to announce the results of the revision of the size of Việt Nam’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2011-2017.“As Việt Nam is developing a 10-year socio-economic development strategy for 2021-30 and a five-year plan for 2021-25, it (the revision) will help the Government address the country’s future path in 5-10 years,” he told the seminar.Lâm announced the revision resulted in an averaged enlargement of 25.4 per cent annually of Việt Nam’s economy in 2010-2017 compared to previous data, an increase of VNĐ935 trillion (US$40.5 billion) in GDP per year.Of the estimates, 2011 witnessed the highest growth rate of 27.3 per cent and 2015 saw the lowest at 23.8 per cent.In 2017, the revised GDP size reached VNĐ6.29 quadrillion, while the previously announced figure was more than VNĐ5 quadrillion.According to him, Việt Nam’s revised per-capita GDP in 2010-2017 rose by an average of 25.6 per cent per year compared to the announced figure, corresponding to an average increase of VNĐ10.3 million per person.According to UN Resident Coordinator Kamal Malhotra, in the past decade, Việt Nam's economy had achieved high growth rates and witnessed vast changes in economic structure.The influx of foreign investment and flourishing information technology had created great potential for domestic enterprises, he said.GDP revision was a common international practice, he said, adding that the practice included re-basing, new surveys and administrative data, thus better reflecting the scale of GDP.The revision would assist the Government in the formulation of socio-economic development strategies and help businesses with their plans, he said.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)’s Country Economist Jonathan Pincus said Việt Nam needed to constantly update and adjust its GDP, especially the use of statistics to suit the current period.According to the General Statistics Office (GSO), besides per capita GDP, the revision will also lead to changes in other indicators relative to GDP gross national income, government revenues to GDP, spending deficit to GDP and public debt to GDP.A revised GDP also changes GDP structure, in which the proportion of industry, construction and service sectors increases while the farming sector’s contribution decreases.According to the GSO, the re-assessment of Việt Nam’s GDP will not affect the country’s growth targets and socio-economic development strategy as the growth rates over the years recorded minor changes.GSO Director Nguyễn Bích Lâm said the GDP re-assessment was based on methodology recommended by the UN’s statistics division.The GSO said the review was in line with international practice and not a change in calculation method.Across the world, most countries conduct regular GDP re-assessments depending on available information, the scope and purpose of the review.In Việt Nam, GDP re-evaluation only takes into account defined economic activities, without including the underground and illegal economy, and is carried out periodically every 5-10 years. — VNS",2

The US-funded project, presented yesterday in Hà Nội, aimed to identify energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions of buildings in Việt Nam with a view to reducing emissions in the future, said Vũ Thị Kim Thoa of the USAID Việt Nam Clean Energy Programme.Thoa said five demonstration projects stimulating buildings’ energy usage in Hà Nội and HCM were also completed, and the buidings were upgraded. The projects consulted the buildings’ designers on using materials and new technologies to save from 22 per cent to 44.5 per cent of energy for the five buildings each year, equalling annual savings of US$170,563, she said. Emissions of over 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide would be reduced each year in the five buildings, she said.The buildings included the Hà Nội Energy Manager Training Centre, the State Securities Commission of Việt Nam, Việt Nam National Construction Consultants Corporation, the Trúc Bạch Building Complex and HCM City’s Capital Place.Additionally, 2,955 Vietnamese professionals and building owners, 26 per cent of them women, participated in training courses of design, construction and operating green buildings for energy efficiency, she said.The programme also promoted the use of energy-efficient building materials in the construction sector in order to reduce energy consumption throughout the buildings’ life cycle, she said.Lương Đức Long, president of the Việt Nam Institute for Building Materials, said the programme would serve as a foundation to compile a plan for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in manufacturing building materials that had large emission levels. For example, the plan scheduled a reduction of 4.37 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission in producing cement and sanitary ware by 2020, he said.AssessmentsĐỗ Bình Yên, former deputy director of the Institute of Engery Science, said the data samples collected this time had been considerably larger and more reliable than before. They included architectural and construction elements that were not collected before, he said. Data on ventilation, lighting and air-conditioning were added to energy-consumption measurements, he added. ""We can say we now have a valuable database to drive energy planning policies forward,"" he said.Nguyễn Thị Như Trang, a lecturer at Hà Nội Architectural University who participated in a training course under the programme, said she learned many new things, including energy stimulation allowing her to create a computer model of a building and calculate its energy efficiency. ""This was the first time I’d used such software and it was very interesting,"" she said.She said she had imparted the knowledge to her students so that they could compare the energy consumption of green buildings and normal buildings.Nguyễn Công Thịnh, deputy director of the Science, Technology and Environment Department under the Ministry of Construction, said the programme would allow the ministry to assess the current situation of the construction sector and issue a green growth action plan for the construction sector by 2020, with a vision to 2030. — VNS'",4
763,'Remembering former President Lê Đức Anh',"HÀ NỘI — General Lê Đức Anh was a leader whose contribution was of immeasurable importance to Việt Nam during both war and peace.The former President and Politburo member passed away on Monday at his home in Hà Nội due to illness and old age. He was 99.He was the last general that partook in all major battles of the country to pass away, including the anti-French war, the American war, and the wars to defend the southwestern and northern borders, according to Deputy Minister of Public Security Bùi Văn Nam.To former Minister of Defence Phạm Văn Trà, General Lê Đức Anh was a brave and fair leader who dared to make decisions and take responsibility for his actions during difficult times.He allowed everyone to speak up during discussions of military strategies and encouraged them to defend their opinions until the end, Trà said.“I stood up against him twice. At first I thought he wouldn’t listen to me, but he did,” Trà said.“Our most-heated discussion was at the beginning of 1978 during the Battle of Phú Cương Mountain against Pol Pot’s regime in the southern province of An Giang. His tactics were different to what we were used to, so I said to him we couldn’t do it.“He resented it at first, saying if we don’t want to do it, then don’t do it. But I said to him it was his responsibility to make that decision, we would do whatever he said. Finally, he gave in and opted for our tactics. During that battle, the Khmer Rouge ran away.”General Lê Đức Anh was born in 1920 in the central province of Thừa Thiên-Huế.Since he was young he had had the opportunity to meet with patriots and revolutionists, and read about Communism and about the activities of Nguyễn Ái Quốc (President Hồ Chí Minh) in France.In 1938, at 18 years old, he became a member of the Communist Party of Việt Nam. He served as a commander in Thủ Dầu Một City in the southern province of Bình Dương during the August Revolution in 1945, and later joined the anti-French resistance in the southeastern region.He took part in several major battles as Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Việt Nam People's Army, Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Command of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, and Commander of Military Zone 9.He was the second-in-command of the Hồ Chí Minh Campaign, the military offensive that put an end to the three-decade conflict in Việt Nam and unified the country on April 30, 1975.In 1984, he was promoted to the rank of General, then served as Chief of General Staff of the Việt Nam People's Army (1986), Minister of Defence (December 1986 – December 1991). He was President of Việt Nam during 1992-97.An outstanding diplomatNot only did he make major contributions to the fight for freedom, General Lê Đức Anh also played a significant role in the development and expansion of diplomatic relations of Việt Nam, especially in normalising relations between the country and China and the US.The normalisation of the\xa0relation\xa0with the US began in 1986, at the same time as the Đổi Mới (Renewal) process started. As a defence minister, General Lê Đức Anh started to implement Operation Smile – an initiative that repairs childhood facial deformities – and ran a search of American soldiers declared as missing-in-action during the war, which was considered a new approach to normalising relations with the US.In July 1991, he visited China as a Politburo envoy, creating a foundation for an official visit of the then Party General Secretary Đỗ Mười and then Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt to the country in November of the same year. The two countries later issued a joint statement and signed an official agreement to normalise relations as the result of the visit.He said about the process of building the diplomatic relations: “It’s a process that we must take caution every step of the way, and it must serve our nation’s independence and interests.“The independence and interests of our nation and the sacred sovereignty of our fatherland must always be our first priority.”Lê Đức Anh’s devotion to the country was highly appreciated by former Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt.He once said: “After all these years, whether as a soldier in the battlefield or a State leader, Lê Đức Anh has always been a great officer and a leader of dignity, bravery and responsibility.“As a defence minister, he made drastic changes to the organisational structure of the Việt Nam People’s Army and People’s Armed Forces, and he was a leader of great influence in the period of national renewal.“If I am to be honest, we don’t have many leaders like him.”Deputy Minister of Public Security Bùi Văn Nam said: “I’ve heard a lot of stories about him having an outstanding vision when it comes to handling issues of national defence, security, foreign affairs, economics and society.“He was also a great child of the central province of Thừa Thiên-Huế. I’ve had the chance to visit his hometown and I’ve seen with my own eyes the admiration that people there have for him.“They are proud of him – a commander, a great leader who made great contributions to the country during both wartime and peacetime.” — VNS",0

2137,'Four bank shares to gain maximum 68 per cent in 12 months: JP Morgan',"'HÀ NỘI — Shares of four Vietnamese banks may rise 14-68 per cent in 12 months, according to JP Morgan’s Asia Pacific Equity Research.The New York-based financial institution said in its research that the Vietnamese banks “offered an increasingly rare combination of high and self-sustaining earnings growth.""“This, with a favourable credit cycle, should lead to significant multi-year returns,” the US bank reported early this month.In addition, high visibility on nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and current account surplus allows “extrapolation of strong earnings and credit growth in Việt Nam.”JP Morgan rated shares of the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (Vietcombank), the Vietnam Technological and Commercial Joint Stock bank (Techcombank) and the Asia Commercial Joint Stock Bank (ACB) at over weight and the Vietnam Prosperity Joint Stock Commercial Bank (VPBank) at neutral.The banks under JP Morgan’s coverage are expected to deliver 15-21 per cent return-on-equity (RoE) ratios in the next two years as\xa0“they have started making money on both sides of the balance sheet.”JP Morgan also highlighted favourable cyclical positioning as a defining feature\xa0of the Vietnamese banking system, which managed\xa0asset quality problems well in 2012-13.It spoke highly of the creation of the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC), which “provided a five-year timeline to write off bad debt” and allowed\xa0banks to grow sustainably through being funded against VAMC bonds.Vietcombank, Techcombank, ACB and VPBank were forecast to record a 12 per cent earnings compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for 2019-21 on the back of a 16 per cent loan CAGR and a 6-13 basis point net interest margin (NIM) compression, as competition in retail loans should crimp yields.JP Morgan warned the four banks’ stock of capital would appear low at a 12.2 per cent capital adequacy ratio (CAR) as they were “transitioning from Basel 1 to Basel 2.”Meanwhile, high RoE, limited dividend payout rates of 0-17 per cent and reasonable risk-weighted asset growth of 13-19 per cent would ensure capital needs are met.In addition, credit penetration at 104 per cent of the revised GDP is high, according to JP Morgan, due to “leverage build-up at State-linked companies with low capital efficiency” and a higher consumer leverage that would limit growth and lead to non-performing loans (NPLs).Other risks JP Morgan pointed out\xa0include Moody’s placing 17 banks under review for a possible credit rating downgrade due to delayed Government payments, the foreign exchange depreciation lowering USD returns for investors, and the US Treasury’s watch over Việt Nam for possible status as a\xa0currency manipulator.\xa0— VNS'",2

2301,'October’s CPI reaches three-year high',"'HÀ NỘI – Việt Nam’s consumer price index (CPI) in October increased by 0.59 per cent against September – the highest rate in the last three years, driven by soaring pork and fuel prices, data from\xa0the General Statistics Office (GSO) showed on Tuesday.CPI in the last 10 months rose 2.79 per cent.According to Đỗ Thị Ngọc, director of the GSO’s Price Statistics Department, high inflation rate in October was caused by the soaring price of pork, which climbed 7.85 per cent in the month\xa0after African swine fever decimated pork supplies.Pork was the main ingredient in Vietnamese meals and rising pork prices contributed 0.33 per cent to October’s CPI increase, Ngọc said.African swine fever had\xa0killed nearly 5.7 million pigs weighing\xa0327,000 tonnes as of October 22. Việt Nam’s national pig herd has\xa0fallen 20 per cent compared to the same period last year.The deadly swine disease was\xa0expected to continue depressing pork supplies towards the end of this year when many big festivals take place, including the New Year\xa0and Lunar New Year\xa0holidays, Ngọc said.In addition, gasoline and oil prices which rose 2.22 per cent in October also contributed significantly to rising CPI. After two adjustments in October, A95 gasoline price increased VNĐ650 (three US cents) per litre, and E5 gasoline went up VNĐ360 per litre, contributing 0.1 per cent to the overall CPI rise.Since early this month, the domestic gas price has\xa0also increased to VNĐ24,000 ($1.03) per 12kg cylinder, up 7.6 per cent against September, following rises in the world gas prices which surged $72.5 per tonne to average\xa0$427.5 in October.GSO\xa0data revealed 10 out of 11 groups of commodities saw prices increase compared to the previous month, of which food and foodstuff grew 1.04 per cent; housing and construction materials was up 0.53 per cent; and traffic up 0.99 per cent.Other commodities including beverages and cigarettes,\xa0garments, footwear and hats,\xa0education,\xa0culture, entertainment and tourism,\xa0medicine and healthcare,\xa0and household appliances and goods\xa0increased by less than 0.3 per cent.Only the price\xa0of postal services and telecommunications decreased by 0.06 per cent.In October, the gold price index was down 0.57 per cent, in line with downward global trends which fell 1.26 per cent in the\xa0month due to positive signs from the US-China trade negotiations and the Fed\xa0possibly cutting rates to support the domestic economy. The domestic gold price is hovering around VNĐ42 million per tael (1.2 ounces).Meanwhile, the US dollar increased slightly by 0.03 per cent compared to the previous month thanks to abundant foreign currency reserves at\xa0the State Bank of Việt Nam. The foreign exchange rate between the US dollar and Vietnamese đồng was stable, averaging around VNĐ23,227 in October. — VNS'",2

However, their efforts are insufficient, especially when coal-generated electricity is playing an important role to ensure energy security in\xa0countries like Việt Nam, Thailand and Indonesia.Đặng Hà Sơn from the Centre for Energy and Green Growth Research said Việt Nam has increased imports of bituminous coal to meet demand for industrial activities and power generation.The country should apply advanced measures to use energy in an effective way, and it is necessary for State-owned agencies to carry out meticulous studies\xa0to lay down standards to curb sulfur and mercury emissions from industrial plants, he said.Meanwhile, Lesley Sloss, a representative from the Clean Coal Centre, said there are many technologies to reduce pollutants from coal burning, and management of mercury can be done by using clean coal. — VNS",4
428,'NA Standing Committee clarifies planning law',"'HÀ NỘI Lawmakers at the ongoing meeting of National Assembly (NA) Standing Committee approved a resolution on Tuesday to clarify vague definitions in the Law on Planning.\nAccording to Minister of Planning and Investment Nguyễn Chí Dũng, the Law on Planning was approved at the fourth session of the 14th NA in November 2017 and took effect on January 1, 2019.\nEight months since it was enforced,\xa0ministries, sectors and localities have different understandings of a number of the law’s articles, leading to sluggish planning implementation for 2021-30.\nThe Government proposed the NA Standing Committee issue\xa0the resolution to explain a number of vague articles.\nDeputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng said that the Law on Planning’s enforcement was key to national planning implementation. However, planning at regional, sector and local levels had faced obstacles.\nAfter the resolution was approved, the Government would instruct sectors and localities\xa0to overcome the obstacles, he said, adding that planning workload was huge with new projects, from marine planning, land use planning to local and national planning.\nLawmakers at the meeting proposed the Government issue a set of rules and steps to implement planning at national and local level to avoid overlaps.The NA spent the afternoon discussing a report which reviews the policies on managing and using off-budget financial funds.A decision to issue a decree on supervising the use and management of these funds was made as the result of the discussion.A thorough review of all of these funds, spent between 2013-18, will be conducted by the Government to evaluate performance, from which rearrangement and merging of the funds might take place, according to NA vice chairman Phùng Quốc Hiển.The decision was made following the presentation of the report by Nguyễn Đức Hải, chairman of the NA’s Finance-Budget Committee, which found there had not been a consistent flow of management of these funds at both the central and local levels of authority across the country.The financial resources used to establish these funds were not strong enough to make sure they can function without support from the State budget, according to the report.There were also overlaps between the functions and missions of the funds, leading to their poor performance, the report said.Based on these findings, chairman Hải proposed the NA issue a decree to better manage these funds, and terminate unnecessary and non-performing ones.Stressing the importance of the reviewing process, Lê Thị Nga, chairwoman of the NA’s Judicial Committee, said there was a loophole in the 2015 Law on State budget.“The law regulated that these funds are ‘independent from the State budget’, but provided only general guidance on defining their functions. A legal corridor to manage them has not been established,” she said.Reading the report by the NA’s Finance-Budget Committee, NA chairwoman Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân pointed out there were some 100 legal documents allowing the establishment and regulating the functions of these funds.“This shows that our legal system to manage these funds is complicated, inconsistent, intransparent and impractical,” she said.

2164,'PPP regulations to be changed to serve development',"'HÀ NỘI \xa0—\xa0More than per 76 per cent of current investment projects following\xa0public-private partnerships\xa0(PPP) are\xa0in the field of transport infrastructure, but\xa0investors still feel insecure.Of the 289 PPP investment projects, there are 220 involved in\xa0transport infrastructure, said Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyễn Nhật attending a\xa0conference themed ""Solutions to promote investment in the development of transport system structure under PPP"" in the capital\xa0last week.Nhật told Việt Nam News: “The total investment capital of PPP projects in the form of construction-business-transfer\xa0or BOT is worth about VND210 trillion (more than US$ 9 billion), and this\xa0was significantly supporting the limited budget in the field.”“The legal framework for PPPs is not strong enough to encourage more private investors, especially\xa0in the context that an infrastructure project usually lasts between 15 and 20 years, and has high risks,” he said.The Ministry of Transport sent 125 delegations and inspectors to\xa0PPP projects between 2018-19, and the Vietnam Association of Road Traffic Investors (Varsi)\xa0surveyed\xa012 road projects. The results showed investors faced many\xa0obstacles and problems carrying\xa0out PPP projects in Việt Nam.Trần Chủng, chairman of Varsi, said regulations for PPP capital management remained lax\xa0as State capital in PPP projects was mainly allocated from the annual public investment plan.In more detail, Cấn Văn Lực, chief expert at the\xa0Vietnam Development Bank (BIDV), said\xa0PPP capital came from four sources: 20 per cent from\xa0owner\'s equity, 40-50 per cent from credit institutions, 20 per cent from capital markets such as corporate and project bonds, and 20 per cent from the fund.Lực said BIDV specialised in medium and long-term capital, but it was\xa0 in a\xa0restructuring period and could not\xa0meet the capital demands of all projects. At the same time, other credit institutions in the market preferred short-term loans as long-term loans could\xa0lead to bad debt.Saying that PPP was an\xa0effective method\xa0to attract investment, Nguyễn Mại, vice chairman of the Việt Nam Association of Foreign Invested Enterprises, said: “The biggest roadblocks for PPP in Việt Nam is that local investors have encountered a series of difficulties when implementing projects, and foreign investors are wary of getting involved in road projects.”Mại told Việt Nam News the\xa0lack of guarantees or a\xa0risk-sharing mechanism was\xa0the biggest obstruction for investors. For example, the Government should come up with\xa0effective methods to ensure the toll collection roadmap. Conflicts between investors and local people caused losses for investors.Nguyễn Văn Khang, deputy general director of the Investment Joint Stock Company Cường Thuận Development (IDICO) recalled a\xa0case in\xa02017 when some people opposed paying a\xa0toll at\xa0BOT stations. Without regulations clarifying the responsibilities\xa0and rights of stakeholders, corporates faced losses.Capital was another matter, according to BIDV’s Cấn Văn Lực, who said\xa0the minimum capital of VNĐ200 billion ($8.6 million) for a PPP mentioned in the draft law was lower than\xa0the international level which ranges from $50-100 million.Luc said slow investment\xa0would take its toll on projects, reducing\xa0investment efficiency and putting off\xa0big investors.The conference was held last week to get more ideas for the draft \xa0law on\xa0PPPs with 11 chapters and 112 articles.

Rescue personnel and equipment must be on standby for any emergency.As of 6am on Tuesday, border guard forces had been working with local authorities, boat owners and captains to inform more than 28,641 vessels carrying around 103,267 sailors of the development and direction of the storm so they could find shelter and escape hazardous zones.On Tuesday morning, the system was located 190 km off the East Sea’s northeastern territorial waters and Hoàng Sa (Paracel) archipelagoes, with maximum sustained winds of between 40 and 60 km per hour near the centre.By 1pm on Wednesday, it will be at the Hainan Island’s eastern territorial waters with winds of 60- 75 km per hour.The storm will continue moving west- northwest at speeds of 15 km per hour towards the \xa0territorial waters of Quảng Ninh to Nam Định provinces.The influence of the storm along with high sea surface temperatures will create favourable condition for the tropical storm to make landfall in Việt Nam. It will trigger heavy downpours in the North and North-Central region on Wednesday and Thursday with average rainfall of 100-250mm. Flash floods and landslides are forecast for these regions.Floods are predicted to occur on rivers in provinces from Thanh Hóa to Hà Tĩnh with water levels rising from 2-5m. — VNS'",4

It means we will have to play an extra\xa0match compared to teams\xa0Group A. The teams in Group B are really strong so the\xa0result of every\xa0match is very important.

The Hà Nội People’s Procuracy want the four to pay back more money, and the defendants are asking for a reduction in their sentences.In June, the Hà Nội People’s Court sentenced four former leaders of State-run Vietnam Shipping Industry Corporation (Vinashin), now the Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (SBIC) for abusing their positions and power to appropriate assets at the first instance trial in Hà Nội.Nguyễn Ngọc Sự, former chairman of Vinashin’s member council was sentenced to 13 years.Trần Đức Chính, ex-chief accountant, was sentenced 17 years while former general director Trương Văn Tuyến and former deputy general director Phạm Thanh Sơn were jailed for seven and six years, respectively.In addition to the prison sentence, the court also requested the defendants to pay back the money they illegally appropriated.Following the trial, the Hà Nội People’s Procuracy filed appeals to increase punishment for Sự. It also asked for the defendants to pay back additional of VNĐ14.8 billion (US$640,000).Sự and Tuyến asked for reduced sentences. However, Sự then withdrew the petition before the appeal opened.Sơn said the sentence was too heavy and that it was wrong to ask him to payback VNĐ4.5 billion.Chính asked for an appeal for the whole sentence.From 2008 to 2010, Vinashin encountered many difficulties and was on the verge of bankruptcy, prompting the Party and State to restructure the group.Vinashin received VNĐ2.2 trillion ($94.8 million) from the Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group and VNĐ4.19 trillion from the Central Corporate Restructuring and Supporting Fund.According to the trial’s indictment, the four defendants agreed to make fixed-term deposits at OceanBank to gain extra interest that was not stated in deposit contracts.Investigators found that from 2010 to June 2014, Vinashin made more than 2,300 fixed-term deposits totalling nearly VNĐ104 trillion ($4.45 billion) and some $181 million with OceanBank.\n\nFrom March 2011 to August 2014, Chính received more than VNĐ105 billion ($4.5 million) in extra interest from OceanBank. As agreed by the four, Chính was assigned to receive and manage the extra interest which was used for the firm’s activities and divided up among them.\n\nSự initiated the depositing, signed 12 deposit contracts and pocketed VNĐ8 billion himself. Authorised by Tuyến, Chính also signed many deposit contracts at OceanBank and appropriated VNĐ10 billion, while Tuyến pocketed VNĐ3.5 billion and Sơn bagged VNĐ1.2 billion.The appeal is expected to end today and the sentences will be announced on Monday. — VNS'",0

Ninh also approved the plan to equitise the Airports Corporation of Việt Nam and 10 internal water management units, which were not subject to equitisation.These documents ran counter to the Politburo’s conclusions and the Government’s decree on equitisation and divestment of State capital in tandem with the restructuring of State-owned enterprises.As a member of the Party Central Committee, Secretary of the Party Civil Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Finance, Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Vietnam Social Security Management Council from July 2006 to 2011, Ninh lacked responsibility, violated the Law on Social Insurance and the Government’s decree on the Việt Nam Social Security (VSS).He let two VSS general directors (in 2008 and 2009) seriously violate legal regulations by signing contracts allowing Agribank Financial Leasing Company No 2 to get loans worth VNĐ1.01 trillion (US$43.43 million).The bankruptcy of\xa0 Agribank Financial Leasing Company No 2 resulted in a huge loss for the State.

1670,'Elderly woman shows trash can mean cash',"'By Mai HiênHÀ NỘI — She may be 87 years old, but Bùi Thị Thịnh is showing no signs of slowing down.In fact, this grandmother of eight is a woman on a mission – to rid the planet of plastic waste creating a better world for future generations.“Fighting against plastic waste requires a long time,” Thịnh said.“I hope that more and people will join us in this effort. I believe together we can make a major change.”From her small one-storey house in Hà Nội’s Hà Đông District, Thịnh co-ordinates a team of helpers who scour the streets salvaging anything they can recycle.Her efforts fall under the umbrella of the Women’s Union, and Thịnh is more than happy to set a good example for others to follow.She has even enlisted the help of the neighbourhood’s younger generation – and has her own Facebook profile to post and live stream her efforts.She said: “Children usually come to my house, asking me to give them bags so they can collect trash that can be recycled.”Their efforts don’t go unrewarded.\xa0Thịnh often repays their hard work with sweets and gifts.Thịnh’s friends all share her ideals and as the old saying goes, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.The items collected are sold on, and cash raised is used to make soup to give to patients at the National Cancer Hospital’s branch in Tân Triều Commune, Thanh Trì District.She added: “The trash collection has been implemented in Phúc La Ward where I lived two years ago. The purpose of the activity is to have money to provide free soup\xa0for poor patients.”“Women are the ones who throw away rubbish in the family. The trash collection movement is not only for humanity but also a way to recycle waste.”Lê Thị Hương\xa0, head of Phúc La Ward’s Women’s Union,\xa0said often the groups don’t realise there’s money to be made.“At first not many people responded\xa0to the movement,” she said.”People think rubbish can’t bring about much money but a residential group could collect VNĐ30 million (US$1,290) a year. It was quite a big surprise.”The money collected from selling trash will be spent on charity programmes as well as purchasing hand baskets and glass bottles to give to members who are active in waste collection and environmental protection.According to Hương, scrap collection is a renovation of the movement of exchanging scrap for green products. It is organised once a month instead of twice a year as was in the past.Local women will bring their belongings that are no longer in use to a certain gathering point.“Some sub-unions do the gathering of garbage once a week – on Saturday morning,\xa0and they usually collect between VNĐ500,000 - VNĐ1 million each time.”Now the movement has proved to be successful as most people in the locality are involved, Huong said.“You can see that every hair salon in Phúc La Ward has a bag for keeping used shampoo bottles. If you ask them what\xa0it is for, they’ll say\xa0that they gather to hand in to the women’s union,” she said.The scrap collection movement was conducted following late President Hồ Chí Minh’s practice of thrift – that is saving from the smallest things, Hương said.\xa0 It also enhanced the awareness on environmental protection of both the elderly and children.As children often followed their grandmothers’ example, the movement would help set up a good habit for them from\xa0childhood, she said.Every Saturday, at 5.30am, about 60 women gather in front of CT4C in Xa La urban area.After doing morning exercises, they clean up the surrounding environment, collecting rubbish and then start\xa0classifying wastes at the gathering point.“We long for Saturday so that we can take part in the event,” Nguyễn Thị Tuấn, a member of the group, adding that most of the participants are retired employees who want to do something for society.She said this is a very practical programme to clean up the environment, spreading the solidarity and mutual affection in families.Tuấn said the key to the success of the programme is the involvement of the elderly – because younger people see their elders taking action and learning from them.“It is difficult to meet younger people because many have busy lives, the advocacy should start with the elderly who will spread the information to other members in their family,” she said.But the secret of future success, and a better, greener environment, will always ultimately fall on the shoulders of the next generation.Tuấn also said to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of the movement, children should be educated on environmental protection from a very young age.But as 87-year-old Bùi Thị Thịnh proves beyond doubt, you are never too old to learn. — VNS'",1

While it\'s the Vietnamese side\'s first appearance in the showpiece final, the North Korean side played in the same game last year, losing out to Altyn Asyr of Turkmenistan.In a press briefing yesterday in Hà Nội, O said 4.25 and Hà Nội were strong teams as both had advanced to this stage of the tournament but tt was difficult to say who was stronger.“4.25 players are really fast and strong as they are training in the environment of military which orders great physique and strict discipline. They are good in attacks too and each of them has their own remarkable abilities,” said O, who confirmed that six national team players in his squad would play tomorrow but refused to predict a score.O said he had researched Hà Nội but found little information, bar that\xa0Nguyễn Văn Quyết and Nguyễn Quang Hải were danger men.“They will be in the starting squad, leading Hà Nội to play in attack and they may score tomorrow,” he said.Like his coach, midfielder Won Song shared little about his team.“We are confident for a win because we are a united team and we support each other in great way,” he said.On the home side, coach Chu Đình Nghiêm has also studied mysterious 4.25 SC.“There is almost no information about 4.25. We just know they are strong although they have\xa0no foreigners in their team. And they\xa0press\xa0really well,” said Nghiêm.“Their No 13 (striker Rim Chol-min) and 18 (striker Kim Yu-song) are good players and we need to keep our eyes on them.”Kim has 23 AFC Cup goals to his name in the past three years and\xa0has netted eight times this year.Rim has also impressed in the current campaign. The forward has weighed in with three goals and is strong in the air.Coach\xa0Nghiêm is facing a familiar problem of a shortage of players.“Left defender Đoàn Văn Hậu moved\xa0to the Netherlands leaving a hole in the defence while some players who could replace him are not in the best condition. Phạm Văn Nam has a problem with his knee, Phạm Đức Huy has not recovered 100 per cent while Nguyễn Văn Dũng is suspended because of two yellow cards,” said Nghiêm.“However we have to find a solution,” he said.Nghiêm also said that Hà Nội, who won the V.League title last week, were successful due to their team-building style, not depending on any individual player. It would be a mistake\xa0if 2.45 SC pay much attention to midfielders Quyết and Hải as it would be chance for other stars to shine, he said.“Hà Nội are in a good mood after winning the domestic league. We still have two more to go, the National Cup and the AFC Cup. Now, we will give priority to\xa0this continental tournament first to have best result,” he said.“They are tough but we will step by step remove any obstacles during the game.”At the briefing, Hà\xa0Nội\xa0midfielder Đỗ Hùng Dũng spoke of his team\'s surprise to have made it one step from the competition\'s final proper.""It is a surprise when we are in the Inter-zonal final as our target at the beginning was winning the ASEAN Zone only.""In the coming match, our rivals are stronger as they are No 45 in Asia (Hà Nội are No 57).

Drowning is the leading cause of death for those under the age of 19, killing more than 3,000 children and adolescents annually,” he said.Besides traffic accidents and drowning, falls, self-inflicted violence, burns and poisoning are the other top causes.Phạm Việt Cường from Hà Nội University of Public Health said the number of suicides among those between 15 and 19 had increased, urging the necessity for psychological health care and lifestyle education for adolescents, especially during puberty.Vũ Thị Kim Hoa, deputy head of the Children’s Department under Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said one of the targets in the national programme on children’s injury prevention was to reduce the number of deaths by drowning.To realise the target, the ministry had organised classes to teach children how to swim and equip them with safety skills.The ministry had worked with agencies to compose safe swimming textbooks to teach children swimming skills so that after training, children can swim at least 25m and float for 90 seconds, she said.The ministry had also made schools and houses safer by erecting fences, warning signs and using cribs to take care of children.Anuradha Khanai, director of Global Health Advocacy Incubator in Southeast Asia, said the percentage of children’s death caused by drowning in Việt Nam was 10 times higher than that of other developed countries.Since 2018, the organisation has helped Việt Nam implement a series of children’s drowning prevention programmes.More than 6,100 children have been equipped with swimming skills and some 550 swimming teachers have been trained in 21 districts of eight provinces which have the highest percentage of child drownings, namely Lào Cai, Yên Bái, Ninh Bình, Thanh Hoá, Quảng Bình, Đắk Lắk, Đồng Tháp and Sóc Trăng.The classes teach children swimming skills to survive, not just normal swimming skills, Khanai said.By the end of this year, more than 16,000 children aged between six and 15 are expected to be trained with water safety skills. The project will be implemented in other localities, aiming to reduce injuries caused by drowning by 20 per cent.According to the World Health Organisation, more than 5 million people die of injuries every year globally. They account for 9 per cent of global mortality and are a threat to health in every country of the worldAmong those, more than 1.2 million died of traffic accidents worldwide. More than 600,000 children under the age of 15 died of drowning. Two thirds of those cases are reported in low and middle income countries. VNS'",1

Water shortages are threatening food security and public health.Identified as an economy significantly affected by climate change and rising sea levels, Việt Nam is also located downstream of two important international rivers, in which two-thirds of the water in Việt Nam flows from neighbouring countries.""Therefore, the availability of freshwater and water management are priorities in agriculture development policies,"" he said.At a symposium on ""Building resilient agro-food systems from production to consumption,” Hong-Sang Jung, executive director, APEC Climate Centre, said ""food security is one of the most central concerns of the 21st century"".As the world’s population would exceed nine billion by 2050, the world needs to produce at least 50 per cent more food by that time, according to Jung.However climate change has traumatised the sufficient and stable drive of food.The conference would be a place for policy makers and experts to exchange concrete ideas, information and opinions to tackle the issue of food security, which Jung said would require an inter-disciplinary approach and joint work by invited experts.Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Nguyễn Linh Ngọc said enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture in response to climate change is the priority of APEC Việt Nam 2017.""Food security is one of the top concerns in APEC as it contributes 55 per cent of global agricultural produce. Food security is also listed as the second goal in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.""This event would improve understanding of weather and climate information to effectively utilise it to enhance food security and sustainable development, he added.Đào Anh Dũng, deputy chairman of the Cần Thơ city People’s Committee, said the Mekong Delta, comprised of Cần Thơ and 12 provinces, contributes more than 90 per cent of Việt Nam’s rice exports, 60 per cent of fisheries exports and more than 50 per cent of fruit and vegetable exports.Agricultural production and rural livelihoods depend entirely on natural conditions.""Climate change has been a complex issue, especially with floods in 2011 and saline intrusion in 2016, that has caused great damage to agriculture production in the entire Mekong Delta, affecting social stability and the sustainable development of the community.""According to local and international experts, the unpredictable weather conditions have severely affected agriculture and aquaculture production.""The main focus is to link production and consumption, ensure environmental protection and the sustainable exploitation of resources, and adapt to climate change,"" Dũng added.News from SOM 3 will be updated later.\xa0—\xa0VNS'",4

We have not had any intellectual properties being registered.”Start-up businesses require an ecosystem, which is developed based on a strong financial sector and market-leading companies with help from research institutions and schools, he said.“Local firms are only\xa0able to buy technologies but unable to master them. So they have to buy new technologies to keep business operation up to date.“If we cannot master existing technologies, we cannot develop new ones.”Việt Nam cannot keep benefiting from a low-cost workforce and cheap resources, or its economy will never escape the middle-income trap, he said.Technological\xa0advancement is key to economic development, he stressed.According to Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam, Việt Nam has become the second home to many international corporations – who have helped boost the Vietnamese economy by bringing in new technologies and production methods.Businesses and Government agencies must pay attention to the development of infrastructure and the finance-banking system. In addition, students must be more creative.Việt Nam has made strong efforts to nurture sectors that benefit from Industry 4.0 and embed information and communications in all areas, which is proven\xa0by the high number of both internet and smartphone users and a fast-growing telecommunications sector in the country.Phan Minh Tân, chairman of Simple Tech Investment JSC, said technologies help companies transform business models, increase productivity, improve corporate governance, optimise the working system and expand operations.But technologies also put Vietnamese enterprises under pressure to change. If a business does not fully understand technologies, it will waste resources, Tân said.In the last two decades, the world has made great achievements in science and technology, offering vast opportunities and changes for businesses, Lương Thanh Văn, chairman of the Vietnam-Australia Seafood JSC, said.According to PwC’s Industry 4.0 Việt Nam Survey 2018, companies in Việt Nam anticipate the fast-approaching Industry 4.0 will bring significant benefits, such as higher efficiency of operations as well as improved access to customers brought by digitisation and automation. The same positive sentiment was conveyed by most industry leaders at the summit.“Adopting new technologies is important, but more than that, business leaders need to think of digital transformation as an integral part of the overall development strategy of their business,” Võ Tấn Long, Technology Consulting Partner of PwC Consulting Vietnam, said at a panel discussion focusing on the impacts of scientific and technological innovations.Đinh Thị Quỳnh Vân, General Director of PwC Vietnam, stressed a holistic approach to transforming for the digital age.She said a successful business strategy for the digital age should be able to empower the workforce to own the digital transformation journey.In a new study PwC conducted among more than 22,000 workers across 11 countries,\xa061 per cent\xa0of respondents were positive about the impact of technology on their day-to-day work, but only a third said they\xa0are given many opportunities to develop digital skills outside their normal duties.“Upskilling the current workforce is key. It is about giving each existing employee the opportunities to gain the knowledge, tools, and abilities they need to use more advanced and ever-changing technologies in the workplace,” Vân said. “Given the right context, people can be highly adaptable, and the ability of organisations to make use of that adaptability will be critical.” — VNS'",2

314,'Deputy Prime Minister calls for effective solutions to forest land conversion',"'HÀ NỘI — Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ has asked ministries and agencies to help Gia Lai change the purpose of infertile forest land.By doing so, it is hoped the new direction farmers follow will help build a better economy for ethnic minority people.Right now\xa0the rubber trees grown in the area have either died or produced very little.Huệ made the request while leading a delegation of Government officials at a working session in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai yesterday.The session was organised to review the implementation of socio-economic development tasks, news-style rural areas and improve the efficiency of agroforestry companies.The deputy PM asked the Ministry of Industry and Trade to coordinate with other ministries to submit a report to the Government next month.According to the People’s Committee of Gia Lai Province, more than 12,000 ha of rubber trees planting on poor fertile forest land in the province were either died or had very low productivity.In mid-2018, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ordered the region to replace the trees with something that would grow better, but so far, that’s not happened.It is blamed on the fact that rubber enterprises faced financial difficulties due to investment in growing and tending the trees for a long time, without any raising any revenue, which makes it very difficult for them\xa0to continue pouring money in plant restructuring or replant forest, as regulated by the 2017 Law on Forestry.The committee said some enterprises have proposed to develop solar and wind power on a part of that forest land area.“It’s a waste as more than 12,000 ha of rubber trees planting on infertile forest land is now pasture, not forest,” said Dương Văn Trang, Secretary of Gia Lai province’ Party Committee.“We hope the Government would help the locality deal with the issue,”Because the rubber plants which were in poor condition haven’t been replaced, Ia Mơr, an irrigation project in Chư Prông District with a total investment of nearly VNĐ3,000 billion failed to meet the designed target, he said.Trang said the province would include the 12,000ha [of infertile forest land] in land planning for 2021-25 and asked for support from the Government.""The area of land for afforestation of the province is still large, so investors, who convert to other crops or invest in renewable energy, can replant forests in other areas"", he said.Socio-economic developmentNguyễn Đức Hoàng, deputy chairman of provincial\xa0People’s Committee said there has been positive signs in the province\'s socio-economic development over the past eight months.State budget collection has reached more than VNĐ3 trillion (US$129 million), meeting 67 per cent of the goal set by the State.As many as 24 projects, with total registered capital of more than VNĐ2.1 trillion, have been approved in principle.The province has 60 communes and 14 villages with ethnic minorities meeting the new rural standard.While appreciating efforts made by the province in implementing socio-economic development tasks, the deputy PM suggested the locality invest in developing commodities suitable to regional and national planning.Attention should be paid to the expansion of product development\xa0programs and administrative reform, he said.To facilitate the deployment of important infrastructure projects and the ones serving ethnic minorities in the province, Huệ required the province to submit dossiers so they could be included in the country\'s\xa0plans for public investment in 2021-25. — VNS'",0

5086,'Contemporary art charms fashion student',"Artist Phạm Hồng began creating contemporary art in 2005. Her latest piece, entitled Sự Im Lặng (The Silence), was named as one of 14 finalists in the Dogma Award 2019 and was displayed last month in HCM City.Reporter Việt Quỳnh, from Đại Đoàn Kết (Great Unity) newspaper speaks to Hồng about her career and passion for contemporary art.How did you begin creating contemporary art?I remember that independent artists and groups of experimental artists were becoming more common in 2005.At the time, I was in college and was fortunate to participate in workshops with my friends and other artists.At the beginning, I was an outsider because my major was in fashion design. However, I was excited.I was interested because I could see contemporary art is a very new and varied concept with no limits or distance between works, artists, and the public.There are many young people like me from different fields such as art, theatre, music and even journalism and foreign languages. This shows that contemporary art is no longer limited. Not only art students have the chance to experience it.After the art workshops, I changed my mind and my point of view not only about art but also about studying fashion.Do you remember the first work you did in 2005?The first piece I did was two installations named Mẹ (Mother). I participated in a workshop with a German artist before I created the work.The topic was about women, so the first thing I thought about was my mother. At that time my mother was the only one encouraging me to create art. I wanted to do something like a story about my mother.I used a lot of furniture and household objects such as old irons and a pan which are probably the same age as me. My mother used them every day. My mother bought the pan when she got married and kept it until I grew up.I used these objects to create the shape of my mother. It is the first artwork in my life, but I made it with all my emotions. Many of my friends said it was an emotional work.I believe that art needs true feelings. The sentiment is not fake, and works made with the artist's emotions will allow the viewer to feel and appreciate it.How did you experiment with contemporary art at that time?I watched contemporary art develop. There are many artists working in the field and they are considered crazy. Many of them have made excellent works such as Trương Tân and Vũ Huy An.I see contemporary art as a movement, both new and challenging. I am really impressed with the creativity of the artists not only in form, expression and material but also their ways of working, thinking and exploring are very profound and dedicated.I find myself learning a lot from the artists. Through attending discussions and workshops as well as seeing art exhibitions my artistic thinking has changed.Are you still creating pieces inspired by women?Yes, I always think about the position of women in society.I grew up in a family with three generations, in which women always had to do both housework and social work. So I see their role in the family as well as their sacrifices and their patience.Most of my works are from personal stories or from women I have met. I aspire to be able to help the women in some ways either directly or indirectly.I see the life of my grandmother and my mother, who sacrificed their whole lives for the family with the same acceptance. It's like being born a woman must be like that sacrificing becomes a mission.Why do you usually use fabric in your art?I use cloth because I studied fashion design and I know about this material and I can control it when making art works. Each type of cloth brings a different effect. Meticulously sitting to sew for me is both work and relaxation.Many people say that female artists often choose to sew in their works. I think this is discriminatory. Artists choose which materials they find suitable and effective. Gender is irrelevant.Many male artists choose cloth, cotton, or even flowers to make art. And there are also many female artists creating art with iron and steel.I choose cloth because when I sit to sew it is like meditation. It is time for me to focus on my work, to think about many things in life. I love it.What is your latest piece?It is an installation titled The Silence presented to the public in August.This work is about silence in modern society. We no longer spend a lot of time together, instead have different concerns that creates distance between people.Silence invades life like a pathogen. It can destroy the affection, relationships and many of the good things that we have had. VNS",5

The ministry has frequently pointed out the terrorist tactics of this organisation but many dissidents who are exposed to toxic and misleading information on the internet have been recruited into the organisation.In this case, via social media, a US national named Kelly Triệu (also known as Triệu Thanh Hoa, born in 1968, a core member of “Chính phủ quốc gia Việt Nam lâm thời”) induced Khải to join.Khải was assigned to recruit other people to hold a referendum to elect Đào Minh Quân as President of Việt Nam.Khải recruited with Nguyễn Đoàn Quang Viên, Lê Ngọc Hiển and Trần Thị Ngân Giang and together they discussed and made a list of participants in the referendum to send to this organisation.Viên, Hiển and Giang were not prosecuted criminally as the court deemed they had limited legal awareness, making them easy targets for recruitment by those with ill will, and their wrongdoings were not serious and they expressed earnest repentance.The three were handed over to local authorities for management and education. — VNS",0

Many officials and Party members involved in the case have been punished.The Inspection Commission said Ninh’s violations were “serious” and affected the prestige of the Party organisation and himself.During its meeting, the commission also looked into wrongdoings of the Standing Board of the Party Committee of the Đồng Nai Province's\xa0Department of Public Security.It concluded that the Standing Board violated the centralised democracy principle and working regulations. They lacked responsibility, examination and supervision and showed poor leadership and direction, leading to many violations and shortcomings in the investigation and settlement of cases and incidents; the management and use of weapons, land, finance and assets; and the personnel work.The Inspection Commission also pointed out the responsibility of several incumbent and former officials in Đồng Nai Province, adding that violations by the Standing Board and the officials caused “very serious” consequences, affecting the prestige of the Party organisation and law protection agencies and stirring public concern.Therefore, disciplinary measures are needed, it said.At the meeting, the Commission gave a warning to Nguyễn Văn Công, Deputy Minister of Transport; Phạm Viết Muôn, former deputy chief of the Government Office; and Trần Ngọc Thành, former Chairman of the Members’ Council of the Việt Nam Railways Corporation.Meanwhile, it reprimanded deputy ministers of Transport Nguyễn Ngọc Đông and Nguyễn Nhật, and Nguyễn Ngọc Huệ, former Chairman of the Members’ Council of the Shipping Corporation Vinalines.It took disciplinary measures against three former officials of Đắk Nông Province. — VNS",0

However, only 23 firms made it to the final assessment and those firms were the largest companies by market value.Some of the finalists were the Vietnam Dairy Products JSC (Vinamilk), insurer Bảo Việt Holdings and the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV).According to Nguyễn Viết Thịnh, CEO of the Vietnam Institute of Directors, only 11 companies last year had independent sustainable development reports, which was almost double the number recorded in 2017. But it was still modest compared to the size of the Vietnamese business community.Notably, the top 10 companies nominated for the awards had their sustainable development reports included in the annual reports. The largest firms by market capitalisation maintained a good quality of reports for six straight years.Thịnh said the sustainable development report must be finalised in the April-May period and the sooner it gets done the better.Data should be collected consistently during the financial year and the report should be treated as a long-term opportunity for the business, he added.Even top companies with best sustainable development reports have not performed data analytics to see how they have changed through the years, Thịnh said.He suggested the board of directors must play a major role in making sustainable development strategies popular to investors and shareholders, thus improving the company’s transparency and corporate governance.“The board of directors must be strongly committed to delivering sustainable development activities and ensure the company stays on its path towards a sustainable business operation,” he said.According to Nguyễn Công Minh Bảo, Director of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Vietnam, reputational risks and benefits, regulatory requirements and CEO’s directive, operational risks and benefits, investors’ interests and requirements, and market growth opportunities are among the most common factors that prevent a business from striving towards sustainable development.Hoàng Đức Hùng, deputy director of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Vietnam, told attendees that compiling a sustainable development report requires the company to have sufficient human and financial resources.Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have to establish a specialised unit to monitor the compilation of sustainable development reports, Hùng said.“Financial and non-financial strategies must be developed within the business. And anyone responsible for preparing the firm’s sustainable development report must make sure the system and workflow are passed to the next generations, saving expenses and workloads for the business.”“Sustainable development reports must be standardised so that they are collectable at the end of the year,” Hùng said. – VNS'",2

3652,'Low rainfall worsened air quality in Hà Nội',"'HÀ NỘI —\xa0Last September recorded the lowest rainfall in the last six years, triggering air pollution and increasing the concentration of PM2.5, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment announced on Monday.Hoàng Văn Thức, deputy head of the Việt Nam Environment Administration, said air pollution in September happened locally and abnormally compared to previous years along with a dramatic rise of hazardous atmospheric particulate matter PM2.5, especially in big cities including Hà Nội and HCM.“Without appropriate mechanisms, air pollution will get worse,” he warned.Data collected from 13 air quality monitoring stations in Hà Nội showed the upward trend of PM2.5 concentration from September 12 to 29. Specifically, from September 15 to 17 and 23 to 29, the matter’s concentration increased more than 75 per cent, far exceeding Việt Nam’s standard of 25 µg per cubic metre.The fluctuations of PM2.5 and PM10 in Hà Nội depend heavily on weather conditions.HCM City faced the same situation in September due to seasonal changes, Thức said.“Moreover, farmers in Hà Nội’s suburban areas still practise agricultural combustion, generating smoke and leading air quality to decline in the city centre,” he added.“The ministry has asked responsible agencies to tighten management over vehicles and construction, yet the situation has remained unchanged.”According to MoNRE, air quality in Việt Nam’s cities has slightly improved since 2013. However, air quality index changes locally during a day and depends on the location of sensors.“If we put monitoring stations at hotspots with high traffic density or near construction sites, indicators are usually bad. To evaluate the overall air quality in Hà Nội, it has to be based on the density of monitoring stations. Information provided by some foreign-developed apps using data from some sensors should only be considered a reference,” Thức said.Hà Nội is going to have 20 new air quality monitoring stations to promptly issue warnings.MoNRE will complete a report on the development of an air monitoring network by the end of 2019. —\xa0 VNS'",4

Those included asking for permission to remove containers considered harmful to the environment, including those containing radioactive waste, to be shipped out of the territory within a 30-day period after giving notice to shipping companies.Failure to comply would result in the revocation of shipping privileges at all Vietnamese ports until the Ministry of Transport was able to verify all those containers had been shipped out of the country. Stricter inspections and standards for incoming containers will also be carried out by a joint task force from the customs department, transport ministry and finance ministry.In a recent meeting, deputy chief of the Customs General Department Mai Xuân Thành said it had been working closely with local customs departments to document, categorise and process waste containers, which according to the task force, were mostly concentrated in seaports along Việt Nam's coast such as Hải Phòng, Đà Nẵng, TP HCM, Bình Định and Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu.During the first six months of the year, more than 500 waste containers were denied entry into Vietnamese ports for failing to meet the country's import regulations.

4840,Springsteen dives into his psyche with 'Western Stars' film,"'NEW YORK — Though Bruce Springsteen\'s songs are a\xa0vibrant part of the contemporary American songbook, he regularly uses his\xa0lyrics to express his deep misgivings about the proverbial American dream.With Western Stars\xa0a full-length feature film out on\xa0Friday that marks the\xa0Boss\'s directorial debut, New Jersey\'s favorite son is once again looking at a\xa0question he\'s grappled with for decades: the struggle between transient freedom\xa0and communal life.The meditative concert film features sweeping pans over California\'s wide\xa0expanses —\xa0think wild horses, a muscle car on the open road and cacti bathed\xa0in a rose sunrise —\xa0interspersed with Springsteen\'s family home movie footage.It is effectively the 70-year-old icon\'s replacement for a tour to promote\xa0his latest solo effort.Springsteen plays his full Western Stars\xa013-track album in the film —\xa0it\xa0hearkens back to the 1970s-era golden age of the Laurel Canyon music scene —\xa0with backing from band members including his wife Patti Scialfa as well as a\xa030-piece orchestra.The recorded live performance, filmed in a barn on Springsteen\'s property\xa0in New Jersey, features sweeping crescendos of strings that project a luxurious\xa0warmth —\xa0the aural equivalent of slipping into a hot tub in the middle of the\xa0desert at dusk.But the music\'s hazy glow contrasts with the edge of the artist\'s piercing\xa0inner reflections, as Springsteen considers the demons he\'s repressed and the\xa0aches he\'s caused after nearly half a century in show business.""It\'s easy to lose yourself —\xa0or never find yourself,"" his voiceover says\xa0in the film. ""The older you get, the heavier the baggage becomes that you\xa0haven\'t sorted.""Considering the ""destructive parts"" of his character, Springsteen says that\xa0in his younger life, ""if I loved you, I would try to hurt you.""""You run until you\'ve left everything that you\'ve loved and that loves you\xa0behind,"" he says.""I\'ve done a lot of that kind of running.""\'Living in good faith\'Though his fame is rooted firmly in his skills as a musician, Springsteen\xa0as auteur is not necessarily a stretch: the performer has long imbued his\xa0lyrics with a cinematic quality.The brawny superstar burst onto the international stage in 1975 with ""Born\xa0to Run,"" taking his audiences into bleak small American towns that contained\xa0youthful desires for adventure.Western Stars,\xa0his 19th album, marks a sharp turn from his signature\xa0hard-driving rock that recounted the mundanities of everyday life and\xa0blue-collar struggles, making him a working class hero.But Springsteen maintains the character-driven storytelling element that\xa0has long shaped his work, centering on the tale of a lone, washed-up Western\xa0movie star adrift and in search of roots.Springsteen considers Western Stars\xa0—\xa0which he co-directed with Thom\xa0Zimny —\xa0the third installment in a trilogy that began with his acclaimed 2016\xa0memoir and his wildly successful intimate show on Broadway.The rock star has been open about his battles with depression and\xa0self-loathing, saying publicly he\'s been in therapy for decades and continues\xa0to aspire towards, as he puts it in the film, ""living in good faith.""""Lost is something I\'m good at writing,"" he says. ""Gravitating towards pain\xa0feels more like home.""""You don\'t know how to hold onto love but you know how to hold onto hurt.""Scialfa, his wife of nearly 30 years and member of his famed E Street Band,\xa0plays guitar and sings in the film, but also is charming in home movie from the\xa0pair\'s honeymoon.Springsteen reminisces about the early days of their romance spent on a\xa0park bench in front of New York\'s Empire Diner, where he eventually proposed.""When you\'re young, it\'s all about going where I want to go, doing what I\xa0want to do, I\'m going to be who I want to be, and that\'s okay for your\xa0twenties,"" he told late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel this week.""But somewhere in your thirties, it starts to catch up with you and your\xa0definition of freedom has to expand to include family, your civic life, you\xa0know, community that you\'re involved in,"" he continued.""If it doesn\'t... you get stuck out in the cold, you know?

Their experience had proven that encouraging innovative ideas from an early age was crucial to the development of businesses and society in general.“In order to boost innovation, we should inspire and encourage environments where young people are free and supported to take responsibility to come up with solutions to address development challenges of today and tomorrow”, she added.“Young people are agents of change and innovation.”The contest’s deadline for submission is November 6, 2019. The participants will form teams of two and their contribution will be assessed based on whether the entries are innovative, creative, feasible, sustainable and commercially viable, as well as on what kind of lasting impact they will have.The jury consists of representatives from sponsoring Swedish companies, Uppsala University and the embassy.The winning team will be offered a trip to Sweden and a visit to a number of Swedish companies’ headquarters as well as Uppsala University. Along with the runner-ups, they will also be awarded internship opportunities with sponsoring Swedish companies with business presence in Việt Nam.Nguyễn Trọng Cường, 23, who won the 2018 contest with the idea to install styrofoam panels into the walls of his house to reduce the temperature and save electricity consumption, said the trip to Sweden was meaningful and brought valuable experiences.“It’s not something big, they protect the environment by doing little things,” he said.For example, they preferred driving battery-operated vehicles and they classified waste before disposing of it, he said.“And the most important thing is that everyone takes it seriously,” he said.Trần Thị Thu Vân, a representative of Hồ Chí Minh Communist Youth Union said she hoped the contest would provide a good chance for Vietnamese students nationwide to stimulate their creativity to contribute to the implementation of the nation’s SDGs. —\xa0VNS'",1

5212,Netflix gives Scorsese's ‘Irishman’ brief theatre run,"LOS ANGELES — Netflix's star-studded gangster movie The Irishman will receive only a limited release in theatres, it said Tuesday, as debate rages in Hollywood over the disruption caused by deep-pocketed streaming giants.Martin Scorsese's long-awaited crime epic starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino cost US$175 million to produce, and is part of Netflix's long-running bid to gain the traditional film industry's acceptance – and top awards – as an A-list content provider.But campaigners including director Steven Spielberg have suggested that films produced and released by streaming firms should not be eligible for the Oscars.The Irishman will appear in select US theatres for 26 days before its global Netflix release on November 27, the company said.Netflix is juggling its commercial interests with Oscar ambitions, as Academy Award rules require at least a seven day-run in theatres.But any hopes of a full theatrical release were dashed after talks with major multiplex chains over a longer window appear to have broken down.The film will show in mainly independent cinemas, after the likes of Cineplex, Regal and AMC held firm on their traditional 90-day window, according to Hollywood press reports.Many who support the exclusion of streaming content from the Oscars have suggested that streaming at home or on devices does not capture the true experience of cinema.The battle between traditional cinema and streaming came sharply into focus after Netflix's impressive haul at the Academy Awards earlier this year.Netflix gave a 23-day theatrical run to Alfonso Cuaron's Roma, which earned a whopping 10 Oscar nominations, winning three.On Tuesday, it released plans for a number of awards season films, including Meryl Streep's The Laundromat, and Dolemite is My Name starring Eddie Murphy.The ten feature films will have theatrical windows ranging from one week to one month.The Irishman will be released in limited Los Angeles and New York theatres from November 1, before hitting additional cities in the US and UK from November 8.It tells the decades-spanning, true story of powerful union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), crime boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and Frank The Irishman Sheeran (De Niro), who claimed he killed more than 25 people on their orders. — AFP",5

There, people are poor and I recognise my life in them,"" he told Tuổi Trẻ (The Youth) newspaper.Remembering his poverty in the past, Lương who is often called Út Ổi, said after the war ended in 1975, people around the country faced difficulties and had to start building a new life.""I had to try to grow rice, corn and potatoes to escape poverty,"" he said.He worked very hard and had to do different jobs to earn a living, so he understands the suffering of the poor.Gradually, his life improved. He saved money to buy more land to grow rice.His family now owns about 7ha of land, generating about 120 tonnes of unhusked rice each year.""When my family life improves, I see many people still hungry. I realised\xa0that I have to share and find ways to help them,” he said.At that time, rice was the only thing his family had. Initially, he gave a few kilograms of rice to each family, gradually increasing his donation to 20kg per family.At the end of the year and during the Tết (Lunar New Year) festival, he gave more than four tonnes of rice to local poor people.Sometimes, he could not sleep, thinking ""Is rice really enough to help people overcome poverty?""In 1990, he went into business. He opened a sugar processing and carpentry workshop. At that time, he was able to increase his charity work.“I can\'t remember how many houses I built for the poor. At that time I earned a lot of money from carpentry and I used surplus wood to build houses for people.”""Everyone here knows Út Ổi. He gives rice and builds houses for the poor. He also builds bridges to help people travel easily. Everyone loves him and calls him the person for the poor,"" Âu Cường Lợi, a local resident said.Located near the centre of Long Xuyên City, thousands of people in Mỹ Quý Ward still face many difficulties.Local people mainly grow rice, fruit trees\xa0and vegetables, and raise fish. But their daily travel is not easy due to the canal system.In early 2000, he discussed with local authorities and spent about VNĐ600 million (US$25,700)\xa0to build the first bridge in the locality.Ngã Kênh Bridge is 20m long and 3m wide and people are happy with it.""I want to build more bridges. But the biggest hurdle is the capital because it costs a lot of money to build a bridge.

The rangers weighed the butchered Indochinese serow and estimated the mammal was about 58kg. They also seized the hunters’ traps and tools.Indochinese serow, which has the scientific name of Capricornis milneedwardsii maritimus, is a species native to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Việt Nam. The mammal is listed on the red list of IUCN due to a decrease in its population caused by its narrowing habitat and being hunted for its meat and antlers.Phong Nha Township, located in a buffer zone near the park, houses many residents who made their livings from hunting and tree logging, prior to the rise of tourism at local cave systems, which lifted the local economy. — VNS'",4

We hope that Vietnamese troupes will have good scripts to perform at the festival. We expect the festival will have experimental works that will contribute to new trends in modern theatre.I think it is difficult to talk about limitations of experimental creativity. As long as the artists create something new in structure, conversation and directing style, it can be called experimental.I just hope that it will inspire debate.The most important thing is to ensure the truth, and national culture identity.How will the international troupes get financial support from the organisation board?The festival was approved by the Government.

5249,'Japanese expat falls for Vietnamese literature',"By Lương Thu HươngMany foreigners profiled in this column\xa0consider\xa0Việt Nam their second home because they have fallen for the landscape or the locals’ hospitality, but Kawarai Yushi, a Japanese expat based in the central province of Thừa Thiên – Huế, has fallen for Vietnamese literature.Yushi learnt about Vietnamese literature by chance when he visited a bookstore in Japan and came across the French version of the novel entitled Tố Tâm by writer Hoàng Ngọc Phách, which, he said, is the main reason he decided to come to Việt Nam to study.“I read the translation of some novels and poetry, which made me cry all night. Although I used to major in theoretical astrophysics in England, I was familiar with literature as well; however, it was a shock to discover Vietnamese literature! How touching it is! I believe that it was my predestined affinity when I already knew French and classical Chinese which are necessary to understand Vietnamese literature,” Yushi said.He first visited Việt Nam in August 2010, after an invitation from a Vietnamese friend who was also an overseas student in England. At first, he never imagined he would study in Việt Nam, but it was the locals’ hospitality and generosity enticed him to come back.“Vietnamese people have strong bonds of family, relatives and friends. My friends gathered to celebrate my birthday, which I had never experienced in Japan, and it has become my unforgettable memory,” Yushi recalled.Aiming to explore Vietnamese literature, he decided to apply for the Linguistics and Literature Department at Huế University’s College of Education. At present, the 31-year-old Japanese expat is doing an MA in Philology and will graduate this November.Though Yushi is interested in Vietnamese literature, he admitted he was keen on reading classical literary works and seldom modern ones. Some of his favourite Vietnamese classical works include Lục Vân Tiên (The Tale of Lục Vân Tiên) by poet Nguyễn Đình Chiểu, The Tale of Kiều by poet Nguyễn Du or Chinh Phụ Ngâm (Lament of the soldier's wife) by Đặng Trần Côn.Presently, the Japanese expat is planning to work with an English native speaker to translate Tố Tâm and other Vietnamese classical works into English.“I have read many books and found out that Vietnamese have many interesting literary works which, however, have not been popular among foreign readers. I hope that more foreigners will understand more about Vietnamese literature, as well as the beauty of the country and people here,” he said.Yushi is also among 21 writers contributing to the book entitled Chuyện Người Tây Ở Xứ Ta (Stories of the Foreigners in Việt Nam), which gathers the stories and views of the foreigners who have visited and fallen for the country.To many first-comers to Việt Nam, language is a difficult barrier\xa0to get over, but\xa0in only a month Yushi grasped six Vietnamese tones and 11 vowels which Japanese does not have.“I have a policy of teaching myself the national language of the country I am going to visit. My first impression on the Vietnamese language was ‘melodious but difficult sounds’,” he said.According to him, the largest difficulties in Vietnamese are its complicated pronunciations and abundant vocabulary.“At the beginning, they did not know I was trying to speak Vietnamese but said ‘sorry, I do not speak English.’“I always put the TV on to get accustomed to the pronunciation and observe how Vietnamese people move their mouth to mimic. Fortunately, my teachers did explain the pronunciation system to me in terms of English so I could learn it both in theory and in practice,” he added.Besides literature, language is another of Yushi's passions and gifts. He can speak English, French, German and Vietnamese fluently, as well as communicate basically in Korean, Chinese, Thai, Lao, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian. He can also read Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Latin, ancient Greek, Sanskrit\xa0and Pali.Yushi is presently enriching his linguistic capacity by learning the Czech language.“I have learnt about 20 languages but find Vietnamese has the most difficult pronunciation system,” he said.“I strongly recommend you should follow private lessons. You should watch how Vietnamese people use the mouth and mimic it. If your mouth gets very fatigued, it means you are learning Vietnamese well, since learning a foreign language requires you to use different muscles.”After completing his masters in Vietnamese lterature, Yushi plans to do a PhD of Hán Nôm (Sino-Vietnamese characters) at the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences in Hà Nội this November.“Hopefully I could become a lecturer at a university in Việt Nam. I intend to naturalise and stay in the country till the end of my life,” he said. — VNS",5
5058,'Teacher and student display\xa0paintings together',"Nguyễn BìnhHÀ NỘI — Artist\xa0Lý Trực Sơn and his student Triệu Quốc Chiến are displaying sơn mài (lacquer) paintings\xa0at Việt Nam National Museum of Fine Arts.This is the first time the two artists of different\xa0generations\xa0have\xa0exhibited their paintings together.The exhibit comprises 30 large paintings, some of which were created this year.The paintings\xa0tell the personal stories of the artists and portray\xa0social situations influenced by traditional sơn mài in terms of ideas and form.Sơn mài\xa0comprises\xa0sơn\xa0(lacquer) and\xa0mài\xa0(grind) which relate to the material and process used to make a\xa0sơn mài\xa0painting. The paintings are also inlaid with crushed egg shells, gold, silver and other materials.Over the past 80 years, Vietnamese\xa0lacquer\xa0masters have reached milestones in developing traditional crafts towards artistic creativity.Sơn was a pioneer of the young artist movement in the 1980s, while Chiến does not want to be involved any movement.“They met in thought and art is a pure activity decided by their character,” said art critic\xa0Phan Cẩm Thượng.“To them, sơn mài is merely a means but a traditional means adept at expressing one’s cultural identity.”Sơn's Quê Ngoại (Mother Homeland) is a three-piece painting which measures 108cm by 180cm for each piece. The painting is the largest and perhaps most outstanding at the exhibitionIt features a peaceful rural scene with a mother and her child,\xa0a buffalo,\xa0a banana tree, a\xa0river and a rainbow.Another painting by Sơn entitled Vô Đề (Untitled) is also a set of five pieces. The pieces are made by traditional lacquer resin.Untitled paintings are abstract and coloured\xa0black and blue. The exhibition is a chance for Sơn to debut\xa0the paintings which he created\xa0this year.“These paintings are difficult to understand,” said artist Nguyễn Quốc Huy at the exhibition's opening ceremony last Thursday. “Even for\xa0professionals, the paintings are very distinctive in shaping art and composition.“Currently, Sơn is creative in space and shape which are irreducible.

He has 14 paintings displayed at the exhibition.His paintings\xa0such as Cá Đùa Dưới Trăng (Fish Plays Under Moonlight); Bà Mẹ Vĩ Đại (Great Mother) and Đức Phật Ngủ (Sleeping Buddha) honour Buddha, women and beauty.“Women sacrifice\xa0their careers and beauty to focus on motherhood,” Chiến said about Bà Mẹ Vĩ Đại.“Although life brings many difficulties, challenges and sadness, it is beautiful to me,” he said. “I always try to express the beauty of\xa0life in my paintings.”Chiến doesn’t want his paintings to become a fine arts handicraft nor does he to repeat traditional lacquer’s glossy, deep and sparkling effects.In his Buddha-themed paintings, he traces and divides the lacquer plate to make miniature paintings within\xa0the whole painting.His paintings show that he profoundly changes the traditional way of lacquer but still keeps the ancient beauty in feeling and splendor, rather than form.The exhibition runs until September 25 at 66 Nguyễn Thái Học Street. — VNS",5

Some agricultural products of Việt Nam’s strength like lychee, mango and dragon fruit have entered the Australian market, which is a good sign for other farm produce, he noted.In the time ahead, the two sides need to continue carrying out practical measures to facilitate bilateral trade and investment. They should also work together to make use of the multilateral agreements to which both are parties, especially the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), he added.The official also highlighted the increasingly effective co-operation in defence-security, adding that Australia has actively helped Việt Nam train and transport officers to the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan.Appreciating Australia’s official development assistance for Việt Nam, Deputy PM Đam asked the Australian Government to pay more attention to the country’s key areas such as infrastructure, poverty reduction, climate change response, and competitiveness improvement.In terms of collaboration in education and science-technology, he asked Australia to increase assisting Việt Nam in human resources training, innovation programmes and scientific-technological research.The official also called for stronger ties between localities, people-to-people exchange, and co-operation in culture, tourism and sports, thus creating a solid foundation for enhancing all-round partnerships at all levels.For his part, Ambassador Chittick said there are many factors bringing Việt Nam and Australia closer to each other, including similarities and the two peoples’ sentiment.He also noted that his country has assisted Việt Nam in many fields, thereby developing bilateral relations in a fast and sustainable manner.The diplomat affirmed that in whatever positions he will hold, he will keep contributing to the two countries’ strategic partnership. — VNS'",0

1997,'Việt Nam a new star in Southeast Asia region: Horasis forum',"'Bồ Xuân HiệpBÌNH DƯƠNG — Việt Nam has emerged as a new economic star in the Southeast Asia region, with its southern province of Bình Dương poised to become a new centre for global dialogue in the near future, the chairman and founder of Horasis said yesterday at one of Asia’s largest economic forums.More than 400 top leaders from across Asia and 500 government officials and top executives from businesses in Việt Nam are participating in the 2019 Horasis Asia Meeting that officially opens today in Bình Dương Province.Speaking on the sidelines of the opening plenary session yesterday, Dr. Frank-Jürgen Richter, said: “We’re very impressed with the potential of the Vietnamese economy and Bình Dương Province, which is one of the country’s major economic hubs with strong industrial development. That’s why we chose Bình Dương to host the Horasis Asia Meeting again this year.”“The province has all the conditions to become one of Asia’s most attractive investment destinations and a new financial hub in the region,” he told Việt Nam News.“Bình Dương boasts good infrastructure with a state-of-the-art conference centre, and we have had great support from the local government as the host of our meeting,” he noted.“The province has attracted attention from investors from all parts of Asia such as Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea and the rest of Southeast Asia,” he said.To lure even more foreign investment, the province should diversify its portfolio, and not only focus on manufacturing but also raise the profile of knowledge-based industries such as blockchain, AI and, IoT, Richter said.Asia in transitionThe world is at a crossroads, and Asia with its exposure to a highly volatile geo-political and geo-economic context, is no exception, according to speakers at the meeting.Asian economies should grasp opportunities emerging from rampant change in an era of disruption to achieve inclusive growth.With uncertainty stemming from the US-China trade war, many businesses are looking at other production locations in the wider Asia Pacific region. Việt Nam is set to benefit the most from the trade war, according to Richter.“I very much believe that Việt Nam, with strong economic fundamentals coupled with firm government commitment to more open trade and investment, will soon achieve a double-digit growth rate of 10-12 per cent in the near future,” he said.According to the World Bank in Việt Nam, in the short and medium term, Việt Nam’s economic outlook is expected to be positive despite signs of cyclical moderation in growth.After peaking at 7.1 per cent last year, real GDP growth is projected to slightly decelerate at 6.6 per cent this year, led by weaker external demand and continued tightening of credit and fiscal policies.Annual headline inflation has been stable for seven consecutive years (at single digits), trending towards 4 per cent and below in recent years, according to the World Bank.Strong FDI inflows, which reached almost $18 billion last year, account for almost 24 per cent of total investment in Việt Nam, it said.Speaking at a National Assembly meeting last month, PM Nguyễn Xuân Phúc said Việt Nam’s open economy was exposed to external risks.The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth, however, was expected to exceed 6.8 per cent this year, backed by robust exports and foreign investment, he said, adding that the country aims to keep inflation below 4 per cent next year.Việt Nam’s foreign exchange reserves had reached a record high of US$73 billion.However, the country’s pace of privatisation of state-owned enterprises and pace of budget spending on infrastructure had been slower than expected, according to Phúc.Trần Văn Nam, Party Secretary of Bình Dương Province, said the Horasis event would help promote the image of Việt Nam, especially Bình Dương Province, with international partners, and improve management capacity as well as the science and technology level of Việt Nam.“CEOs and investors from Southeast Asia, Japan, South Korea, India and the rest of the world have already come to seek investment opportunities in the province today,” he said.During the two-day event, entrepreneurs from around the world will discuss Asian enterprises’ rise to global eminence.Participants will also examine the state of the global economy and Asia’s role in shaping it.The 2019 Horasis includes four plenary and dialogue sessions related to key issues in the current globalisation era such as new trends in economic and trade development and achievements in science and technology.Delegates will also attend the 15th Asia International Science Conference on Urbanisation, which is expected to launch various IT projects.The two-day event is co-hosted by Bình Dương Province Becamex IDC Corp and VSIP Group.Horasis is a global visions community committed to providing a platform for companies from emerging and developed markets to seek global partners.In addition to the Horasis Asia Meeting, Horasis hosts the annual Horasis Global Meeting, Horasis China Meeting, Horasis India Meeting, and others. — VNS'",2

It’s the biggest motivation for me to decide to have the concert,” she said.The 27-year-old singer said she expected the concert will help her audience remember her, alongside her distinctive voice, but also as a hardworking and high-demanding singer.“Actually, my only concern about the concert is its quality, to satisfy all my fans,” she said.The singer doesn’t mind performing old songs that people have listened to several times because, through her acoustic and jazz singing style and new remix, “audience will get the feeling like they’re meeting old acquaintances,” she said.Three years after participating in Việt Nam Idol in 2012, Quyên released critically acclaimed musical productions, including her first album\xa0Về\xa0(Come Back) in 2015.

For 27 years, it has been engaged in environment and development issues, seeking to influence national policy and North-South relations.According to Germanwatch’s report, Việt Nam ranks 6th globally, the highest of any ASEAN country, followed by Thailand at number 10. This is the result of storms, typhoons and droughts in 2017, which killed 298 people.The deadliest one, Typhoon Damrey, hit Việt Nam in November and killed at least 106.2017 was an exceptionally intense year for tropical cyclones, according to Germanwatch Policy Adviser for Climate Risk Management Lena Hutfils. “Many countries are hit very frequently, so they don’t have an opportunity to recover in time,” Hutfils said. She also drew attention to how eight out of the top ten countries are from low- or middle-income groups.David Eckstein, the organisation’s Policy Adviser for Climate Finance and Investment, explained that the index consists of two components: one which looks at data from the previous year, and one which incorporates a 20-year development. Data includes direct short-term and long-term linkages between climate change and meteorological events.“[The index] should be understood as a warning signal,” Eckstein said. Furthermore, it provides crucial evidence to support the story that climate change and annual increases in storms, typhoons, floods, are linked.Eckstein hopes that this would translate into action from national governments, not only to deal with the impact once it happens but also do more planning in advance.Responding to these recent developments at COP24, Phạm Văn Tấn, Deputy Director General of the Climate Change Department, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE), declared that climate change adaptation would be “the number one priority.”Tấn noted how Việt Nam’s Government was one of the first to pass an implementation framework for the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly a month before the agreement itself went into effect in 2016. A key part of this plan is the constant review, submission and implementation of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), each country’s objectives for mitigation measures.At COP24’s Session on ASEAN NDC Partnership, Tấn stated that 47 of Việt Nam’s 63 provinces had already submitted concrete implementation plans for the Paris Agreement. Việt Nam is “among the most advanced in ASEAN” in terms of NDC implementation, according to the Vietnamese official. His claim is supported by many in the international community, who raised questions during the session to learn from Việt Nam’s policies.The NDC Partnership’s Country Engagement Director Jahan Chowdhury commended Việt Nam on its effective coordination between the government’s supreme leadership, Ministries and civil-society actors for better climate change adaptation. According to Tấn, MoNRE meets with NGOs once every three months to discuss the implementation of policies at the grassroots level.Tấn has high expectations for the outcome of COP24, the most important gathering of international negotiators on the issue of climate change.He wants to see how much support Việt Nam will be able to obtain from the international community following MoNRE’s proposal for Greenhouse Gases Reduction plan.“Support” is hereby defined as a combination of three things: finance, technology transfer and capacity building. So far at the conference, Việt Nam has not received any new pledges from developed countries with regards to financial support, a major concern. — VNS'",4

2229,'Private sector’s public goods provision: necessary but needs supervision',"'Võ Trí Thành*In early October, an unusual scene unfolded in a modern part of the capital: hundreds of thousands of Hanoians were queuing up to collect clean water from a tanker.This wasn’t a throwback to the bad old days when water shortages were common. It was due to a polluted supply of tap water.Despite knowing that oil waste had been dumped at the source, the supplier\xa0–\xa0Vinaconex Water Supply Joint Stock Company (Viwasupco)\xa0–\xa0continued to pump water into family homes. At a press conference, the company’s CEO even said: “Viwasupco was the biggest victim in this case.”The case has raised questions about who is responsible\xa0for checking water quality\xa0and ensuring it is safe for use, and whether the participation of the private sector in delivering public goods is as necessary and efficient as expected.Economists have for a long time pointed out that providing public goods is one of the key roles the State has to play in the development process.By nature, public goods have certain characteristics that make it difficult to charge for them, and therefore private suppliers generally choose not to provide them. They are non-rival which\xa0means\xa0consumption by one user does not reduce the supply available for others, and non-excludable meaning users cannot be prevented from consuming the goods.Clean water, power and infrastructure are among them.Besides, the market has some imperfections. One of them is the existence of positive and negative externalities, but the externalities are not often captured in the price, so some goods may be underprovided while other overprovided from a social point of view.Infrastructure projects related to transport, electricity and water supply or public services like education and healthcare normally have greater social returns than private benefits, so tend to be underprovided. Meanwhile, the price of goods often does not cover negative externalities such as environmental pollution caused by production, therefore they are overprovided from a social point of view.The State needs to find solutions to correct imperfections by curbing negative externalities and promoting positive externalities.The State also has a critical role to play in protecting the vulnerable and ensuring an equitable distribution of public goods. Growth could be hampered by civil unrest and political instability caused by lingering poverty and inequality.However, the State also has some failings. Especially in developing countries, corruption, principal-agents and conflicts of interest are just some of the issues that prevent states from performing their functions properly.Hence, there has been an increasing trend in public goods provision toward contracting out to the private sector and encouraging the form of “public-private partnerships” which is expected to solve both market and state failure. Still, the model is not a nostrum.Efficiency of private sectorIn Việt Nam, there was a period when the State held the monopoly over public utilities such as electricity, water and telecommunications. But facts have shown that direct interference of the State in such markets does not mean efficiency due to a shortage of human and capital resources, and poor performances at State-owned enterprises.The development of the Vietnamese telecommunications market over the past two decades is clear evidence of the efficiency of the private sector’s participation after the State contracted out the service and promoted competition to improve the delivery of the service. As a result, people are enjoying good quality telecommunications services for reasonable prices.However, water is a special field as it relates to environmental issues and people’s health.In principle, competition in a free market should be the motivation for private goods providers to enhance quality. In the case of the water sector in Việt Nam, enterprises only compete when they bid for projects, not for the interest of consumers.The risky problem lies in that, unlike telecommunications services in which users can change their provider, water consumers have no choice. The areas they live in have only one supplier. Once the water source is polluted, thousands of people suffer and struggle, as the case of Viwasupco shows.Privatisation of water enterprises started in 2005 and gathered pace in recent years with only a few enterprises remaining State-owned, transforming the water sector from a social to a business focus.But the Government’s process of privatising water companies “has not yet had the impact that may have been intended”, the Asian Development Bank said in its working paper 2010 on ‘Việt Nam Water and Sanitation Sector Assessment, Strategy and Roadmap’.“Private ownership of a share of the system assets was not backed up by clearly defined\xa0and verifiable performance indicators"", and therefore did not lead to efficiency gains or performance improvement, but a loss of management control and no benefit to consumers,\xa0the report said.In the UNDP Global Centre for Public Service Excellence’s publication titled “Is the private sector more efficient? A cautionary tale”, by examining cases of various countries, authors concluded that privatisation is often, but not always, associated with improved efficiency.The publication showed the findings of a study on the French water supply sector in 2009 that having taken the environmental indicators into account, public management was more efficient than private management.Another study on Malaysia’s water privatisation in 2012 found there was little overall improvement in terms of water revenue loss through leakage and theft.Though efficiency is assessed based on different definitions or approaches, the common conclusion drawn in the publication is that the efficiency of public goods provision under all ownership models depends on factors like competition, regulations, autonomy and wider issues of institutional development.Lesson learntFrom what happened last month and from recommendations made by international organisations, the private sector’s participation in providing public goods, particularly water, would only bring targeted results if there were good regulations and institutions in place.To resolve market failure and ensure the State performs its functions well, the participation of related agencies and communities is necessary to supervise public goods providers based on criteria like security, health and the environment.In the water sector, to ensure tap water is safe to use, the State must issue standards and supervise the water supply system, as well as publicising test results on a regular basis.Public goods have an influence on a large scale, thus any incidents related to their delivery can easily cause a crisis. The State must be active in taking preventive measures and respond to incidents promptly, drastically and responsibly, restoring faith in the people.Information disclosure, transparency and accountability are factors that create healthy competition among private enterprises. We will not be able to encourage the private sector’s engagement if we let cronyism exist.Besides encouraging private participation though incentives, the State must have strict penalties for those who violate regulations. That’s the “carrot and stick” principle.Finally, when more and more public services from building roads to education and healthcare are provided by the private sector, the State should focus its resources on delivering pure public goods that enterprises are not able to, such as ensuring the air is breathable, better social order, safeguarding property rights and guaranteeing the rule of law. — VNS* Võ Trí Thành is a senior economist at the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and a member of the National Financial and Monetary Policy Advisory Council.

The city consumes more than 10,000 pigs a day.However, there are still many difficulties in this sector such as poor management and the traditional nature of the pork trading market with small farms and manual slaughter.Pork must go through many intermediaries to reach customers, causing high prices.Based on projects such as for tracing pork origin and building a safe food supply chain in the Southern Key Economic Region, we found that \xa0production and processing of agricultural products and foods have great potential for growth.So the Department of Industry and Trade sought permission from the People's Committee to trial a pork trading floor before replicating it for other agricultural products and foodstuffs.In my opinion, its establishment can help the city to meet many objectives at the same time such as restructuring agricultural production, adoption of technology including biotechnology\xa0and market stability.Can you describe the organisational structure and operating mechanism of the trading floor?It can operate in the form of a joint stock company like most agricultural trading floors in countries with a similar agriculture sector as Việt Nam’s.The State will only support the setting up and development of the floor initially and issue appropriate regulations.It will monitor and supervise instead of directly investing or managing.Buyers and sellers will directly trade while quality inspection of pork after slaughter will be assigned to an independent quarantine unit.With the support of foreign experts, especially from the British and Dutch consulates in the city, the department proposes to study more trading models for pigs and other agricultural products to choose suitable solutions for the city’s model.What are the likely benefits of this model compared to the current system?According to the evaluation of research teams, this model will bring great benefit to society as well as all the participants.Farmers can deal directly with buyers and decide the selling price without intermediaries. Therefore, farmers can build their brands and know the needs and market demand to have a consistent and steady production and business plan.Customers will be able to buy clean and safe food at [farm] prices without intermediary costs.What were the difficulties faced by the department in researching and developing this model?The department had difficulty in persuading small farms and manual slaughterhouses to participate.However, this problem has been solved thanks to the project for tracing pork origin.Thanks to the direction of the People's Committee and support and co-ordination by related departments, cities in the Southern Key Economic Region and the two wholesale markets of Hóc Môn and Bình Điền, the preparatory steps have gone smoothly.Can you tell us about the schedule for the project?We expect that by the end of 2020 specific models will be proposed as well as complete preparatory steps for pilot operation in early 2021. —VNS",2

In the field of peace and international security, Việt Nam has made practical contributions and taken an active part in multilateral mechanisms on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nParticularly, Việt Nam was one of the first 10 countries to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty).\n\nSince 2014, Việt Nam has sent forces to UN peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Việt Nam’s second bid for a seat at the UN Security Council is a continuous affirmation of the country’s policy of becoming an active member and a reliable and responsible partner in the international community.\n\nIt also presents an opportunity for Việt Nam to contribute to ensuring peace, stability and development in the region and the world.\n\nGerman’s Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) Foundation’s representative in Việt Nam, Peter Girke, said he hoped Việt Nam would fulfil its missions of building and ensuring security and peace in the region and beyond if it is elected to this position. — VNS'",0

2652,'GDP in first three quarters climbs to 9-year high',"'HÀ NỘI — Local gross domestic product (GDP) climbed nearly 7 per cent in the first three quarters of 2019, reaching its highest level for the last nine years.Director General of the General Statistics Office (GSO) Nguyễn Bích Lâm told a press conference on Saturday that amid declining global economic growth, Việt Nam still witnessed growth of 6.98 per cent in the first nine months of the year.The major contributors were industry, construction and services. Specifically, industry and construction increased by 9.36 per cent, contributing 52.6 per cent to GDP, while services increased by 6.85 per cent, contributing 42.6 per cent.The processing and manufacturing sector remained\xa0the pillar of growth, with a rate of 11.37 per cent, followed by the service industry which included wholesale and retail sales, financial activities, banking and insurance, transportation and warehouses.Agriculture, forestry and fishery increased by 2.02 per cent, lower than the growth in the same period last year, because they faced formidable challenges as the prolonged heatwave decreased productivity while African swine fever outbreaks had threatened the livestock sector’s health.\xa0However, on Saturday, Lâm announced those factors were declining.Lâm also announced that in the first nine months this year, there was a record of newly-established enterprises, reaching nearly 102,300. They also had the highest level of capital in recent years, reaching an average of VNĐ12.6 billion (US$543,217) each.According to the latest business survey, 43.3 per cent of businesses rated their business performance in the period as “better than before”, 18.3 per cent said it was “difficult” and 38.4 per cent rated the period as “stable.”Investment capital in the first nine months reached a decent growth rate of 10.3 per cent, higher than the same period in 2018, of which the non-state economic sector reached VNĐ624.6 trillion ($26.93 billion), accounting for the largest proportion of 43.5 per cent and the growth rate of 16.9 per cent, while the investment capital of the state sector was VNĐ426.6 trillion ($18.3 billion), accounting for 33 per cent of the growth rate of three per cent.The FDI sector reached VNĐ327.1 trillion ($14.1 billion) accounting for 23.7 per cent at a growth rate of 8.4 per cent. It is noteworthy that investment capital from the State budget has not improved much, continuing to reach the lowest growth rate in the years 2015-19.Lâm said that the total import and export turnover was estimated at $382.72 billion, of which exports reached $194.3 billion, up 8.2 per cent over the same period last year.

On the economic development front, Vietnamese entrepreneurs are playing perhaps the most important role today, especially in realising the objective to transform Việt Nam into a modern industrial country by 2030 and a developed country by 2045.Vietnamese entrepreneurs, as a major economic driver, must work together with the Party and the State to improve the country's\xa0business environment, policy-making capacity and national competitiveness. In order to make it happen,\xa0the Central Economic Committee has started an initiative\xa0to encourage\xa0Vietnamese entrepreneurs to participate in the\xa0policy-making process.I strongly urge each and every business to join the initiative as policy reform and business improvements are two crucial objectives that often go hand in hand. More than 30 years after đổi mới reforms, Việt Nam fields over 700,000 licensed businesses and millions of individual business households. The next step is for Vietnamese businesses to aim for greater innovation, to achieve sustainable development and to meet social responsibilities.What are Vietnamese businesses' shortcomings and limitations?I think our economy has a sufficient number of businesses compared to other economies in the Southeast Asian region. Our problem is quality. Top Vietnamese entrepreneurs, who can effectively compete\xa0on a global level, are few.A report on business management capacity among ASEAN listed companies ranked\xa0Việt Nam in 6th place. Ours are also reported as average in similar rankings by the World Bank and the World Economic Forum. This points to limited productivity, even among ASEAN countries, and numerous issues yet to be resolved in order to provide our businesses with much-needed support for growth.How can Việt Nam approach the mentioned\xa0issues?The most pressing issue at the moment is how to strengthen and improve Vietnamese businesses in a comprehensive manner. The\xa0focus of Việt Nam's national programme on business development must make a shift to increase\xa0quality, rather than just increase the number of businesses.\xa0Sustainable development and digitalisation are two important objectives for business development and must be integrated into each business’s growth strategy.Việt Nam's draft\xa0Law on Enterprises, which is to be submitted to the National Assembly for review this month, prioritises business management improvement and increasing transparency, especially in micro-businesses and business households.— VNS",2

These clauses consist of climate change response, including human activities to adapt to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions; climate change response associated with sustainable development and strengthening the resilience of the natural and social systems.He also proposed adding some other clauses including those encouraging the collection, recycling, use or destruction of ozone depleting substances or controlled by the Montreal Protocol in civil and industrial refrigeration appliances when they are no longer in use.Addressing the workshop, Đào Anh Dũng, vice chairman of Cần Thơ City’s People’s Committee, said, like other localities in the country, the city was suffering from the impacts of climate change. It was reflected in the fact that extreme weather occurred more regularly.“High tides and river bank erosion has seriously affected the lives and production of local residents,” he said.Marcel Reymond, head of the Economic Cooperation Embassy of Switzerland in Việt Nam, said due to climate change, the Mekong Delta region suffered from US$130 to $190 million in damage every year.“It was essential for Việt Nam to further strengthen its legal frameworks and policy as well as improve technical standards to have an integrated implementation process,” he said, adding that the integration must be done separately at different levels from the Government, scientists, experts and communities.Lâm Văn Bi, vice chairman of Cà Mau Province’s People’s Committee, proposed the Government allow the province to pilot the capital mobilisation of enterprises involved in climate change response and erosion control in the province. Accordingly, enterprises could exploit a certain land area to compensate the construction of the works they invested in the locality. — VNS'",0

The ruins are now a popular destination because of their cultural relevance and architectural features.The ancient town of Hội An still preserves its cultural values as a busy trading port dating back 400 years.The Chàm Islands-Hội An World Biosphere Reserve, which covers over 33,000ha including Hội An, has 1,500ha of tropical forests and 6,700ha of sea featuring a wide range of fauna and flora.Speaking at the ceremony yesterday, a representative of UNESCO, Michael Croft, said: “I am honoured to address you this evening here in Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary, a place of another time and age, where we feel very much in the presence of the immortals.\xa0 As we celebrate the achievements of the past twenty years since UNESCO recognised the importance of the two gems, Mỹ Sơn and Hội An Ancient Town, it seems important to recall the historical context of cultural heritage management in Việt Nam.\xa0And this reflection takes us quickly to another anniversary which the nation recognized only a week ago, the 50th anniversary of the legacy of President Hồ Chí Minh.”“One of the most fascinating aspects of President Hồ Chí Minh was his ability to remain focused on his long-term strategic vision even while facing many immediate challenges. So when we revisit his issuing of Decree 65 on 23 November 1945, a decree which called for the immediate protection of cultural and historic relics, we understand that for him, the issue of cultural heritage was no trivial matter. He understood the importance of the country’s cultural identity to the movement for independence and freedom, and so he established the country’s first legal instrument for safeguarding cultural heritage, knowing that culture constituted the essential foundation and strength of the nation,” he said.“The Government and the Vietnamese people have continued to respect his vision and the result of their efforts, is what celebrate today. The beautiful Sanctuary of Mỹ Sơn, which once lay in ruin, has become one of the best examples in monument restoration in Southeast Asia, providing us a fascinating glimpse into the political and cultural history of the region. And we find this same sense of shared history expressed in the international collaboration to restore the site, in the close cooperation between Việt Nam and friendly countries like France, India, Italy and Poland and many other partners. UNESCO is proud to have been part of this process, and highlight it as best practice.”Quảng Nam hosted 6.5 million tourists, of which Hội An was a favourite destination of 5 million visitors, last year.

Malaysia are one step above with one win and one loss.It will be the first meeting of the two sides since Việt Nam beat Malaysia 3-2 in the final of the AFF Cup last December.Park and his assistants watched Malaysian’s recent games and all agree they were stronger now than before.""My assistant Lee Young-jin\xa0came to see their match against the UAE last month and I myself watch a clip of that match,” said Park through an interpreter.“I saw some changes in the team and recognised their front line is really sharp, much more than in the AFF Cup.""The South Korean believes playing against Malaysia would not be easy.""They have also watched us a lot,\xa0learned our strong points and found\xa0ways to limit us,” he added.“It is impossible to change all of\xa0our tactics now\xa0but we should level up our \'weapons\' that\xa0they already know and this change would\xa0push them in disorder\xa0(during the game).“At the same time, we will find the Malaysian weak points and attack on that.

He\xa0axed midfielder\xa0Hadin Azman and brought in\xa0defender Aidil Zafuan of Johor Darul Ta\'zim\xa0and midfielder Abdul Halim Saari of\xa0Selangor.Zafuan, 32, is a veteran player who played in many AFF Cup games in the past.

It\'s a great chance for Tammy.""He\'s always scored goals with our junior teams, with the Chelsea youth teams, on loan in the Championship consistently and now he\'s really grasped\xa0this opportunity at the beginning of the season, so it\'s thoroughly\xa0well-deserved.""Tomori, who could also represent Nigeria and Canada at international level, has also shone at centre-back for Chelsea after playing under Lampard on loan\xa0at Derby last season.Should either Abraham and Tomori feature in the upcoming qualifiers, they\xa0would no longer be allowed to switch international allegiance.""I don\'t think it\'s ethically right to select someone just to make sure he\xa0can\'t play for somebody else,"" added Southgate. ""The two boys Fik and Tammy are\xa0in on merit.""They\'ve both been part of our youth system, Fik came in a bit later but he\xa0was part of the team that won the (Under-17) World Cup.""As far as we\'re concerned they\'re English players. I\'m sure they have huge\xa0desire to play for England at senior level.""The emergence of a host of young players, though, has come at the expense of some of the stars of a run to the World Cup semi-finals 15 months ago.Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and Kyle Walker have all been left out.The Three Lions travel to face the Czech Republic in Prague on October 11\xa0before a trip to Sofia to take on Bulgaria four days later.England are in a commanding position to qualify for next year\'s European\xa0championships after winning all four of their opening qualifiers.

""We really wanted to play another game and when so many players are missing, the\xa0team steps up.""Loren Moron slammed a late strike into the top corner for Betis but by then the game was up as Barca ensured no further ground was lost on Atletico Madrid,\xa0who beat Leganes 1-0 earlier on Sunday, or Real Madrid, who were held to a 1-1\xa0draw on Saturday by Real Valladolid.Barcelona will hope to have Messi back for the trip to Osasuna next weekend but with Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele both out for longer, Griezmann\'s\xa0statement display was timely.Whether it also affects the club\'s attempts to prise Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain remains to be seen.This was Griezmann\'s first goal at Camp Nou in 14 appearances, five of them for Real Sociedad and eight for Atletico, and his overall performance was of\xa0someone ready to lead, rather than serve as only a foil for Messi.The crowd also enjoyed a goal from the 21-year-old Perez, making his first Barca start, and a substitute appearance from Anssumane Fati, who at 16 became the second youngest player ever to play for the club in La Liga.Sergio Busquets was at fault for Betis\' opener as he gave the ball away, allowing Fekir to drive in his debut goal since he moved from Lyon in July.But Barca were undeterred and after Rafinha missed an excellent chance to equalise, Griezmann took over, volleying in on the stretch four minutes before\xa0half-time, past the weak hand of Dani Martin.If Griezmann\'s first owed something to the goalkeeper, his second was unstoppable. He collected the ball 25 yards out and used Sidnei as a marker to\xa0bend his shot around the defender and inside the far post.Griezmann ran to the corner where confetti was poured into his hands. He threw it into the air above his head.Barca were relentless as Perez steered a third into the bottom corner and Alba made it four, latching onto a superb Busquets pass inside the full-back.There was still time for two scintillating strikes, the first from Vidal, who was slid in by Griezmann, and the second by Loren, who was given too much\xa0space. It was no more than a consolation.Barcelona stay behind Atletico, who maintained their perfect start with another 1-0 victory, this time over Leganes as Vitolo came off the bench to\xa0score a second-half winner at Butarque.Joao Felix, Atletico\'s 126 million-euro (US$140 million) buy from Benfica and much-hailed replacement for Griezmann, was again quiet but again delivered the\xa0match\'s most memorable moment.The 19-year-old\'s perfectly-timed pass provided set Vitolo free while Felix\xa0had been picked out by Kieran Trippier, who was faultless on his second Atletico start. —\xa0 AFP'",3

There is also a shortage of establishments that produce marine fish fry.\nAs of this month, the province has 3,464 floating cages that breed various kinds of marine fish species, up 27 per cent against the same period last year.\nThe marine fish species include cobia, grouper, black banded trevally and white pomfret.\nLast year, the province bred nearly 21,800ha of bivalve mollusks with a total output of 66,000 tonnes.\nThe bivalve mollusks, mostly mud clam, blood cockles and green mussels, are bred in alluvial grounds, shrimp ponds and mangrove forests.\nThe province estimates that it will be breeding bivalve mollusks on an area of 22,700ha with total output of 78,100 tonnes this year, according to the department.\nThe province also has about 50ha of oyster farming area for harvesting pearls in Phú Quốc District. Private enterprise Ngọc Hiền Pearl has invested in the area that produced about 250,000 pearls last year. The district’s pearl farming has contributed to tourism.\nIn recent years, the province has called on companies to invest in farming marine fish with advanced techniques.\nThe Trấn Phú Trading and Import-Export Co Ltd in Phú Quốc District is breeding white pomfret and red drum in floating cages with Norwegian techniques.\nIn the 2016-18 period, the company had four such floating cages with a total output of 100 tonnes a year. This year, the company added eight floating cages.\nIn July, the province gave approval to the Mavin Group to invest in breeding marine fish in Kiên Hải District for export. The project will cover 2,000ha of surface water off the coast of Kiên Hải and cost US$30 million.\nThe project is scheduled to operate in 2021 and will produce 30,000 tonnes of marine fish a year.\nThe province has nearly 200km of coast and favourable natural conditions for breeding fish in floating cages. — VNS",1

Apart from local tournaments, my players had to compete in the AFC Cup and then more than half of our team is in the national team. The busy schedule\xa0has strongly affected their strength for the Nam Định match,” Nghiêm said.“If we can't beat them we will face a big problem in our efforts to defend our title.”Nghiêm is also missing star fullback\xa0Đoàn Văn Hậu, who has moved to the Dutch league’s SC Heerenveen on loan.Despite these concerns, Hà Nội are in good form, having won in the\xa0AFC Cup inter-zone semi-final and their last three\xa0V.League outings.They lead\xa0the V.League 1 with 43 points, two more than runners-up HCM City with one game in hand.Meanwhile the visiting side's coach\xa0Nguyễn Văn Dũng has asked his players to focus on\xa0defence to bring at least one point home.They will be supported by more than 3,000 fans living around the city as well as those coming from Nam Định Province.Nam Định are\xa0in poor form, without a win in three matches. They are ninth in the table on\xa027 points, just two off the relegation playoff spot in 13th.The visitors are one of two teams, alongside SHB Đà Nẵng,\xa0who have yet to win away this season, while\xa0Hà Nội have yet to lose at the Hàng Đẫy Stadium this year.

It’s my emotion, pride and gratitude for the city where I was born,” said Vũ.Vũ was born in 1979 in Hà Nội. Vũ started studying music at the age of 15. He competed at the Sao Mai National Singing Contest in 2001 and was one among 10 finalists. Though he didn’t win a prize at the contest, he had a chance to meet and then marry singer Phương Nga, winner of the contest that year.He has worked as an artist at the Việt Nam Opera and Ballet Theatre (VNOB) for 10 years.

1326,'UK sends papers to Việt Nam for verification of four victims',"'HÀ NỘI — British police have sent documents to Việt Nam for verification on four of the 39 victims found dead inside a lorry last week, said a Vietnamese deputy foreign minister on Monday morning.Deputy minister Bùi Thanh Sơn told reporters during a National Assembly meeting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was yet to receive the papers to run the verification process and thus none of the victims have been confirmed, he added.The tragedy came to light last Wednesday when police received reports about 39 bodies found in a lorry at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, about 20 miles east of London.Police first suspected the victims to be Chinese nationals, but they shifted their efforts to identify the victims among the Vietnamese community after two dozen Vietnamese families reported their children missing while supposedly en route to Britain.As of Sunday evening, 24 families in the central provinces of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh reported to the authorities that they have been out of contact with their children for almost a week.Sơn said that it was still too early to “say anything concrete” about the deaths of the alleged illegal migrants.UK police managed to get leads on four cases and sent their documents to Việt Nam to help verifying the victims.“It will take quite a while for British police because according to the law, the UK doesn’t accept face identification but DNA tests only,” he said.According to the plan, British police will be able to complete papers for between five and six cases a day, Sơn said.“Sending documents of the first four cases to Việt Nam means that the UK has doubts on the nationality of the victims and is seeking bilateral co-operation for verification.”Việt Nam planned to have a meeting with the British Ambassador in Việt Nam Gareth Ward on Monday to exchange information, Sơn added.Following a meeting with Việt Nam’s Ministry of Public Security on Monday, UK Ambassador to Việt Nam Gareth Ward issued a statement on the deaths of 39 people in Essex.The ambassador confirmed there has been no official identification of the victims, but authorities in Việt Nam and the UK are working closely together on this process. “This identification process will take time to ensure the dignity of the victims, to guarantee forensic accuracy, and to secure information for the ongoing investigation,” Ward said in the statement.“The UK and Vietnam are friends and partners. We will work together to raise awareness of the dangers of human trafficking, to prosecute the criminals who facilitate it, and to protect vulnerable people.”— VNS'",1

624,'Việt Nam pursues multilateralism and consensus as member of UN Security Council: Foreign minister',"'Việt Nam has been elected to the United Nations (UN) Security Council as a non-permanent member with a near unanimous vote in a General Assembly meeting last Friday. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Phạm Bình Minh speaks to local media on what Việt Nam expects to contribute to the UN agenda during its 2020-21 term.What are the priorities for Việt Nam during our term on the Security Council?The United Nations Security Council is one of the main organs of the United Nations and has primary responsibility for global affairs, especially peace and security, and Việt Nam’s contributions to the Council would be in line with the United Nations’ agenda.Our priorities during our membership for the 2020-21 term would be to promote multilateralism and compliance with international laws in addressing global challenges regarding peace and security. This is the highest priority Việt Nam strives for in serving the Council.We also want to leverage our past experiences to resolve issues of great concern, such as post-conflict reconstruction, women and children in conflicts or dealing with unexploded ordnance.And of course, participating in the UN also means that we seek to contribute our part to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region and the world at large that is conducive to the country’s own development.What are the main challenges facing Việt Nam as it assumes a position on the Security Council?On the UN Security Council, it’s important that the five permanent and the ten non-permanent members co-ordinate and co-operate effectively to address issues of concern, and make sure that any issue put before the council receives unanimity in the best case scenario.As per our observation at the UN, 90 per cent of all issues on the table can be resolved if there is a consensus, which ensures that\xa0the\xa0implementation of the UN Security Council’s resolutions will be effective. If a resolution fails to achieve consensus\xa0or gets vetoed by a permanent council member, that means there’s a split of opinion amongst the members and that’s something we need to keep in mind to avoid such cases. Our duty is to connect the members of the Council to build consensus at the highest level.There are also issues that may force council members to take a stance, which means we will need to be careful in our deliberations to arrive at a suitable decision.Our decision to push for election to the Security Council is historic. Could you tell us about the efforts Việt Nam has been taking to prepare for the role?This decision is indeed significant, as it showcases Việt Nam’s elevated global standing and our commitment to global responsibilities as a member of the UN and the international community.Việt Nam’s candidature to the highest organ of the UN reflects our desire to contribute to one of the world’s most urgent business, which is to maintain peace, stability and security.Việt Nam’s upcoming term in 2020-21 will be the second after\xa0our very first stint on the council in 2008-09. Our contributions and performance of the duties during the first time serving on the Council have been widely recognised and appreciated, which certainly helped us obtain high confidence from other countries as Việt Nam ran for the position\xa0for the second time, evidenced by the landslide vote.However, our candidature and eventual election to the UN Security Council must not be thought to be a “foregone conclusion”, this is a fruit of our proactive efforts from our part over the last ten years to maintain Việt Nam as the sole candidate for the entire Asia-Pacific region.It has to be said that competition is fierce between the member countries from the same group in running for a seat on the Council. There was a time when no country received the required number of votes even after 140 rounds to represent the group of countries to be elected to the Council. Over the past ten years, of course there were times when a few powerful countries in the region made moves to prepare for the election but with skilful approaches and measures, we have managed to persuade them from running, ensuring our status as the sole candidature for the Asia-Pacific region. This serves as a clear demonstration of other countries’ trust in Việt Nam’s full capabilities to handle the duties as a Council member.Việt Nam will also assume the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2020. How will Việt Nam leverage this position with its time on the Security Council?For the term 2020-21 on the Council, Việt Nam will seek to further enhance the co-operation between the United Nations, or the Security Council, with regional organisations, including ASEAN. This is also high on the United Nations’ agenda so when\xa0we take the leadership of ASEAN in 2020, we will be in a great position to push for the realisation of this goal.2020 will surely be a busy and challenging year for Việt Nam, as we will undertake the role of ASEAN chair and the rotating presidency of the Council from the beginning of the next year. — VNS'",0
2663,'Consumer price index to be controlled at low level of 3.3-3.5% in 2019',"'HÀ NỘI If there are no unexpected factors in the remaining months of the year, it is feasible to control\xa0the consumer price index (CPI) this year at a low level of 3.3-3.5 per cent,\xa0Deputy Prime Minister Vương Đình Huệ said on Friday.During a meeting of the Government’s Steering Committee for Price Management to review the country’s price management in the third quarter of 2019 held in Hà Nội, Huệ said average consumer price index in the first nine months of 2019 was estimated to expand by some 2.52 per cent against the same period last year.Huệ, who is head of the committee, said the average CPI of 2.52 per cent in the first nine months of 2019 was the lowest level in the past three years. The rise in 2017 and 2018 was 3.79 per cent and 3.57 per cent, respectively.The low monthly CPI rise in the third quarter has continued to ease authorities in controlling inflation for the whole year according to the targets set by the National Assembly, Huệ said, adding the low hike would also be a condition for the Government to consider the price adjustment of some public services according to the Government’s approved roadmap.Nguyễn Anh Tuấn, Director of the Ministry of Finance’s Price Management Department and head of the committee’s assistant group, said during the first nine months of 2019, prices of goods and services rose significantly in February before inching down in March and June. The prices then gradually increased again from July to September.Despite still rising, the monthly increasing rate of the CPI was low in the third quarter. The CPI in July expanded by only 0.18 per cent compared with June. The rate in August was 0.28 per cent and is estimated at some 0.4-0.6 per cent in September.According to Tuấn, the main reasons for reducing the pressure on the CPI were the decline in food prices due to the abundant domestic supply and the decrease in the demand for rice imports in the world market.Besides, prices of petrol, oil and gas in the domestic market tended to decrease in the third quarter, contributing to easing the pressure on CPI.In addition, Tuấn said, the low CPI hike was also thanks to great efforts made by ministries and sectors in monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the movements of domestic and foreign market prices of essential commodities in order to have timely policy responses, contributing to stabilising market sentiment and controlling inflation.The ministries and agencies were successful in proactively calculating and adjusting the prices of essential commodities according to the Government’s roadmap and the Steering Committee’s scenario set out for each quarter, Tuấn said.To continually better control inflation in the remaining months of the year, Deputy PM Huệ required ministries and sectors to closely monitor supply and demand movements of goods and services, especially some essential goods, as well as proactively prepare commodity supply sources at the end of the year for holidays such as the New Year.The Ministry of Industry and Trade must proactively distribute goods sources in the context of commercial competition among big countries. The ministry also has to take measures to boost exports and control imports to ensure not only the CPI target but also balance of payment, balance of capital and current account balance, Huệ said.Huệ directed the State Bank of Việt Nam to continually manage the monetary policy actively and flexibly, and co-ordinate the fiscal policy with other macro policies to control core inflation at some 1.9 per cent.He also instructed the management of prices of some essential commodities including electricity, requiring competent authorities to make public the input costs of electricity before November this year.As for the price management next year, Huệ said the Government would propose the National Assembly to control the CPI rise at\xa04 per cent.\xa0VNS'",2

There are investment funds, mentors and innovative start-up spaces for young people. The involvement of big corporations in innovative start-ups is a growing trend in\xa0ASEAN and other countries around\xa0the world, helping it to grow faster and more sustainably.Việt Nam has made changes to mechanisms and policies to attract domestic and foreign investors. The Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) has listened to the domestic and foreign communities to propose plans to the Government to improve these mechanisms. A lot of ministries and sectors have also proposed sound policies and projects to call for investment from the community, and improve licensing procedures and the investment climate.However, when I met with investors in Singapore and South Korea, they said Vietnamese procedures for investors still needed to be improved. Other countries have specific mechanisms to license investments in innovative start-ups. Capital withdrawal and capital concessions also involve\xa0different mechanisms than\xa0normal investments.Việt Nam needs more labs located at educational institutes and localities for start-ups to test their products. The issuance of licences to test\xa0new products\xa0also needs to be accelerated.A bright spot for\xa0the Vietnamese start-up eco-system is the\xa0private and public sectors have worked together to organise start-up events, and taken start-ups overseas so they have a\xa0chance\xa0to participate in contests and call for investment.The number of domestic and foreign start-up investment funds has increased significantly.In the eyes of investors, Việt Nam is emerging as one of the most actively-growing start-up eco-systems in ASEAN, jumping from seventh to third in only one year. Other statistics on innovation have also climbed.If we improve the investment climate and adventure capital market, for sure, Việt Nam will be able to achieve more and Vietnamese start-ups will be fuelled to grow faster.What are the major goals of the national innovative start-up day at Techfest 2019?Under the theme ‘Việt Nam: Globalise’, the major goal is to bring as many as sources to Việt Nam as possible. They include\xa0manpower, technology and finance.We will focus on human resources, intelligence, experience, coaches and investors.We will also look at\xa0bringing technology-based solutions and\xa0business models to Việt Nam, especially those created by Vietnamese people studying abroad. Vietnamese scientists and businesses across the world will act as a bridge to bring those technologies to Việt Nam.We hope that not only adventure investment funds but also corporations, groups and angel investors from ASEAN will support Vietnamese investors to connect with foreign investors to create an ASEAN capital market for regional innovative start-ups.Techfest 2019’s targets are recommendations for Việt Nam when the country will assume the ASEAN Chairmanship next year because the topic of\xa0innovative start-ups will attract a lot of\xa0investors at ASEAN 2020 meetings.Attracting domestic and foreign capital\xa0is one of the targets Techfest 2019 and Vietnamese start-ups are looking for. What plans are there for the National Agency for Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialisation Development and the\xa0MoST in general to encourage investment in Vietnamese start-ups?It is important to have specific mechanisms for investors. The Law on Support for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises has proposed mechanisms for investment organisations, funds and companies. Individuals or angel investors also need mechanisms such as tax exemptions and\xa0licence issuance. Mechanisms for\xa0auditing and\xa0accounting need to be more specific and relevant for\xa0adventure investment.Regional countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand are improving these mechanisms.The MoST will receive feedback\xa0from investors and experts and submit regular reports to the Government and the Prime Minister so they can\xa0assign ministries, agencies and local authorities to pilot specific mechanisms, make amendments to the laws and issue the necessary legal documents for\xa0start-up investments. — VNS'",1
5203,'American writer settles down in Việt Nam after travelling to 70 countries',"As the son of diplomats, American novelist Alexander Yates has travelled to 70 countries around the world.He says one place was unlike any other, the place he now calls home: Việt Nam.Yates has lived in Hà Nội for four years and apart from writing and promoting his books, spends his time as a\xa0partner in Fourdozen, an American-based education consultancy and marketing company and giving lectures and discussions on story-telling hosted by American Centre in the capital.He was born in Haiti, and grew up in South America and the Philippines. He also worked as a consultant for the State Department and US Agency for International Development in Rwanda\xa0and Afghanistan.Yates' first novel was published before he was 30. He has written one novel for adults, and two for young adults. The latest one, How We Became Wicked, came out in July.The American has\xa0won\xa0awards in both fiction and poetry, and his books have been published in more than six countries.“While all of the novels are very different from each other, they all deal with culture and identity,” he said.“The question of where I am determines who I am and informs all of my books. Family issues, particularly relationships between parents and children, are also central to my work.”Special connection to Việt NamYates first came to Việt Nam in 2014 and\xa0soon realised that he had never experienced anything like the country.“I felt simultaneously very far from my own comfort zone, but also safe and welcomed. Particularly after my Vietnamese started to improve, I found it so rewarding to make relationships here.“Speaking Vietnamese and getting to know the city of Hà Nội and its people has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life,” he said.Yates professes he has a deep love for Việt Nam and is a fan of how comfortable Vietnamese people are making one-on-one connections.“I also love the use of public space in Hà Nội. The fact that Hà Nội is not for me, not for tourists or people with money. Hà Nội is for Hanoians. I am welcomed, but I am not necessary. I adore that.“I also love the energy of Hà Nội, and of Việt Nam. There is such a sense of possibility here.”Yates wants to do his best to adopt the local culture and lifestyle so he speaks Vietnamese every day\xa0in his office.“It was naturally difficult to learn, but Hanoians are so willing to engage and correct me,” said Yates.“In my early days learning Vietnamese, everyone I met was willing to become a teacher, and correct my word choice or pronunciation, I don’t feel ashamed at all.”Bird-watching, more than a hobbyYates' hobby of bird-watching has taken him all across the country and his photos of the avian delights are impressive, as is his passion.“Bird-watching is a passion of mine. Do not ask me about it at a party, because I become like an evangelist spreading the gospel,” he said.Yates has been watching and photographing birds for about 13 years and says he has seen about one fourth\xa0of all the bird species in the world so far.“Some days I think I would like to go for the world record, but I doubt I will ever\xa0have the time and money to do all that travel, and also I am not sure I'm crazy enough. I'll settle for seeing half of the world's birds.”Bird-watching is also a fantastic way to travel. For example, when he was bird-watching in shrimp farms in\xa0the northern province of Nam Định, looking for the endangered Black-Faced Spoonbill, he stopped for tea and spoke with many shrimp farmers.“One year, I spent Tết in a stilt house over a lake filled with crocodiles in Cát Tiên National Park (the southern province of Đồng Nai),” he said.“The forest rangers still had duty, but their families had brought them all food and beer to celebrate the holiday. So we celebrated together, in the woods, in the dark. It was a wonderful way to bring in the new year.”For Yates, bird-watching is the ultimate meditation. He silently and patiently pays attention to the birds and photographs\xa0them.“I take photos as a way to help me identify the birds, I know that my photos can never truly express how beautiful birds are,” he said.“When I am in the woods, seeking a rare bird, my self disappears. I don't think at all about the troubles in my life, or stresses related to work. I focus completely on the sights and sounds coming in to me. My mind disappears, and I become nothing but a set of eyes watching, ears listening, and a beating heart, swelling.”While Yates is a pet-lover, he doesn't keep caged birds as he wants to let them roam free and find their own homes, as he has in Việt Nam. — VNS",5

4916,'Việt Nam - India culture and tourism: Chicken lays golden eggs',"'Predestined relationship with Việt NamReferring to Kolkata - the third largest city of India (and former capital of British India) - is referring to a place which seems to have predestined relationships with Việt Nam.Ambassador Phạm\xa0Sanh Châu said the image of President Hồ\xa0Chí\xa0Minh remained intact in the memories of the people in Kolkata who admired and respected him.In 1911, he came here in the journey to salvage the nation. In 1946, he returned as the leader of a newly independent nation. In 1958, he visited Kolkata as the President of the young Democratic Republic of Việt Nam in the process of overcoming the consequences of war, building and fighting to unify the country.In 1947, the people of Kolkata chose January 19 as Việt Nam Day here and two days later (January 21), thousands of students took to the streets to protest and support the Vietnamese government. The slogan was shouted by protesters at that time: ""My name, your name, Vietnam, Vietnam"".Many anti-war songs and poems have been born since then, associated with this familiar slogan. Many Kolkata youths have fallen to claim independence for Việt Nam. During the war against the US, the articles supporting Việt Nam demanding peace and reunification were always hot in Indian newspapers.In Kolkata, the love for Việt Nam and President Hồ\xa0Chí\xa0Minh was so great that people renamed a road to Ho Chi Minh Road by themselves.Ten years later, in response to the people’s wholehearted aspirations, the government officially recognised this road.In 1990, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birthday, the City Council and the India-Vietnam Solidarity Committee of West Bengal inaugurated a road named President Hồ\xa0Chí\xa0Minh - ""Ho Chi Minh Sarani"".This road intersects with Jawaharlal Nehru Boulevard. It is the symbol of the friendship of the two great leaders Jawaharla Nehru - Hồ\xa0Chí\xa0Minh and the friendship of India and Việt Nam.On that occasion, the West Bengal state government erected a bronze statue of Uncle Ho in the city park (located right at the intersection between Ho Chi Minh Boulevard and Jawaharlan Nehru Boulevard). Kolkata becomes the first foreign city in the world to build monument to Uncle Hồ.Currently, at The Lalit Great Easten Hotel where Uncle Hồ\xa0stayed when he visited Kolkata for the first time on June 1, 1946, there was a sign placed in a dignified position saying: ""Ho Chi Minh (1890-1969), Founder of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (now the Socialist Republic of Vietnam) was staying at The Lalit Great Easten Hotel on June 1, 1946”.In 2016, at the Jadavpur University and the National Library in Kolkata, there was the opening ceremony of ""Vietnam Book Corner"".It was a practical action that contributed to the promotion of the studies about the history and culture of Việt Nam by the Indian youths and students, thereby strengthening the cooperation between the two countries, especially in the context that the Indian government is promoting the implementation of the “Act East Policy”.The Executive Director of National Library Dr. Arun Kumar Chakraborty said ""Vietnam Corner"" is a vivid symbol of people-to-people exchange, making an important contribution to promoting cooperation between the two countries, especially in the field of culture and education.Direct flights to Kolkata“India, a country with the world\'s second largest population, is now considered as a promising tourist market. Each year about 25 million Indians travel abroad and this trend has been increasing rapidly in recent years. However, the number of Indian visitors to Việt Nam is still small (over 130,000 Indian visitors to Việt Nam in 2018, while the number of Indian tourists to Thailand reached about 1.5 million). ""- Ambassador Phạm Sanh Châu expressed his concern.In March 2019, the Vietnamese Embassy in India contributed to convincing an Indian billionaire couple to hold their wedding at the J.W.Marriott Emerald Bay Hotel in Phú\xa0Quốc.Ambassador Phạm Sanh Châu said: “The tourists all said that they were surprised because they did not think Việt Nam had such an impressive wedding venue. Việt Nam tourism is very diverse and attractive with variety of tourism products in different regions.”One of the reasons the tourism potential of the two countries has not been fully exploited is that the flights from India to Việt Nam or vice versa have to be transited at other airports which cost time and money.This will be overcome when IndiGo, an Indian Airline, opens direct flights from Kolkata to Hà Nội (on October 3) and to Hồ\xa0Chí\xa0Minh City (from October 18).Mr. Châu said: ""I believe that actively promoting tourism and opening direct flights between India and Việt Nam will turn Việt Nam into an attractive destination for Indian tourists.""Ambassador Phạm Sanh Châu shared that India is also promoting tourism in Việt Nam.Indian Ambassador to Việt Nam Mr. Pranay Verma often talks about India\'s strengths such as natural and cultural heritage and religious diversity.The architecture of temples, palaces and fortresses are great sculptures with high artistic value. In addition, tourism resources, especially Buddhist spiritual tourism, are very unique. Coming to India, visitors can experience Buddhist tourism, boating on the legendary Ganges river or climbing and skiing the Himalayas.Besides, healthcare tourism and retreats, yoga programs are also great potential of India.Many tour operators have launched attractive tours such as ""Four Holy Places"" by Gotadi, including four Buddhist sacred places, marking four important events in the life and teachings career of Buddha Shakyamuni. This tour with the support of Gotadi and Hương Giang Aviation, the representative of an Indian Airline IndiGo in Việt Nam, currently only cost VNĐ25 million\xa0for Vietnamese tourists.As for Việt Nam tourism market, Ambassador Phạm Sanh Châu said: “I believe that from the view of an enterprise, the Indian tourist market with one of the largest population in the world is really a very attractive ""piece of cake "".The middle class of this billion-people-nation alone amounts to 200-300 million people, with annual increase in demand for shopping, recreation and tourism, from that point of view if being exploited \xa0successfully, this will be the ""chicken laying golden eggs"" for tourism in Việt Nam."" — VNS'",5

Later, his mother died of kidney disease later the same year at the age of 38.\xa0Chuyền was 20.After his mother’s death, Chuyền dropped out of HCM City University of Sports to return to\xa0Lạng Sơn\xa0to work in imports and exports\xa0and get married.However, his job trading at the border gate in\xa0Lạng Sơn didn\'t interest him.“I didn’t enjoy the work at home,"" he said. ""And I could not stop thinking about running. Training conditions at home were not good so I decided to find another job that would let me live my dream.""Chuyền left\xa0Lạng Sơn, finding\xa0work at a paper factory in the northern province of Bắc Ninh.“Near my working place, there is a very nice road so I can work and run comfortably,” said Chuyền.Chuyền registered to take part in the 10km and 21km races at many marathons in the north and became\xa0an elite amateur runner with the nickname Tốc Ca Ca.He won the\xa010km at the\xa0Long Biên Marathon in 2016, the Hạ Long Marathon in 2017-19 and the Ciputra Marathon in 2017. He also won the 21km races at the Long Biên Marathon in 2017 and the Việt Nam Trail Marathon in Mộc Châu this year.TrainerIn 2016, one of\xa0Chuyền\'s friends offered him the chance to be a trainer at his gym. He left his job at the paper factory and came to\xa0Hà Nội to help people become better runners.To make extra money,\xa0Chuyền started holding running classes and training session at the city\'s\xa0Thống Nhất Park.The first class attracted around 10 runners with the fee of VNĐ300,000 per month for each person.As he was training runners,\xa0Chuyền realised they needed a place to buy quality sports equipment. He and his wife starting selling running shoes, shorts, t-shirts, stopwatches, reflector belts and sunglasses.Chuyền said\xa0he ordered the goods online to sell them to local runners.Thanks to his experience and knowledge of running, he has been able to find quality products and offer them to customers at good prices. He also offers his professional advice.“I want each good\xa0my clients buy\xa0to\xa0be in accordance with his or her targets and demands,"" he said.\xa0""Every person will have their own demands in\xa0running. Sometimes, my store doesn’t have products which are\xa0comfortable for\xa0the customer so I advise\xa0them\xa0to wait for me to find another product.""Chuyền has expanded from a small sporting goods store to a large one on\xa0Hà Nội\'s\xa0 Đào Tấn Street.“My shop now has turnover of around VNĐ600 million (US$26,000) per month and I employ four people,” said Chuyền.\xa0“I have also opened a second store in Hà Nội with the name Tốc Sport and I will open another one in HCM City.""Chuyền\'s training courses at\xa0Bách Thảo Park,\xa0Thống Nhất Park and\xa0Hoàn Kiếm Lake have helped him create a network of customers.Every Thursday, Chuyền teaches beginners the basics and instructs runners who want to improve their performances. He also offers expert advice about sporting goods and training regimens.Although Chuyền is busy with his business, he still trains for three to\xa0four hours per day. He runs from 5am to 7am and from 4.30pm to 6pm.“Running has helped\xa0me give up unhealthy habits,"" he said.\xa0""I love running. I have collected around 100 medals from marathons around the country.""“Every one of us has a starting point,"" he said.\xa0""I experienced a hard\xa0childhood being\xa0born in a remote mountainous region far from civilisation.

After fulfilling their duties, they returned home and continued working in different positions, contributing to national development and defence.The former experts’ liaison board had actively taken part in people-to-people diplomatic activities to help enhance the solidarity and friendship between the two nations, Vượng said, expressing his hope they would continue serving as a bridge linking the two countries.On behalf of the Vietnamese Party, State and people, Vượng also thanked Cambodia for its precious support for Việt Nam’s national liberation, development and defence.

Through the defendant's testimony,\xa0the Ministry of Public Security's investigation agency also gathered some evidence including telephone number, and documents recording the amount of money giving and name of officer accepting bribes.At the appeal trial, a representative form High-level People’s Procuracy said in cases of bribery there must be a person who gave bribes and another person who accepted. It was not reasonable to prosecuted defendants who gave bribes and acted as middleman while ignoring the crime of persons who have taken bribes.He proposed the Jury Board suggesting the public security ministry's\xa0Investigation Agency and Supreme People’s Court to clarify traffic police and inspectors involved in the case. — VNS",1

1819,'Aviation sector aims for sustainable development and healthy competition',"HÀ NỘI — Sustainable development and a level playing field for all are two important objectives for Việt Nam’s aviation sector, said policymakers and industry experts at a conference in Hà Nội on Wednesday.The sector has maintained a 15.8 per cent per annual growth rate during the last 10 years, an impressive feat especially considering it has not suffered any incidents that resulted in lives being lost, said Deputy Minister of Transport Lê Anh Tuấn.Tuấn said the industry has been a key driver for economic growth and has helped expand commercial and cultural exchanges between Việt Nam and the world.Đinh Việt Thắng, head of Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV), said the sector’s fast-pace development has offered consumers more travel options, benefits and improved quality of service. Việt Nam is among a handful number of countries that have been able to maintain a perfect safety record for over two decades now.Rapid growth, however, has created numerous difficulties and challenges for the industry, especially in keeping up with demand for infrastructure, said Vietnam Airlines CEO Dương Trí Thành, who heads Việt Nam’s flag carrier and largest airline.The CEO stressed the need for upgraded infrastructure and policies to encourage and attract investment from the private sector if the industry is to maintain its current growth speed.Former head of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) Nguyễn Đình Cung said the Government must identify bottlenecks that have been hindering the aviation sector's faster growth.“Overloaded and overcrowded Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport is the first major infrastructure bottleneck that comes to mind. Not only the airlines industry, it has hampered growth for tourism and other sectors,” said Cung.In addition, CAAV’s boss Thắng pointed out infrastructure was not the only issue that requires immediate attention from policymakers.Thắng said a major revamp to the country’s current Civil Aviation Law is needed. Short\xa0of clear and effective development policies and strategies, other airports across the country will soon experience the same issues as HCM City’s Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport.There is still a large margin for growth in Việt Nam’s aviation sector. By the year 2025, CAAV anticipates the industry must meet travel demands of 150-180 million passengers. The number of airlines operating in Việt Nam has remained at five, a figure that can be considered low in comparison to neighbouring countries such as Indonesia (12), Thailand (16), Malaysia (10), the Philippines (12) and Singapore (6).“Even if we count the three pending proposals from Vinpearl Air, Kite Air and Vietravel Airlines, we only have eight airlines,” said Thắng.Việt Nam-US directAt the conference, speakers also discussed the possibility and formation of a Việt Nam-US direct route.While it’s just a matter of time before a direct route between Việt Nam and the US\xa0becomes a necessity, the question is when and how such a route should be established, said Prof. Nawal Taneja, an industry expert.Taneja said while established operators such as Vietnam Airlines possess more than enough of the technical capacity to fly direct, they must pay attention to brand-building and networking with partners in the US as well as to seek support from both governments.He urged Vietnamese airlines to review their financial resources and analyse passenger data before thinking about setting up a Việt Nam-US direct route.In addition, Vietnamese airlines must overcome many technical barriers to set up direct flights to the US, said CAAV’s Thắng.While the two governments have already signed an agreement to allow up to seven direct flights per week between the two countries, Vietnam Airlines is currently the only Vietnamese airlines that meet all the requirements to operate them.“Security is a major issue. Airlines operating flights to the US must satisfy rigorous security requirements by US government agencies. Even Vietnamese airports are subject to US annual inspections to make sure they meet security standards,” Thắng said.The CAAV’s boss also advised airlines to carefully consider the financial feasibility of a direct route as competition could be expected to be fierce for the world’s largest aviation market, especially given the fact that there are already numerous connecting flights heading to the US from Việt Nam. — VNS",2
2483,'Gov’t proposes naming ACV as investor in Long Thành airport',"'HCM CITY — The\xa0Government has proposed naming\xa0State-owned Airports Corporation of Việt Nam (ACV) as the main\xa0investor for the first phase of Long Thành International Airport in the southern province of Đồng Nai.As authorised by the Prime Minister, Minister of Transport Nguyễn Văn Thể has submitted a\xa0feasibility report on the first phase of the airport at a cost of VNĐ111 trillion (US$4.779 billion)\xa0to the National Assembly (NA).“If the proposal is approved by the NA, construction of the airport can begin in the first quarter of 2021,” said Lại Xuân Thanh, chairman of ACV.According to the report, ACV, which runs 21 airports nationwide, will invest in the first runway, taxiways, a terminal, an aircraft parking space and other major infrastructure at the airport.ACV\xa0will need to raise about VNĐ98 trillion ($4.19 billion) for the project. It is set to have VNĐ36.6 trillion ($1.57 billion) by 2025, or 37 per cent of the investment.\xa0It has been working\xa0with 12 domestic and international organisations to borrow the remaining at an interest rate of 5-5.5 per cent a year with a loan term of 15 years.In addition, the Government has also proposed naming\xa0the Việt Nam Air Traffic Management Corp (VATM) as the investor of the\xa0control tower and other safety features.\xa0VATM would need to raise an estimated VNĐ3.22 trillion ($138.8 million) for the purpose.VATM\xa0already has VNĐ2.12 trillion ($91.38 million), or 66 per cent, of the needed money.\xa0VATM would borrow the rest from local credit institutions with an interest rate of 11 per cent a year.“We are confident that we will manage to find\xa0enough capital for the project. But there’s still a long road ahead.\xa0It will take a long time\xa0to invite bids for technical designs of the airport before\xa0construction,” he said.In addition, the Government has proposed building two additional roads to enhance better connections between the city and the new airport.Land adjustmentThe Government has also proposed increasing\xa0the first-phase construction area by 55 per cent from 1,165ha to 1,810ha to add more structures such as cargo storage and a cargo terminal, and to clear the area for a future second runway.However, the total area for the airport in all phases\xa0remains unchanged at 5,000ha as approved by the NA.Experts said that the Government should\xa0carefully consider its proposal to name ACV as the main investor since there will be no other competitors.They said that Việt Nam should invite bids to build its largest airport\xa0instead of handing it over to a State-owned firm.\xa0The\xa0investment is far beyond ACV’s capacity, which might lead to financial risks.Asking investors to bid for the project is a better option to ensure transparency and effectiveness in such a massive project, they said.According to the Ministry of Transport, Long Thành airport\xa0requires careful preparations so that the project can kick off in 2021 and be completed in 2025.The ministry has asked\xa0theVNA\xa0to\xa0issue a resolution to approve the feasibility report for the project.The airport was approved by the NA four years ago, but funding has remained a big question, even as construction of the first phase is set to start next year.The airport will be built in three phases over three decades, and is expected to become the country’s largest airport.The first phase is scheduled for completion in 2025, when the new airport will be able to handle 25 million passengers a year.The next two phases will run from 2030 to 2035 and from 2040 to 2050.Once completed, it will have an annual capacity of 100 million passengers and five million tonnes of cargo.The three phases are estimated to cost $5.4 billion now, but experts have warned this could double if the project is delayed by five years.Located 40km to the east of HCM City, Long Thành airport is expected to\xa0relieve overloading at\xa0Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport in HCM City, the country’s largest airport.Vietnamese airports served 103.5 million passengers last year, up 11 per cent from 2017, according to ACV. — VNS'",2

They were an undefeated team and\xa0this was a lesson for our young players.Masanaga also admitted that coach Philippe Troussier of Việt Nam applied good tactics in this match.According to Masanaga, Troussier was a good trainer. He knew Japanese football clearly as he coached the Japanese national football team. He also knew\xa0Japan's playing style in advance.While French Troussier\xa0said that: “Việt Nam will meet many difficulties when they face Japan so I encouraged my players very much in terms of psychology.

Four years later, he strongly impressed by leading Japan through to the World Cup knockout stage for the first time in history.In June 2018, Troussier inked a contract to work as the technical director of the PVF youth football training centre in the northern province of Hưng Yên.The French strategist hoped that he would lead Việt Nam U19s to harvest such success as achieved by Việt Nam’s U22, U23 and national teams in recent years. —\xa0VNS",3

3624,It's time to seriously think about climate resilience,"'My grandfather turned his head and watched as his house was engulfed in the devastating water.On a tiny boat, my grandparents and their neighbours carried some clothes wrapped in plastic sheets, leaving the village for higher ground.It was November 2, 1999, when strong cold air combined with the equatorial low-pressure belt hit central coastal provinces from Quảng Bình to Bình Định.In my hometown - Quảng Trị Province’s Đông Hà City, total rainfall from November 1 to 4 reached 800mm.Huế City was the most impacted with rainfall of 1,384mm, the highest level recorded since 1886.According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, some 7 million people lost their homes. Hundreds of medical facilities and schools were destroyed.Nearly 600 people were killed, 75,000ha of paddy fields were damaged and 130,000 tonnes of warehoused food was soaked in floodwater.For locals, it is remembered as the late 20th-century cataclysm.Gloomy memories of diseases and starvation still haunt many people, despite the fact that two decades have passed.When my grandfather was finally able to build a new house, he decided to give it a mezzanine as a hiding place for family members and to store precious assets and rice for when floods hit.Last week, a report released by Climate Central warned southern Việt Nam could disappear under water due to sea level rises by 2050.More than 20 million people face watching their homes and livelihoods being taken away by high tides.HCM City, the country’s economic engine, is apparently at risk of being submerged. The current severe situation, even in high-class neighbourhoods like Thảo Điền and Phú Mỹ Hưng, could get even worse.Some people, whether in jest or seriously, have started talking about moving from the south and buying houses “somewhere higher”.Just like thousands other families in central Việt Nam 20 years old, running is the best policy.But what about those who have to stay, whose livelihoods depend heavily on paddy fields in Mekong Delta or neon streets in HCM City?After five days at a community house, my grandparents came back to their village which was covered in mud. They believed they could rebuild it, regain what was gone and mitigate the impacts of later disasters.But what about southern people in 2050? If they lose their land, they will lose it forever.Đà Nẵng City is also in the spotlight, as its sandy beaches are choked in plastic waste after excessive rain over the last few weekends.In a photo currently going viral online, thousands of used plastic bottles were found inside the city’s drainage sewer when cleaning worker tried to unclog it.Some 6,000 households of northern central Nghệ An Province’s Vinh City will never forget the serious flooding in mid-October which left them in the dark for several days due to electricity cuts.The reason, ironically, was because Đông Vĩnh Ward authorities forgot to build a drainage system when upgrading Trần Bình Trọng Street earlier this year, preventing water from flowing away in case of heavy rain.Other wards faced the same ordeal as ponds, lakes and fields through which water runs to the sewer have been encroached upon for construction.“Extreme weather does not care about man-made borders, whenever the tide rises or storm hits it affects the whole region,” Henk Ovink, Special Envoy for Water Affairs of the Netherlands, told\xa0Việt Nam News\xa0this time last year.Flooding is no longer a problem for disaster-prone localities like Quảng Trị or Huế.Extreme weather events no longer just come, destroy and go like the 1999 flood in central provinces. It has become a part of our lives, an issue we create and have to fight every day.People must stop thinking of escaping from the bitter reality and instead start being responsible for our environment and find solutions to increase community resilience to climate change. — VNS'",4
1691,Quảng Ngãi's fish ports quiet now,"QUẢNG NGÃI — The fish ports in the central province of Quảng Ngãi are quieter these days, as a lack of fish to catch offshore has led fishermen to sell their boats, while wholesalers are driving down the price for those who are sticking with the trade.Trần Minh, 54, of Bình Thuận Commune, Bình Sơn District said his family had fished for a living for three generations, before he had to sell his boat.“I had to sell the vessel. It's sad but true, the nearshore zone seems to have run out of fish,” he said.He couldn't look after his family with the money he earned by catching fish anymore, he said.Võ Minh Thư, of Tịnh Khê Commune, Sơn Tịnh District, has fished for 50 years. When he was young, he went far offshore to fish, but in recent years, as he has passed 70 years old, he only works in the nearshore zone.“This year, there are very few fish to catch. It is because people have overfished. They even catch baby fish,” he said.This had led to the depletion of aquatic resources, he added.Trần Văn Dân, 50, of Bình Thạnh Commune, Bình Sơn District, a fishing vessel owner, said his vessel only caught about 10 tonnes of squid after it went sailing for a month and a half near the Trường Sa (Spratly) Islands.Normally they could watch about 40-50 tonnes,\xa0Thanh Niên\xa0(Young People) online newspaper reported.When at the sea, the crew heard seafood wholesalers had put down the price, so they stopped catching and returned to the mainland, he said.Đặng Tằm, of Bình Châu Commune, another vessel owner, said it was hard to earn a living by catching fish offshore. This meant it was hard for fishing vessel owners to hire labourers to go on fishing expeditions.He's even had to pay workers in advance to get enough crew for his ship.Reel problemStatistics of the Directorate of Fisheries under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development reveal that fishermen exploit more 2.5 million tonnes of fish each year, while the recommended number is about 1.7 million tonnes.Overfishing and poor fishing techniques\xa0were blamed for the depletion of aquatic resources. This was the consequence of loose management of fisheries by the authorities, according to experts.In Quảng Ngãi alone, 5,664 fishing vessels currently operate\xa0with about 38,000 labourers.Dương Văn Rin, head of a local aquatic processing company, said he had asked agencies to limit the number of newly-built ships in the province.Other local fishermen also suggested agencies set up marine protected areas and ban fishing in some areas.Tạ Văn Minh, vice chairman of the People’s Committee of Bình Thuận Commune, said the commune now had about 200 fishing vessels, dozens of fishing vessels lower compared to 2016.In the long-term, Minh advised the local administration to help local fishermen change careers.Phùng Đình Toàn, deputy head of the provincial Fisheries Division, said the province had tightened management of fishing vessels’ activities.The province was compiling regulations to limit newly built fishing vessels, he said.It had also made efforts to raise awareness of local people of the importance of sustainable exploitation. Spontaneous exploitation would be improved. Then, local fishermen would gradually shift to sustainable exploitation, he said. — VNS",1

Some were even found on restricted roads and areas.One of the drivers parking in a restricted road said it is very difficult to find parking space for trucks in the area and he drives his truck away if traffic police officers or other officials arrive.Bùi Văn Quân, chairman of the HCM City Freight Forwarders Association, said hundreds of forwarders, especially cargo transport companies in District 9, face difficulties since there is no parking space for their trucks. Many of them have to park on roads or lease space in private lots.“Transport firms pay large amounts of money for parking and as fines for violations,” he was quoted as saying by Tuổi Trẻ\xa0(Youth) newspaper.A number of them have had to suspend their operations due to losses, he added.The association has urged city authorities to use vacant plots of land in districts 9 and 2 as temporary parking lots, pointing out that thousands of trucks would otherwise have no parking space in the two.Temporary parking lotsĐỗ Ngọc Hải, head of city Department of Transport’s road transport management division, said the lack of parking space has affected both passenger and cargo transport.It also has other adverse impacts, such as an increase in the number of accidents, he said.He blamed the situation on the lack of land for construction of parking lots and terminals.The association’s proposal that the city should lease land in districts 2 and 9 and build temporary parking lots was rejected by the department since the proposed areas do not meet the conditions required for building parking lots, he explained.The department would consider other areas in districts 2, 9 and Nhà Bè and complete construction works expeditiously, he added. — VNS'",1

In mid-2007, PTSC M&C won the Black Lion of Cửu Long Joint Operating Company.This started a golden age.When the customer had a project requiring complicated techniques and high economic value they turned to PTSC M&C.Blackbird Oil Field of Premier Oil, White Rhinoceros Oil Field of Hoàng Long Joint Operating Company, and especially the East Sea 01 of Biển Đông Joint Operating Company were came calling, and PTSC M&C were happy to answer, and deliver a quality service.The East Sea 01 project worth more than half billion dollars included the construction of the oil platform of Hải Thạch Technology Centre and its jacket – the steel frame supporting the deck and topside of the platform.Also the Mộc Tinh 1 oil platform and its jacket, a leading bridge with about 70km of pipelines and 20km of underground cable with the total volume of over 60,000 tons.PTSC M&C had to mobilise more than 3,000 engineers and skilled staff to work around-the-clock to meet the demands of the project.The completion improved PTSC M&C’s market position, making it one of the most prestigious and high quality petroleum engineering service providers in Việt Nam and in the region.In mid-2013, PTSC M&C officially signed a contract with AFCONS Infrastructure Limited to get the package of procurement of main materials and construction and pre-trial test of the Heera Technology Rig, which was part of the Heera Redevelopment Project in Mumbai, India.It has become a milestone for Việt Nam's marine mechanical engineering industry as the project helped exporting rig in the world.A series of projects for foreign investors followed, such as MLS Project of Total E&P Borneo BV in Brunei, Ghana OCTP Offshore of FPSO in Ghana, Greater Enfield Project for Technip and Daman Project for ONGC in India.These projects helped secure the jobs for employees of PTSC M&C in the period of 2014-2017 – an extremely difficult time for domestic and foreign service companies.In 2018, PTSC M&C continued to affirm its leading capability in the field of marine engineering in Việt Nam when it won an engineering, procurement, construction and installation contract worth US$330 million for the development of Gallaf (Al Shaheen) project invested by Qatar’s North Oil Company.Under this contract, PTSC M&C designed, procured, manufactured, conducted pre-test, and completed offshore construction of the project.The detailed design work was mostly implemented by PTSC M&C’s engineers.PTSC leaders said the implementation of detailed design has helped control errors and ensure the progress of projects. The construction of a jacket shortened from 10-11 months to five months, and the construction of the topsides shortened from 16-18 months to 9-10 months.It helped saving the cost as there was no need to mobilise dozens of project managers, experts and engineers to supervise and perform design and procurement work abroad. The unexpected cost arising during the implementation of the project was limited. This helped PTSC M&C to keep its competitive bidding prices.PTSC M&C has gained a lot of faith of both domestic and foreign investors in the field of oil rig infrastructures because of its capacity and reputation, which has been built with a lot of effort of engineers and skilled workers of the company. — VNS",2

1721,'Whitmore’s disease cases on the rise in rainy season',"'HÀ NỘI — The latest case of Whitmore’s disease, also known as melioidosis, was reported at Hà Nội’s Đức Giang General Hospital on Monday.\nAfter 10 days of illness, the patient was treated at hospital for high fever and headaches and he tested positive for melioidosis.\nCases of the rare disease have risen since the start of this year’s rainy season with at least 20 cases reported.\nLast week, Nghệ An Province Maternity and Pediatric Hospital admitted three patients in critical conditions with abscesses and inflammations of their parotid glands.\nThey were first treated at home because the symptoms are similar to mumps, but were transferred to hospital when their conditioned worsened.\nOn September 12, another case of Whitmore’s disease was reported in the central province of Hà Tĩnh.\nThe patient got infected after being exposed to contaminated soil.\nWhitmore’s disease is caused by a bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei which exists in contaminated water and soil.\nThe most common transmission to humans and animals is via direct contact with the infection, especially through skin abrasions or inhalations of dust particles containing bacteria.\nAccording to Nguyễn Văn Kính, director of the Central Hospital of Tropical Diseases, Whitmore’s disease was first reported in Việt Nam in the 1950s and only appeared in some provinces.\nThe incubation period from the exposure to the bacteria to the appearance of first symptom takes two to 21 days. However, once the disease activates, it progresses rapidly; an infected patient might be killed in only 48 hours after being hospitalised.\n“Some researches show that eating food containing Burkholderia pseudomallei can lead to the infection,” Kính told Kinh tế & Đô thị (Economic and Urban Affairs) newspapers.\n“However, there is no evidence of disease transmission among humans and from animals to humans through the air.”\nThe disease is common among people having direct contacts with soil and open wounds which allow bacteria penetration, causing abscess, inflammation and even sepsis or lung damage.\nPatients with diabetes or chronic lung, heart, or kidney-related diseases are more vulnerable to the bacteria. They may suffer multiple organ failure leading to death if infected.\nCommon symptoms include fever, weight loss, chest pains, headaches, seizures, and muscle pain.\n“Whitmore’s disease is called ‘an impostor’ as it does not have any clear clinical manifestation and is usually misdiagnosed to pneumonia, sepsis or muscle abscess,” Kính added.\nDoctors have to test blood, pus, sputum, urine or cerebrospinal fluid to establish an accurate diagnosis.\nDương Thanh Bình, director of Việt Nam – Cuba Friendship Hospital in Quảng Bình Province, said they had not received any patient with Whitmore’s disease after a rumour of three infected people was spread on Facebook.\nThe provincial police also said they would investigate the origin of the fake news.\nIt is difficult to treat the disease as doctors have to prescribe high-dose antibiotics for patients in at least two weeks then maintain the use in three to six following months.\nWithout the right dose, regime and monitoring, a patient can relapse and die.\nThe treatment and monitoring process takes time and can be expensive.\nKính said many people had given up, leading to failures in treatment and raising the fatality rate to about 40 per cent.\nAt present, there is no vaccine for the disease.\nTherefore, it is essential for people to wear masks in polluted areas, wear boots and protective clothing when in direct contact with soil or mud. — VNS'",1

1922,'Local automobile\xa0\xa0manufacturers ask for\xa0more support',"'HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam\'s automobile industry is small compared to regional markets and local suppliers are asking for more support from the Government.A report from the MoIT says though the rate of domestically manufactured and assembled vehicles have grown, only a few suppliers are involved in the local supply chain. Compared to Thailand, the number of Vietnamese suppliers in the automotive industry is low.The report says Thailand has nearly 700 Tier 1 suppliers, which supply parts or systems directly to original equipment manufacturers, while Viet Nam has less than 100. Thailand has about 1,700 Tier 2&3 suppliers, which provide raw, or close-to-raw, materials like metals and plastics for the Tier 1 category, while Viet Nam has less than 150. Locally manufactured 9-seater cars in Việt Nam only meet 7-10 per cent of the demand.Phạm Tuấn Anh, deputy director of the department of industry, told Vietnam News Agency at a seminar on Thursday that market capacity was small because the local automobile industry did not have the conditions to grow.Anh specified: “Việt Nam does not offer enough support for the automobile industry.”Anh also said policies that supported the automotive industry still conflicted and were unstable.Đỗ Thu Hoàng, deputy general director of Toyota Việt Nam, also told Vietnam News Agency that following ASEAN integration in 2018, the import tax on complete cars was cut to zero per cent within the bloc, and that had created more difficulties for the industry.Hoàng said the biggest challenge was the small size and output of the market. For example, the number of Toyota’s Vios model cars produced in Viet Nam was only one-eighth of Thailand\'s, which made production costs higher than other countries in the region.Due to limited production, most manufacturers had to import parts, which resulted in very high costs for packaging, shipping and import duties.Hoàng continued: “Currently, the cost of manufacturing in Việt Nam is 10-20 per cent higher than in Thailand and Indonesia.”“Before 2018, when there were high taxes for imported cars, locally produced cars were still able to compete. Now the rate has been cut to zero per cent, it is very difficult for car manufacturers in Việt Nam,” she said.Compared with Thailand and Indonesia, Việt Nam\'s automobile output is far behind. Thailand produces about 2 million cars and Indonesia 1.3 million cars each year, while Việt Nam can only produce about 300,000.A representative of the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers Association (VAMA) told the seminar that local car manufacturers planned to make 500,000 cars next year.More supporting policiesTo cope with these difficulties, local manufacturers at the seminar asked for more support policies from the State.Phạm Văn Tài, general director of Thaco Trường Hải, said: “Việt Nam needs certain technical barriers to help local car makers. For example, in order to enjoy the zero per cent import tax rate, imported cars must have a localisation rate of 40 per cent.""He also said the Government should lower the special consumption tax on the value of domestic production in order to reduce the price of locally manufactured cars.Another representative from the MoIT’s industry department suggested the Government could offer incentives for consumers who purchase locally-made products to increase demand. The same thing had been done in Thailand and Malaysia, he said.At the seminar, some manufacturers asked the Ministry of Finance to remove the special consumption tax for locally made parts to help them reduce prices to compete with foreign manufacturers. — VNS'",2

Recently, I rarely have meals with my family. I return home when my parents are already asleep,"" Nguyên said.There are many hospitals in Đống Đa District. Information on cases of dengue fever at hospitals is sent to the district\'s medical centre. The centre will then confirm the address of each case and health workers are assigned to spray chemicals to kill mosquitoes in a 100m radius around the patient\'s house.Phan Quỳnh Liên, a resident in Đống Đa District, one of the hotspots for the disease, said in peak season, every household in her neighbourhood received a leaflet from the local ward\'s People’s Committee on preventive measures such as killing mosquito larvae and minimising standing water, as well as cleaning both inside and outside the house.The sheet also advises residents to go to a medical centre or hospital immediately if you have a fever.“The warning is part of a nationwide war against dengue fever. It is just a leaflet to encourage residents to help fight the disease,” Liên said.But not everyone is aware of this.Nguyễn Thành Công, Nguyên\'s\xa0colleague, said they often told local households before they were going to visit and spray chemicals. Some households asked the health workers to spray chemicals at 6am because they did not want to be late for work, or in some cases they refused to allow the workers in.Some residents got frustrated with advice to turn water containers upside down when not in use.In peak season, the medical workers had to start work at 5am and each worker had to spray about 40 houses in the morning, said Lương Xuân Thủy, a health worker.“Wearing a 20kg tank, climbing all over high buildings or houses takes a lot of energy. The work goes well if we receive help from local residents. If not we have to come back another day,"" Thủy said.This job also means constant exposure to chemicals.Thủy\'s family advised him to find another job. But to earn a living and help the community eliminate the disease, he continues to work.“Every job has its hardships. If everyone refuses to do this job, who will?” he said.They still have to strengthen efforts in killing mosquitoes and larvae, and continue to teach residents how to prevent dengue fever, said Nguyễn Đức Tuấn, director of Đống Đa Health Centre.The joint efforts by people as well as responsibility for disease prevention are key factors to curb dengue fever, according to Tuấn.""I hope the epidemic will soon be eliminated so people are less worried and we will be less busy,” said Nguyên. — VNSA medical worker instructs local residents on how to prevent dengue mosquitoes from proliferating. — VNA/VNS Photo Dương Ngọc'",1

4492,"'Don’t concrete Sơn Trà, says tourism association'","'HÀ NỘI — Đà Nẵng City Tourism Association insisted at a talk on Sơn Trà Peninsula tourism development on Tuesday morning that no more hotels or buildings should be built on the peninsula to preserve its environment and biodiversity.Speaking at the talk held in Hà Nội by Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and Đà Nẵng People’s Committee, head of the association Huỳnh Tấn Vinh said: “Don’t concrete, don’t destroy Sơn Trà.”He said that his opinion on tourism development on Sơn Trà Peninsula remained unchanged from the petitions that the association submitted to Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc earlier asking to adjust the Sơn Trà National Tourism Site plan.Under the Government plan outlined in May 2013 and approved in November 2016, Sơn Trà Mountain on the Sơn Trà Peninsula is set to become a national tourism site and luxury eco-tour resort complex by 2030, able to accommodate 300,000 tourists with 1,600 luxury hotel rooms.Before May 2013, Đà Nẵng City People’s Committee had approved 18 tourism projects on the peninsula, including 11 housing projects expected to provide 5,000 new rooms. Since then, it has not approved any project on the peninsula, which has the Sơn Trà Nature Reserve, well-known for its rich biodiversity, with 287 animal species and 985 plant species.The city’s Tourism Association strongly opposed the master plan after it was publicised on February, 15 this year.Vinh said at that time he said that they would lose Sơn Trà due to hotels.“I was reassured that such an outlook would not happen but two weeks later, I saw fast deforestation and construction,” he said.“It’s time to save Sơn Trà,” he said, suggesting that planning be made in line with conservation and sustainable development for the peninsula.Sơn Trà and the neighbouring sea stretching to Nam Hải Vân should form a natural reserve like the model of Cù Lao Chàm in Hội An, he said.“We won’t choose tourism projects with massive hotels. We choose to keep Sơn Trà unchanged, “a green lung@for the next generation.“If Sơn Trà is turned into resort area, its natural landscape will be ruined and coral could be threatened,” he said.Head of Việt Nam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) Nguyễn Văn Tuấn said the VNAT also wanted sustainable tourism strategies like Vinh.However, vice chairman of Đà Nẵng City People’s Committee Nguyễn Ngọc Tuấn said that the city could face a shortage of accommodation for tourists if no more hotels were built.“The city expects to host 15 million visitors yearly by 2030, so it needs nearly 58,000 rooms. Some completed projects on the Sơn Trà Peninsula added 253 rooms and some other projects are ongoing,” he said, adding that it was unreasonable to keep the same number of rooms.Deputy Minister of Tourism Huỳnh Vĩnh Ái said that the planning for a national tourism site on Sơn Trà Peninsula was made after consulting experts and had Government approval.Responding to the demand that no more hotels be built there, Ái said the issue was complicated and need careful consideration.“Should incomplete construction work on the peninsula be removed or continued? Should approved projects be stopped? If yes, how should we deal with?,” Ái raised major questions for debate at the talk which was organised soon after Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam announced the temporary halt of the tourism plan on Sunday.During the three-month halt, agencies and Đà Nẵng People’s Committee are asked to collect opinions to report to the Prime Minister. — VNS'",4
